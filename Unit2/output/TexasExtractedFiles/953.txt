Photograph: Ron T Ennis/APRescuers sifting through the rubble of the Texas farming town that was shattered by a massive fertiliser plant explosion on Wednesday night, said on Friday that they had recovered 14 bodies, some of them emergency personnel who had been responding to an earlier fire.Sergeant Jason Reyes of the Texas Department of Public Safety, which is co-ordinating what he called a "search and recovery" effort rather than the previous day's "rescue", also confirmed that the number of reported injuries had risen from about 170 to "approximately 200". The official number of fatalities, however, appeared to contradict a claim from the mayor of West, Tommy Muska, who told reporters on Thursday that "around 35 people" were dead."I cannot speak on behalf of the mayor," Reyes said at a press conference early on Friday. "I have not talked to him today. We have left messages for him."The bodies, mostly of firefighters who were tackling a blaze at the West Fertilizer Company when a store of ammonia-based chemicals ignited, were taken to the Dallas forensic laboratory for identification, according to Reyes."It is with a heavy heart that I can confirm 12 individuals have been recovered from the fertilizer plant explosion. We know these bodies were in the area of the explosion," he said. "We continue with the recovery effort. We are still treating this as a crime scene, we will go in there and make sure we conduct a thorough investigation." He later updated the number of deaths to 14.He added that 50 homes had been destroyed by the blast, as well as three fire engines and one ambulance. About 150 buildings have been cleared and search teams have another 25 homes to visit once the structures have been made safe to enter.Although officials are not yet confirming identities, some of those known to have died were volunteer members of the West fire department, a 29-strong force whose members rushed to the plant after receiving a 911 call reporting a fire at about 7.30pm on Wednesday, about 25 minutes before the explosion. Local media named Jerry Chapman, 26, as one of the victims. In Dallas, mayor Mike Rawlings paid tribute to Kenny Harris, a 52-year-old father of three and a captain in the city's fire department, who was not on duty in West but who was killed after he went to assist the volunteers.
