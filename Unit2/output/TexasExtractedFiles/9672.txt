I'm a little confused sorry. I'm on a mac running 10.6 using google chrome. I went to gs.apple.com and it takes me to a placeholder page. doesn't mention anything about cydia. am I good to go? should I then just back up, update thru itunes, then do the jailbreak? we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
