A spokesman for Adair said he had been at the West Church of Christ, where he is an elder, on Wednesday night when he learned of the fire and drove to the scene to urge people to move to safety.Adair lives about five miles (8 km) from West in a neat, white two-story house set back from the road down a gravel driveway marked by a green John Deere mailbox. The house is surrounded by farm buildings and equipment, and has a basketball hoop.Most of the dozen residents interviewed by Reuters, including farmers, church members and local business owners who know Donald Adair, did not fault him for operating the plant so close to a residential area or for storing large quantities of the hazardous materials ammonium nitrate and anhydrous ammonia.The privately held fertilizer plant has been in operation since 1962, long before the homes and nearby schools were built, and the fertilizer was needed by farmers, they said.Irwin said the Adair family is generous in donating to community events, such as church bazaars and sports tournaments.Donald Adair is a lifelong farmer who also spent about 30 years working at General Tire and Rubber Company in Waco, said Donald Cernosek, who worked with Adair as mill operators until the plant closed in the late 1980s.West Fertilizer Co was in financial distress when Adair bought it nine years ago and farmers worried about losing a local resource for the supplies needed to grow corn, wheat and milo, several people said. Plant employees mixed fertilizers for farmers based on tests of their soil samples.The fertilizer facility had an appraised market value of $908,400 when he bought it in 2004, according to McLennan County property tax records. By last year, its appraised value had fallen to $723,771, although it was not clear why.The stable of Adair family businesses also includes Adair Grain, which is the parent company of West Fertilizer, and Adair Farms. Adair owns some 5,000 acres (2,023 hectares) of cropland and grassland in the area, Keeney said, which according to local tax records would be worth several million dollars at market prices.The Adair family have been among the biggest recipients in the area of farm subsidy payments from the federal government. Donald Adair received $874,522 during the period 1995 to 2011 and his son Gary received more than $1.2 million in subsidies during the period, according to a database of U.S. government data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.Local residents also said they knew that handling fertilizer was a potentially dangerous business.West Fertilizer disclosed to a Texas state agency that, as of the end of 2012, the company was storing 270 tons of ammonium nitrate, mixed with other compounds to produce a dry fertilizer. The same type of solid fertilizer was mixed with fuel and used by Timothy McVeigh to raze the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, killing 168 people.A search of federal and state legal records did not turn up any lawsuits against Adair personally or any of his companies.But the lack of lawsuits may soon change. A Dallas law firm Baron & Budd, which was involved in BP oil spill litigation, has set up a toll free number for victims of the West explosion to contact them about possible legal challenges.Some residents still had unanswered questions in the difficult, soul-searching days after the blast, among them Emily Polansky, who lives about half a mile (800 metres) from the plant and had her windows smashed when it blew. Walking with the aid of a cane, she puzzled over how the fire took hold after workers had left the plant and wondered about supervision.But resident Chuck Smith, who helped neighbours leave their homes amid the dark smoke and acrid fumes after the blast, was not prepared to point a finger at the Adairs.(Additional reporting by Chris Francescani; Editing by Greg McCune and Vicki Allen)euronews provides breaking news articles from Reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.Copyright 2013 Reuters.5France set to legalise gay marriage in parliament vote1Five dead in Seattle shootout5Rape and torture of girl sparks furious New Delhi protests1Two deadly bomb blasts hit Boston marathon in terrorist attackBe a No Comment TV Reporter!
