Hamill: College student stunned by death of lively former boss, Krystle Campbell, in Boston bombings - NY Daily News    America    New York      News     More of News :   U.S     World     Desi     2013 NYC Elections     Crime     The Week     News Pics     Blogs       Politics   Sports     Showbiz     Opinion     Living     Photos     Video    Autos    	Last Monday, Krystle Campbell was murdered in the terrorist bombings in Boston.	Convey says he liked and admired Campbell from that May afternoon last year when she hired him on the spot as a cook, cashier and bottle washer at the popular seafood restaurants on Georges and Spectacle islands in Boston Harbor.	Convey says that after work he would often take the 40-minute ferry ride home with Krystle to the Long Wharf of Boston, and remembers that she liked a cold Harpoon IPA summer ale, the Red Sox, the Celtics, the Patriots and music by OAR.	He says Krystle stormed ashore from the ferry and, even though she was fuming, she put a smile on her pretty face and worked the busy register.	Not as tough, unfortunately, as the killer nails packed in the pressure-cooker bomb planted at the marathon finish line by a sociopathic coward who had as much contempt for his fellow human beings as Krystle Campbell had human compassion.	And he laughs, which is how, Convey says, Krystle Campbell would want everyone to remember Krystle Campbell.
