Abbott has spent the last 4 years setting up his campaign machine for governor.  And it is a well funded, managed and tested political machine.  Wendy Davis is a Johnny come lately who has only managed to raise a paltry $1 million.  She has to, at the very minimum, raise twice as much money as Abbott to have a realistic chance of overcoming the red state advantage Abbott currently enjoys.  That is the political reality Wendy Davis faces.The real fight is when the motion to suspend the rules takes place to get past the "blocker bill".  With a blocker bill at the top of the regular order of business, at least two-thirds of the senators present must vote to begin debating a measure before it can come to the floor.  Bills that do not enjoy substantial support cannot make it past the blocker bill.  So since the real fight takes place on suspension of the rules and once that is done a bills passage is almost guaranteed. I think he could have gotten a large percentage of the vote if it wasn't for the tea party lunatics coming out in droves.You're obviously out of you depth because you've contributed a grand total of zero facts.  Run along kid. Like I said before, the D's in Texas have not won a statewide seat since 1994.  That's beyond pathetic. Yeah, maybe a little more than luck, but not by much.  Winning by 2.2 points proves my point.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
