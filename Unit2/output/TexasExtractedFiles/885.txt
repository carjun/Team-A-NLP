An avid hunter, Busch joined the NRA in 1975, but after watching its political dealings in the ongoing debate over new gun regulations following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the former CEO said he had seen enough.	"The NRA I see today has undermined the values upon which it was established," Busch wrote. "Your current strategic focus clearly places priority on the needs of gun and ammunition manufacturers while disregarding the opinions of your 4 million individual members."	In a statement to the Huffington Post, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said, "We disagree with his characterization, but we wish him all the best."	No stranger to the politics of the boardroom, Busch zeroed in on the reason why the NRA has acted to thwart any and all legislative attempts to enact new gun laws.
