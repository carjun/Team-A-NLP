Dust off that ancient Dell & CRT combo (or not, dust is fine) and snap some pics.Use some common sense in your post. These posts are intended to be satirical. That means something a bit over the top or ridiculous that would constitute the antithesis of what someone would consider cool at /r/battlestations. Don't post your above average station here that someone from /r/battlestations told you wasn't good enough just because it doesn't glow like a Honda from Fast and the Furious. /r/battlestations rejects a lot of people for the smallest of things.Above average or greater hardware is not shitty, regardless of it's surroundings. In other words, having a shitty desk or garbage around/under/over your nice hardware does not make it shitty.If all else fails, stop and look at other submissions and compare yours to it. Don't just head straight over and post it when you're referred by /r/battlestations.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
