The P210 is an excellent pistol, my only problem is that mine is chambered in 7,65 Para and getting ammo for it outside the range is hard and expensive.The only problem is that some ammo is incredibly expensive, for example I can only find non-corrosive ammo for my Mosin and it costs 30 dollars for 20 rounds. But now the safe is practically full and I've decided to stop buying new stuff for a while.My first 3 guns were the Ruger 10/22, the Glock 19 and the Norinco, I'm unhappy with the Norinco since I can't find any mags for it, and I think I just bought it because I was still a newbie and didn't have much knowledge of what was important when buying a firearm.After a short pause I bought a K31 for accuracy shooting at the local state endorsed gun club (Feldschiessen) and I've had a blast with this rifle, the diopter sights make it even more fun to shoot with.I then bought the P210 and the CZ 75 (which is my favorite pistol so far), and after searching for a while I finally found a Mosin Nagant from 1943 (which was my dream rifle since I was a kid).Now I finally bought my first shotgun, I decided to get a Mossberg 590A1 and so far it's incredibly fun to shoot. I might get some addons for it later this year.I never understood why we did it, only the kids in the family had to do it and it would stop once you were too old to get presents.I had my gunsmith put these on my K31, I only paid for the sights, the rifle was free since he sold me all for the price of the sights only.Nope. There are very informative and helpful boards that are way superior to the subreddits about the same stuff on Reddit.You guys are really lucky with your prices, just thinking that I paid 1k for a Glock 19 in Switzerland makes me cringe.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
