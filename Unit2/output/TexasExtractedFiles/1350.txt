I request a meeting with the hiring manager BEFORE I agree to do any tech interview.Does the manager know anything at all...anything...about software development?  How full of shit is this person? Really full of shit?  Then no tech interviews.  We've both wasted 30 minutes instead of only me and some developers wasting 8 hours combined.Internships are always relevant.  Extracurriculars are not unless you organized something and it was related to the job you're applying to.  Example: 'organized and lead 5 ACM events with attendance of 20+' but not 'Organized and lead team in amateur hockey league.'  The exception is if the hiring manager plays hockey and you want to work for someone who cares more about shared personal interests than technical interests and abilities.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
