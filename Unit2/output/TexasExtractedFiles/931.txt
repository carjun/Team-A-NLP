When you click on an image the system will begin to load the most current weather data. When the radar loads you will be able to use the check boxes at the top of the page to turn the radar features on and off.Radar essentially detects the location and the intensity of precipitation. The intensity is measured in units called dBZ.Notice the smooth look of the precipitation patterns (i.e., the storms) on the radar display. This is a result of high definition data processing which eliminates the blocky appearance typical of less sophisticated radar displays.This button changes the radar imagery to detect winter precipitation like rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow. The legend on the left side also changes to indicate the winter precipitation type.This highly advanced feature allows you to track winter storms and monitor the type of precipitation falling in a particular area.This will overlay a storm track on every significant storm. The line extending from the storm points in the direction of motion, and the end of the line gives you an idea of where the storm will be in one hour.This simple button activates the results of an extremely complex program that analyzes every storm in three dimensions and calculates the maximum size of hail stones within each storm.Once the hail reaches one inch or more in diameter (about the size of a quarter), a relatively large white ball icon is plotted with the size of the hail stone (in inches) inscribed within the ball.Since our WARN Interactive Radar ingests true Doppler Radar wind data, it is possible to detect areas of rotation within a thunderstorm. These rotation centers are identified by a gray swirl icon.However, it must be emphasized at this time that just because a thunderstorm has developed rotation, it does not necessarily mean that this rotation is a tornado, nor does it mean that it will continue to develop and eventually produce a tornado.Areas of particularly strong rotation are identified by either a purple swirl icon or a purple arrowhead as indicated by the legend.The purple arrowhead means that intense rotation was detected in the lowest levels of the storm, and therefore has a higher probability that it is actually extending down to the ground.It should be pointed out that due to the curvature of the earth, it is not possible for any radar, no matter how powerful, to see what is going on directly at ground level.The severe weather warnings displayed on WARN Interactive Radar are not simply an outline of the county being warned. The outlines produced by our WARN Interactive Radar specifically point out which part of the county (or counties) will be affected by the storm.To zoom in and out on the radar place your cursor on the map image and click your left mouse button. The left button zooms in. Holding down your ALT or CTRL button (CMD button for Mac) while clicking with your left button zooms out. You can also move the map around while zoomed in by holding down your left button and dragging.WARN Interactive requires Flash Player.
