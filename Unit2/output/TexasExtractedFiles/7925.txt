Note: I play almost exclusively hardcore, so if any of these classes catches your eye, you may have to modify them slightly for core game modes.First, I have my basic assault class.  This is my well rounded class, it's good for pretty much any play style in any game mode.  I switch the sight out a lot, usually rotating between Target Finder, MMS, and Hybrid Sight (whichever one I fancy at the time, really). Next, there's my run'n'gun class.  This is the class I use when I want to go crazy.  Really good for hit and run play, fast movement and stealth.  You can easily have a crazy high K/D with this class.Finally, there's my machine gunner class.  I'll admit, I'm a massive bitch with this class.  I sit behind my claymore and a trophy system and just pick people off.  Adding the dual-band/variable zoom combo makes it almost an automatic sniper.  Great for holding down a position, especially if you have someone to watch your back.Prediction:  The guys at /r/LonghornNation will get buttmad that I said they suck.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
