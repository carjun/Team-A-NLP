The manager slipped on sunglasses to hide the tears, boarded a train for Baltimore and proceeded to manage the first three games of the American League division series without allowing those around him to know the personal pain he was experiencing.	Jerry Girardi served his country in the Air Force during the Korean War. He went on to work in construction sales, also working as a bartender and a bricklayer to help support his wife, Angela, and their five children.	Girardi would visit his father a couple times each season, usually taking advantage of an off-day surrounding a Yankees series in Chicago or the Midwest. His last visit came in August, on an off-day between series in Chicago and Cleveland.
