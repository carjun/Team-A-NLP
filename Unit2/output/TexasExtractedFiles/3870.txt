I think its just because its such an unpopular car. No one wants a corolla that old unless its RWD. Which is understandable. Its crazy how broad the price range for 240s are around here. Cheapest ive seen was a fully running one for $600 (massive rust holes through chassis and floor pans) to 18K RB swapped monsters. Well that's what I was thinking in theory. Truth be told though ive never worked on a car before, just figured if I can tear down a laptop or desktop computer into individual pieces and put it back together in working order in less than an hour then I can figure out how to replace a head gasket. Not looking for something in terribly good shape. Just something to have fun with. A fire water bomber. Those guys who fly planes full of water to drop on forest fires sounds like the coolest job ever. I've always dreamed of being a pilot but at 16 my eyes said "NO". But if I ever happen to get into the air I want to be a water bomber. Its not so mundane like being an airline pilot, and you dont have to kill people like a military pilot, but still get to bomb the shit out of stuff. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
