['What experience, if any, do you have with moderating a subreddit?  Feel free to include your stattit page.', "I'm not too bad with CSS. Did the sidebar for /r/funny anyway. Don't have too much experience with automoderator, but its nothing that can't be learned.", "As for the final section, I already moderate a few defaults and I'm sure quite a few of you know me from other places we moderate. I quite enjoy moderating and keeping the modqueues clean everywhere I moderate. I'm good with keeping an eye out for spam, and most of all, I absolutely love askreddit. It's probably my favorite subreddit. I spend a lot of time here already and I'd love to help maintain the quality of this place.", 'we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but']
