['So there have been a lot of "where did my car go" etc posts recently and i\'ve done a fair bit of research so wanted to share.', 'Storing a car: a car is not counted as stored unless it has been in your 4-car garage (having re-read Rockstar\'s post i believe these may be the "Social Club Garages" they refer to). Safehouses do not count. I will refer to a car that has been in the 4-car garage most recently as "stored".

Also, higher level programming itself isn't too math based, it's been abstracted so heavily that most of the mathematics is happening in the background and you only have to string together simple logical statements.
