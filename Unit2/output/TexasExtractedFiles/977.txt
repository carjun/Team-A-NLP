They do primarily sketch comedy, not two-man standup routines, and either can take the lead.	Key & Peele extract some significant part of their comedy from language, and another winning bit in their early shows has Key in an upscale restaurant, speaking like a polite, mild-mannered, nonthreatening black man.	Not all the humor is racial. A parody of Gordon Ramsay is witheringly funny, and a sketch about a clueless stoner trying to qualify for medical marijuana is amusing.
