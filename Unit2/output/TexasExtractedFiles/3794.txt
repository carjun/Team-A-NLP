Liquor and beer stores are common.", 'Officials refused to offer any numbers for the dead on Thursday afternoon, though earlier statements had said that there were between five and 15 fatalities. More than 160 people were injured.', 'Volunteer firefighters were battling a blaze Wednesday evening that Nathan Spires, 26, said started as a brush fire. Other witnesses agreed about the cause, which is still under investigation.', 'As the firefighters worked, the fire ignited tanks of anhydrous ammonia, setting off a blast that devastated an area five blocks deep and 10 blocks wide, residents said. Structures suffered lesser damage for miles around.', 'The Advertisementsmoke plume thrown up by the blast could be seen in Arlington, 75 miles away, said Joe Kotch, 71.', 'Residents congregated along Main Street as a woman came by, passing out blue rubber wristbands that said God is Big Enough.', 'As they discussed the devastation, residents noted how lucky it was that that West Intermediate School, almost across the street from the fertilizer plant, had let out for the day.', 'Everybody who owned homes in the area, however, seemed to suffer a total loss, residents said.', '"It didn\'t matter if you were a lawyer or a doctor or a judge,\' said Wesley Gatlin, 44, a lifelong resident.', 'He and Vanessa Kotch-Williams, 40, were taking pictures of the fire when the fertilizer tanks exploded at 7:50 p.m. The blast was so strong that, 500 yards away, it cracked the windshield on their truck.', "The blast threw Kotch-Williams into a panic because her two sons were at her ex-husband's house, about 100 yards from the fertilizer plant.", 'It was two houses down from a nursing home that was being evacuated when the explosion took place. Many of the residents are thought to be among the injured.', 'The closer Gatlin and Kotch-Williams got to the house, the more like a war zone it became. The debris in the street punctured their tires.', '"We were driving on flat tires as fast as we could,\' Kotch-Willams said. "I kept saying, \' God, let my children be alive.\'\'', 'It did nothing to ease their panic when they got to the house and found nobody there.', "Gatlin, who had served nine years as a volunteer firefighter, said he doesn't remember much about wading through the knee-deep debris.
