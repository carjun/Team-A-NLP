While the chain of events that triggered the mammoth explosion at a Texas fertilizer planton Wednesday night remains unclear, a likely culprit is the highly explosive material ammonium nitrate that was stored at the facility.The facility, run by West Fertilizer Co., stored up to 540,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and 110,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, according to a report filed to state and local officials as required by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency.A less-likely scenario in the explosion is the ignition of anhydrous ammonia, which is also used as a fertilizer. It is a colorless, pungent gas that is kept in liquid form under high pressure in steel containers. But because ammonia is relatively stable and can only ignite at a temperature of 1,562 degrees Fahrenheit, such explosions are said to be rare.Latest Headlines is home to all the latest, up to the minute news headlines from The Wall Street Journal in a streaming continuous headline experience.
