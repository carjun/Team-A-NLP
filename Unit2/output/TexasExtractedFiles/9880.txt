The Paul's always win straw polls, especially when it's anything online. Rand is much more legit candidate, but I can understand being wary of that online libertarian presence if you want a meaningful poll.I really wonder what would happen if they didn't ignore the Pauls in mediums other than the Internet.I really like the kind of female leads that TJF and TN&F, coupled with the unique musical style and somewhat abstract lyrics. Edit: That Scanners song is actually very good! I'm going to be checking them out more.You just sound like an Aggie who gets joy from seeing misfortune fall upon Texas.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
