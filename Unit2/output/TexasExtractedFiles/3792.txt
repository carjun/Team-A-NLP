(Source: CNN)WEST, TX (RNN) - People in this small town can finally begin the process of returning their lives to normal.The city's top official made it clear that when residents began moving back into their homes, they would not be hindered by the threat of an environmental hazard."I want to dispel any rumors of any health, or safety hazards, or  threats at this time in the city of West. It is safe, it is safe and it  is safe," West Mayor Pro Tem Steve Vanek emphasized. During a press conference Saturday, Vanek announced the first group of residents can return to West, despite rumors the town is still unsafe. He did not say when all evacuated residents would be allowed to return.As  investigators move inward in examining debris  and damage, residents  gradually will be allowed to return to homes  along streets that  have already been examined.About half the population in the town was evacuated, including a nursing home with more than 130 residents.homes are encouraged to be out of the impact area by 7 p.m. Saturday or to remain inside of their homes without leaving throughout the  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the  state fire marshal's office are working to try to determine the cause of  the blast.A dozen investigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board were also inspecting the site Friday.A minor incident before the announcement may have fueled misgivings about returning to the area less than three full days after a fertilizer plant fire and explosion killed 14 people and injured 200 others.Officials told AP the fires were caused by tanks that were leaking gas on the site and that they were being contained.President Barack Obama issued an emergency  declaration for West, and Gov. Rick Perry declared McLennan County a disaster area.The president's declaration gives the Federal Emergency Management Agency the  authority to "identify, mobilize, and  provide at its discretion,  equipment and resources necessary to  alleviate the impacts of the  emergency.  Emergency protective measures,  including direct federal  assistance, will be provided at 75 percent  federal funding.""I've pledged  that the people of West will have the resources they need to rebuild,"  the president, speaking from the White House, said Friday.Law enforcement officials said they will continue to search through the debris for more bodies. About 60 people were unaccounted for after the  explosion, but  McLennan County Judge Scott Felton said late Friday that  most, if not  all of them, have or will be located."I would be surprised if it's more than a few people (who are missing)," Felton said.West police  Chief James Lawhorn said on Friday five of the dead were West volunteer  firefighters, and four were EMS personnel.Twelve individuals were recovered from the fertilizer plant explosion Friday morning. Two more were found Friday afternoon.  "The deceased have been taken to the Dallas Forensic Lab for proper identification," Sgt. Jason Reyes said."I  just toured the site, both from the air and from the ground, and  frankly, the observation along the area around the site is just total  devastation," Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said.A four-block radius around the fertilizer plant is almost completely leveled. Three fire trucks and one ambulance were destroyed.The  bodies were found in and around the plant area. Officials will not  confirm if the bodies recovered are firefighters, emergency workers,  plant workers or regular citizens.Search and rescue crews sifted through the still-smoldering remains for survivors throughout the day Friday."At  this point they are in the continuation mode of search and rescue,  which to me means that they are still going out and looking for  survivors of the blast from Wednesday evening," Sgt. Patrick Swanton  said.Investigators said there is nothing so far to suggest anything other than an accident, but they can't rule anything out."The  explosion happened in a highly populated neighborhood, it is a volatile  situation because it being a fertilizer company, it has the component  ammonia nitrate which is a volatile product," McLennan County Chief  Deputy Sheriff Matt Cawthon said.Republican U.S. Senators John Cornyn and  Ted Cruz and Rep. Roger Williams, R-Weatherford, were in West on Friday afternoon to offer support to residents.Cornyn said they viewed the tangled wreckage of one of the fire trucks destroyed in the explosion."In this close community, I grieve with the injured and the family and friends who have lost loved ones," Cornyn said. "After  seeing the site firsthand, I know the road to recovery will be long,  but I am encouraged by the many examples I have already seen of this  town's resilience."Abbott  said Thursday "it's way premature" to determine whether any criminal  charges could be sought in relation to the deadly explosion.According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the force of the explosion through the air was greater than a 2.1 earthquake. The fire call came in at 7:29 p.m. CDT, Swanton said. The explosion was reported at 7:53 p.m. "On  my way in I saw homes that were burning, homes that had significant  devastation, bricks were torn off," Swanton said. "It was almost  tornadic in effect."A YouTube video has surfaced of a man recording the explosion moments before it occurs. The video may be disturbing for some.As the events unfolded, people in the area went online to report what was happening. One man posted a photo on Instagram of a giant black cloud that resulted from the explosion.Kristen Crow, a reporter for the Tribune-Herald tweeted a photo of a triage on a football field. The field was later evacuated and the triage relocated. The fire was under control, but continued to smolder Friday. Another factor in the disaster was the potential for toxic fumes.The plant contains anhydrous ammonia used in the production of fertilizer, the fumes of which are dangerous to breathe.The West Fertilizer Co. said it had 54,000 pounds of the chemical, The Dallas Morning News reported.Because  of the risk of poison, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality  personnel were posted within a quarter-mile of the facility at  the request of emergency personnel for safety reasons.The  Associated Press reported West Fertilizer was investigated by the Texas  Commission on Environmental Quality in 2006 after receiving a complaint  of a small ammonia smell.The town of West has a population of  around 3,000 people. It is approximately 19 miles north of Waco, the  city where cult leader David Koresh led a 50-day standoff against the  FBI that ended in more than 80 deaths on April 19, 1993.Two years after Waco,  on April 19, 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown  Oklahoma City was destroyed with a bomb that used fertilizer, killing  168.And in what could be a tragic coincidence, Tuesday's disaster occurred the day after the anniversary of a similar fertilizer explosion in Texas City, TX, which took place on April 16, 1947.The official death toll of that explosion was 581, making it the deadliest industrial accident in American history.Officials allow some West, TX, residents to return homeMore>>A look at America's deadliest industrial accidentsA look at America's deadliest industrial accidentsUpdated: Thursday, April 18 2013 8:56 PM EDT2013-04-19 00:56:25 GMT(RNN) - The explosion at the Texas fertilizer plant happened almost 66 years to the date after the deadliest industrial accident in American history.
