I totally agree with you on the human testing front, and frankly we thought it would be a headache so we opted out of human testing. This is our first time building a pressurized vessel among many other things and we simply will not take the risk.Will definitely use the Navy diver manual in our report, it looks like just what we need. Thanks!Luckily we won't be testing the chamber ourselves, and it won't actually be used as it is only a prototype; this is more of a research and design/manufacturing project so we don't expect it to be used.I've encountered charts like these and they seem to encompass the basics of what you're explaining (that deco is a function of time and pressure). Would I be wrong in referring to those types of charts?We are initially designing for a simple compressed air environment , no added oxygen until we feel that it is safe to proceed. We're operating at around a maximum of ~15 psig so about 2.0 ATM initially. However a main concern was that since we are simply using air (no change in O2%) the recommended values for divers would not apply. Would the 1ATM/min still apply for ordinary air? Of course we will be designing for about 4min decompression but this would be for the emergency release valve.The taxi was driving a group of drunk guys (coincidentally at 4.am early Sunday) who refused to pay the fare for some reason. He told them to get out, they later caught up with him and started beating on his car trying to get him out. After he ran one of them over he drove straight to the police station to turn himself in. I'm guessing something similar happened here.ETA: There was a big protest that ensued in front of the courthouse which led to the hit-and-run driver getting bail.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
