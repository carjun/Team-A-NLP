The applicants will need to have had their fill of life on Earth, as there are no current plans for a return journey from Mars. Instead, 24 astronauts will be selected to establish a permanent Martian colony.	Judging from early response, Mars One will have more than a few people to choose from.	Still, while the initial interest is intriguing, Mars One faces no small challenge when it comes to funding the missions. While the maximum application fee will be just $25, Mars One estimates that it will cost a whopping $6 billion to send the first four astronauts to the red planet.	In order to help bridge the budget shortfall, Mars One hopes to market its application, selection, and training phases as reality television offerings.	Whether or not the company can come close to covering its costs, would-be astronauts will soon be encouraged to apply.	On its website, the company listed resiliency, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust, and creativity/resourcefulness as the six most important qualities for an applicant, but also mentioned a few others.      On Thursday, astronomers announced in two different studies that NASA's Kepler telescope had spotted three far-off planets that could potentially support life.
