This was originally recorded by Queen during the Works sessions in 1983. Rumor has it Anita used that recording as a guide vocal for this version.Lyrics:When people talk of love, I'll join in conversationI'll say I feel just fine, happy with my situationBut when I look away, people know my mind is spinningTo where I once belonged, I'll dream I'm in your heart againLet me inLet me in your heart againWhen love has let you down, I'll be your consolationWe'll talk and talk our lives, through every complicationBut when you went away, you took my heart and soul away with youBut now I stand alone and dream I'm in your heart againLet me inLet me inLet me in your heart againSo many nights we meet, in my imaginationAnd everywhere I turn, you're still my inspirationThen yesterday you came, and turned my whole world upside down againYou won't hear me complaining, I'm back inside your heart againYou let me inYou let me inYou let me in your heart againOooh, you let me in your heart again--------------------------------------"Queen" "Freddie Mercury" "Brian May" "Roger Taylor" "John Deacon" "Keep Yourself Alive" "Queen II" "Seven Seas of Rhye" Sheer Heart Attack" Killer Queen" "Now I'm Here" "A Night at the Opera" "Bohemian Rhapsody" "You're My Best Friend" "A Day At The Races" "Somebody To Love" "Tie Your Mother Down" "Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy" "News Of The World" We Will Rock You" We Are The Champions" "Spread Your Wings" "Jazz" "Bicycle Race" "Don't Stop Me Now" "Fat Bottomed Girls" "Live Killers" "Love Of My Life" "The Game" "Play The Game" "Save Me" "Another One Bites The Dust" "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" "Flash Gordon" "Flash" "The Hero" "Hot Space" "Body Language" "Under Pressure" "Las Palabras De Amor" "The Works" "The Complete Works" "Radio Ga Ga" "I Want To Break Free" "It's A Hard Life" "Hammer To Fall" "A Kind Of Magic" "One Vision" "Who Wants To Live Forever" "Friends Will Be Friends" "The Miracle" "Breakthru" "Scandal" "I Want It All" "The Invisible Man" "Innuendo" "I'm Going Slightly Mad" "These Are The Days of our Lives" "The Show Must Go On" "Headlong" "Live at Wembley" "At The Beeb" "Classic Queen" "Made In Heaven" "Heaven for Everyone" "Mother Love" "Too Much Love Will Kill You" "I Was Born To Love You" You Don't Fool Me" A Winter's Tale" "Queen + Paul Rodgers" "Greatest Hits" "Greatest Hits II" "Greatest Hits III" Queen Rocks" "Queen Rock Montreal" "Stone Cold Classics" "Queen on Fire Live at the Bowl" "Return of the Champions" "Larry Lurex" "The Cross" "The Eye" "Ibex" "Wreckage" "We Will Rock You The Musical" "WWRY"Brian May and Roger Taylor on Freddie Mercury's Last Daysby Birgir Einarsson292,538 views Brian May's Private Collection - 40 Years of Queen Book Launchby BrianMayCom112,678 views The Brian May Band - Live at the Brixton Academy (London - 15/06/93)by SheerHeartAttack218,884 views Anita Dobson (with Brian May) - The Last Time I Made Loveby David R.
