["Three members of the Texas congressional delegation, including Sen. John Cornyn, got a firsthand view of the aftermath of this week's massive fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas.", 'Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) revealed the number of missing Friday after visiting the area devastated by the explosion. Cornyn was joined by two congressmen, and the three lawmakers described the damage inflicted by the blast at West Fertilizer Co. on Wednesday night. Twelve firefighters and other first responders are believed to be among the dead. At least 160 people are believed to have been injured.', '                As the great and very red state of Texas has reformed its workers compensation system so as to permit employers like West Fertilizer to "opt out" of its workers compensation system and, at the same time "reformed" its tort system so as to make it virtually impossible for working class people to get to court against big business it\'s going to be real interesting to see who foots these bills.At the same time, watching antigovernment Rick Perry beg for federal disaster assistance is indeed something to behold and would be hilarious if it weren\'t so tragic.This is what it really means to "starve the beast/shrink government"', "                So many entrepreneurs are moving to Texas for freedom because its government doesn't hassle businesses with needless regulations. The nit picky libs in CA would never let you store dangerous chemicals unsafely and blow up a whole town. Hooray for Texas!", "Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
