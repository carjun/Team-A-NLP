I think Baylor is getting to the Oregon level but we don't have the depth your team has on offense or defense. Just as my opinion is that Tech is the least respectful school in the Big 12. The horror stories you hear from opposing fans visiting Jones Stadium makes me appreciate the Baylor vs. TT game being in Dallas. Stonum did have previous off the field issues but was never really a contributor on the field at Baylor and never got into any more trouble. Unfortunately, many inmates choose to misbehave in jail which causes them to loose the opportunity to participate in those programs. Maybe Texas Tech but I don't think we should be "expected to win". That game is always a toss up. He said "I think Baylor just won its first Heisman". He said the entire season the Heisman was a team award, not his, and that he couldn't have won it without his team. He referred to his team winning the Heisman with a big win over Texas to finish the season. He never referred to himself.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
