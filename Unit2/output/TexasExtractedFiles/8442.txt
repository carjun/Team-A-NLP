I guess I'll just post my version in a few days or something and hope no one gets mad ;.;Our image is almost exactly the same as far as placement of the dude and stuff but mine has a bit different colors and is more cartoon, less realistic. Yours is better overall anyway probably. Quick edit: Just glanced at your site, what kind of music do you make? I like music too! But I'm kind of picky so who knows if I'll like yours, but I totally support anyone creating anything rather than just becoming a pop culture reference machine.  I want to make music, but my instrumental skills are seriously lacking (I'm working on the accordion right now), so I paint sometimes, at least better than a 5 year old could. On another note, this doesn't really make me rage either. It's more of a facepalm. She can do whatever she wants, and it won't bother me, but I feel bad for her future health problems. No anger. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
