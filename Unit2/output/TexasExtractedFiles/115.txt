Linda and Burt celebrate Burt's 80th birthday last month at Portofino's restaurant in Queens.       Pugach is escorted from prison after he slit his wrist in 1959.

New York's hometown newspaper announces the guilty verdict, July 15, 1961.     Spend some time with Burt and Linda Pugach in their cramped Queens apartment, and it's hard to believe their lives were fodder for one of the juiciest stories ever splashed across the front page of a New York City tabloid.", 'Not to mention the subject of "Crazy Love," a documentary that opens Friday about their less-than-storybook romance.', 'Despite Linda being almost completely blind, they seem to be a typically normal, elderly couple who have known each other for 50 years.', "They bicker and banter constantly - though good-naturedly - and they perfectly complement each other's personalities.", 'The 80-year-old Burt, a former lawyer, is charming and talkative, with an impish, low-key sense of humor.', 'Linda, 10 years younger, is a feisty, stylish woman who enjoys needling her husband in a thick Bronx accent.', "They may be in love, but there doesn't appear to be anything crazy about it - except it was Burt who hired the thugs that blinded Linda 48 years ago.", 'And not only did Linda eventually forgive Burt, she married him after he spent 14 years in prison for the crime.', 'Having their sordid, sensationalistic history dredged up again in "Crazy Love" after so many years has left the couple with decidedly mixed emotions.', '"I could put my feelings in just a couple of words: Oh, what I caused," says Burt, who initially saw the documentary when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January. "I went into a deep depression after I saw it - very deep. But [the film] was constructive. The story has [previously] been told in such a jaded way, this is the first time it humanizes us, and I\'m not depicted as a monster."', '"I feel like a vaudeville act that doesn\'t want to end," counters Linda, sitting next to Burt and wearing the ever-present oversized sunglasses that hide her eyes.', '"There\'s just no end to this," she says. "I think it\'s truly amazing that anyone would even [still] be interested in this. It\'s such old hat."', 'But for "Crazy Love" director Dan Klores, the ongoing saga of the infamous couple is anything but old news. Like many New Yorkers who were around in 1959, "I read about them in the papers and their story resonated with me," says Klores.', 'Though he was just a boy, the Brooklyn-bred Klores was fascinated by the true-crime tale of Burton Pugach, a flashy, married Bronx lawyer who, in a fit of jealous rage, paid three thugs to attack his young, pretty girlfriend after she became engaged to another man.', 'The men threw lye in the eyes of Linda Riss, permanently impairing her vision and scarring her. Riss, then 22, had dumped Pugach after he repeatedly broke promises to divorce his wife.', '"It\'s a story about all the elements I\'m interested in - New York, love, loss, obsession, romance and sex," says Klores, who also directed the acclaimed 2005 boxing documentary "Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story" and 2003\'s "The Boys of 2nd Street Park."', '"But this is also a film about all the things we think about when we have our hearts broken, yet don\'t like to talk about," adds Klores.
