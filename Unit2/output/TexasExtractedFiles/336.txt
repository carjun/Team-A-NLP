I think this letter is completely self serving and not written for Miley. It seems to me like she took Miley's mention in Rolling Stone and wrote a passionate follow up letter that she knew would garner attention and be read. Especially since what she writes is the obvious public opinion and has been stated and restated for months now.Maybe she meant well, but an open letter like this is an open letter for Sinead and Sinead only. I hope she's enjoying her little moment in the spotlight, I imagine its akin to someone getting a ton of likes on Facebook when they post a status of "their opinion".Any funny stories from on set in You've Got Mail? That is perhaps my favorite romantic comedy!Did you have any input into the several typewriter lines and mentions in You've Got Mail? It gave the narcissistic writer boyfriend a funny edge.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
