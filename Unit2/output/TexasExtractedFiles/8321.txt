I\'ve connected it to the local repeater and that\'s probably a good 30 miles away from me. Whilst I\'ve not read Rawles\' book I suspect he\'s talking about 6 meters, which is considered the "magic band" as given the right circumstances you can communicate for a very long distance. All of those bands are actually available to the technician level. Which is the first level license you need to be a ham radio operator.
