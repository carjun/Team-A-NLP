Personally I think the concept of a norm is a bit unavoidable, and since we're not going to be breaking down marriage laws anytime soon, we might as well go ahead and provide that as an option for gay couples. But I do see the logic, having met many happy people in non-normal relationships and having met many childless (by choice) married couples who get tax breaks for doing jack shit.Many in the gay community oppose the current rhetoric on gay marriage because is focuses on normalizing gays (i.e. "We're normal just like you - we get married and have kids!"). It will end up putting a lot of social pressure on gays to get married and "be like Mitch and Cam", when that's not what all gay men and women want. They spent decades in the 20th century building their own communities with their own ways of negotiating romance, friendship, and sex, and many find it offensive that now they want to throw that behind them and just get married like everyone else. They had a lot to teach the non-gay world about their lifestyle, but instead they chose to embrace the "norm" wholeheartedly. A good book that goes over this is "The Trouble with Normal" by Michael Warner. He advocates redefining marriage such that the government can incentivize what it needs to incentivize without getting mixed up in a very culturally loaded word. For example, two friends or siblings living together for a long time would be subject to taxation appropriate for shared property, and adultery laws would be annulled to allow for adult couples to have a relationship in the way that they wish. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
