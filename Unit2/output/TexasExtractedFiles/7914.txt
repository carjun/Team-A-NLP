Riding hills? Keep it in the granny gears until you feel like you're spinning like woah (your legs are having to go waaaaay faster than is comfortable), then gear up one at a time.The front derailleur will make you go faster, but with more effort. The rear will make you go a little bit faster with less effort. Also, a note about gearing: when you're climbing, it's less stress on your components to go up in gear than down. Start off at the bottom of the hill in your easiest gears and then gear up appropriately. I ride bikes for a living, but racers and cross riders might have stronger advice than I. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
