On the other hand, quantum tunneling would be cool to look in to. Would that involve micro waves?   I am personally interested in something like this but I don't know if my professor will OK that (I have an email out to him about it right now). Beyond that, I really didn't have a specific direction that I wanted to take. I was honestly posting in hopes of having a handful of ideas thrown out there and finding one or two that I actually found interesting. I'm planning on going into a field that has to do with engineering and ultimately explosives applications and demolition, but I couldn't find anything in higher level physics that I could experiment on in a lab setting. It definitely is depression, but I''m not big on therapists. I'm at the point though that it doesn't matter what I think and I'll end up going to one. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
