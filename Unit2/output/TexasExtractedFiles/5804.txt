Even the most silly thing about the British uniforms are almost universally their hats, but at the same time the hats at least complement the rest of the uniform.However, I am almost certain that everyone in that picture knows what they look like in those uniforms and curses the higher ups for foisting it on them.Edit: also, the "say that to their face" defense is just damn stupid. I don't say anything as an internet tough guy, I don't claim I could beat them in a fight: I am mocking their uniforms because quite honestly the uniforms look terrible. Plain and simple, from an aesthetic standpoint the uniforms are obviously ill-fitting (look at the way it bunches up on everyone in that picture) , mismatched, and overall badly designed. The people in those uniforms are a completely separate issue, hell they could be the best soldiers in all of Spain for all I know, but that is not what I am commenting on.If the Navy Seal dress uniform consisted of a Barney the Dinosaur costume, I would also say that is a terrible way to dress your armed forces.Also, they may look like the armed division of the fashion police, but the fact that their hat does not match at all with the rest of their outfit means that they are impostors.The tassel on the hat just adds to the confusion, as well. Uniform designed by a colorblind version of the guy who designed the costumes for the village people, hat designed by someone's two year old.I mean, hell, you must know some profoundly mentally disabled six year olds if you think, for instance, that upon being shown a picture of a tabby cat and a black cat and asked "what sound does this make?" they  won't be able to make the very simple logical leap that both the tabby and the black cat are the same kind of animal and both go meow. That sort of inability would raise flags in a four year old, and definitely be cause for alarm in a six year old.tl;dr: I would be worried and assume a developmental delay if a six year old could not recognize that a black person was at least a person, even if they were not sure what kind of person.Also, all jumbo-jets and passenger jets are designed to literally glide for a VERY long time without any propulsion, they are extremely hard to stall out just by killing the engines.Case-in-point: the Glimli Glider, which managed to land safely not only with no engines operational, but also despite the fact that they had to carefully manage speed so that their ram air turbine which provided emergency power to the hydraulics (as the engines normally supplied power) would provide enough power to control the plane.The pilot was an experianced glider pilot, who managed it just right, and it turns out the plane (a 767) had a glide ratio of 12:1.Hilariously enough, the Glimli glider has its own entry in Wikipedias "examples of glide ratios" table, placing it between a hang glider and a paraglider.It looks like the Tannosome is a specialized chloroplast-derived tannin-production center that then moves its contents into the vacuole.So, it is not major not because it is just a toxin containing vacuole, it is not major because it is a derived specialized function of some chloroplasts that serves as a site of polymerization.Granted, it is major in the field of plant biology, but it is not a new major organelle. How many people have heard of a Glycosome or a Glyoxysome for instance? Both of these are similar in that they are a specialized vacuole in which a specific metabolic action takes place, but they are minor organelles.Also, depending on the way the wave propagates it sometimes feels like you have simply lost equilibrium (like you have suddenly become drunk), rather than a vigorous shaking, but that depends on the type of ground you are on and how far away the quake is. If it was that kind of quake, they might not have even registered anything was off until the actual noise started and the quake began in earnest. Edit: Although, I should note, that as this camera is likely connected to the floor and has mechanical means of damping vibration, you can also consider this: imagine an old hand-held video camera without any stabilization technology, and consider how even tiny movements translated into quite a bit of shaking - the same thing might be happening here.Being able to completely stop progression during the very first symptoms would be a near-cure, but but as there are actual architectural changes within the neuronal structure of the brain, reversing it is not the same as simply removing the trigger, you would have to undo changes in brain structure, which is much harder.Consider a guy with ALS who has to own a van with a wheelchair lift. He can't get a license, he can't drive it, but he owns it and his caregiver is the one who takes him places. Similar situations with some old ladies, or with some private chauffeurs.Alternatively, a guy driving a company car - he does not hold the insurance, the company does, and no driver's license is functionally attached to it.Overall point being, insurance does not go away with loss of licence or change in status, as it is a separate agreement with the insurance company while still required to drive the car. The state can require you to get insurance, but it does not dictate the exact terms of the private contract (other than to dictate a minimum value, of course). Now, the insurance company could terminate insurance, but that is their decision.But, cats are obligate carnivores, wouldn't feeding them a vegetarian diet be abuse?It really just depends on how you approach ethics, and as the character who said it (Atticus) is pretty much a literary embodiment of Kantian ethics.However, the rest of the quote does indicate that although you might be beaten at the moment the point is to not give up as you still may win in the end, even if the chance is slim. It is also meant to define courage as a willingness to face those odds even if the outcome looks grim. "Down, but not out" in other words.Water soluble vitamins simply get filtered out from your kidneys post-absorption if you have too much, and only A, D, E, & K are fat soluble (you can overdose on these, actually - polar bear liver is deadly due to high amounts of vitamin A, for instance).So your average person is not really getting all that much out of a supplement unless it is to answer a specific deficiency (folic acid in pregnancy, vitamin D for people who are indoors all the time, etc). However someone with a severely nutrient deficient diet will absorb those vitamins assuming they are in a form with decent bioavailability.Eggs are about $2.50/dozen where I am, so that equates to about 21 cents per egg, for a total cost of 43 cents per meal of Ramen+egg. You spend a tiny bit more, you get some protein and it is more filling, and at least you wont develop kwashiorkor.A stack of paper is heavier, does not feel like an Ipad, and does not look like an Ipad. The chance it is a mistake is functionally zero, so the alternative is that he was making a point.If, on the other hand, Reddit crushes the site with a mass of clicks and eats their entire bandwidth for the month, the people who liked the comic and would have liked to see more would now be unable to do so, and would be far less likely to bookmark it and come back later, and now all your regular readers can't visit the site either due to it being down.Alternatively, some people do it for fun and their adds are there only to offset the cost of the server, so having their site implode is counterproductive.Now, the Boy Scouts have always been religious since their inception, but for most of that time it was religious in that 1940s-50s-60s way that was sort of the standard of that era - with all that implies. It was in 1985 that they directy codified the ban on Atheists or Agnostics, though the ban on homosexuals was in place since 1978.The shift toward serious god-bothering in the Boy Scouts is both dependent on geographical area (guess where it is most religious - you probably won't be surprised by the answer!), and seems to be somewhat recent in regards to the history of the scouts. Most people who were in the scouts 20-30 years ago would not have seen it at that level, but a far larger proportion of the scouting groups are religiously-oriented than they were before. I would be willing to bet that it is at least in part due to a siege mentality - a larger proportion of the US is putting pressure on them, so the reactionary stance they take shifts them further into religion, and you can have severe polarization of group policies.In short: Some groups do indeed still not give a damn, as there is some autonomy there, but they are going against official policy.Best thing to do: If you go to one and everything sounds like it could be coming out of the mouth of a person who practices crystal healing? Probably don't want them.Otherwise, they have about as much actual medical training as a nurse practitioner or PA (if they were trained well, that is) and can actually be quite good at physical exams, assuming you don't end up with a quack.In the long run though, as long as they don't interfere with the treatments I know my patients actually need, I don't have a problem with them, and if it helps me wean them off the stronger pain killers, all the better.Incidentally, you are right about back surgery, and I agree that a large part of the draw of alternative medicine is actually that 1-on-1 interaction time. Part of the reason I also wish there were a lot more Nurse practitioners and physicians assistants - too few PCPs for too many people, at the moment.Conclusions. The consistency of the results provides, despite some discussed shortcomings of this study, evidence that in patients with chronic spinal pain, manipulation, if not contraindicated, results in greater short-term improvement than acupuncture or medication. However, the data do not strongly support the use of only manipulation, only acupuncture, or only nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for the treatment of chronic spinal pain.It certainly does something, they simply say it could be part of, and provide a benefit to, a general therapy regimen.Some say there are possible benefits when used with painkillers, but none state it is a pain reliever by itself. Is directly contradicted by the statement: "manipulation, if not contraindicated, results in greater short-term improvement than acupuncture or medication."That is not a statement that it is only effective "when used with painkillers," that is a statement saying that it is independently more effective than NSAIDs as an isolated therapy, at least for the time period they studied. I can't think of any other way of reading "greater short-term improvement."The fact that it would be more efficacious as a combinational therapy does not somehow negate the rest of their conclusion.From an evolutionary standpoint that is tremendous pressure to value the self (obviously), closely related members of the same species (that is, family) and the species as a whole before any other species. To not value human life in general is detrimental (note that most genocidal dictators in history have gone out of the way to paint their victims as not merely "other" but somehow "subhuman").Most other explanations of why humans deserve more moral consideration ultimately are simply to grant some higher meaning to what amounts to a powerful evolutionary drive, but in reality it is not that complex.I recognize my particular bias, and I choose to embrace it. If another person wishes to take the moral high ground and claim all life is equal, that is their wish, though I would question why they would still probably take mebendazole to treat a helminth infection. If they feel there are, in fact, gradations of moral consideration - is an ant worth more than a lion? - then the question I would pose is: If a lion is worth more than an ant, then why not a human more than a lion?If all life is equal, I literally can't live without causing an atrocity with every step I take.If only life that can feel pain should have moral consideration: I should note that even plants have a very specific response to injury that in any normal consideration would be considered a pain response. Caenorhabditis elegans has a nervous system and a noxious stimulus response - how much consideration should it get?If it is all meaningless, then the nihilistic realization that morality is a farce is a slight downer. I would rather not go down that road.In a gradated system, choice is shaped by experience and is ultimately subjective. As I am a human, I choose humans.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
