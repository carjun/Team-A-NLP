There's a lot of poorer minorities within Waco. In fact, on campus we call campus the "Baylor bubble"; they have a perimeter of lights all around the campus, as well as a pretty active police force. There's more upper-class areas south and west of Waco, in the same manner as suburbs, but the area isn't big enough to call them suburbs, and they aren't as sprawling as suburbs. As for Baylor, I really enjoy it here. It's a private Christian university,  but they don't shove it down peoples' throats. While there are a couple of required classes on the Bible and the history of Christianity, they're from an academic perspective, and dissent isn't quickly hidden away. As a Biology major, I'm especially glad they don't waste any time even mentioning creationism; the science classes here are about science. I'd have to say a great draw has been the people here. It's not so big that you become a number and it's not so small that everyone seems to be the same. While upper/middle class white kids are the majority, there's still a decent amount of diversity. Overall, I'm very glad I ended up picking Baylor to study at.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
