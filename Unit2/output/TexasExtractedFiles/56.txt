"First of all, Ann Curry, with all due respect [makes snoring sound]," Rivers said to host Marc Lamont Hill on HuffPost Live.	"Do you really like coffee? Really? That's making me cry that you like coffee," Rivers joked, impersonating Curry's heartfelt interviews.	"I used to scream at the set, 'Shut up, b---h!'" the comic exclaimed. "But she's a very nice woman, and I've heard Matt Lauer is a toughie."	Still, the outspoken comedian doesn't blame Curry or Lauer for the NBC show's tanking morning ratings. Those, she says, are the responsibility of clueless executives.
