That said, drunker crowds are less safe crowds.  More likely get into fights, throw things at opposing fans, etc.  Unfortunately not everyone becomes a loving drunk like me.  The angry drunk exists. I've never read a single comic, but I'm told he gets to be badass "as he gets older".  I just don't think the show is going to be on for another 5 years. We are spoiled, so we have such high standards nowadays that we are critical of shows like Walking Dead when 15 years ago it'd have been considered a top 2 or 3 show on TV. Nothing is worse than a vapid person with nothing going on for them but their looks.I'd have the body of a Greek God too if I had a full time personal trainer and nutritionist living in my guest house. You could fit the entire world's population inside an area the size of the state of Texas if everyone was willing to live in a city as congested as New York City.  The entire world in 1 Texas-sized city with the rest of the world dedicated to farming/etc.  It could be done.So you could fit all of America's population into 1 sprawling city the size of Ohio with absolute ease (and more space than you'd have in NYC), and then use the rest of the the states to farm food and the like.The "one big city" idea will never happen and is stupid, but it serves as an example of whats' possible.  If we all move into compact cities we have plenty of space for more people.  We'd just have to convert the farmland that is now suburbs back into farm land. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
