Edit: To clarify I meant 1 game in post-group play. I personally don't count group, but y'all can feel free to change my view! I'm open to new views.I feel C9's team comp isn't quite as strong as Fnatic due to Fnatic's sheer mobility. Combine teleport with Kass and it's going to be a very hard game. This will be a fun game to watch.Edit: I bet that Fnatic is going to camp Vlad. He needs to be ramped up and if he's targeted it'll hurt.we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
