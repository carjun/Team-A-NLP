['SHORTLY before a fertilizer plant exploded in West, Tex., on Wednesday, a father was driving in the vicinity with his 12-year-old daughter. They had stopped to take a video of what the man thought was a large fire swirling around the local high school.        ', 'He chatted with his daughter as he aimed a camera at the flames, which he later estimated were 150 to 300 yards away. He seemed to have faith that no harm would come. Suddenly, there was a bone-shaking hell on earth as the plant erupted.

Perhaps in West, there were some who still had unblinking faith in the muscled-up industrial soul of Texas, that it had been scrutinized to the right degree, and that the lawmakers in Austin had made sure of it.
