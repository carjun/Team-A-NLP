Hopefully he's able to stick with it.  I don't think he'll really miss anything by not seeing the episodes I left out.  Where No One Has Gone Before (a good "exploration" episode, sets up some later stories)In my opinion, those should be the bare minimum. I'm sure others may add or subtract from that list, but I don't think you'll be bored or put off by any of those. But I don't need to know what the reasons were behind the murder of Daniel. Nothing can excuse that. Nothing can lessen the gravity of killing a child. Plus, OJ never murdered a kid. As far as the criminal justice system is concerned, he didn't murder anyone. On Smackdown, Heyman got pissed that the interviewer asked about what was going on with Punk. He mentioned that her engagement had ended, asking her how she liked having personal business aired in public. On Raw, Heyman said he's avoided Punk all week because the issue should be aired publicly, not in private.Don't get me wrong, it was an awesome segment, but the logic behind its taking place was a little thin. You make a good point about the Hall, which relates to DVDs and the like as well. How would "paying tribute" to Benoit be fair to other wrestlers who didn't murder their families?  Him going in the Hall takes away a spot from someone else. And why should he get a DVD and not someone like Davey Boy?  we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
