Let's see let's go I'm thinking you decide on where we runThese words and faces stripped away my soul againThe devil told me you can justify your way through every thingThat's right I said it first escape is here fair weather friendsDamn I get the point, don't drive it home(Please to meet you now I'm gone)I fake a smile to everyone (just to get a rise)Save your breath I think it's time - now let it goSo make your point and move along(Please to meet you now I'm gone)I see you think I'm special something cool and close to magicalI'm stuck here selling mud and dirt to the kids againMy angel saved me from the depths of hell I swear she really didThat's right you said it best - there's no escape for you my friend-DISCLAIMER-Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for "fair use" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
