Does anybody else here from Katy or thereabouts find that sort of terrifying? (en.wikipedia.org)submitted 1 day ago by milagrojones8 commentssharecancelloading...all 8 commentssorted by: bestbesttopnewhotcontroversialoldrandom[+]natophonic2 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]natophonic2 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoFrom their website, they don't seem much different from the Christian private schools we toured around the Austin area with our grade-school daughter. Is there some backstory here?
Granted, once we got to talking to the teachers and administrators at those Austin area schools, there was no way in Hell we'd put our daughter there. We made it clear we were non-religious non-churchgoers, and while they were all still welcoming, we got the strong impression that was because they thought they could change our minds (or our daughter's, at least). One school forbade the kids to even talk about Halloween. Most of them were no better academically than the public school we'd been sending our daughter to.

permalinksave[+]milagrojones[S] -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]milagrojones[S] -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day agoCertainly, probably, worse than these public schools, where evidently it turns out that Halloween is real but so are other fascinating concepts, such as, per se, science.

permalinksaveparent[+]milagrojones[S] 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago* (1 child)[–]milagrojones[S] 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago*As a weary graduate of Katy High School (Katy Katy, not Katy Taylor), I am pretty much deeply worried by anybody who found KISD "too liberal" now representing us in like the highest deliberative body in the land.

permalinksave[+]bambamtx 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours ago  (0 children)[–]bambamtx 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours agoAgreed. Despite his personal views on any issue, it is easy to become excited about his zeal in standing up to the Washington insiders and making them listen to a different perspective. Not everyone has to agree with everything he says or does, but he's certainly making the voices of his constituents heard where there has been an echo chamber for only specific voices for far too long.

i wonder if they're related to/owned by the same people as faith christian academy in pasadena. i went to another private baptist christian school, and our sports teams played against faith on a regular basis. absolutely awful people, both students and teachers.
