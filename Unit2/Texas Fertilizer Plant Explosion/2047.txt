permalinksavecontextfull comments (109)Dermagraphism. Known as the Skin writing disease.  by  jlew24asuin  pics[+]SpammityCalamity 0 points1 point2 points 28 days ago  (0 children)[–]SpammityCalamity 0 points1 point2 points 28 days agoI took 20 mg of Zyrtec everyday until I didn't have to anymore. It took about 2 years, but it varies per person. Take the antihistamines also didn't get rid of it, it just masked the symptoms. I could've gone on a round of prednisone, but I really don't like the side effects of systemic steroids.
Check with your doc or pharmacist (like meeee) about antihistamines for allergies (these work the same way in treating dermatographism). All the ones effect people differently. I like zyrtec because it doesn't make me sleepy (even at twice the recommended dose).

Want to open a coke bottle? Bam, itchy red hands.
Want to try on multiple sets of clothes? Bam, your chest and arms are breaking out in hives from the friction.
Moving boxes, and a box slides gently across your forearm? Hives everywhere.
It was a neat party trick, but ungodly inconvenient.

He hit his head on the marker tray (chalk tray) with such force that he knocked himself out cold, and didn't come to until the paramedics came.

(imgur.com)submitted 3 months ago by SpammityCalamity to creepyPMs7 commentssharecancelloading...Redditor TofuTofu has gotten his Kickstarter project funded. Problem is, it's a thinly-veiled "How to Rape Someone" guide. I didn't know where else to put this...  by  GoCaps333in  WTF[+]SpammityCalamity 7 points8 points9 points 3 months ago  (0 children)[–]SpammityCalamity 7 points8 points9 points 3 months agoThat's a good point. I wouldn't deck someone for shoving me aside (I'm not sure what he means by shove aside HARD--if it were physical, I'd prolly just shoot him a wicked pissed look and tell a bartender or bouncer).
However, no one "accepts" to have someone's tongue down their throat in such a rough manner. I honestly think that if this guy hit the wrong "mark", or had one of his inexperienced fanboys pick the wrong chick, they would find themselves in a bunk bed in a holding cell rather than a chick's bed.

I don't tolerate that bullshit. We learned in kindergarten to KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELF.

Oils, syrups, dry measurement of solids because recipes in the states don't use grams or oz in recipes, they use volume measurements.
Finding out the specific gravity of your non water liquids is stupid inconvenient.

Pretty sure that rat doesn't hang out in trashcans on college campuses anymore.
You all should start a club. Vomiting on Vermin, perhaps?

I'm not paying 50k a year to be a secretary. Fuck you.

I will carry that bitch on and deal with the awkward shape rather than subject it to the whims of underpaid, rushed baggage handlers.
If they forced me to check it, I'd probably cry.
