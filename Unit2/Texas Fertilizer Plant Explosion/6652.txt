permalinksave[+]andrew2003 6 points7 points8 points 15 hours ago  (1 child)[–]andrew2003 6 points7 points8 points 15 hours agoThrowaway for this one: This kind of stuff is not uncommon at all. I've worked at quite a few full service restaurants in north texas, and have seen people queeze out juicy bacon onto sandwiches or burgers of people they assume are Muslim. Ham dipped into sodas or stuff similar. A lot of servers don't care at all, and most managers are former servers and don't care either. Muslim people aren't considered by servers as people who tip we'll either, so it's like, "Well that's what they get for being terrorists and poor tippers." I know a lot of people won't want to believe this, but I'm not surprised by this happening at all. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Nacho_torpedo 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes ago  (0 children)[–]Nacho_torpedo 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes agoI have seen a few comments like this and I can only assume these things happen in lower-end establishments. I have worked in restaurants for years and am now part of the management team of one and have never, ever seen a staff member purposely alter a guests food for some sort of retaliation or political rant. Just about the most "evil" thing I have seen done is someone adding the auto-grat to a check...everyone hates auto-grat.
Normal human beings who work in the service industry do not behave this way, the world is not a real life version of the movie "Waiting".

permalinksave[+]Bite_My_Butt 4 points5 points6 points 17 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Bite_My_Butt 4 points5 points6 points 17 hours agoIt's unfortunate but an alarmingly high percentage of people in this great state are "that way" and no amount of lawsuit or otherwise will fix it... People are shitty to people, regardless of race, gender, or affiliation. Be a white guy dating a black girl getting an ice cream at the DQ in Tyler just off I-20 en route to the Casinos in Shreveport, an un-fucking-believable amount of gall. 
Backwater redneck fundamentalist pieces of shit floating in the big ol' bowl we call Texas.  If it's any consolation, it's pretty much the same in Louisiana too.

permalinksaveparent[+]pdcgimpy 5 points6 points7 points 19 hours ago  (1 child)[–]pdcgimpy 5 points6 points7 points 19 hours agoDid you honestly think that I meant everyone is only putting bacon in straws as a method of bigotry?

permalinksaveparent[+]TheRighteousTyrantborn and bred -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours ago  (0 children)[–]TheRighteousTyrantborn and bred -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours agoI honestly have no idea what you meant. It seems like you're accusing a majority of people in Texas suburbs of being bigots, but for such a grandiose claim, you are sorely lacking in sources and support.

Texas is full of these ignorant bigots that are being taught to hate anything not christian from the Tealiban.  This is a big reason I look to make sure the person I elect is not wearing Jeebus on their sleeves.

Kid running for class president who texted himself racist messages. Duke LaCrosse team. There are tons of examples. Not saying it couldn't happen but just to be skeptical.
