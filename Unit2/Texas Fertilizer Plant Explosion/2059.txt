If anybody is wondering, the town of West, Texas pretty much exists because of this plant. Which happens to be next to a school and residential areas.

permalinksaveparent[+]GravityGrave 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]GravityGrave 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoYes, some local news tweeted 60-70 dead last night on twitter, and then deleted it not very long after. The number really blew up on twitter. Funny how all day yesterday twitter was bashing CNN for propagating false news, and then that happened last night. I thought it was fairly obvious that they wouldn't be able to confirm that many deaths just hours after the explosion, and while most fires were still being put out.

permalinksaveparent[+]KittenyStringTheory 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]KittenyStringTheory 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI'm thinking that's why the firefighters were there on scene despite the immediate danger, when normally you'd pull them out.  It was a heroic last-ditch effort to stop the place exploding before residents could be evacuated.
I doubt there was anything they could have done once it was burning, but it would be hard to give up and run away when you can see the elementary and high schools from where you're standing, and have no idea if they'll be caught in the blast.
Horrible.

permalinksaveparent[+]Kiliana117 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Kiliana117 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoI heard them say on NPR that the plant was originally out in the middle of nowhere, but that over the years residential building had encroached upon the factory. It's not like they build a fertilizer plant in a residential zone.

permalinksaveparent[+]bilabrin 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]bilabrin 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWell see burning occurs as a result of combustion of a surface which has a limited acess to oxygen. However when a fuel-air mixture occurs at the proper vapor pressure....BOOM!

Where did you get your information? It doesn't look like that big of a plant.

permalinksaveparent[+]Lucifersamtaco 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Lucifersamtaco 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoProbably not largest by volume produced, but by batch size.

permalinksaveparent[+]Ironicallypredictabl 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Ironicallypredictabl 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago

And ironically pretty much no longer exists because of the plant.

permalinksaveparent[+]MaeveningErnsmau -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]MaeveningErnsmau -1 points0 points1 point 5 months agoWhich begs the question: where do they build a town right around a fertilizer plant / a fertilizer plant right inside a town?
Texas, that's where; thanks to no zoning. From the State that brought you the sprawling morass of Houston, here's a fertilizer plant a few hundred yards from an apartment complex.

permalinksaveparent[+]frizzlestick -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]frizzlestick -1 points0 points1 point 5 months agoDude, /u/Seth44 's comment was still valid; because it's his hope (and was mine) that if someone was going to build the "largest ammonia based fertilizer plant", they'd do it a safe distance from residentials.
It's obvious it wasn't here - cuz man, that apartment building - and you just know folks were staring out their windows looking at it....
But still, he didn't deserve a "Dude..." dressdown. :(
edit:   I just read windows broke five miles away, houses shook 50+ miles away.    "safe distance from residentials" seems to be... Iowa.   :-/    It's one of those weeks, Lucifer's Morning Taco.
