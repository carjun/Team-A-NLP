permalinksaveparent[+]VictoryIsMyValentine 223 points224 points225 points 5 months ago  (10 children)[–]VictoryIsMyValentine 223 points224 points225 points 5 months agoSome people feel the need to tell other people when they enter a goddamn Starbucks or what type of pie they're just eating, so putting real news online seems kinda logical.

It's like we have a duty to do so, even though we don't.

I've always told myself that if I witness something tragic that I would document it and spread information as quickly as possible. We're living in an incredible age where it's possible to do this, so I do kind of consider it a duty to share information (as long as I'm not endangering anyone by doing so; in this case, the father was–although, it's not likely that he understood the magnitude of the fire).

permalinksaveparent[+]dsi1 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]dsi1 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoYeah, I totally consider it my duty to document and share any big event. We're all reporters now. (some people are just good enough they can live off it)

permalinksaveparent[+]finder90 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]finder90 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoBut you've gotta admit it's kind of amazing how much in depth information we can get these days in the comparative blink of an eye! This happened just a few hours ago and over 1,500 miles away from me. Not only do I already know about it, but I can actually see nearly every detail of it. If people didn't share things like this, that wouldn't be possible. Sure, sometimes it can be a negative thing for people to be sharing pics and videos and rumors when something bad happens. And it's definitely annoying as fuck when, say, my fiance's mom is posting requests for prayers for her granddaughter on facebook five freaking seconds after she finds out she's been in a car accident. But, damn; it's still pretty fucking cool. And just think of all the really positive impact these "amateur photojournalists" have had. For instance, people documenting and instantly sharing the Arab Spring has, I think, been a very good thing for the world. 

permalinksaveparent[+]aleisterfinch 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]aleisterfinch 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoIt has ups and downs, but ultimately I think it's made the world a better place.

permalinksaveparent[+]foreverburning 13 points14 points15 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]foreverburning 13 points14 points15 points 5 months agoYou know, though, I feel like it is important. 

Let me first clarify by saying that I in no way desire people putting themselves in harm's way to get this information/footage, or people neglecting other more pressing issues to get the big story. 
That said, I often think about how things like this will impact the way we view history (especially in the classroom--I am a teacher after all). Imagine the difference between how students learn about the American Civil War (mostly letters and ledgers), versus WW2 (some video and photos, some remaining artifacts), versus today (constant civilian-documented and submitted information, more than we could ever hope to sift through in some cases). 
I think it makes for a facinating shift in the way we are able to view historical events; we have first hand accounts available to view hundreds of years in the future (assuming proper precautions are taken to back up media and we have media viewers compatible with today's video). That is amazing to me. We have a much more accurate sense of civilian and infantryman POV than we do currently for events happening 80+ years ago. (At least I think this is true-- please feel free to correct me, I am not a social studies instructor). 

permalinksaveparent[+]sfc949 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]sfc949 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoWell we've all learned that "knowledge is power", so although we view this type of media, on the surface, as a type of entertainment/out of curiosity, it might be evolutionary engrained in us, in our subconscious, to want to share and receive knowledge. Pure speculation.

permalinksaveparent[+]Mike_Facking_Jones 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Mike_Facking_Jones 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoPretty sure this falls into human nature/group survival.

permalinksaveparent[+]thecrazydemoman 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]thecrazydemoman 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoFor some people it actually is their duty. See news crews, videographers.
Some people are wired to want to do this type of thing. I know I am crazy but I have an incredibly strong internal urge to run towards disaster so that I can film and document it. This is why I work in news/documentary work. It is a crazy dangerous curiosity.
Most people however are not stupid, they run away from danger.
Also maybe they uploaded this video form their phone (it looks like it was shot on a phone from the images in the mirror).

permalinksaveparent[+]HAL9000000 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]HAL9000000 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoCivic "duty" is something that is under-appreciated.  I get that we don't actually have a duty to specifically upload videos like this, but these people are performing a civic duty and I hope more people would see it like that.

permalinksaveparent[+]Graywolves 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Graywolves 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIt's always been the duty of humans to inform each other. That is how we build our collective knowledge and move forward. 

permalinksaveparent[+]TXT_ME 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]TXT_ME 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIn all fairness, it's not like it takes much time to put it on youtube. He seemed to be recording it with a smartphone, and generally you can upload the video straight to the internet after it is recording in a matter of minutes. While you're right, we don't have a duty to do, this kind of thing could be very helpful to people who are investigating the explosion.

Well, that and money.  That video has made him as much as $14,000 in half a day if he is a youtube partner.

permalinksaveparent[+]stranger384 -3 points-2 points-1 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]stranger384 -3 points-2 points-1 points 5 months agoAt it's core, it's an intrinsic, selfish pursuit of accolades and attention. Society is so obsessed with media/content, we see the world through short video clips online, that we almost separate ourselves from the moment and reality.
