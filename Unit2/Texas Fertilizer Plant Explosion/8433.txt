Teardrop tattoos used to mean your a murderer. You know what it means today? That you're a faggot.

Due to your obvious lack of basic superhero knowledge, I'll go ahead and assume that you don't know he's king of Atlantis. He controls the most powerful army on the planet. Think about that. He's the REAL world leader.

Every time I try to give this board a chance I see why Reddit considers this board a cesspool. It's schoolyard level name calling over intelligent posts. Maybe I did make a bad post, but you can put up a better argument than that. And I made this in four minutes.

I didn't want to label it hero because that doesn't specify comic books. You're arguing over semantics for Christ's sake.

The PS4 is often called bland, but fuck me that thing is powerful, and it has actual moral standings behind it.
The Xbox One seemed really cool, albeit boring, for a very long time... Until it turned its back and became a fucking supervillain. It tried to say some weird shit was going down when that happened, but we still don't trust it.
No one really trusts or likes the Vita, but it doesn't care. It'll keep doing what it does despite what anyone thinks, it's loyal and committed.
Everyone makes fun of the 3DS despite being insanely awesome, even though it did have some flaws long ago. It doesn't care, much like the Vita. It'll continue to be awesome until the day it dies.
The PC is indisputably the most powerful gaming console ever. A lot of people would dispute this, but when someone who knows what they're talking about talks to them, they'll learn. It can be called boring, but you know this fucker is the best.
