WEST, Texas — The only one of four schools in a Texas town to escape damage from a deadly
fertilizer-plant blast reopened yesterday with hugs for students and parents, as some residents
expressed frustration they had not been allowed to return to damaged homes.
Fourteen people were killed and some 200 injured in the huge explosions at the West Fertilizer
Co. facility that supplied agricultural chemicals and fertilizer to area farmers.
The cause of what is assumed to be an industrial accident has not been determined, although the
facility stored liquid anhydrous ammonia fertilizer in huge tanks and ammonium nitrate in dry form.
Both are considered hazardous materials that could ignite under certain conditions.
Meanwhile, President Barack Obama will attend a memorial service Thursday at Baylor University
in Waco for the victims.
A line of cars and trucks swept around West Elementary School as parents kissed their children
and hugged their teachers on the first day of school since Wednesday’s blast.
“It’s the first step, but getting back going again, some normalcy for our staff and faculty’s
lives and our kids lives, it’s a huge milestone,” said Marty Crawford, West Independent School
District superintendent.
Over the weekend, volunteers built three temporary classrooms at the elementary school for an
additional 300 students. Efforts to settle them included putting teddy bears on desks and names on
their lockers.

Information from The New York Times was included in this story.

Even at record levels, the stock market is not winning many new individual investors.
Bankrate.com says new research shows 76 percent of Americans are not inclined to invest in the
stock market. That comes even as interest rates on savings accounts and for certificates of deposit
are at record lows.
