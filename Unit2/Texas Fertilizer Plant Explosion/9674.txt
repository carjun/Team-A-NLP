This is something I have been talking about with my brother for over 2 years now, me having some games and him having others; nice to see Steam implementing this =)
Too bad it is a random draw though, I can still hope for the best

If i want to get crisp pictures i need to drive at least 2 hours from where i live, either way it usually worth it =)
Best of luck when you get a camera mount and such!

My main reason i continue to play this game is because I am in love with the vast story and vastly different zones, and I NEED to see how this story plays out. I sometimes spends hours just flying around cities talking to every NPC just seeing what they have to say.

Also having him listen to the the VO lines would definitely create a completely different outcome.
I would like to see him draw Nasus based on a very short description and his VO lines. I think the VO of Nasus would create for an interesting outcome.

My personal favorite aspect of it is the very large ceilings.

I got in the last test when there were only 2 days left so I didn't get to try out Faction Wars, but I loved the new boost feature!
I hope they get the boost feature to be a little more stable this time, constantly crashing the game while im going over a mountain in a steamboat...I wonder why...

I basically have like 5 purples(the rest is 563 heroics with 1 green trinket) and i blindly queued for my first LFR since getting the required ilvl as a tank. I felt like "hey ive got 500k health now, i should be able to tank LFR. Once the queue popped i was like "Fuck...i have no idea what any of the fights are"...but luckily the first wing of Mogu'shan vaults is basically faceroll.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (48)The Future of Team Solo Mid Discussion Thread  by  Kiinglyin  leagueoflegends[+]Xeniieeii 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]Xeniieeii 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoThats the main thing at stake here...TSM is nothing without Dyrus and TheOddone and xpecial. If Dyrus leaves(which is looking more and more worrying) I have no doubt that Oddbro would leave...he would not want to be there with only xpecial to help mediate things. And xpecial would undoubtedly leave if he had no other friends on the team anymore.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (7599)The Future of Team Solo Mid Discussion Thread  by  Kiinglyin  leagueoflegends[+]Xeniieeii 6 points7 points8 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]Xeniieeii 6 points7 points8 points 1 month agoAs bad as it is to say, he doesn't have the level head that Hotshot has. Regi loves being in this position of power and abuses it so much. Hotshot saw that he wasnt performing and he got out to help his brand...regi on the other hand seems to think that he is the TSM brand and is going to turn one of the most synonymous team names from NA and just destroy it.
If i can add my suggestion,it would be to drop regi, pick up a new mid and make Dan Dinh the manager/coach...he is a lot more patient and is a lot more objective about the game; as is observed when he streams he always calls himself out for stupid mistakes.
