If it wasn't it would have a thriving multiplayer, which I've heard it doesn't.
Doom revolutionized PC gaming.. but even if a company gave it out free I wouldn't exactly burst into tears of joy.

They likely profit from it. It's the same reason addictive facebook games give out tiny bits of their currency. To make you want to spend a few bucks to actually be able to use it on something.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (207)A CEO who resisted NSA spying is out of prison. And he feels ‘vindicated’ by Snowden leaks.  by  tonyhouse2in  news[+]Trucidar -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]Trucidar -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 days agoI'm very split on this case. I mean, there still remains the fact that he and numerous other CEOs cashed out stocks right before the value plummeted while telling everyone revenues would be high (due to govt contracts). They also were in shit for dealing with some other company.. i forget the name, but it's the company that was shredding enron documents during that fiasco.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (109)If you had 10 minutes until a nuclear missile hit your area, what would you do!  by  Dijasin  AskReddit[+]Trucidar 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago  (0 children)[–]Trucidar 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoOnly addendum I would make is that I often hear people cite the small blast ranges, but not only do most missiles have multiple nuclear warheads that will enlarge the blast zone you also have to figure that any target that is worth hitting with a nuke is worth hitting with a few. So i think most nuclear attacks will consist of multiple blast zones.

If you have a copy on both computers you're breaking the law. Will anyone catch you? Very very very unlikely. But that answers the legality question.

Edit: I don't think you are kidding so I'll clarify. Although i exaggerated the duration a tad, there are times where a month can pass before you see any cement. Even if a snowplow gets it you just get muddy dirty cement or slush and still can't see lines.

No lines.. just cold bitter snow.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (554)[Best Buy][CANADA]Pre-order Battlefield 4 on PC,PS3,XBox360 and get Premium Edition for Free  by  Cowwieein  GameDeals[+]Trucidar 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago  (0 children)[–]Trucidar 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoIt's not the membership. How it's worded makes me think it might be some sort of "premium expansion pack" meaning something like weapon skins or dog tags.
Regardless of what it actually is, since it doesn't say premium membership, i wouldn't expect that.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (33)The Middle Class Does Better In States With Lots Of Union Members  by  davidreiss666in  politics[+]Trucidar 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago  (0 children)[–]Trucidar 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoI'm not saying that it's true. You're probably correct that it is doable, but there is enough truth to it that CEOs and business owners often use it as a reason that they can't be better to their workers. They're not just fooling us either, they are fooling themselves, because they don't want to imagine that perhaps they are the problem.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1049)The Middle Class Does Better In States With Lots Of Union Members  by  davidreiss666in  politics[+]Trucidar 5 points6 points7 points 9 days ago  (0 children)[–]Trucidar 5 points6 points7 points 9 days agoExactly. Historical Inertia: The people in power aren't out to make the system terrible... it would just require massive effort to change a system by the very people who lose out if there is change.
CEO: "I would offer better wages, but no one else would so i couldn't compete." ie. I'm a good person, the system is the bad guy. Don't blame the player blame the game.. etc.
Simple explanation, no malice needed.

Cashiers aren't paid on commission.. they need to chill the eff out.
