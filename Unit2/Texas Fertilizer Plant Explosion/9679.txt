This was a year ago though.

I believe they also made the aegis for the first TI too.

It was okay and I might still have the photos around somewhere; will post if I can dig it up.

While Bo was definitely corrupt; the bribery and embezzlement charges were for such pitiful amounts that even the locals here are laughing it off.

A body-double CANNOT serve time for Bo; if you knew anything about the case it's the CCP publically shaming and removing a powerful rival. No way in hell they would let a double serve time in his place.

Most Chinese wouldn't have a clue what electro or house is and a handful of those that do would only know a few tracks from trash like Guetta and Benny Benassi.
