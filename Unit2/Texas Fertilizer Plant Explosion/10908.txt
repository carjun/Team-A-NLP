Worldevents is dedicated to fleshing out the historical, political and cultural context of current events.


Rules and guidelines:
The focal point of any submission should be what it adds to our depth of understanding regarding a current event, beyond the facts that would be presented in a basic newspaper article.
All links to breaking stories or plain reportage will be removed at the mods' discretion. When submitting links to articles with 10 paragraphs or less, the submission title should specify what it adds beyond bare reportage.
Submissions that ask readers to make a donation, sign a petition, or spread the word about a particular cause are considered advocacy posts, and will be removed by the moderators. Please down vote and report advocacy posts. >
Submissions will be removed by the moderators if the title features descriptive terms, or issues claims, not made in the content of the linked-to article or media.
Questions submitted to the new queue must be submitted as text.posts. Only essay- and discussion-style questions will be allowed. Do not title a submission with a rhetorical question.
Photos and collections of photos are not allowed. Submit them to /r/photoessay instead. >
Help make worldevents better: Vote for depth, and note the notable. > Votes should take into account more than just the title. >
TROLLING - DON'T.  Comments that add nothing to meaningful, civil discussion will be removed.  People that detract from meaningful, civil discussion will be banned, with no prior warning having to be given.  Instead of responding to trolling and bigoted comments, use the report button to report them to the moderators.

The following "vote fader" ranks subjects according to how appropriate they are for this reddit. If you'd like to help keep worldevents on topic, give up votes to submissions with topics in the "hot" section of the map, and down votes to submissions with topics in the "cold" section.
