One way in which you can donate to our work directly is the donation of field equipment.

Douglas is a baby hippo at a sanctuary in Zambia, and you'll be surprised to hear she actually a girl! Her rescuers thought she was a boy at first and named her Douglas. We think it's so cute we decided to keep it, even if she is a girl!Douglas was only two weeks old when first rescued and close to death. Now she's recovering but needs 3½ pints (2 litres) of milk every THREE hours! Will you help us look after her?http://bit.ly/adoptdouglasRead moreShow less2Add a comment...Born Free FoundationShared publicly  -  2013-07-24 Following the wonderful news of Born Free’s adopted ‪#‎elephant‬ Emily Kate giving birth to her first calf earlier this year, we’re delighted to announce the results of our ‘Name the Baby Elephant’ competition.Hundreds of people entered and we really enjoyed your entries!

The Ashley Shopping Centre in Epsom is planning an event featuring live penguins later this month.Our message to The Ashley Centre? Please don’t do it! The penguins will be subjected to the stress of transportation, and the likelihood of being surrounded by large numbers of people in an unfamiliar and unnatural environment. Furthermore, we believe that such events send a totally inappropriate message to the public that penguins are little more than ‘living toys’. Please contact the Ashley Centre via their website ( http://www.theashleycentre.co.uk/ ), their Facebook page (www.facebook.com/theashleycentre) or on Twitter (@Ashley_Centre) and politely urge them to reconsider.Read moreShow lessMeet The Ashley Centre's Famous Penguins1Add a comment...Born Free FoundationShared publicly  -  2013-05-13 ‘We will not allow dolphinariums’ This very welcome statement has been made by India’s Minister of Environment and Forests, Shrimati Jayanthi Natarajan to the Hindustan Times and will, we hope, soon translate into legislation. Following a plea by colleagues from FIAPO in India, Born Free immediately helped develop and fund campaign action to tackle plans to build several dolphinaria in India. Like the UK, India does not have any captive dolphins, and with both national and international support pouring into the campaign to ‘stop it before it starts’ it looks like there could be a positive outcome for dolphins. It is essential now though that this positive statement becomes enshrined in legislation ensuring India remains free from captive dolphin facilities. Please write to the Minister welcoming her statement and requesting that her sentiments be reflected in legal measures at the earliest opportunity.
