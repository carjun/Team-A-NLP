In other words, I think that some manager somewhere is probably asking them to make monkeys out of potato chips, even though the playerbase wants steak, and they're stuck in the middle trying to make everyone happy. I could be totally wrong though.
I really do wish you weren't getting downvoted for speaking your mind just because people disagree with you. :/

Or the node guarder who called incoming when needed but otherwise sat there bored the whole match.
My guildies rarely noticed the missing vote, but if they did, I'd just tell them I voted for the tank that had 700k protection and was peeling for me the whole match. They understood. ;)

permalinksavecontextfull comments (21)An update on the SWTOR movement...  by  YoBlizzin  swtor[+]KamateKaora 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]KamateKaora 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIf I wanted to get nitpicky, I could point out that there were around 5 points  that user actually agreed with, a couple more being conditional. So maybe 90% is a tiny bit of hyperbole? ;)
It does suck that they left - you would probably have recognized most of the names - almost all of them were long time Shadowlanders.  We'd moved our mains to PoT5 (a week before the removal of 8v8 ranked announcement was made, grrr,) but we still ran lowbies on Shadowlands.  4 man death match just wasn't interesting enough to keep most of them around, though. Not as the only "endgame" PvP option, anyway.
I'm probably going to go preferred when my sub runs out sometime next month.

Not like someone else's sub is your personal responsibility, but if he's obviously still interested in the game and not making idiotic statements like "omg this game sux I don't know why ur still playing it," I still don't see the need to make people feel unwelcome here. Especially when he said he'd be open to coming back.

I know some other people personally who would also potentially come back if some of these changes were made, possibly in the range of 10-15 subs. These people weren't heavy complainers, most of them saved their comments for the unsub box on the website. They genuinely enjoyed the game, but NOT some of the decisions that were made regarding PvP in particular. And to be honest, I find the "Fine, go away, we don't need you anyway" attitude to be a little perplexing and somewhat disappointing.  Isn't it easier to try to retain customers instead of always trying to add brand new ones to replace the old ones?

Why can't their be a middle road? Why is it either play the game how it is and shut up or quit, and go away silently?

I don't get it either. I realize that people have seen some complaints that were genuinely dumb. I also realize that people get tired of completely idiotic comments like "why r u still playing this game, it sucks, lol."  What I don't get, though,  is the automatic jump to "if you don't like it, just leave," even for posts that are well written and coming from people that are clearly long time players who are passionate about the game, just frustrated about something.  I don't see how that's helpful. Because, as you said,

In my opinion tackling the source of frustration yields better results in life than scaring off those who were affected by it.

I agree.

Also, as I mentioned in the other thread, most of my guild ended up unsubbing because of some of these exact issues. Not because they didn't like the game - quite the contrary. But mainly because of what they felt was poor decision making regarding PvP. So...forgive me if I don't find it "hilarious."  I miss my guild, and if the stuff in this petition gets addressed, they might actually resub.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (30)There's a movement going on on the swtor forums  by  YoBlizzin  swtor[+]KamateKaora -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago* (0 children)[–]KamateKaora -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago*I don't think I misunderstood. I understand that you've seen people make threats to quit before and not follow through with it before (I have seen that before too.) My issue is the automatic assumption that this is what is happening here.  I cannot speak for every single person in every single guild listed on the petition...but I can speak for mine. I will be sincerely shocked if any significant number of people in my guild return for 2.4. A small remnant of us still log in and play (occasionally) even though most of us are currently unsubbed - we do have game time left and most of us have been playing for quite some time. After that time runs out, we'll probably be gone too. The loss of my guild was entirely unnecessary and that kind of frustration is what you're seeing being played out in this petition. 
Do you not find it alarming that the streamer from the first Galactic Guild Battle promotion has announced that he's quitting?  Part of it is the fact that his brothers stopped playing - and that was part of the reason he was playing an MMO to begin with; but he also listed the removal of 8v8 ranked as a reason. 
This also hurts the streaming community - a lot of people WERE streaming PvP who aren't anymore - this includes some of the folks behind this petition. (And that was free publicity for BW.) Go to Twitch, browse games, and see how far down you have to go to find people watching SWTOR. There are more people watching people playing games I've never even heard of.  (And this isn't a bash of the game, it genuinely makes me sad.)

They WERE enjoying the game and WERE playing regularly. We had all just transferred for 8v8 ranked purposes the week before the announcement was made. That, and the news that there would be no balance changes before the start of arenas, completely took the wind out of everyone's sails. 
It didn't have to happen the way it did. There were 10+ long time subs there than wouldn't have been lost otherwise.

If your CU participates in Shared Branching, you might have a LOT more options than you think.

Hey folks,
If you were affected by this issue, submitting a customer support ticket is definitely the right approach. Please submit a ticket to CS from the character affected with any relevant information and CS will take it from there.
