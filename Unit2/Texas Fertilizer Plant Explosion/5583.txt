permalinksavecontextfull comments (29)Thoughts and critique my correction (album inside)  by  motoo344in  AutoDetailing[+]muswaj 3 points4 points5 points 16 hours ago  (0 children)[–]muswaj 3 points4 points5 points 16 hours agoListen, do not judge yourself by what you see pictures of. People are very generous, as a whole(no absolutes and all..), when it comes to taking photos of the most flattering areas of a car.
I am not a fan of 105 on an orange pad. That is not to say it can't fit into your workflow though. You will have a ton more cut. Follow up with an orange pad with a medium cut polish then move forward with the 205 on a white/gray/whatever works best.
Again, screw what we think bro. Get that sucker where YOU want it. You're jumping in the rabbit hole when you ask for advice. Look at me for instance. I said it looked great for what you did and after some prodding I just suggested that you could do this and then that(which will probably double the amount of time you've invested in this one project). haha!
Explore with different products and pads. Every paint/damage is different. 
Great attitude to have though.

Sure, you can get better results by being more aggressive/spending more time. But it looks like you got some nice results for what you did. 
Are you happy with it? That's what matters my friend. ;)

If you want the least water possible, try out a $2k professional grade steamer.

It will last you a very long time under amateur levels of use. 
I had one I used all the time and literally broke the end connector after about a year. The steam still worked but I had no way to connect the tips to it. For the money, it's an awesome little machine and builds steam in about 5 minutes.
Pro tip: Check craigslist for one for about $50.

A brush for spray-on dressings. Sponge for gel dressings. Follow up with a microfiber towel to remove excess product and/or layer.

People are used to being treated like a number. When you slow down and enjoy your time with your patrons you also build a relationship. Some of my clients have become buddies.

It's one thing to throw era specific aftermarket wheels on a car. It's another to put modern design HREs on a f40. O_o

permalinksavecontextfull comments (5)Question about Clay bar.  by  svndvlsin  AutoDetailing[+]muswaj 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]muswaj 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoI disagree.
More often than not clay by itself will generate micro marring. It's the nature of rubbing anything against your paint, much less when you're rubbing something against your paint which is grabbing up sand.
OP, I would suggest you first look into some options to remove the debris with chemical and hot water cleaning. A hot water pressure washer may do the trick by itself. Either way, my heart goes out to you on this one. Hearing how sand has bonded to your paint is sickening.
