   Firm's Lawyers Stand Ready to Help Those Who Have Been Affected by Tragedy 

DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2013-- 
  Baron and Budd, a Dallas-based law firm dedicated to protecting the rights of people who have been harmed by corporate negligence, is investigating possible lawsuits in the wake of the tragic explosion of the West Fertilizer Co. plant in West, Texas. According to the latest media reports at the time of this release, the tragedy has claimed the lives of at least 15 people and injured more than 160 people. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the explosion in West registered as a 2.1m seismic event. 

  "This horrible tragedy hits home for us," said Russell Budd, founder and managing partner of Baron and Budd. "Our firm is headquartered in Dallas, not far from West, and we have clients there. We are concerned about all the devastation this explosion has left in its wake. We stand ready to help the people of West as they work to rebuild their lives." 

  According to a required company emergency planning report uncovered by The Dallas Morning News, West Fertilizer Co. stated that there was "no" risk of a fire or explosion at the West plant. While the report did state that the company had approximately 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a potentially dangerous chemical with suffocating fumes that can explode if lit at very high temperatures, on hand, it claimed that the worst-case scenario would be a 10-minute release of gas that wouldn't cause any injuries or deaths. 

  In 2006, West Fertilizer Co. was cited by the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality for failing to obtain or qualify for a permit. The company was also fined in 2006 by the EPA for failing to have an adequate risk management plan, according to WFAA. 

  If you have suffered any harm or have been adversely affected by the West fertilizer plant explosion, contact the attorneys at Baron and Budd at 1.866.855.4556 immediately to learn more about your legal rights.

The firm serves on the highest attorney leadership committee in the litigation surrounding the BP oil spill, and has previously taken on BP/Amoco, as well as other big oil companies, in other environmental lawsuits.
