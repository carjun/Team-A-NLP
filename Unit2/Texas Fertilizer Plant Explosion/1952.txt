I shot this on March 17, 2010 in Riverside, California, at the FIRST LIVE PERFORMANCE of this new band! Fresh out of the studio, where they've been recording their first album, they performed two songs on this night. This one, "Mistreated", and also "One Last Soul", which is set to appear on the new album.  I have posted that one, as well.The members of this super group are Glenn Hughes, Joe Bonamassa, Jason Bonham and Derek Sherinian. Enjoy!!Best,Libby :)
