WEST, Texas
-- The official death toll in the Wednesday
explosion at a fertilizer plant near Waco, Texas, has risen to 14, while
dozens have yet to be accounted for, according to
CNN.
Texas
Department of Public Safety Sgt. Jason Reyes said Friday that 200 people were
injured and 50 homes were destroyed in the massive explosion.
Rescuers
have stopped searching for survivors in the debris, according
to the Dallas Morning News. 
U.S. Sen.
John Cornyn said at a news conference earlier Friday that 60 people have yet to
be accounted for, but the Morning News said officials are downplaying the number,
saying many of those people could be staying in hotels or elsewhere and just
have not been able to get in touch with family or friends.
The Morning
News also reported that 11 emergency responders are believed to be among the
dead.
Donald
Adair, the president of the West Fertilizer Co., expressed "heartfelt sympathy"
and vowed to make sure similar accidents don't happen at other facilities,
according to the Morning News. Follow @JonDReed
