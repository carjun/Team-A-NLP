I have only an Associate's degree and I started at a very small company (Systems Engineer). It has helped me to attain the skill set I have for the past three years. I've just recently acquired a position (IT Coordinator) and I'm happy how I have come along in my career thus far. But will the best opportunities only come when you pursue higher education or just from experience/certifications?
Edit: I'm 23 by the way.

I got it in the third grade because everyone made fun how big my head was and that it was over-proportionate with my little body. I cried at first. Then finally I said, "Fuck it!" I accepted the name and everyone calls me that now. I even put it on my class ring.
