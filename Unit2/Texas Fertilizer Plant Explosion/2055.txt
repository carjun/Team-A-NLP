permalinksaveparent[+]starvinmarrvin 13 points14 points15 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]starvinmarrvin 13 points14 points15 points 5 months agoit was felt as far away as dallas, about a hundred miles

permalinksaveparent[+]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago* (3 children)[–]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago*My roommate and I, in north dallas, both thought we heard/felt thunder, and at first were surprised as the storms were still up in OK Checked the radar to see that it wasn't the weather and was confused. One map I've checked shows a 2.1 mag earthquake there, that's just how big it was.

permalinksaveparent[+]bscooter26 -2 points-1 points0 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]bscooter26 -2 points-1 points0 points 5 months agoFor the record there was a very loud thunderclap at 5:00 am this morning that sounded like an explosion but it was long after the West explosion. I live near downtown Dallas, but we're only about 75 miles away

permalinksaveparent[+]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoYeah I was actually awake when the storms rolled through, and remember that lightning strike as it was close by.

permalinksaveparent[+]ownagebyte 5 points6 points7 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]ownagebyte 5 points6 points7 points 5 months agoI was on the phone with my father just after he felt the explosion, around 90 miles away. He was swimming and felt the pool shake and checked the news being a bit worried. Found out about the explosion and called me to check on me. I didn't feel anything but I was supposed to be in Dallas today, but other plans came up. Must've been a MASSIVE explosion. They even picked up the shake in Amarillo, about 400 miles away.

permalinksaveparent[+]nazihatinchimp 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]nazihatinchimp 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoNot surprising. The OKC bomb was made from just a truck full of that stuff and people felt it about 20 miles away. Incredible. Hopefully there were not many people around. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Lil_Psychobuddy 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Lil_Psychobuddy 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoAs someone who lives about 50 miles from a military bomb testing range, wich is even on the other side of a mountain. every time they drop a bomb, you can feel, and hear it.

permalinksaveparent[+]redmustang04 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]redmustang04 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThat's pretty much of all of Waco and Temple area hearing that blast and Waco is a good 40 miles away and that includes Hillsboro that has a big outlet mall.

permalinksaveparent[+]Colonel_Rhombus 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Colonel_Rhombus 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIt's kind of sad that the Dallas Morning News, which should be the newspaper of record in this part of the world, hasn't updated the story on their website since 8:30pm.  The BBC has up to the minute coverage but the Dallas Morning News can't cover a story in their own back yard.

permalinksaveparent[+]saikyou 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]saikyou 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoreally, 5 miles? Even with an explosion like that, that seems very hard to believe.

permalinksaveparent[+]Sup_gurl 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Sup_gurl 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoReportedly, the blast could be felt in Dallas, which is nearly 100 miles away. Another article reports that it was heard in Waxahachie, which is 45 miles away.

permalinksaveparent[+]alpicart 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]alpicart 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI'm pretty sure I felt it over here in North Carolina. It's probably way worse than it looks.
