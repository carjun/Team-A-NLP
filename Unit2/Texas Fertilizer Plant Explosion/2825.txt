Not so much for their drinks (try a mango pineapple smoothie though. nom.), but for the atmosphere. If you can, chat with the owner, Rusty, for a bit. The place is really focused on community involvement. I also love sitting outside when it's nice out. Their bluegrass Sundays are to die for as well. It's just a circle of good friends playing bluegrass music and it makes me so happy.
