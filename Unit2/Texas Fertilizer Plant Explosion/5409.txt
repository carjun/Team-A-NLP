It made me finally pull the trigger to buy and I can't believe how much I'm enjoying the game. Guess I've got to buy the older ones now :(

If you weren't in the way I could have ran straight through and kept going.

Obstruction is an obvious call, Joyce should be ashamed... Again.

But when I was looking it was a little over a dollar per slot!? So people are paying almost $100 a month so others can play for free? It just seems crazy

The thing that shocked me though is that all of the bf3 servers seem to be paid servers by individuals and not ea?

Their PC strategy: ignore piracy  by  tallkidoin  pcgaming[+]degeneraded 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]degeneraded 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoThat's true and wrong. A visionary is going to come out of this a Steve Jobs like story. It's simple, it's obvious, but nobody has the balls. Maybe things will change some than I thought..

permalinksavecontextfull comments (51)Anyone know any quarter mile racing games?  by  sgtpprin  pcgaming[+]degeneraded 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]degeneraded 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoAt first I thought what an incredibly boring game, what's worse that .25 miles on TV. But then I realized a complex quarter mile game not catered to casuals could be insanely fun and frustrating. Hiring and firing, sponsorships, technical decisions. Make your planning take an hour or two before you get to actually race and you'd be so invested in this one few second race you'd be screaming at the screen every race. 
Or maybe not...

I have a few questions.  by  fuckshitmcgintyin  pcgaming[+]degeneraded 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]degeneraded 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoDon't buy something new for $100 it's a waste. Either find a deal used or save a little more and buy something you won't regret. Nothing more expensive than buying twice.

I have 7 & 8 on different machines both with ssd's. I built them both so there's no bloat. 7 takes about three times as long to become usable.

They'd say things like "welp now it looks like I've got to root for the rangers too! But not when they're playing the Angels! uncomfortable laugh"

permalinksavecontextfull comments (102)Dodgers offered Kershaw contract concept in the range of 300 million earlier this year  by  no-changein  baseball[+]degeneraded 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago* (0 children)[–]degeneraded 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago*I was just saying and again I might be wrong that the average angels fan is much different than the people in this sub. Of course the people that are on /r/baseball are invested in and following their favorite team. But when I'm actually at games I get a much different vibe. A much more friendly, family, as long as you have fun playing is all that matters type vibe. I don't think attendance would change much and I don't think anyone would lose their jobs.
