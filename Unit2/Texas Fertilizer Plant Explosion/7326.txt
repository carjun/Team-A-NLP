Poll: Is the extension of the JobBridge scheme a good idea?
A PROTEST IS being planned today calling on the Government to reverse it’s decision to allow people to remain longer on a JobBridge internship.
Minister Joan Burton confirmed last month that the maximum duration for internships will increase from nine to 18 months.
However, organisers of today’s demonstration say the move only further normalises the practice of people working for free.
What do you think?
Poll Results:Yes, an 18 month internship could give people invaluable work experience.Nine months is enough, any more than that and companies are taking advantage.The whole scheme should be scrapped, it's not working.Vote
