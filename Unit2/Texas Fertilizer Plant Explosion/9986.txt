No DAE posts or solicitation of votes or views.

If your submission does not appear in the new queue, please contact us (be sure to include a link to the Reddit post (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.

permalinksaveparent[+]phidelta355 5 points6 points7 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]phidelta355 5 points6 points7 points 5 months agoNot to get pedantic, but I would wager at a close enough distance, the force of the shockwave from a large explosion is equal or greater than being hit by a train moving at ~30-40 mph, and it obviously increases the closer you are or stronger the explosion.
So yes, air is not a solid object, but in the right conditions, it might as well be.

permalinksaveparent[+]A_HIDDEN_TEEMO 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]A_HIDDEN_TEEMO 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoIt is worse.  The shockwave give no fucks about bones or skin; it will fuck up your internal squishies.

permalinksaveparent[+]DonkeyKong92 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]DonkeyKong92 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIt's the pressure wave that hits you.

permalinksaveparent[+]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWell, it's energy being released from the blast that hits you, similar to energy from a moving train hitting you.

permalinksaveparent[+]Room16 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Room16 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoEnergy equals mass times velocity 

permalinksaveparent[+]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThere's a reason that explosions are measured in weight.

permalinksaveparent[+]galient5 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]galient5 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoNo, literally, seeing as the principle is that of kinetic energy being transferred to the object being "hit."

permalinksaveparent[+]test_alpha -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]test_alpha -1 points0 points1 point 5 months agoI would say it's literally-figuratively.
