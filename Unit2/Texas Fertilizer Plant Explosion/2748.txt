WARNING YAOI / KISAITA ! :oWell, its the part for the mep Im holding. It should be released in something like 2-3 months, it depends how fast ppl will make their parts [btw. thank you for joining everyone, its gonna me an awesome project ;3.!]So yeah, KisaIta is like ma favourite pairing ever. So that I reckon, K/I needs more love, Im afraid this pairing is way too underestimated when it comes to yt videos and generally fandom. Well, and I find it pretty weird, since KisaIta seems to me to be kinda canon. I mean the way their relationship looked like and the tons of kisaita hints in manga. They were the only team in akatsuki which respected each other and was getting on really well [woah, they used to spend their time together for like 10 years, so theres no way they hadnt formed any connection : )]. And the way Kisame had always cared about Itachi was extremely cute. Kisame was the closest person to Itachi, after all [let alone Sasuke of course, I mean  some other kind of relationship]. [gotta prove it with some pages from manga, but will do it when the whole mep comes out].And even if you dont accept them as lovers, you gotta admit, they totally used to be friends, I mean if you read manga [heck those stupid filler Kisames reactions to Itachis death -_-].So yeah enjoy the vid and lets spread the kisaita love, they need it. [rest in peace guys :c]ps. if my part will be too long, ill shorten it for the mep, so no worries :3
