They are the naked hot version Westboro of feminism.

If Ryan Gosling stripped down and protested in the white house lawn there would be more people drooling over it than tweens a Justin Beiber concert. And if that at least happened I feel like Gosling would probably have a decent motive or point.

What is their purpose? I've been seeing them for years but all they seem to do is be hateful in public without getting any point across.

I would still rate it like 9.5 out of 10 but it broke my immersion in the game constantly.

When an average person sees this they are going to think "Oh cool, boobs." And then nothing else because their protests so many times aren't even protests, but hateful and destructive ragefits. If they are trying to support extreme feminism then it's doing quite the opposite, they are just "those crazy/hot naked protester chicks" with no immediate purpose to their actions. 
Oh and you're quite the dick.

I just hope they don't go down the conventional MMO route and stay inside the box. Hell they have their own box and as long as they stay in that one I'll be happy.

I think if they can make combat as close as possible to the ES games then it will have a great chance of being awesome. I hate when a successful game franchises attempt to make an MMO and they end up completely changing the control scheme that the fans love into shitty third person macrofests.

It's simple, nothing crazy and is perfect for books. 
If you are looking for a tablet then definitely try for an iPad/Nexus but if you actually want to use it for reading books get an e-ink reader. It's so much better for your eyes and the battery last months. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (32)After having a good friend yell at me tonight, I'm feeling a bit ambivalent about discussing religion ever again....  by  rustyoldtimerin  TrueAtheism[+]godofallcows 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]godofallcows 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoBoth of my closest friends are Christian (one is catholic as well) and I was once right there with them. They have stayed my friends throughout the past few years including my severance from religion. 
We simply don't discuss heavily debated areas and keep the religious talk mainly to philosophic type of questions (as in morals, ethics, etc) and we keep it respectful. My goal in life is to find some sort of happiness as I know it and not be a dick.
