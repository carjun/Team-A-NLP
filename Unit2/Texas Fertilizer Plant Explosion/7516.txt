This story shows the strength of the maternal bond between a raccoon mother and her young. A homeowner had his chimney and furnace flues capped- inadvertently trapping a mother raccoon and her kits inside. After having been trapped inside the house and removed by Animal Control, this mom still came back for her babies after three days of separation. Humane Wildlife Services was there to rescue the babies, rehydrate, and reunite them with their mom.
