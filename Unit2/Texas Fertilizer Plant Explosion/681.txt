Blast, USA 

Authorities have begun identifying the victims of last week’s massive fertilizer explosion in West, Texas, and the majority of men killed in the catastrophe were local rescue workers.
So far 14 bodies have been recovered from the site of the former
West Chemical and Fertilizer Co. outside of Waco, Texas, where a
gigantic explosion late Wednesday night leveled the facility and
the surrounding homes and buildings for blocks in each
direction.At least 11 of the men who perished in the fire and the
subsequent explosion were first responders, the Dallas Morning News
reports. That number has been confirmed by the Waco Tribune as
well.Among the 11 emergency workers killed in the blast were three
men — Cyrus Reed, Jerry Chapman and Perry Calvin — who raced out of
a volunteer firefighter training seminar Wednesday evening in order
to try and extinguish the blaze.“The three men grabbed their gear and sped toward a growing
smoke plume in West,” the Dallas News reports. “It would be
their last call.”Also identified as killed in the blast is a list of other local
men who proudly served as non-paid first responders for the town’s
volunteer fire department. One of them, 52-year-old Kenny Harris,
doubled as the fire captain for the city of Dallas and is believed
to have rushed to the factory while off-duty; two others, Robert
and Doug Snokhous, were brothers."Doug and Robert could always be seen together, whether they
were hunting, working on cars, golfing or cooking barbecue at the
volunteer fire departments cook-off," reads a statement penned
by members of the Snokhous family following Wednesday’s blast."They were always together and we were always comforted that
they were together at the end."Christina Rodarte, a 46-year-old West, Texas resident who has
lived in the small town of 2,800 people for most of her life, told
the Dallas Morning News that nearly everyone in the close-knit
community lost someone in the blaze."We know everyone that was there first," Rodarte said.
"There's no words for it. It is a small community, and everyone
knows the first responders… all volunteer."County music singer Willie Nelson grew up outside of West and
has vowed to donate the proceeds from an upcoming area concert to
the town’s volunteer fire squad. In a statement published on his
website, he recalls as well the closeness that made West a special
place for roughly 2,8000 residents.“These friends and neighbors have always been and are still a
part of my life. My heart is praying for the community that we call
home,” Nelson said.In addition to the volunteer firefighters that have been named
as casualties of Wednesday’s explosion, the owner of a local
welding operation and the proprietor of a nearby fencing company
were also killed.Several others remain missing, and investigators expect the
death toll to rise as the rubble of the fertilizer plant is
carefully searched in the days to come.Roughly 200 people were injured in the blast, and as many as 75
homes were significantly damaged. The Associated Press has since
reported that the West Chemical and Fertilizer Co. hasn’t been
inspected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) since 1985.

Sadly another example in which the govt regulatory agency doesn't do its job.
