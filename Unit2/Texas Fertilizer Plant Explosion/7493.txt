Welcome to the Magic: The Gathering Limited subreddit.
Magic: The Gathering is a twenty year old card game that combines the skills of poker with chess. Players under normal circumstances build sixty card decks from a pool of hundreds upon thousands of cards. 
Unlike in Constructed where players use any cards they please, however, In "Limited" tournaments, players construct decks using booster packs plus any additional basic lands of their choice. 
The decks in Limited tournaments must be a minimum of forty cards. All unused cards function as the sideboard. In contrast to "Constructed" tournaments, the player is not restricted to exchange cards on a one-for-one basis when sideboarding, so long as the player adheres to the forty card minimum. 
The rule that a player may use only four copies of any given card does not apply.
