In 2 parts: drum processing begins at 5:10.The first patch is silly-complicated, but mostly due to the sequencing and nuanced modulation(VCAs) involved (quadLFO, a-155, quantizer, 04a EnvelopeGenerator  etc). The entire sound itself comes from just one oscillator being processed by two modules .... the sound consists of simply one Anti-Oscillator being audio-rate FM'ed by another, while the DDL just adds some space...all the background-extra weird pitch warbling is courtesy of the modcan FrequencyShifter 39a.a-155 sequencer combo driving 2 anti-oscillators in FM into a plan b m13 lpg+vca. VILFO modulates the FMop(Anti 1), while cwejman vc-adsr2 moves the m13. output goes to the modcan FS 39a, out the 39a 'difference' output, and then into 59a DDL. (no filtering)The second patch is a jomox999 into the 45a E-Follower, but using the gate out to drive the 04a EG instead of the 45a's simpler EG. 04a goes to 48 dB LPF then 4vca, and then through the FS 39a(quadLF0 61a to v/oct in, 04a EG to FM in) and out the 59a DDL.There's a touch of eventide timefactor at the end for those offset dubby echoes.
