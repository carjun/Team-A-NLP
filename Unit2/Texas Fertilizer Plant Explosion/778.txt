Whether you're an experienced camper or just looking for a place to spend the day outdoors with the kids, Florida has no shortage of natural resources to explore. Take a day trip by car to explore natural springs, spend the night on an uninhabited island in Indian River Lagoon, get a taste of the state's cowboy past on horseback, rent a houseboat on the St. Johns River or paddle a canoe and spend a night on a river bank â Chad Crawford has five great ideas to get you started. #LoveFL
