Kudishnyao!

Play 


      In early 2011, we created our second video art exhibition in collaboration with the Goethe-Insitut Nairobi. Titled "Kudishnyao!" (an onomatopaeic word for the sound kids make on the playground to represent gunshots), the exhibition involved using six screens set up around an exhibition space to provide six parallel views of a single story. The exhibition was shown at the Goethe-Institut (Nairobi) and the Rush Arts Gallery (New York).It would be difficult to replicate the experience of the six-screen setup online, so we have reformatted the videos for a single-screen format.Find out more about Just A Band at http://www.just-a-band.comand on our Facebook Page: http://www.facebook.com/justaband
