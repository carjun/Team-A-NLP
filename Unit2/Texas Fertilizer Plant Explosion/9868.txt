I looked at sails over Meteor at first.  I left because of waterline but that is a different story.
The Meteor Book does a good job at defining a folder structure. if there was something like Meteor Lite with the current folder structure, and Meteor with a defined large app layout I would be so happy.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)Wendy Davis is officially running for Governor  by  libsysguyin  texas[+]libsysguy[S] 8 points9 points10 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]libsysguy[S] 8 points9 points10 points 3 days agoAt the risk of being crucified, I'll do my best to explain in a TL;DR version.
While I don't believe there is anything terribly wrong with smaller government, I think that there does need to be an entity with oversight.  I don't really trust a company that is sheerly out for profit to be looking out for my best interest as a consumer.  My best example are the telecoms/ISP's.  
I believe that if there is a genuine community effort to better itself, it will be successful.  That is most certainly a utopian idea. Similarly, capitalism should work in a perfect world.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a utopia and we must come up with this balance of oversight to capitol freedom.  I am not in favor of massive tax rates so the government will brush my teeth for me.  I am in favor of combining resources across our country to offer the best possible solutions.  
I hope that was at least somewhat coherent.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on libertarianism and what you favor in regards to smaller government.
Also, I apologize to the mods if this is off-topic.  Please don't ban me :)

Also, while I am not entirely on board with the small government libertarian movement;  I can certainly respect that we need to oust the far right christian GOP.  While I think what she did on the senate floor was great, it's certainly no tmy only motivating factor for wanting to vote for her.

However, observing that some other node based frameworks are already on 1.0+, I think its an okay versioning scheme.

Davis didn't have an easy race in Ft. Worth for her senate seat either.  Hopefully she can employ some of her past experience and make it a good race.

The ticket repo is called "maja".  The other one that is pushed is called "Mob".  I'd like mob to serve as a SSO to the rest of the applications.  
I've currently got some stuff wired up with bootstrap3 but none of it is themed.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)Looking for suggestions for best hosting environment.  by  sudo_free_cakein  Meteor[+]libsysguy 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago  (0 children)[–]libsysguy 1 point2 points3 points 12 days agoA standard unix stack is totally fine.  It is really a matter of preference.  I run meteor on a 64 bit debian install.  For development you can use the built in mongo database so you don't have to worry about a package install initially.  I would not recommend windows.  
As a side note: To save some money I would consider just setting up virtual box until you get something you want to share with the world.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (4)Functional testing in perl for a webapp  by  rojazin  perl[+]libsysguy 2 points3 points4 points 12 days ago  (0 children)[–]libsysguy 2 points3 points4 points 12 days agoA lot of the perl web frameworks offer testing suites.  If you're not running a framework (Dancer, Mojo, Catalyst) Selenium is probably your best bet.  You can always run selenium in headless mode with ice weasel , you may just have some issues with js.  I am pretty inexperienced in running selenium in headless mode but I have tried it and know it works.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (459)Question about Metro cost  by  sparcespadein  houston[+]libsysguy 2 points3 points4 points 27 days ago  (0 children)[–]libsysguy 2 points3 points4 points 27 days agopublic transit here isn't bad, just a little slow at times.  Be Prepared for the bus to be late picking you up and dropping you off.  Also, google maps (transit) is your best friend.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (9)Question about Metro cost  by  sparcespadein  houston[+]libsysguy 5 points6 points7 points 27 days ago  (0 children)[–]libsysguy 5 points6 points7 points 27 days agoI'm sure you found this map.  The zones are for the park and ride locations.  Local is just getting on at any stop thats not a Park and Ride (I believe).  
As far as the cost effectiveness I suppose it depends on how much you would pay for parking/fuel.  You're probably looking at $2.50/day or $50/mo (business days).  I think parking downtown generally runs about $60-$150/mo depending.  The upside of driving is you will definitely get there faster.  The downside is you will want to murder all the other drivers.  

permalinksavecontextfull comments (9)What company has forever lost your business?  by  tueiq2in  AskReddit[+]libsysguy 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]libsysguy 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoCenturyLink.  I used to work from home and kept getting dropped packets ALL THE EFFING TIME.  This caused my ssh connection to drop out.  When I called to report the problem the "Network Analyst" kept telling me there were no errors and if I wanted out of my contract it would be $200.
TL;DR Read the contract or don't sign one
