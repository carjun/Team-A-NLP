Located a short ride from the Florida Everglades and close to Naples, Marco Island is the largest and only developed land in Florida's Ten Thousand Islands. This Gulf Coast retreat offers luxury resorts, beautiful beaches and unspoiled parks. The tropical climate is a considerable attraction to the area, with the water being the next major attraction.
