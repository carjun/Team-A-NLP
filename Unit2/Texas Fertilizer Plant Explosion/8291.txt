permalinksavecontextfull comments (1103)What is one fact that, despite being 100% true, is still greatly debated?  by  azchrisbin  AskReddit[+]the_fatal_cure -1 points0 points1 point 17 hours ago  (0 children)[–]the_fatal_cure -1 points0 points1 point 17 hours agoNot really. It just means we have reflectors on the moon. Let's say we got the Mars Rover to just install one of those bad boys. Sure, we can test out if they are there, but that doesn't mean humans were there. 
I'm not saying we haven't been to the moon. Just the flaw in this logic.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (342)How to make her fall in love with me again?  by  [deleted]in  AskReddit[+]the_fatal_cure 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]the_fatal_cure 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoDon't. It really is hopeless. If she broke it off, you're fucked. If you really like her that much you can stay friends, but not until you've had at least six to twelve months of no contact/stalking whatsoever. 
Word of advice: Have fun with yourself again. Go out. Hang with friends. Party. Before you notice, you'll be into another girl more than you ever were with this one. It take time. Hell, you'll go though this cycle MANY times in your life. Some really bad, some really good. 
That's my advice, kid. Move on. I wish I took my own advice when I was younger.
