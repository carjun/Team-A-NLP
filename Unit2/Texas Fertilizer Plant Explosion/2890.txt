Go Sean Seibert! I don't know your politics, but anyone is better than that curt!
I'd say fight her in the primaries, but her competition there is a rapper named "cornbreadd" and I assume he'd be no less of a moron than she is.

I've done it. Except for a few choices, there are alternatives on the ballots than the big two.

That is pretty damn important considering towns have actually run out of water this year.

Municipalities aren't actually without water. They just have to pay more to bring it in

You basically just confirmed that the municipalities HAVE run dry and that they now have to truck in their own water. 

permalinksaveparent[+]OscarTheBorracho -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours ago  (1 child)[–]OscarTheBorracho -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours agoNo there is plenty of water but most of it is not drinkable. Wells can be dug to water lawns but it isn't drinkable. Just depends on what "running dry" means ;)

permalinksave[+]Vee_Vee 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago* (1 child)[–]Vee_Vee 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago*No, thanks. Texas Democrats are far more moderate than CA democrats, and anyone saying otherwise most likely has no clue what they're talking about, or are paid GOP shill. Rick Perry was a Texas democrat until 1989 for Christ's sake.    
Seriously, after all the bullshit we've put up with at the hands of Texas conservatives like ridiculous special session for abortion in the middle of the worst drought in Texas history, creationism in textbooks, continued hints toward secession (that's just nutty), having moderate Texas dems in office would be just like having conservatives, but without all the crazy.
