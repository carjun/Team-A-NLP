But as to the reception, I feel like i've overextended myself to ensure that people do have a good time, but to a bunch of people who really dont care if I do. FHs family has been downright critical and demanding, and they are 80% of the guests. I've been completely ignored at every family get together for nearly 10 years. I dont think its going to be very different at this one. So, fuck em. I am going to make sure I have a great night, and I know my few friends and family will be.there and having a blast regardless.

I read this.a.few.weeks ago and my partner was going through the worst nerves at the time. After reading this I told him if he felt nervous, to focus on me. We only get this one opportunity to be honest in front of everyone we know and love, and thats why they are there- to witness that. I told him it doesnt matter if everything goes wrong, if we mess up our vows, at the end of the day we will be married amd thats all that matters. He's been fine ever since.

I just feel like this wedding is out of control, and yeah, I've had a lot of demands placed on me, which I might not have minded so much if it were done in excitement. But its not, its from people who disapprove of us getting married ( FMIL, you are a pain in the ass. " you cant afford to get married, but you have to invite all 70 of our distant relatives"). I am so glad my partner is absolutely giddy with excitement, otherwise I would be in such a worse state. I feel like I am putting my heart and soul into this to make everyone happy, but none of these people care and it will end up being a lukewarm event.
So I am going to focus on my little family, buy the few things left on the list to my tastes, not rely on anyone for help and kick up my heels like a mofo on the night. Otherwise I will call the whole thing off happily.

I think he was quite concerned with the possibility of JA, but once the blood tests all came back in the normal range, he was quite stumped (visibly and admittedly). I would get a second opinion, however I think it's likely to be very similar. I would prefer to stick with the one GP, and pursue JA with him, so he becomes more familiar with our case, and hopefully will refer her to a rheumatologist when we return.

The Dr thinks its the way she holds her pencil at school. I am not convinced. Mothers instinct? This has been going on for over a year and a half. I will try pencil grips, but also start giving her calcium, fish oil and glucosamine just in case. If its still bad in 6 weeks, I will go back again. Still worried, and my gut feeling is to keep pursuing this.

I wasn't expecting such a response, and although I am saddened by your stories, I m also heartened by seeing such a strong community. I know my daughter is finding strenght in solidarity, knowing that she isn't alone and that our family will provide strong support for her.  In 3 hours we will be at the Doctor, and hopefully we will have an answer, but I know it isn't that straightforward with JA. I know having an answer will make things easier for my daughter, as not knowing what was happening to her has caused her a lot of worry and confusion.
Thank you all for your input. I cannot begin to tell you how much it is appreciated to be able to reach out and find that someone is there.

I was also recently asked by work to change my name as it was causing too much confusion for our national office. But yes, it is a lovely name.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (74)Paleo while at college! Tips, advice, common meals? Help!  by  kressikin  Paleo[+]excuses_that_I_know 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]excuses_that_I_know 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoCauliflower and cabbage are super versatile, and cheap per head.
Seasonings are a good change, amd inspirational. Often I choose my flavour and then the meal follows (all up in the asian palate this week).
Find a good place to buy bulk meat and veg. I buy whole quarters of beef, and bulk chicken t@-}--n play butcher at home.
Make enough dinner for several meals and freeze them. Super cheap and lasts atleast a month in the freezer. 
Eggs are awesome. 
Use as much of your veggiea as possible, in as many differwnt ways. I've started julienne-ing my broccoli and cauliflower stems (cut am inch from the base of tuw stem, as it is quite woody) and its become a fave meal addition and snack. 
Keep experimenting qith food and meals. I find that most paleo only takes 15 mins to prep and cook

I go to whole30 & paleo for recipes, and keto for support.

Is there a sub for a combined keto/paleo diet?

permalinksavecontextfull comments (23)Mother obsession issues, 2 years out...  by  papertygersin  weddingplanning[+]excuses_that_I_know 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]excuses_that_I_know 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoHave you both sat down and worked out how much is budgeted for each part of the wedding? It might help you be firmer with her and tell her exactly what you want, if it comes in at the agreed expense.
Another idea is to make a big scrapbook of ideas that you love and give it to her. Once she.sees how it will all come together, she.might be a bit more enthusiastic about your choices.
Other than that, in my.experience, it is crazy how others will passionately share their views on how your special day should be. Its something I never expected, I lost a best friend and suddenly.the in laws have gone from ignoring us, to telling us how our wedding should be (oh, the guilt trips). 
You guys are still 2 years out. I would tread carefully, as silly disagreements become.huge problems when it comes to weddings.

Finally found an effective AD and stuck to it, 4 months. Keto has.been the icing on the cake. I have never felt free from depression until now. Sure my ass looks great. I only wanted to lose a couple of lbs But tbh, why i'm going to stick with it is because I finally feel great.

No amount of sleep was enough and I had huge energy crashes in the afternoon. I was drinking huge amounts of coffee and energy drinks to perk up. I haven't even thought of having an energy drink in weeks now.

I've done all my flowers artificial through an amazing etsy seller for the bouquets, and some great wholesalers on the web for centerpieces. All up $400.  My bouquet is to die for and the best thing about artificial is the flowers are never out of season!

I'm feeling better today, just writing to-do list and working through them.
