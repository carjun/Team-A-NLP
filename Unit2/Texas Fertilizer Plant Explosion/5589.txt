It was similar, though.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (5)Some Surprising Trivia You Might Not Have Heard About Before  by  shellythelastin  WarriorCats[+]shellythelast[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago* (0 children)[–]shellythelast[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*Warriorcats.com is a farce. Even the authors admit to it. It's run by Harpercolins, not them, and half the info listed on it is completely wrong. 
For instance:

Swiftpaw is listed as a female, and listed as Graystripe's sibling.
Longtail is listed as a female.
All of Ferncloud's kits are listed as males.
Brokenstar is listed as a female.
Mousepaw is listed as a female.
Mistyfoot is listed as deceased.
Hazeltail is listed as Sorreltail's kit and deceased.
Molekit is listed as one of Daisy's kits.
Icekit is listed as a male.
Hollykit is listed as a male.
Brackenkit is spelled as 'Brackerkitkit'.
Thornkit is spelled as 'Thorrkit'.
Spottedleaf and Willowpelt are listed as Dappletail's kits.
Lineage is misspelled to spell liniage.
Spottedleaf is listed as Spottedtail.

And in any case, I try to avoid forums for this fandom. I have... opinions, that some tend to vehemently disagree with and I'm tired of arguing my points over and over again to people 2/3rds my age that refuse to understand why I think Briarlight should be killed off or why I think Firstar's a horrible leader or why I think Thistleclaw was a good warrior and Bluestar was not.
Long story short, I've been reading this series since Into the Wild came out, and I've had a lot of time to think about it. I'm not visiting the forums anytime soon.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (108)What was pre-911 america like?  by  UnColoredNegroin  AskReddit[+]shellythelast 1 point2 points3 points 16 days ago  (0 children)[–]shellythelast 1 point2 points3 points 16 days agoI was able to fly on my own as a kid without being on the leash of a flight attendant. They'd keep an eye on me, but that was the extent of it. I even got to hang out with the pilots! Still have one of their wing badges around here somewhere.
And we could see cities attacked in Saturday morning cartoons without people thinking we'd be scared by them. Like seeing a giant Tentacruel destroy a city in Pokemon. After the attacks, stuff like that just got censored. We couldn't even have stuff with names like "tower of terror" on television after that. That never sat right with me.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (43)Which controversial topic can you just not understand the other side's viewpoint at all?  by  neomatrix248in  AskReddit[+]shellythelast 0 points1 point2 points 20 days ago  (0 children)[–]shellythelast 0 points1 point2 points 20 days agoPeople that are against sex-ed. I don't get the thinking that if we don't teach teens about sex, they'll never find out about it until they're legally of age. People have been humping at all ages since the beginning of our species. We obviously don't need to be told about it to know what it is. 
I even talked about it with a co-worker once, who claimed he was against it because he didn't want his kids "looking at porn," which is what he believes sex-ed classes/books show. If he can jack off to a diagram of a vagina and uterus, good for him, but I don't think that's the norm.

Most of the mega evolutions at least bring something new to the design, not just a pallet swap. This would be cool as a shiny version, maybe.

She just didn't get enough contact at the time to go into a coughing fit.

It was established in the episode before that that Hoody had stolen his pills, was it not? Jay's done plenty to prove he's not a reliable person. And I'm pretty sure the only reason Tim hid the tape was because Jay's only motivation so far has been to save Jessica, and Tim either really needs his help to bring down TO or he wants to keep Jay safe. Or both.

He at least seems to have some grasp of what's going on. And I can't forget that he did save Jay's life at great personal risk. He went back for Jay. I don't think Jay would have done that.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (14)Have you ever met an MH/Slender fan in real life?  by  sergeantduckiein  marblehornets[+]shellythelast 10 points11 points12 points 27 days ago* (0 children)[–]shellythelast 10 points11 points12 points 27 days ago*I got a few of my friends and my brother into the series, and we all watch together whenever a new episode comes out. We all have different theories on how it's going to end, and when the end comes whichever one of us is right wins the bet pool ($200, 50 from each of us).
Friend 1 thinks that everyone will just end up proxies of Slender and the series will end there with Jay, Tim, and everyone else enslaved.
Friend 2 thinks that Tim and his guys will save the day in the end when Jay inevitably fucks something up and is about to die. They'll bust in and just clean things up.
My brother thinks that both Jay and Alex will be proxies in the end, but Jay will somehow snap out of it and kill Alex and somehow ward off the Operator.
I think Jay will go nutso from his Slender sickness and kill everyone.
I also think we're all probably wrong.
