permalinksave[+]waveblue 16 points17 points18 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]waveblue 16 points17 points18 points 5 months agoI have to ask... How long did it take to come back? Did you get any permanent damage? Tinnnitus?

permalinksaveparent[+]sergeant_R 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]sergeant_R 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoIt took me a little over a week to recover. It sucks it happened, but I am glad I only have minor side effects. Some things I have trouble hearing, but they are few and far between. 

permalinksaveparent[+]stklaw 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]stklaw 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoWas it total hearing loss? How long did it take for your hearing to recover?

permalinksaveparent[+]S_W 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]S_W 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI also temporarily lost my hearing from a loud explosion.  Right when it happened my left ear was completely 'deaf' with ringing in it and my right ear was partially and had ringing in it.   It didn't really hurt me, although my situation may be different than yours, but it was quite a shock.   My ear drum in my left ear was reconstructed when I was a child so that may have actually helped, I'm not sure.
The doctors gave me steroids to help speed the healing process and it took about a week to get any hearing back and a couple months to get it to where it is today.  I lost a lot of the higher frequencies in the left ear and I have tinnitus in both ears.  I'd say my left ear is at about 75-80% of what it used to be.  I've gotten used to the tinnitus and really only notice it when it is really quiet, so when I'm trying to go to bed it can get annoying sometimes.  
I really hope these kids are doing fine and it was just initial shock to the ears.   

permalinksaveparent[+]sergeant_R 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]sergeant_R 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoFor me it is only certain frequencies that I am unable to hear anymore, but for the most part I function just fine everyday. I wish you the best of luck!

permalinksaveparent[+]sergeant_R 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]sergeant_R 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoNo, it was more of a roaring noise for me. Kind of hard to describe, but definitely not fun.

Soldiers do not choose when, where, or why they deploy. It is our nation's responsibility (collectively) to make those decisions. If you have something to say about it, then contact your senators or run for office. Do not however, put your fucked up opinions into soldiers who have next to no say-so in the matter.

permalinksaveparent[+]Wilcows 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Wilcows 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWell I thought you meant you were hit by an RPG.

permalinksaveparent[+]sergeant_R 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]sergeant_R 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI was.. not directly of course. When explosions hit close to you/your vehicle, that is typically what people mean. If you hear a marine say he was hit with an IED, he does not literally mean that someone took a bomb and slapped him the face with it. He is saying that he was hit with the explosion that it issued. People live through explosions. Point in case, the WACO explosion video.
