(Sorry if repost)  by  VinceinChainsin  StonerEngineering[+]maxsmart01 3 points4 points5 points 14 hours ago  (0 children)[–]maxsmart01 3 points4 points5 points 14 hours agoGet yourself a shot glass and a small pair of scissors. Nugs go in the glass. Scissors in dominant hand. First two fingers of the non-dominant hand cover the top of the glass to keep tiny bits from flying out as you shred the shit out of your tasty nugs. Enjoy--cheers.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (4)Have any of you quit your jobs to follow your dreams? How did it turn out, would you recommend it?  by  FredSlacksin  AskReddit[+]maxsmart01 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago  (0 children)[–]maxsmart01 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoI left a pretty good job back in '99 in order to move in with a girl I had just met. I ended up getting off of hard drugs (coke-speed). Few years later we got married, moved to another country, moved back, and now we live a quiet life in the country. We are still very much in love. It was totally worth it for me and I don't miss that old job at all.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (4)Between the chronic pain and my PTSD, sex is becoming a real problem  by  Purple_Plumin  sex[+]maxsmart01 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]maxsmart01 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI have a tendency to be distracted,all the time, by both my pain and my PTSD. The weed sort of helps me put that aside. When I'm not as focused on my own issues, I am better able to notice what others are going through. I'm less centered on myself and that frees me up to be 'normal' emotionally, at least for a while anyway.

Mary Jane has helped me an awful lot. As you know with PTSD, bad things that you experienced are at the forefront of your mind 24/7 and furthermore, those memories bother (to put it mildly as possible) you 24/7. With the right weed, I still remember but I'm not bothered as badly. It also helps loosen me up and I am more empathetic to my family and attentive the needs and desires of my wife. 
It does help me with my pain to some degree but a lot of that can be attributed to it's powerful anti-inflammation properties. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (19)i need some advice/tips on fast sex, its the only way i can describe my problem.  by  Hero_bin  sex[+]maxsmart01 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]maxsmart01 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoSure, you could. The man is having slippage issues though. I'm just trying to suggest, to him, options that eliminate the risk of slipping. Holding on to her waist is fine, and erotic, and an excellent choice for a normal trip up Space Mountain. However, when your lady wants you to "knock her back out", you make sure you have all your bases covered.
