permalinksavecontextfull comments (9)What happens when you didn't manage to pass your your IPPT during your window...  by  hazwadyin  singapore[+]Dreamwaltzer 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Dreamwaltzer 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIf you fail your IPPT, and do not complete your RT sessions, you get charged. You get a letter telling you to go to CMPB in no.3 or no.4.
You basically get interviewed by an officer, and then charged.
For the first offense, it can be a warning or a fine. Subsequent offenses the fine goes up to like $300+. 5th offense I think you go to DB. 
Also, here are some things which you can do to avoid being charged.
1) you can extend your RT period by 1 month. Ask the PTI at the training centers on how to do it. 
2) You can call your unit and get them to waive the charge. Case by case basis. I just did this, as I couldnt do all my RT last window due to work and school.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (9)STOMP stealing Reddit content and watermarking Redditor's photos (details in comments)  by  damnshiokin  singapore[+]Dreamwaltzer 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Dreamwaltzer 7 points8 points9 points 1 day agohttp://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2012/06/stomped.html
This was the issue that showed that STOMP was more interested in getting sensationalist stories rather then actuall content.
There was a separate incident where it was revealed that most of the staff which stomp hired are PRC's. (Which of course the xenophobic stomp community took the chance to bash em for all sorts of stuff)
