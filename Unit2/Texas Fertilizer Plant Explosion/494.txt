Bioshock is a really good story-based fps, warcraft 3 is an rts that has stood the test of time and is still somewhat relevant. Diablo 2 is a great hack-and-slash rpg that is still played today. DA:O is an amazing evolution of the DnD style rpg. Minecraft is... minecraft. 
If you want a better taste of true rts gameplay and dont mind playing a bit of an older game, I would substitute the first Star Craft for WC3.

The playstation might be a whole different ball-game.
