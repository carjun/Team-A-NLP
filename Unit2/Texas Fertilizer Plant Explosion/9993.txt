Yes, "temporary hearing loss" as in, takes a month or few to recover and chance of never fully recovering hearing range.
edit: update - thankfully it appears no perforated drums for either as an individual mentioned the child was on the today show

permalinksaveparent[+]batman9513 137 points138 points139 points 5 months ago  (20 children)[–]batman9513 137 points138 points139 points 5 months agoThey really are. Took me about a month and a half to get full hearing back after I perforated my eardrum. Hurts like a bitch too.

permalinksaveparent[+]peekoooz 15 points16 points17 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]peekoooz 15 points16 points17 points 5 months agoI got kicked in the head in a swimming pool when I was ~13 and the water rushing into my hear ruptured my eardrum.  The ENT I went to said 1/5 of my eardrum was missing.  It grew back, and I did have some hearing loss for a while, but as far as I can tell my hearing is fine now.
It was the second most painful thing I've experienced, following my broken tailbone.  I'm lucky I was able to get out of the pool because I couldn't tell which way was up and no one was paying attention to me.  I crawled out of the pool and fell over on the concrete because I had no balance.  It was miserable and the doctors couldn't do anything to treat it or and didn't do anything for the pain.  They just looked at it and sent me home.  I'm paranoid about swimming with other people now, even though it was a "freak accident" type thing – his foot hit me at just the right wrong angle.
I can't imagine being near a blast like this and potentially having both ears impacted by it.  I'm dizzy just thinking about it.

permalinksaveparent[+]stufoonoob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]stufoonoob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoFuck, that's absolutely terrifying. So based on the fact that your sense of balance is centralized in your ears, is that what got thrown all out of whack? 

permalinksaveparent[+]Oxide42 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago* (3 children)[–]Oxide42 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago*As someone whose eardrums have been perforated three times in my life, all due to water damage (twice healing naturally; the last time having a paper patch applied), I can say balance/equilibrium was never an issue for myself. But according to Wikipedia, it's not unheard of, even though it's not a common side effect. I'd imagine his disorientation came mainly from being kicked in the head underwater. Being kicked in the head in just about any location would probably make me lose my bearings for a second, I'd think.  

permalinksaveparent[+]stufoonoob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]stufoonoob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAh gotcha, ok that makes sense. I was gonna say, could you imagine being perfectly aware but essentially drunk in a pool because you can't control your balance? Terrifying. 

permalinksaveparent[+]krunchitize 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]krunchitize 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWhen you got the patch did they have to poke/scrape your eardrum to make it bleed on the patch to assist healing?  That was the most painful thing I have ever experienced.

permalinksaveparent[+]Oxide42 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Oxide42 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoNo, he just dipped it into some sort of solution and stuck it on there. It was my last perforation (probably about 10 years ago), and it was a very clean one - no redness or irritation, which isn't typically the case. I could instantly hear a little more after he put the patch on, and over the next few weeks it got back to about normal.

permalinksaveparent[+]starlinguk 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]starlinguk 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHave you asked a doctor if it can be repaired? My cousin had many ruptured ear drums due to infections and he's had an operation to sort it out.

It makes me wonder how any vet who's seen combat has any ability to hear.

permalinksaveparent[+]mynameishere 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]mynameishere 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIf you get a busted eardrum from an ear infection it's actually a great relief from pain.  But you lose the all the high notes from music for quite a while.

permalinksaveparent[+]Ausgeflippt 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Ausgeflippt 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoI've perforated my right eardrum twice.
The first time was during diving training when my BCV had a bad fill valve that stuck open and I shot from two atmospheres of pressure to less than one (was well above sea-level) very rapidly. Immediate rupture of the right eardrum. My hearing was always a little off and the ear didn't clear well after that. Sometimes stuff sounded like the adults in Peanuts. Wah wah wah wah wahhh.
The second time was fairly recently when I got a really nasty ear infection, the antibiotics didn't help, and the eardrum wound up rupturing due to fluid buildup. It was so incredibly loud and sudden. It startled the shit out of me. I saw a doctor a couple hours later when their office opened, they saw that it was ruptured, they took a culture and sent me on my way with cephalexin. I had to go to Maryland (3000 miles away) a few days later and they wound up calling my home phone (against my specific instructions to call my cell) and leaving a message that I actually had a very bad staph infection and that they were prescribing Cipro immediately. I didn't get that message for over a week. Thankfully it cleared up. I don't like the idea of stuff in my body going septic.
Oddly enough, after the second rupture healed (took about 6 weeks), my hearing is better than it was before the first one with tests to confirm, and it clears much easier.
Moral of the story- protect your ears. Ruptures are a bitch.

permalinksaveparent[+]Bloodplz_k_thankslul 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]Bloodplz_k_thankslul 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoGreat, now I feel like an huge asshole for chuckling when the kid kept saying get out of here. 

permalinksaveparent[+]whosthedoginthisscen 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]whosthedoginthisscen 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI'm feeling like an ass for thinking "I'm going to post 'turn the damn phone horizontally, noob!'".  Then that poor kid started freaking.  I feel bad for what that dad must be feeling about endangering his kid, but I'm also fucking mad at that dad for endangering his kid!

permalinksaveparent[+]ThePegasi 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago* (0 children)[–]ThePegasi 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago*I used to get them from time to time when I was kid cause I was constantly getting ear infections. Apparently I'm lucky that my hearing is fine now, doctors reckoned it quite likely that I'd end up partially deaf. Hope the folks in the video do recover fully. That kid screaming that they couldn't hear was really horrible, can't even imagine how terrifying an experience like that must have been.

permalinksaveparent[+]LauraPa1mer 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]LauraPa1mer 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI currently have a perforated eardrum and I can confirm that it was extremely painful and not being able to hear properly is frustrating.  I hope my hearing goes back to normal eventually.  

permalinksaveparent[+]Snotdoc 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Snotdoc 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThis is correct. The good news is that the vast majority will heal on their own. Also people get what's called a temporary threshold shift which is essentially a temporary hearing loss. Well,  hopefully temporary... Similar to what you experience after leaving a loud concert. Source: I'm an ear nose and throat throat doctor.

permalinksaveparent[+]nropotdetcidda 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]nropotdetcidda 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI have hearing problems from an explosion when I was a teen. Blew out both my ear drums and I constantly get ear infections. Not to mention anything with bass hurts like hell. Music, forget about it, when you have an war infection it's waaaaaaay worse too. I've had multiple surgeries to repair and have around 60% hearing in my left ear, although that's the one that hurts the most and gets infected often. I have about 40% hearing in my right ear. 
I hate talking to people because I constantly keep asking "what"? Or the equivalent and it annoys the shit out of people. Most think I'm ignoring them when I don't respond. I constantly have to sniff to regulate the pressure in my ears so it doesn't hurt all the time. People must think I'm a huge coke addict, but it is a habit that I don't even realize I do it anymore. Others contribute it to allergies and don't say anything. 
Totally tone deaf too. Karaoke night sucks so I just blame it on the a a a a alcohol.
