Published on Oct 17, 2013



In 1903, drivers of newfangled automobiles decided the hard, packed sand of Ormond Beach might be the perfect spot to see just how fast a car could go. 110 years later and about 10 miles away, Daytona International Speedway has become hallowed ground for racing fans. And in some ways, the best time to visit is when there isn't a race on — you can stand on the track, sign the start-finish line, tour the garage and see all the areas that are closed during a race. Cross the ground where Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison had their infamous fight in 1979. Or stand in the spot on Victory Lane where Dale Earnhardt Sr. celebrated a victory that defined a generation. But if history isn't your thing, sign up for the Richard Petty Driving Experience and get behind the wheel for a few turns around the track.
