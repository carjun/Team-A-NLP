	A member of the NRA since 1975, Adolphus Busch IV resigned from the gun rights organization one day after it helped defeat Senate legislation mandating background checks for those who purchase firearms.

	This bud’s not for the NRA.

	One day after the United States Senate failed to pass background check legislation for firearm sales, Adolphus Busch IV, the heir to the Anheuser-Busch beer fortune, abruptly terminated his membership to the NRA.

	In a forceful letter to NRA President David Keene, Busch expressed his dismay that the organization had worked so diligently to defeat the background check bill, KSDK reported.

	"I fail to see how the NRA can disregard the overwhelming will of its members who see background checks as reasonable," Busch wrote.

	An avid hunter, Busch joined the NRA in 1975, but after watching its political dealings in the ongoing debate over new gun regulations following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the former CEO said he had seen enough.

Bush resigned from the NRA in a letter to the group's president, David Keene.  

	"The NRA I see today has undermined the values upon which it was established," Busch wrote. "Your current strategic focus clearly places priority on the needs of gun and ammunition manufacturers while disregarding the opinions of your 4 million individual members."

	In a statement to the Huffington Post, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said, "We disagree with his characterization, but we wish him all the best."

	No stranger to the politics of the boardroom, Busch zeroed in on the reason why the NRA has acted to thwart any and all legislative attempts to enact new gun laws.

	"One only has to look at the makeup of the 75-member board of directors, dominated by manufacturing interests, to confirm my point,” Busch wrote. “The NRA appears to have evolved into the lobby for gun and ammunition manufacturers rather than gun owners."

	Busch, whose great-grandfather founded Anheuser-Busch, instructed Keene to “immediately” remove his name from all membership roles, KSDK reported.
