Rescuers
have ended their search for survivors following the devastating
fertilizer explosion in West this week that killed at least 14 people
and injured 200.Texas
Gov. Rick Perry announced Friday afternoon that the search and rescue
operation has ended now that responders have found 14 bodies. At least
11 emergency responders are presumed dead after the massive explosion
and blaze at the West Fertilizer Co. facility near Waco.Sen.
John Cornyn said earlier Friday that 60 people remain unaccounted for,
but officials have now downplayed that number. Officials said this
afternoon that people were put on a list of those missing if friends and
family couldn’t reach them. Most of them are probably alive and staying
with friends and family, officials said.Meanwhile,
the owner of West Fertilizer Co. broke his silence Friday and expressed
his “heartfelt sympathy for those affected.” Donald Adair said he
pledged to help solve what caused the blast and prevent it from
happening again in any community.Adair
praised the first responders “who died trying to protect all of us” and
said the incident will be something he will never get over. At
an afternoon news conference, Perry called the damage in West “pretty
stunning.” The fertilizer facility had at least 540,000 pounds of
ammonium nitrate, Texas Health Department records show. That is 100
times more than what was used in the Oklahoma City bombing 18 years ago
Friday. Chris
Barron, the executive director of the State Firemen's & Fire
Marshals' Association of Texas, said his organization has calculated
that 11 first responders died in West.They
are five West volunteer firefighters, a retired firefighter who
assisted West, a Dallas Fire-Rescue captain who lived in the town and
four emergency medical technicians, Barron said. He said some bodies
recovered haven't been identified yet.Texas
Department of Public Safety Sgt. Jason Reyes said the bodies were found
"in the area" of the facility that exploded. He did not say how many
were found at the explosion site and how many were recovered from
surrounding buildings. Mayor Pro-tem Steve Vanek confirmed that five of
West's 33 firefighters, including the city secretary, died in the
explosion.Many
victims are still in hospitals. Five patients, including three in
critical condition, remain in Scott & White hospitals in Temple.
Eighteen patients are still in Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center Scott
& White Healthcare in Waco. Eight have been released from that
hospital.As
rescuers still search for people alive in the rubble, West residents
forced to evacuate the town haven’t been allowed yet to see what remains
of their homes. State officials were expected to tour the damage area
Friday afternoon. State
Rep. Kyle Kacal said he understood residents want to see their homes
but said, "What everyone needs to remember: prayers and patience."Kacal said he had lots of people ask him to check on their homes when he toured the site.Sen.
Ted Cruz, who joined Cornyn on the morning tour, declined to discuss
whether buildings and houses in West were built too close to the
fertilizer facility. The site opened in 1962."We
need to allow time for a careful investigation of what occurred. We all
want to know what happened here," Cruz said. "It would be a mistake to
rush to a conclusion."Cornyn said he expects there will be a review of the facility’s close proximity to homes and schools."I'm
confident there will be exactly the kind of review you're talking about
on the local level, state level and the federal level,” he said. “We
have authorities from all of those jurisdictions here in place."The ATF will begin investigating the blast area Friday to collect debris and other evidence that may point to a cause.The deceased have been transported to the Dallas County Medical Examiner's office for identification.Twenty-five
buildings have yet to be cleared by the search and rescue teams.
 Local, state and federal officials were expected to meet Friday to
devise a plan for allowing residents back into the area affected by the
blast.Multiple
obstacles must be overcome before people can live in the area. Some
bodies sill must be recovered, and buildings need to be inspected to
make sure they are structurally sound, officials said. With at least 175
buildings in the blast zone, that will take time."We don't even have water out there right now," said Mayor Pro-Tem Steve Vanek.By the numbers200 injuries reported150 buildings destroyed50 buildings cleared by search and rescue teams25 buildings yet to be cleared3 fire trucks destroyed1 EMS vehicle destroyed
