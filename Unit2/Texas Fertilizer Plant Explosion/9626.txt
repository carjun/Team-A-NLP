My last purchase was a Mossberg 590A1 and now my gun safe is full, but I think there is still space left for a revolver.  by  Lokarnin  guns[+]Lokarn[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes ago  (0 children)[–]Lokarn[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes agoThanks. I recently got my Swiss citizenship so I haven't served yet since it's only been one month that I got it.
The P210 is an excellent pistol, my only problem is that mine is chambered in 7,65 Para and getting ammo for it outside the range is hard and expensive.

I had to wait 3 months to finally get some Remington .22lr High Velocity ammo for my Ruger, since it's the cheapest I find in Switzerland.
The only problem is that some ammo is incredibly expensive, for example I can only find non-corrosive ammo for my Mosin and it costs 30 dollars for 20 rounds.

I keep thinking of what I should buy next, I had to take some control over myself during the last couple of months...
But now the safe is practically full and I've decided to stop buying new stuff for a while.

My last purchase was a Mossberg 590A1 and now my gun safe is full, but I think there is still space left for a revolver.  by  Lokarnin  guns[+]Lokarn[S] 2 points3 points4 points 55 minutes ago  (0 children)[–]Lokarn[S] 2 points3 points4 points 55 minutes agoI started my collection in February of 2013, I've been using my guns regularly at the local range and I've finally found an hobby that is fun and interesting.
My first 3 guns were the Ruger 10/22, the Glock 19 and the Norinco, I'm unhappy with the Norinco since I can't find any mags for it, and I think I just bought it because I was still a newbie and didn't have much knowledge of what was important when buying a firearm.
After a short pause I bought a K31 for accuracy shooting at the local state endorsed gun club (Feldschiessen) and I've had a blast with this rifle, the diopter sights make it even more fun to shoot with.
I then bought the P210 and the CZ 75 (which is my favorite pistol so far), and after searching for a while I finally found a Mosin Nagant from 1943 (which was my dream rifle since I was a kid).
Now I finally bought my first shotgun, I decided to get a Mossberg 590A1 and so far it's incredibly fun to shoot. I might get some addons for it later this year.

I think it was more of a "earn your right to get presents" thing.

If we didn't do it we would not get any presents.
I never understood why we did it, only the kids in the family had to do it and it would stop once you were too old to get presents.

I had my gunsmith put these on my K31, I only paid for the sights, the rifle was free since he sold me all for the price of the sights only.

But by making a new rifling in the barrel wouldn't it mean that you removed material and now the barrel has a bigger diameter? Would this work with any rifle out there?

Nope. There are very informative and helpful boards that are way superior to the subreddits about the same stuff on Reddit.

Edit: Yep, it's not common at all, it's just about isolated cases of nutjobs.
Reddit sensationalism strikes again!
