I looked through the law and I found that if the pharmacy has a out of state fill plan filed with the DPS they can do it. A few such pharmacies existed in 2010, but I'm having trouble tracking them down now. I posted the law in a reply above.

By the way, do towns like Dallas or Fort Worth have less strict policies about c2? It seems like since it is state laws it would be about the same everywhere. 
Best of luck to you!

If this is the most pathetic drug fishing you've ever seen you must live a pretty sheltered life. I used to drive through detroit and flint michigan every month, crazy shit. 
I have a prescription, take it responsibly, have worked with the same doctor twice a month for the past 4 years to help manage my ADHD and depression that I've struggled with since I was little. I'm not sorry that I want to continue a treatment that has helped me significantly, and part of that is getting my medication and trying to stay with the same doctor. Have an upvote anyways.

But I'm sure you and a lot of other people here are better informed than me.

I am looking at getting a doctor here, but I have worked with this doctor for the past four years. And yes what you have with your doctor would be ideal. I am a couple hours away, but I would make the drive every three months. 
Thank you very much for both the reply and the pharmacy suggestion, I will call tomorrow. Appreciate it mate.

Thank you, it is sad that this is so difficult, but people like you that don't treat patients like we're all criminals really make things better. 
I will figure something out! Best of luck to you.

§13.82. Pharmacy Responsibility – Out-of-State Practitioner. (a) If a pharmacist in this state 
receives a prescription, that is not on an official prescription form, that is for a Schedule II 
controlled substance, and that is issued by a practitioner in another state, the pharmacy may fill 
the prescription if: 
 (1) the practitioner is authorized by the other state to prescribe the substance; 
 (2) the pharmacy has a plan approved by and on file with the director allowing the 
activity; and 
 (3) the pharmacy processes and submits the prescription according to the 
reporting requirements approved in the plan. 
(b) The approval of the plan will run concurrently with the pharmacy's registration.
I've read about pharmacies that have said plan filed with the DPS, that is what I'm searching for, but it seems like most of them just think it isn't worth the risk.
Thank you very much for the reply

Told to get a local doctor, bummer. I will get started on that on monday I guess, could be a couple weeks before I get in. It is my fault for not researching this earlier.

I will do this on monday if I can't locate a pharmacy with an out of state plan.
