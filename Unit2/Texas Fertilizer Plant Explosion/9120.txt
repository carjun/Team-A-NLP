CHECK OUT THE FINISHED PRODUCT HERE:  http://goo.gl/PSnwQDownload our full-length album R.E.V.O. here: smarturl.it/revoThis is the unedited version of the video for our first single RED HANDS! The song is all chopped up to achieve the final speed-ramped video.We hooked up with the talented director Ellis Bahl to create this. We like to push the boundaries of music and film and when Ellis called us with this insane idea, we knew we had found a brother from another mother!We hope this puts to rest any critics who think the original was shot in multiple takes!Please help us out by:- Hitting the "LIKE" button.- Adding this to your Favorites- Sharing this video on Facebook and Twitter.- Subscribing to this channel.Thanks for all the Love. WOTE fans are truly amazing people. You guys make us soo stoked on making music!See you soon.WOTE
