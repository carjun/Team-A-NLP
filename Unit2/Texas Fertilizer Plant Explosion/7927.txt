We pulled up the security footage and saw a 5 or 6 year old kid, make a b-line right for the fire alarm and reach up and pull it. No hesitation, no curiosity, just ran across the lobby and jumped up and pulled it. Of course the (very young) parent just grabbed the kid and walked out.

That's part of why you have so many kids going back home after college. I have 2 siblings, I am the only one who chose to go 2 year for a blue collar job (literally, I wear navy dickies work wear), and they went 4 year with white collar, and now I'm the only one with a job. And I do pretty damn well for myself.
