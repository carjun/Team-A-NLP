What are her stances on the issues. I mean other then abortion. We know her feelings on that. Anyone have a break down list?

Issue Positions:

Veterans -- Our Nation's Heroes: As a member of the Senate Committee on Veteran Affairs & Military Installations, Senator Davis is a recognized champion on behalf of our nation's heroes living in Texas. Senator Davis helped create the "Veteran's Cash" $2 scratch-off lottery ticket that provides funding for veteran services in Texas, such as counseling services and job placement assistance. In 2011, Senator Davis advanced several bills into law supporting veterans living in Texas. A bill that she co-authored and was later approved by voters in November 2011 now extends property tax exemptions for 100 percent disabled veterans to a surviving spouse of the veteran. Senator Davis also championed a law that protects veterans funding, ensuring that money dedicated to veteran services is not "swept away" to help balance the state's budget. In her first legislative session in 2009 she co-authored a bill that created Veteran's Courts in Texas -- which are diversion programs for veterans suffering from combat-related head injuries or post traumatic stress disorders who are facing low-level criminal charges in our court system. The programs have given many veterans a second chance.
Easing Family Budgets: Senator Davis continues to lead the charge against predatory lending in Texas, an industry that siphons money from our local economies and keeps many hard-working families trapped in a cycle of debt. She also fights hard to lower homeowners insurance and residential electricity rates to put more money back in Texans' family budgets, offering several pieces of legislation that shift the balance of power from these industries to consumers. She is fighting the industry's efforts to target our military servicemembers and their spouses who are financial vulnerable. Senator Davis works closely with the Christian Life Commission (Baptist General Convention of Texas), the Conference of Catholic Bishops, dozens of ministers in the Metroplex, AARP, NAACP, LULAC, and other groups advocating stronger consumer protection to put in place fair rules and oversight of these lending products. Under her leadership, this coalition is working to advance legislation that creates oversight of the payday and car title lending industry that currently exploits a loophole in Texas law. Senator Davis is also working tirelessly to lower homeowners insurance and residential electricity rates to put more money back in Texans' family budgets so they are not left with only high interest credit cards and predatory loans to balance their family budget.
Education: Senator Davis believes providing an excellent public education system is the state's most-important responsibility. While most lawmakers were mired in so-called "emergency" bills in 2011, Senator Davis made education funding her emergency. Education is the path to success for all Texas families, preparing our children for college, workforce training, and a competitive job market to support a strong Texas economy for generations. Senator Davis is committed to fighting for all schoolchildren, so that they will benefit from the opportunities that public education can provide. On behalf of thousands of parents, educators and business owners who contacted the Senate District 10 Office, Senator Davis took a stand against deep funding cuts forced by the powerful special interests and the failed legislative majority. She even filibustered a fiscal bill at the end of the regular 82nd Legislative Session that would cause harm to our public schools and hurt Texas' ability to keep and attract jobs.
Job Creation -- Economic Stability: Job creation, job retention and stability for local economies are priorities for Senator Wendy Davis. Authoring legislation to spur job growth in local economies and keep jobs in Texas instead of shipping them out of state. Senator Davis is a recognized leader in the Texas Senate for her work on job creation and economic stability, authoring legislation to create and retain jobs.
Truth In Budgeting, Honesty With Taxpayers: Texas taxpayers deserve the truth about how their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent. For years, the majority in the legislature has claimed to "balance" the state budget, using "smoke and mirror" tactics to support that claim. Last session, Senator Davis fought the diversion of over $5 billion of funds that were collected from taxpayers for a specific purpose, and yet were diverted to the general fund to balance the budget, a diversion that betrayed Texas taxpayers' expectations that money collected for a specific purpose should be used for that purpose.

permalinksaveparent[+]danintexas 33 points34 points35 points 1 day ago  (37 children)[–]danintexas 33 points34 points35 points 1 day agoThank you for this list. After going over it - I am not seeing to much to go on - but from what I can see she is a hard left liberal. Not something that lines up with my libertarian small government views. I do wish you well if she is the one you want to back. I just ask to every one reading to make sure she lines up the best on all issues important to you. Not just that she did a filibuster for the abortion of an abortion bill. I just really don't want to see the far right christian GOP party continue ruling in this state. 

permalinksaveparent[+]NF3RN0 14 points15 points16 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]NF3RN0 14 points15 points16 points 1 day agoWhile I don't agree with you on your "limited government" view. I think we can find some common ground on the idea that these far right christan GOP politicians need to go.

permalinksaveparent[+]firex726 16 points17 points18 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]firex726 16 points17 points18 points 1 day agoSame, she may not line up 100% with my views, but she'd have to work pretty hard to be worse than the borderline Theocracy that the right seems to want to institute. 

permalinksaveparent[+]libsysguy[S] 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (29 children)[–]libsysguy[S] 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoI agree that the list is not the best form of information.  Also, while I am not entirely on board with the small government libertarian movement;  I can certainly respect that we need to oust the far right christian GOP.  While I think what she did on the senate floor was great, it's certainly no tmy only motivating factor for wanting to vote for her.

permalinksaveparent[+]digital_darkness 8 points9 points10 points 1 day ago  (28 children)[–]digital_darkness 8 points9 points10 points 1 day agoCan you expand on that a bit? What is wrong with a smaller government? If it were up to you, how large would government be? I only ask because you guys aren't yelling for the libertarian to die at the stake : ) 
I am honestly curious as to how you think, I am not being a troll.

permalinksaveparent[+]jcpuf 10 points11 points12 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]jcpuf 10 points11 points12 points 1 day agoI'm not against small government, I just don't trust it when it's brought up in politics. It seems to be a bone that dishonest politicians wave around to attract well-meaning white dudes to vote for them, then they cut services to poor/black/female people and say "look at how small we're making government," while not actually fighting against all the stuff (huge war spending, spying, corruption etc) that people are actually concerned about.
The Tea Party started out libertarian and today it continues to talk libertarian while being retarded. That's unfortunate for actual libertarians, who I hope will take back the idea. We could use some actual conservatism in the country, somewhere.

permalinksaveparent[+]libsysguy[S] 8 points9 points10 points 1 day ago  (7 children)[–]libsysguy[S] 8 points9 points10 points 1 day agoAt the risk of being crucified, I'll do my best to explain in a TL;DR version.
While I don't believe there is anything terribly wrong with smaller government, I think that there does need to be an entity with oversight.  I don't really trust a company that is sheerly out for profit to be looking out for my best interest as a consumer.  My best example are the telecoms/ISP's.  
I believe that if there is a genuine community effort to better itself, it will be successful.  That is most certainly a utopian idea. Similarly, capitalism should work in a perfect world.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a utopia and we must come up with this balance of oversight to capitol freedom.  I am not in favor of massive tax rates so the government will brush my teeth for me.  I am in favor of combining resources across our country to offer the best possible solutions.  
I hope that was at least somewhat coherent.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on libertarianism and what you favor in regards to smaller government.
Also, I apologize to the mods if this is off-topic.  Please don't ban me :)

permalinksaveparent[+]txanarchy 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago  (6 children)[–]txanarchy 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoJust so you know telecoms/ISP's enjoy government granted monoplies. Don't blame the market for problems created by the government.
And for the record our society and everything you use was built by for profit companies. Profits are not evil; the are essential to all businesses to determine efficiency and how well they are serving their customers. Without them you could not have anything you enjoy now.

permalinksaveparent[+]Nymaz 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]Nymaz 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago
Profits are not evil

Seriously you know when you do that you are reducing the other person's argument to a ridiculous strawman that reflects worse on you then on the other person.  You remind me of a Republican accusing the Democrats of being commie nazis that hate mompie and freedom apples.
Profit isn't evil?  Well duh of course not.  It's a great motivator and as you've pointed out a lot of innovation is due to profit motive (although again, saying that without profit motivation, "you could not have anything you enjoy now" is overly simplistic).  However, when societal benefit conflicts with profit, when profit is your sole motivation then it's going to win.  You can call that evil, but I call that simple logic.  And that conflict is why liberals believe that certain parts of society should either be non-profit, or profit but overseen by non-profit actors.  Do you think we should have a socialized fire protection as we do now?  Or do you think that when your house is on fire, it'd be the best outcome if a company pulls up and negotiates with you while you're under duress?  Think that will never happen?  Also if you think about it from a pure profit stance, a private firefighting company would benefit from more fires, so they logically would do all they can to discourage fire safety, including paying off companies to produce appliances that tend to overheat.  Not doing so would be "evil" towards their stockholders by cheating them out of profit.  Again, if you don't think that will happen, guess who is the biggest lobbyists towards keeping our war on drugs so ridiculous so that a person smoking a joint in their own house can get a longer prison sentence than someone convicted of rape/murder? Hint, it's the private prison industry.
So in short, luxuries should be a fully profit-driven marketplace, but necessities should either be non-profit, or for-profit overseen by non-profit actors.  And while people can honestly debate where things fall in the necessity/luxury category, I can't see how a non-sociopath can logically disagree with this basis.

Just so you know telecoms/ISP's enjoy government granted monoplies. Don't blame the market for problems created by the government.

Ehh. The monopoly is not entirely because of government intervention but more of a result of the cost of doing business being high.
Namely, Time Warner (or whichever cable company serves your town) doesn't have a monopoly because your municipality has an ordinance on the books granting them one. 
It boils down to the physical wires. TWC is a monopoly because they built and/or bought the wires that connect the houses. Because it is not in their best interest and neither are they required to do so, TWC blocks competitors from re-using the last-mile wires to service households.
The only place local government comes into play is they, and to be honest somewhat reasonably so, put restrictions on who can lay down new cabling. So even if Comcast wanted to shoulder the largely prohibitive cost of dragging the last mile cabling, they would probably not get the permits to do so.
Honestly the monopoly is more natural than government enforced, but local governments are certainly helping the monopoly.
Simply allowing anyone to drag more cable (by removing the regulations that prevent it) won't solve the problem as we already have an example of that happening: Verizon FiOs has to drag brand new cable since they provide fiber-to-the-home. The rollout is taking forever and is going to result in them owning a fiber monopoly in the towns they wire up (I'm not too angry about it, Verizon does deserve to recoup their investment and tearing up the streets/laws to drag cable for another company is unreasonable and redundant).
IMHO the only way we'll ever see the monopolies break is if the government buys the cabling and treats them like roads, granting equal access to businesses that wish to service customers.

And for the record our society and everything you use was built by for profit companies. Profits are not evil; the are essential to all businesses to determine efficiency and how well they are serving their customers. Without them you could not have anything you enjoy now.

For the record I don't think anyone is arguing against profits (at least not in this thread and not in American politics in general). The disconnect I've noticed between you, a small government libertarian, and me, a smart government progressive; is that I view the government as all of us doing something for ourselves (as opposed to an entity doing something to me) that we can utilize to our advantage. I don't want big government, I want smart government who steps away where they're not needed (I don't need government built electronics, Apple is doing quite well thank you and I don't begrudge them a single penny in profit) and steps in where they are (I know you disagree, but I believe healthcare is a mess that would be more cheaply provided if the basics were served centrally).

permalinksaveparent[+]NF3RN0 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]NF3RN0 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI will try and explain with examples. I like a government that has a small military or at least cut their budget, so if you would call that small a small government I would not be opposed to that. As long as veterans get their benefits. On another note I like the fact that government is at least trying to negociate with healthcare providers to make sure that there is no price fixing on healthcare just for the fact that they can charge more, or that they deny anyone healtcare because of a pre existing condition. I like when people get involved with politics and are passionate about it, but I disagree with yelling at people just because they do not see the same view. Yelling gets us nowhere, and that sucks that anyone of us has to deal with that BS.

permalinksaveparent[+]NuclearWookie 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago  (7 children)[–]NuclearWookie 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago
I ask you, are you actually being affected by any of these things?

I am very much being affected by the war on drugs. This shouldn't be too hard to comprehend: I pay taxes that are spent on an ever-more-militarized police force and keeping more people per capita in jail than in any other country. Furthermore, my right to do what I wish with my body is severely curtailed if I risk being locked in a rape cage for buying bags of plant matter. Of course, there's also the fact that drugs must be bought from shady characters and are of dubious purity.
The domestic spying also affects me. Knowing that I'm paying taxes so that the government can keep a dossier on me and all other citizens, with transcripts of our phone calls, e-mails, and who knows what else also creates a chilling effect on free speech. Then there's the extrajudicial executions: knowing that the President can now call out a hit on any citizen without any form of oversight scares the hell out of me.

I don't have a problem with the spying, because I have nothing to hide, and if it stops evil people from doing evil things I'm willing to sacrifice a little privacy. I'm not sure how free speech comes into the equation. 

permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]BookwormSkates -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day ago* (0 children)[–]BookwormSkates -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day ago*Yes, abuse of government power can be more extreme with big government.  Everything has its pros and cons.  But if you decentralize anything then you end up with a clusterfuck of disorganization with no standards.  Personally I'd rather trust large national-scale issues to a large national-scale government.  Just because big government can do wrong doesn't mean its a guaranteed bad idea.  

permalinksaveparent[+]YaDunGoofed -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]YaDunGoofed -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoA Government needs to be as big as it needs to be to effectively control against negative externalities. What those are depends on society and you the voter.
Ergo, if you have a good reason for not wanting the government supervising part of society that's up to you, but when you wantonly attack it for being big, bad, inefficient, unchristian etc with no logical/economical backing then I have a problem.
EDIT: Good Question!

Though 9 years of city counsel are good for a Senator, 1 1/2 terms in state office seems awful short to go Governor. 

permalinksaveparent[+]swxrice 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago* (1 child)[–]swxrice 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago*Rick Perry was in the House from 1985-91, Ag Commissioner from 1991-99, Lt Governor 1999-2000, and Governor since.
GW Bush's first ever election win was the governorship in 1994 (dream big?)
Ann Richards was Commissioner of Travis County from 1977-83, State Treasurer from 1983-91, and Governor 1991-95
Bill Clements was a Deputy Secretary of Defense under Nixon and Ford from 1973-77 and Governor from 1979-83 and 1987-1991.
Mark White was Secretary of State of Texas from 1973-77, Attorney General from 1979-83, and Governor from 1983-87 between Clements's terms.
In summary, since 1980, there is no real correlation between experience in holding office and being elected governor. Bush and Clements hadn't won an election before becoming Governors of Texas. White, Richards, and Perry all had decent state resumés before making it to the mansion.
Edit: typo

permalinksaveparent[+]MaxTheLiberalSlayerborn and bred 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago  (0 children)[–]MaxTheLiberalSlayerborn and bred 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoI know this will sound very silly, but Texas Senators tend not to vote against each others bills.  Call it courtesy. To the general public I know that seems very strange.  
The real fight is when the motion to suspend the rules takes place to get past the "blocker bill".  With a blocker bill at the top of the regular order of business, at least two-thirds of the senators present must vote to begin debating a measure before it can come to the floor.  Bills that do not enjoy substantial support cannot make it past the blocker bill.  So since the real fight takes place on suspension of the rules and once that is done a bills passage is almost guaranteed.

Looking over her - I would really caution my democrat fellow Texans to really go all out with this lady. I am not a democrat - I am not a republican - I am a libertarian - but the thought of Abbott frightens me. I just would like to see another strong candidate put forward to choose from and as of right now - I do not see that with Davis. That may change the more I learn about her though.

permalinksaveparent[+]lashazior 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (14 children)[–]lashazior 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI'm not worried about them obtaining guns at a gun show. It's not as if the felons and/or mentally ill are going to not obtain guns somehow. Background check laws end up costing more time and money for the average good citizen and do more harm than good in that fashion. TBH, I'm more worried about them restricting the looser carry laws that we just passed. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Necoras 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (4 children)[–]Necoras 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoFood quality checks end up costing everyone more up front as well. Speed limits slow everyone down. The argument that "x regulation costs everyone more time/money so don't do it" isn't valid.
That said, regulation certainly can be overreaching and harmful to consumers. The recent post about hair braiding licenses is a clear demonstration of that.
What's necessary is an even handed, non biased look at what the goals of any proposed regulation are and how those goals can be met with the least amount of inconvenience to everyone who will have to deal with them. I'm not a gun person, so I can't say whether or not more background checks would be effective or not. Neither can I speak to how much of an inconvenience they would be. But simply saying "any regulation will be inconvenient to me personally, so there shouldn't be any at all" ends up hurting more people in the long run.

Food quality checks end up costing everyone more up front as well. Speed limits slow everyone down.

Food quality checks are important for everyone that wants to eat, and eating is an act of surviving. Not everyone obeys the speed limits and arguably people should get pulled over more often for general driving errors everyday (merging improperly for example)

The argument that "x regulation costs everyone more time/money so don't do it" isn't valid.

You truncated the part that mentioned me saying this hurts the average citizen's rights more often than not. Who's going to regulate background checks in the first place? How long should a background check take to begin with? Other states it already takes up to 30 days just to buy a gun and some have waiting periods between buying multiple guns. If I need to buy something right away, I expect to be able to. I'm sorry if you're not a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment but if silly people like these scumbags can buy stolen guns from people then I too should have decent access.

permalinksaveparent[+]Necoras -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]Necoras -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoSo your argument is that since things are available easily on the black market, there should be no attempt at regulation whatsoever?
I don't have an answer to any of your questions. I've not done any research into these issues, and I'm not going to spout off uneducated drivel. But I do know enough to call out a fallacious argument. You seem to argue that any regulation is too much regulation because it inconveniences lots of people.
I am not stating that you (or the general population) should have no access to guns. I am saying that there is a middle ground between 0 guns in the country and the ability to buy an RPG at the closest 7/11. Surely you agree with that? If so, then the discussion should be about where that middle ground lies. It is not irrational to call for a debate on that subject.

permalinksaveparent[+]lashazior 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]lashazior 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIt's not that I'm 100% against background checks. I'm 100% against slow background checks. The state government would have to open records in some form and fashion for FFL dealers. I'm sure it can be done in a fast manner but I'm just skeptical that it will be always accurate. Felons can almost easily just forge fake IDs and make themselves appear to be other people in the system. Currently there aren't any laws regarding mentally ill people from owning firearms but Iowa allows blind people to carry. It's a really fine line to fix.

permalinksaveparent[+]Bajonistaborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Bajonistaborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoAs someone who works in mental health, just how would we regulate that? Odds are everyone is mentally ill at some point in their life. Would there be a permanent restriction? How would we even begin to assess which conditions and how much threat of harm there is when we're limiting someone's rights? (Hint:research says even highly trained professionals aren't able to predict self harming or violent behavior.) Would they need to be cleared by a professional before they can own a gun again? Which professional is going to commit career suicide and sign that paper? (I sure won't!)
Mentally ill people are also more of a risk to themselves than they are to others, and access to a gun significantly increases the likelihood of death by suicide.

permalinksaveparent[+]argoATX  comment score below threshold  (5 children)[–]argoATX -8 points-7 points-6 points 1 day agoWhat you said was

I'm not worried about them obtaining guns at a gun show.

The implication thereof is that you think felons and the mentally ill buying guns at gun shows is 'just fine' at worst and 'a good thing' at best. Which part of this do you have a problem with? Is it the stupid shit coming out of your own mouth?

permalinksaveparent[+]monolith_blue 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (4 children)[–]monolith_blue 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoIncorrect, the implication is that it is a non issue. If I have no concern about what happens to an ant hill in West Texas. The destruction or expansion of said ant hill isn't either 'just fine' or 'a good thing', it simply isn't an issue. 
In this case, the argument is felons and the mentally ill will obtain weapons "somehow". Banning one possible way, out of many possible ways, for them to be acquired doesn't address the real problem. 
The real issues are how do we help the mentally ill, or those that are becoming mentally ill. Likewise, how do we reduce recidivism and prevent people from becoming criminals. 
Adding controls at gun shows solves neither of these issues.

permalinksaveparent[+]Bajonistaborn and bred 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]Bajonistaborn and bred 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoWhy is that a "real issue"? Don't get me wrong, I'd love it if we invested more in mental health care. Why can't we solve two problems at once?

permalinksaveparent[+]monolith_blue 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]monolith_blue 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoMental illness and criminality are more to the heart of the problem.
If there was some reliable and wide spread way to address the issue of mental illness, a Senator and many innocent bystanders aren't shot in Arizona. Mothers all over aren't drowning or dismembering their children. Elementary schools in the East and high schools in the West aren't getting stormed. A whole group of people are still alive and undigested in Milwaukee. James Brady is walking. Charles Manson is a singer-songwriter no one has heard of, but John Lennon is playing the Superbowl with Paul McCartney. Mental illness is the problem that needs to be addressed, not just the armed mentally ill.
Criminality desperately needs to be addressed. So many theories, so very little practice. Strain, labeling, social learning, subculture of crime, differential association, deterrence, reform, and yet crime rate is seen as going up. Local law enforcement is accused, and in some cases rightfully so, of fixing the numbers via inappropriate resolution. Then there is the criminality in the white collar realms that have led to world crisis. Plus the ultimate betrayal of the public trust, governmental corruption and criminal activity. 
Gun regulation? I'm not worried about it.

27.7% of crime guns are sourced from FFL holders who find gaps in the oversight of their sales. What you seem to be trying to say is that removing that stream of firearms would have no effect on the number of illegal firearms available or the number of guns available for criminal activity. That is the dumbest shit I've heard all day, you dumb bitch.

permalinksaveparent[+]monolith_blue -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]monolith_blue -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoYou make too many inferences.  FFL holders do not equate to gun show sales only. By saying weapons are obtained "somehow" would account not only for the 27.7% you sited, but the other 72.3% which you left out. 
All of which STILL doesn't address the very real issues of helping the mentally ill and reducing criminality. Perhaps you have an opinion on that?

I'm not trying to be condescending either, I worded it like that because the OP was saying "Why do people think she is superwoman". I was trying to be funny but in the wrong context I just look like an asshole. 
Here is a link regarding her anti-choice filibuster with really good video of how WE helped stop the bill temporarily by running out the clock.
Here is a link regarding her [filibuster](www.texasobserver.org/wendy-davis-last-hurrah/) against billions of dollars in cuts to education. This one also talks about her uphill battle to retain her seat. That leads me to the next link:
Which is her ability to win elections in districts that are gerrymandered to be red
Then there is the fact that she came from crushing poverty, was raised by a single mother, was a single mother living in a trailer by 19, put herself through law school, and became the American dream.
Or it could be the bills she's introduced for consumer protection
It could also be the bills designed for governmental transparency.
If you want more examples here are the bills she authored in 2011
And here are the bills she authored in 2013
Edit: Also, quick note, if you want to find out anything about her while doing a google search go to the advance search and have it only bring up articles before the filibuster regarding abortion. It'll weed out all the repeat stuff you've probably seen and bring up more topics.

He doesn't want to follow clean air efforts by the EPA. This appears to cater to coal power plants that don't want to spend money updating their process and equipment to more sensible standards.

This had to have been circa 2010.
I contacted his office through his website a number of times, at first just asking his office to explain the decision. Later I moved on to explaining why I thought it violated several aspects of the U.S. Constitution. I never received even a form reply. I probably sent in three or four requests over as many months.
I ultimately uncovered much of what you posted (thanks for collecting some of it here for others) and my hatred has grown deeper.

permalinksaveparent[+]Aaron215 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago  (5 children)[–]Aaron215 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoAs much as Glass is my definition of NOPE-NOPE-NOPE, I still won't stand for people saying voting their conscience is a "throwing away a vote". Seriously people.. We HAVE to stop saying this. Even if someone's conscience doesn't line up with mine, I'll never criticize them voting for a non R or D candidate if it's who they think will do the best job. And neither should you.

permalinksaveparent[+]Aaron215 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Aaron215 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoIt's not true, and it's an unfortunate side effect of having two parties seen as the only ones with a chance to win any given election. While everyone on Reddit would love to see FPtP replaced with a better system, it's what we've got until the people who got elected with it decide they want to lose their seat without a fight (Not happening).
A better way to fix this "waste of a vote" mindset is to stop saying that anything other than a D or R is a waste of a vote. It isn't. A Green or Libertarian has LITERALLY just as much of a chance at winning as a Democrat or Republican. A Constitution candidate or an independent candidate doesn't get a percentage of their actual votes counted. What matters are individuals just voting. I can guarantee you that your neighbor doesn't know Joe Republican any better than they know Joe Independent on a personal or even political stance level, but they do know that letter R. If they had the time and mindset to educate themselves on the candidates running (or at least the candidates on the ballot), instead of just the Democrat and Republican running, they would likely see they prefer someone else.
TL;DR: If we want to elect more than the Democrats and Republicans, we don't need to change how we count votes, just how we cast our ballots.

permalinksaveparent[+]Reddit_Wingman 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Reddit_Wingman 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoWell, if people donated and spread support and knowledge about her and what she'd do for Texas, she might have a fighting chance.

permalinksave[+]DB_McGee  comment score below threshold  (10 children)[–]DB_McGee -16 points-15 points-14 points 1 day agoI feel like the filibuster was just a publicity stunt leading up to this. It was said before she even accomplished it that it wouldn't prevent the bill from being passed. I just don't think most people would have a clue who she is if it weren't for that stunt. It's just not a reason for me to vote for her. 

permalinksave[+]Lorpius_Prime 10 points11 points12 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Lorpius_Prime 10 points11 points12 points 1 day agoOf course it was a publicity stunt.  But publicity stunts are one of the most effective tools for calling public attention to an issue.  
Furthermore, to have a chance at winning the governorship, a candidate needs to have good statewide recognition.  And Texas Democrats just don't have have many ways to raise the profile of any of their party members because they've been shut out of the State government for so long.  The filibuster may not make her a qualified candidate for governor, but it means she has the potential to actually win, which is more than most other Texas Democrats can claim right now, even if they did have better qualifications.

permalinksaveparent[+]mutatronborn and bred 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (8 children)[–]mutatronborn and bred 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoSometimes people do things in public life whether they think they will be successful or not. Usually that sort of action is called a protest, rather than a publicity stunt. Do you think everyone should just bend over and take it, and be quiet about it too?
One thing her fillibuster accomplished, and it was true filibuster, was to get people talking about what the legislature was doing, and why. Surely that's a good thing whether you're for or against what they did.
Another thing she did was to galvanize liberal and progressive opposition in Texas. I go to a liberal meetup group that usually meets twice a week. We had a good number of people before the filibuster, but we grew quite a lot in subsequent meetings. People are enthusiastic now because of Wendy Davis.
This is why they got her to run for governor whether she really has a chance to win. Texas gubernatorial elections come every mid-term. They are poorly attended compared to elections in presidential years, usually half as many people vote in mid-terms. But liberals are excited about Davis. She might be have the pull to get the Democratic vote to rival a presidential election. In my district, the 32nd, Pete Sessions got close to 80,000 in 2010, but his opponent got close to 100,000 in 2012. So if Davis could increase Democratic turnout by 60% or more, Pete Sessions might be out of a job. And that kind of thing could happen all down the line, in weaker Republican races.
So that's what Wendy Davis' "publicity stunt" did. Gregg Abbot has $22 million in his campaign fund, compared to Davis' $1 million. What do you call that?

permalinksaveparent[+]Nerobus 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (8 children)[–]Nerobus 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoWhat I mean is it's probably not a great idea to vote without examining the issues in a non-bias mature way.  
It's just a bad idea in general to vote based on ONE parameter like pro-life.  You could wind up with an impassible fence through your yard one day (ask my grandpa who has lost access to half of his property thanks to the border fence)... what made it worse was he voted for the d-bags that caused that fence to be there in the first place.  
I know this is the internet, and the first instinct is to jump to insults and broad sweeping gestures, but I just hope not as many people do that in real life as I see online :P that would suck. 

permalinksaveparent[+]txanarchy  comment score below threshold  (7 children)[–]txanarchy -9 points-8 points-7 points 1 day ago*I don't normally vote for Democrats or Republicans. And I espejcially don't vote for abortionist. I will, however, give money to anyone that can keep an abortionist out of office. And before anyone starts any shit its not for religious reasons. I'm an atheist. 
Edit: You know what, it's not so much her stance on abortion it's the fact that she wants to give taxpayer money to organizations that perform them. That's what really pisses me off. I really don't care if someone has an abortion or not but I don't want my money paying for it.

permalinksaveparent[+]Nerobus 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (6 children)[–]Nerobus 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoBecause those clinics also are the top providers of cancer screenings for women in Texas.  Planned Parenthood's business is pretty much pregnancy prevention first.   
That being said, I completely agree that our tax money for these sorts of things needs to be reevaluates.  I can't believe that equal tax money in Texas is split between clinics that provide a ton of non-abortion based services also goes to crisis centers that provide zero medical advice or services, and simply give out pregnancy tests to scared young people, then supplies them misinformation.  Some of the information they give is useful, but I disapprove of how they represent birth control and sexual education.  I think they should be held to the same standard and spend the majority of their funds on ACTUAL education and proven effective pregnancy prevention, like open access to birth control, and cancer screening.  I would say with those additions, then those shared tax dollars would be worth my money.

permalinksaveparent[+]txanarchy 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (5 children)[–]txanarchy 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThey shouldn't get any money from taxpayers. If those organizations are so important then they shouldn't have any problem raising money from charitable donations. If people truly believe in them then they should donate their money to support them, not force other people to pay for them with tax dollars. That applies to any private organization. Tax dollars are for funding the government not private enterprise. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Nerobus 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Nerobus 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThis sentiment doesn't hold up.  Example, look at public schools.  I mean, if public schools are so important, they could be held up 100% by private donations.

These clinics are non-profit, so it's not like they are running off with money bags into the night.  They are actually almost all working with a skeleton crew and no "fluff".
I go to a clinic for my yearly exam cause I can't afford Heath care.  Take the time to check one out and you'll see what I mean, it's pretty clear they run on a tight tight budget.
