How do you react when girls openly flirt with you?  by  ksmp728in  AskReddit[+]FluroBlack 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago  (0 children)[–]FluroBlack 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoI dont. Unless someone spells it out for me I just assume their being nice. There is so much variation in flirting and not. I used to have a friend who everyone thought flirted with me all the time. She's a lesbian and just acts that way.

Omg that's great. Yeah im considering getting it and just beating the hell out of it. Guy said he thinks the engine may have been replaced by the previous owner. He's willing to take 1500 for it. No idea if that's even close to his original price. 
I think its just because its such an unpopular car. No one wants a corolla that old unless its RWD. Which is understandable.

Its crazy how broad the price range for 240s are around here. Cheapest ive seen was a fully running one for $600 (massive rust holes through chassis and floor pans) to 18K RB swapped monsters.

I have a love for little lightweight hatchbacks and the FX16 is quite the monster in corners. 
Plus the rarity is quite appealing. :)

Mostly just something fun and to get me back and forth from work (5 miles). 
Eh, I have odd taste in cars.

Grew up in both Japan and England and the FX reminds me of a lot of the cars you'll never see around here. 
Well that's what I was thinking in theory. Truth be told though ive never worked on a car before, just figured if I can tear down a laptop or desktop computer into individual pieces and put it back together in working order in less than an hour then I can figure out how to replace a head gasket.

Fellow says its in running condition and that it blows thin white smoke but not all the time. 105K miles, rear seats and interior panels removed. Guy wants $1500 OBO for it. 
Not looking for something in terribly good shape. Just something to have fun with.

A fire water bomber. Those guys who fly planes full of water to drop on forest fires sounds like the coolest job ever. 
I've always dreamed of being a pilot but at 16 my eyes said "NO". But if I ever happen to get into the air I want to be a water bomber. Its not so mundane like being an airline pilot, and you dont have to kill people like a military pilot, but still get to bomb the shit out of stuff.
