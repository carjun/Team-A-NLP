Free - somebody saysI guess now I'm free - to say what I feelAnd crush you with wordsThat tell you you're wrong - for all that you've done- the harder harder we fall - the less we all learnNow hang on and listen you broken recordNo I won't stay long so keep it all to yourselfPraise - keeps you so tallI give you some time - you're wasting it allFighting for space - and looking for ways - to spread yourself thinThe more I stay here - the less you fit inWhen all the conflict ends - the life of us dependsOn whether time can clear our way-DISCLAIMER-Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for "fair use" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
