Please post news items only, with the exception of meta posts about /r/news itself. Self-posts aggregating news data and "independent reporting" each count as news, but are not an excuse to editorialize.
Your post will likely be removed if it: 

is not news (or a meta post).
is an opinion/analysis or advocacy piece.
primarily concerns politics.
has a title not taken from the article.
has a pay wall or steals content.
covers an already-submitted story.
violates reddit's site-wide rules.

Your comment will likely be removed if it:

is racist, sexist, vitriolic, or overly crude.
is unnecessarily rude or provocative.
is a cheap and distracting joke or meme.
is responding to spam.
violates reddit's site-wide rules.

Extreme or repeat offenders will be banned.

If your post doesn't fit, consider finding an appropriate news article on that story to submit instead, or submitting yours to lower moderation subreddits:
/r/inthenews - all news-related content
/r/AnythingGoesNews - unrestricted news
/r/truereddit - insightful articles
/r/self - any self-post
/r/misc, /r/redditdotcom - anything
or other news subreddits:
/r/SyrianCivilWar - about the conflict in Syria
/r/worldnews  - from outside the USA only
/r/UpliftingNews - uplifting            
or subreddits for other topics:
/r/FoodForThought - discussion-worthy long form articles about interesting subjects
/r/politics - for shouting about politics
/r/moderatepolitics - less shouting
/r/politicaldiscussion - even less shouting
/r/geopolitics - intl. politics and geography
/r/entertainment - Justin Bieber updates, etc.
/r/europe - news from Europe

Recommendations? Other questions or feedback? Read/skim this:

Before complaining about certain sites, YSK news websites aren't run by the pundits that appear on cable stations operating under the same brand.
We are aware that the list is currently dominated by "corporate" outlets. We hope to soon expand it to include a lot of sources appealing to people who don't like such outlets. Don't: message us just to point this issue out, or to let us know you're upset about it. Do: message us with recommendations of "independent" outlets that frequently produce non-analytical, non-editorialized stories.

Now that you've done so, feel free to send us a message.
