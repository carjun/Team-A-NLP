Original Synthpop's Alive video with new soundtrack - a remix using the CD/digital release version of the song mastered by Ken Rich (Grand Street Recording). This video was originally made in response to another YouTube video called "Synthpop Is Dead" which I thought was witty and amusing -- but incorrect ;-)!"Synthpop's Alive! Can't You Hear it?!"The entire Synthpop's Alive album can be heard at the Maison Vague website www.maisonvague.com and is available as a digital download at online music shops worldwide. Have fun!
