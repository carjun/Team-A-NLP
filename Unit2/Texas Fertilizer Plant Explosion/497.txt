The current view of anarchism views it as bomb-throwing rioters out of 1910, whereas looking at real philosophers and theologians who align with it will show a much more different view. While I will admit I don't agree 100% with what they had to say, there was a lot that really challenged and fleshed out some of my theological views as well, and pointed out ideas that were rooted almost entirely in tradition, and not in Christ.

From this discussion, it's clear that you know exactly what use of the idiom "Dark Ages" mean. The English language and modern vernacular doesn't always stem from fact-- "Dark Ages" as an adjective doesn't fit in modern Acadamia, but you'll still find it used from time to time in conversation. I thought you were asking a legitimate question about the term.

Modern extremists, in their intolerance of any brand of Islam other than their own, much less other religions, emulate this "Dark Age" style of thinking.

If you think you can bump up your SAT scores another 90 points, then you'd get into the next academic scholarship threshold, which is always a plus. GPA is a bit tougher to change your senior year, but same for that.

For being the largest Baptist university, I'm pleasantly surprised to have not come across anyone who denies Evolution (At least, folks who have taken a course with a unit covering it)

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1057)This makes me mad in my Bio class  by  HerbertTheHippoin  AdviceAnimals[+]Bandefaca 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago  (0 children)[–]Bandefaca 0 points1 point2 points 16 days agoDepending on where you go. I'm a student at Baylor University, which is the largest Baptist University in the States, and pretty high up on the list of private Christian Universities. Our Biology department (which I am proud to be getting a degree from!) explicitly states that we teach our courses based on what is factual and can be tested, not philosophical ideals. 
I've even had a genetics professor last year who mentioned several studies on the genetic basis of sexuality and attraction, and presented examples of flies being born with what appears to be homosexual behavior. Not all Christian universities are intellectually stifling.
From what I've heard, some Christian universities actually end up allowing more fringe ideas to be explored. I've heard of history professors who left public schools for private schools, because public funding to their department was dependent on how they portrayed certain government actions.

You can look for an English teaching center if you're in a big city to find locals who have some mastery of English, and would be more than happy to spend time with you. Most Kurds, from my experiences, seemed to be very welcoming of foreigners, particularly Americans, and obviously even more so if they understand some English.
I'd also look into figuring out basic Kurdish before going over; being able to greet people, order tea, ask for a bus driver to stop, etc. can help a ton. Knowing basic numbers is good as well. While most people can't speak English, I was in Sulaymaniyah, and if someone didn't understand my limited Kurdish, they almost always knew someone they could call or contact who knew some English-- enough to get my point across.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (19)Ariel Castro dead after suicide  by  neggrollin  MorbidReality[+]Bandefaca 8 points9 points10 points 28 days ago  (0 children)[–]Bandefaca 8 points9 points10 points 28 days agoTo all the folks saying he "couldn't last a month" in prison, I think you're missing or ignoring the full story here. He was sentenced to 1000 years in prison, and will obviously die there, under maximum protection. I can hardly imagine the crushing apathy, knowing that all the remaining years of my life will hold nothing but the bleak concrete walls surrounding me. Being told day-in and day-out when to eat, where to walk, how to act... I think the reality that the rest of his life will be nothing but that is what led to his suicide. His victims, tortured as they were, still had hope. They sought a light at the end of the tunnel, and what do you know, they found it. 
For Ariel, the light at the end of his tunnel was death.
The morbid reality I see here is that, despite his heinous, unforgivable, disgusting crimes, I can still sympathize with his action to commit suicide. I don't see him as a malformed, monstrous caricature of a person, but as an actual human being.
And knowing he is as human as I am... that's the real morbid reality here.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (34)So I got here yesterday and so far it's been great. My one question is, how do most students/faculty/people feel about smoking/trees?  by  baylorfreshmENTin  baylor[+]Bandefaca 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]Bandefaca 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI doubt anyone can speak on behalf of the views of the tens of thousands who work at, or learn at Baylor. If you're wondering what punishment looks like, however, know that, if reported up by a CL or Hall director, the punishment can be severe, as Baylor will tack stuff on top of whatever the police do, as it breaks the code of conduct we sign to be students here.

Happy 78th birthday, you crazy bastard.  by  gekkozorzin  Libertarian[+]Bandefaca 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]Bandefaca 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoI agree with your overall point, but I would like to comment on the earmarks vote. Earmarks are slightly different from pork-barreling in laws. Earmarks say that, when the money is given, it can only be spent on "X", while pork-barreling adds spending for an unrelated group or cause to the overall bill. Earmarks can be a fantastic way of congressional oversight in making sure money is spent the way it should be spent.

Supposedly the renovations are supposed to restore the citadel to looking like it did several thousand years ago. Do you think that an alteration like this is good or bad? Do you think things can be lost in restoration?
