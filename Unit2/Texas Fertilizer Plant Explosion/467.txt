I was a mage, played against a druid.   We were down to 2 hp each.  He went to go hit me with his druid spell to finish me off...and accidentally hit himself...and finished himself off.   I was dying!! Too funny.  I didn't know you could accidentally hit yourself like that...but I guess so!

permalinksavecontextfull comments (2)Is there a guide on how to go from downloading the game to playing the game?  by  pastoraliain  ffxiv[+]GadgetQueen 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago  (0 children)[–]GadgetQueen 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoNope, can't play.   After the initial crowded login issues were resolved, I played just fine.  Then they did maintenance on the 90K error and claimed it was "resolved" and me and a ton of other people got the error and have not been able to connect since then.   Take a look at the "tech support" forums....there's numerous people with the issue still going on and SE is being suspiciously quiet.  I haven't been able to log in without that error since last Wednesday.  Tried to submit a support ticket, called my ISP (who does not throttle), tried everything...and everything I research tells me it is SE and not me.   I can play every other online game just fine, just not FFXIV.

I'm happy for you that you're enjoying the game, but not everyone is having a great game experience, buddy.

I pay extra for the super high speed stuff.   I've played much heavier stuff than FFXIV...

Prepare yourself for a treasure hunt.  Half the fun is figuring out how the hell to register it! The other half is trying to actually connect to the game and to have it tell you "Error 90000" for weeks!  To hell with actually playing it after they have your money!

He'll lose it, never be able to work again, and may face jail time and/or extreme fines. 
Report him.

They're watching that page.  They just posted a picture of garlic sauce and I commented, "You can't pay your employees, but you post a pick of garlic sauce? How about a picture of John writing a check so your employees can eat and pay their rent?"    Within 3 minutes, the photo of the garlic sauce was deleted.   They're paying close attention to the Facebook page :)

She's not one bit sorry, she's just saying what her PR people are telling her to say. This video proves it...did you catch her snarky attitude?

permalinksavecontextfull comments (13389)Possible botting?  by  monopandorain  ffxiv[+]GadgetQueen -2 points-1 points0 points 22 days ago  (0 children)[–]GadgetQueen -2 points-1 points0 points 22 days agoYup.  Bots.  They have a teleport hack where they can instantly teleport from node to node.  If you are really feeling adventurous, open a trade window with it and then cancel it.  That screws up their script and they just stand there wasting botting time.   

permalinksavecontextfull comments (9)These teleporting hacker bots are really annoying the hell out of me. Is it even worth reporting them?  by  JunkMcReadyin  ffxiv[+]GadgetQueen 0 points1 point2 points 23 days ago  (0 children)[–]GadgetQueen 0 points1 point2 points 23 days agoSomeone did figure out a way to stop them.  I haven't tried it, but basically, you run up to them, open a trade window, and then close it without trading anything.   Supposedly that screws them up so that they just stand there wasting time until they are reset.   

permalinksavecontextfull comments (46)Unable to obtain the World list. Please help :(  by  TheRhodanin  ffxiv[+]GadgetQueen 0 points1 point2 points 24 days ago  (0 children)[–]GadgetQueen 0 points1 point2 points 24 days agoI can't log in either...same issues.  Can't even access my character screen list to pick a character on any of my servers.   
I'm thinking that most people are at work and not trying to log in right now, so the verbal outrage about not being able to log in hasn't reached its peak yet. 
So, basically, yep.  Something is wrong.  Here's to hoping they figure it out sooner than later.

Getting all kinds of errors, it tells me it can't find my characters, the start screen is grayed out...
Christ almighty this game is a hot mess. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)Keep an eye out for teleporting botters  by  Dflowerzin  ffxiv[+]GadgetQueen 0 points1 point2 points 26 days ago  (0 children)[–]GadgetQueen 0 points1 point2 points 26 days agoYup, I've seen this twice now.   And they're also the same people selling 1,000 shards for 35,000 on the marketplace.   Bastards.  It really, really sucks when you are mining near one.  You mine a node and run to the next one and by the time you get there, the bot is already there and mining because they literally warp from node to node and do not have to run.   Then they rinse and repeat. Reported both of them...

permalinksavecontextfull comments (70)Lawyers of reddit, what is the dumbest thing your client has ever done?  by  Hendricks_ginin  AskReddit[+]GadgetQueen 6 points7 points8 points 1 month ago* (0 children)[–]GadgetQueen 6 points7 points8 points 1 month ago*I'm not a lawyer, but I work in juvenile justice and one of the lawyers came into a court room where a bunch of kids and their parents were waiting for court.  He sits down, opens his brief case, and in a few moments looks around the room frustrated.  For, as any large group of people tends to do, everyone was talking, fighting, babies were crying, etc.  It was not the respectful decorum that is supposed to occur.  The judge was on the bench, but was not yet hearing cases. 
The lawyer, looking quite annoyed at the loudness of it all, stands back up and says loudly, "Quiet! All of y'all knock it off with all the talking.  And that's enough with all the cussing and shit!"
Even the judge busted up laughing....

I'm a patient person, but after all this time, I'm starting to get angry.  They told us it would be fixed this weekend, and now its on Wednesday.  Two damn weeks after launch.  I mean come on, this is not a mom and pop little indie developer....come on, man.

And I don't give a fuck HOW MANY people are working on this shit.  When the head guy is gallivanting around instead of leading his team on a game that thousands upon thousands of people PAID FOR but can not play, it's a slap in the face to hear how "sorry" he is over and and over again and then to see his fucking smiling face...ugh.   I'm just fucking PISSED.  They took my money and don't give a flying fuck that I can't play the game.  I have seriously been patient and patient and patient for over a damn week and there is STILL no end in sight.  I'm fucking going nuts.
