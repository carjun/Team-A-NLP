(to clarify in MY mind the limit is Cannabis info. since this is ENTs... and in a few weeks our own moderator will not be in Houston as some of our other users or not specifically IN Houston... and just in case some jack ass wants to try to make a point about NO LIMIT by posting his grandmother's bunion surgery)
(and seriously waiting 2 weeks between posts?) - ( its an interesting endeavor trying to get people to do things they don't want to )

When I call my reps. I talk about points brought up in the Texas Legislator Education Packet we hand delivered to them in February this year..
There is also a very handy Preparation Guide with some advice.. 
Any and ALL open honest conversation is going to push us to legalization!
Good luck!

there are ENTs that refuse to click out side reddit for information.. 
and in a time when open honest conversation is a big part of getting legalization don't we want more people talking about what has been successful in other places.. that maybe we could get more done in Houston? Texas? 
talking is social right? 
randomhoustonguy... when you move from Texas, will you still be moderating HOUSTONents?
