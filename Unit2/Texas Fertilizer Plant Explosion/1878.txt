Kiki is a year old Shepherd mix and is VERY sweet. She has an incredible disposition.  She is spayed, up to date on all shots and fully housebroken and Kiki friendly with other animals and people. Kiki has a a special need as her tongue is partially paralyzed and the only affects is that she takes longer to eat/drink and drools a little  extra. Her personality more than makes up for her ever so slight imperfection.Kiki's foster mom says..."Kiki is wonderful. She is eating well and just loves her people and her brother and sisters. She also loves her cat cousins. She will be the light of some lucky person's life. Kiki especially likes children. Kiki is the best...Adopt Kiki!
