They ruin Boehner's chances while still maintaining the republican seat.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (5)children of divorced or never married parents, how do you think going back and forth between two homes has affected you?  by  sawyersmommyin  AskReddit[+]Kaelter 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]Kaelter 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI was usually with my mother but my father got visitation rights every Tuesday, Friday and every other weekend. Dealing with their arguments was difficult but I'd like to think I turned out alright. Just be there emotionally for your child and don't use them as a go between no matter how hard it is and I think you'll prevent most of the stress.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (20)children of divorced or never married parents, how do you think going back and forth between two homes has affected you?  by  sawyersmommyin  AskReddit[+]Kaelter 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]Kaelter 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoMy parents split up when I was two so I've known nothing other than life in a divorced family. It's been extremely high-conflict mostly because of the one-sided divorce. It most certainly has had a lasting impact in that since I ended up becoming the only line of communication between my parents I've had to deal with a huge amount of stress. Every holiday, every vacation, there has been at least one argument between them which ends up going through me. 
If you're asking because you have a spouse with children and are considering divorce I would just say that no matter how hard it is, do NOT force your children to communicate to your spouse for you.

I want to agree with zoef but $250k debt is not the norm outside of Ph.Ds or medicine.

He makes $300k a year and is at the absolute top of his field. He barely got into it at all because the company he works for was transitioning to requiring a college degree but he only had a GED and a few college credits. He still refuses to say any of that was luck though and that anyone could do it if they just worked hard.
