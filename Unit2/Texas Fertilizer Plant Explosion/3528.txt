Lyrics:Down on my flexible flyerTo the bottom how fast I would goJust waiting for me under the treeAnd out in the snowA cowboy, a nurse or a firemanThere's so many things that you can beYou can set bigger goals, but set your soulYeah, set your soul freeTimes, places and situationsLead to an early graveWhen we get there we seeJust what did we save?If your heart is a flame burning brightlyYou'll have light and you'll never be coldAnd soon you will know that you just growYou're not growing oldIf the wheels of your wagon are rustyYou can paint them until they are newYou can roll down a hill, but if you can'tThen I pity you
