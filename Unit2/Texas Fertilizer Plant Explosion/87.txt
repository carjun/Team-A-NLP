Except for one house that burned down after Wednesday's fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, investigators have finished their search and rescue efforts, Gov. Rick Perry told reporters Friday."It's going to be a long recovery for this community," he said.Authorities are still reviewing a list of people reported missing to determine how many people are still unaccounted for after the devastating blast, McLennan County Judge Scott Felton said Friday.[Original story, posted at 5:30 p.m. Friday]The death toll has risen to 14 after an explosion at a Texas fertilizer factory, Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Jason Reyes told reporters on Friday. Search and rescue efforts in the area are continuing, he said.Authorities are trying to determine the whereabouts of 60 people who remain unaccounted for, making an exact casualty count difficult to establish, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said earlier Friday.Reyes said 200 people have been injured and 50 homes have been destroyed. "This is still being treated as a crime scene," Reyes said.Many questions remain about Wednesday's fire and explosion, which leveled buildings, ripped up walls and threw people on the ground blocks away. About half the town was evacuated, including a nursing home with 133 residents.
