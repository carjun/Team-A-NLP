Rules

No politics. Political videos (including ones related to current political figures) should be submitted to r/politics, r/worldpolitics, etc.
No personal information such as names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this a warning.
No witch-hunting or incitement to witch hunt. This means no demanding "Reddit justice" in any way in post titles or comments.
No police brutality/violence videos. Consider posting to a different subreddit, like /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut or elsewhere.
No blogspam or URL shorteners. Please post direct links.
No porn or gore. There are many other subreddits for such content.
No DAE posts or solicitation of votes or views.

If your submission does not appear in the new queue, please contact us (be sure to include a link to the Reddit post (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.
Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly!

permalinksaveparent[+]GravityGrave 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]GravityGrave 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoYes, some local news tweeted 60-70 dead last night on twitter, and then deleted it not very long after. The number really blew up on twitter. Funny how all day yesterday twitter was bashing CNN for propagating false news, and then that happened last night. I thought it was fairly obvious that they wouldn't be able to confirm that many deaths just hours after the explosion, and while most fires were still being put out.
