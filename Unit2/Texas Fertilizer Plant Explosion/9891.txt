EDIT: you can find gems like this: "The climate change or global warming agenda is basd [sic] on a fraud and a thinly veiled globalist attempt to control every aspect of our lives."
and i was all excited when i saw that a libertarian was running, too.

permalinksaveparent[+]HoratioBrembley -1 points0 points1 point 54 minutes ago  (3 children)[–]HoratioBrembley -1 points0 points1 point 54 minutes agoMaybe you're in brainwashed denial, but the regulations that our betters want to impose on us in the name of environmentalism rings true in her comment there.  You're just not educated enough and watch too much mainstream corporate media.

permalinksaveparent[+]teddywilsonborn and bred [score hidden] 8 minutes ago  (0 children)[–]teddywilsonborn and bred [score hidden] 8 minutes agoYou mean like the corporate talking point that there isn't a consensus in the scientific community about climate change? 

permalinksaveparent[+]HoratioBrembley 1 point2 points3 points 52 minutes ago  (1 child)[–]HoratioBrembley 1 point2 points3 points 52 minutes agoBeing a libertarian, she should also be pro-choice and for the decriminalization of illegal drugs for personal use.  In other words, ending this silly drug war.  I'd think you would support that.
She's also for smaller government across the board, which is a terrific thing.
