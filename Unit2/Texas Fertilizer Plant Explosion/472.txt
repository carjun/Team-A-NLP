But even then, these new hardware might just change the way how players experience the new FPS games.  
Edit: Oculus Rift

permalinksavecontextfull comments (187)What game will be the competitive game for the next gen consoles?  by  nimikin  truegaming[+]krizalid70559 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]krizalid70559 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI can't really predict what is going to be the next big-hit genre, but FPS is going to be my guess.  
My reason is, FPS actually got a lot of non-gamer to become gamers.  I've met a couple of people who plays nothing but Call of Duty, Battlefield type games.  They also told me they have no interest in any other games, and had not played video games before.
FPS like Call of Duty is very easy to get into, because it doesn't take a lot to understand.  That is not to say, COD or BW is simple games that everyone can master; but it means these games are easily immersible.  In these games, you have a fairly realistic world, and because it is first person, it makes it easier for people to be immersed.  The mechanism in these games are not as complicated as games such as RPGs, and definitely not fighters.  
For the next genre to be big and competitive, it has to satisfy those factors.

Ignorant comments have got to be the most retarded thing to read.  It actually hurts to understand it.  Like a million nail scratching glass.

PS: I apologize. I realize calling you a retard is an insult to the mentally handicapped.  They are much more intelligent than you are.

Just because topic similar to this has been discussed to death.  
Anyway, I don't know where you live, but video games doesn't get stigmatized where I am.  Sure, some people still view it as "immature", but then some people view sports as immature, some people view music as immature, etc.
Ultimately... who cares about what other people think?  If you like games then you do.  Anything can be stigmatized.

Best Gundam paints to get my boy friend?  by  radyroveryin  Gundam[+]krizalid70559 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]krizalid70559 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI am not really sure what he is referring to by Gundam Paints... Does he mean paint used to paint Gundam Model (Gunpla)?  If that is the case, you might want to look into Tamiya paint.  That is for hand painting; you can also look into getting him an airbrush and a compressor, which is kind of expensive - but he will love you forever.
If this is Gundam model (Gunpla) related, you can take it to /r/gunpla and you'll definitely get appropriate help there.  Hope it helps.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (2)China Says US Shutdown Exposes 'Ugly Side of Partisan Politics'  by  BillTownein  news[+]krizalid70559 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]krizalid70559 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoAll the problems you listed is directly or indirectly caused by government corruption, and corruption also happens in the US.  The only difference is instead of bribes, it's now "lobbying".  
Take censorship for example, the Chinese government openly conceal facts and shut down websites.  The US government would shut down websites or fill the internet with pro-American propaganda.  It's just a different way of control.  It's no different.
I do agree China needs a lot of work because corruption is much more severe over there, hence the extreme condition.  Keep in mind that China is a huge country, and only recently started to industrialized (relative to the US).  With the huge population and large land, on top of the difference in culture, you can't expect the Chinese government to turn everything around in a short amount of time.

Does a person pick themselves as a fatty, therefore they will be in the fatty category?  If that's the case, there will be a lot of dishonesty "non-fatty" out there.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (309)Why are dating sims virtually non-existent in the US?  by  Kensinin  truegaming[+]krizalid70559 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]krizalid70559 5 points6 points7 points 3 days agoNot just Japan, but I am sure Korea and China too.  Part of the countries are Westernized, that's the trend, and that's what's "hip".  They are interested in casual sex, but it's still "taboo", you see.  It's not the norm.  
I don't know about Europe, but in the US, especially where I live, dating is very casual.  It goes from date, sex, then break up.  Happens all the time, no hard feelings afterward.  That almost never happens where I originally came from.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (135)What makes or breaks a game for you?  by  blues4thecupin  truegaming[+]krizalid70559 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]krizalid70559 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoI am definitely not a typical gamer.  A lot of times things that are non-significant to other gamers affect me in a major way.  
One of the biggest factor that breaks the game for me is the visual, actually.  I am not talking about graphic quality, but the art style.  Whenever there is a game with cartoony, cute, or ugly characters, 99.9% of the time I would not even approach it, regardless of how "critically acclaimed" the series is.
Another big factor would be things that would test my patience.  Anything from extreme level grinding, long load time, to dragging story line.
Things that makes the game for me...  A game with fantastic visual.  Games like Metal Gear Rising, Devil May Cry, for instance.  Even games like Dynasty Warriors, while the game play is repetitive, the flashy action actually draw me right into the game.
A strong story line and good system, of course, also makes the game for me.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (38)Why are dating sims virtually non-existent in the US?  by  Kensinin  truegaming[+]krizalid70559 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]krizalid70559 2 points3 points4 points 4 days agoYou're right, even in western culture, sex is not the only reason for dating, but it is a big part.  That is the major difference.  Sex plays a really big role in western romance; whereas in eastern romance, sex is much more serious, intimate, and there are much more things to consider.  
That is not to say, every western couple behaves that way; but it is simply how the culture is here.  There are always outliers.
I'll use pop culture as an example.  In the west, you often hear songs about sex, one night stand, or similar topics.  You also get the heart broken songs, about breaking up, missing someone, etc; but it's not as saturated.  In the East, it's the opposite - with very little music about sex, if any.  

permalinksavecontextfull comments (135)Yoshiyuki Tomino’s new series “Based on a world 1000 years after the apocalypse”  by  krizalid70559in  Gundam[+]krizalid70559[S] 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]krizalid70559[S] 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoI don't think there is an intention to make his robot "real" or "super".  He simply created a show with a different kind of mech, with realistic weapons instead of flying punches (Mazinger type).  He put Star Wars and robot together, and we get Gundam.  
How realistic it is, is all subjective and relative.  If you compare Gundam to Getta/Mazinger, of course it is real; but it doesn't mean it is realistic or practical.  Since the beginning, fighting a "mech" war with light saber and gundam hammer just isn't practical.  Then you have "technology" like moonlight butterfly, which is highly unrealistic.  But that is acceptable and often overlooked because it is technology "far in the future", therefore it is "explained" and "real".

It is okay for things to work as if they are magic.  So it's the exact opposite of what you said, it might have godlike mechs in it that makes no sense.  Maybe some Evangelion shit.
