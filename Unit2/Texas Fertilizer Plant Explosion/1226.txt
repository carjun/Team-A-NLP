Perfect for city traffic, the Jetta Turbo Hybrid helps move you forward while you slow down. Regenerative braking converts the heat and friction produced by braking into energy that recharges the battery. The Jetta Turbocharged Hybrid conserves energy by shutting down when the car is at a full stop, and restarting effortlessly when you press the accelerator. In E-Mode, the Turbo Hybrid engine can get you some of the best fuel economy, up to 70 km/h as far as 2 km on electric power alone, so you can cruise the city while saving fuel. And with a 7-speed DSG automatic transmission, the Hybrid powertrain switches gears seamlessly as it performs. If you drive down the highway often, the TDI Clean Diesel engine is also powerful and environmentally friendly. Thanks to advanced German engineering, it produces greater torque at lower revs than a traditional gasoline engine. Plus, the TDI Clean Diesel's fuel efficiency is nearly 30% more than comparable gasoline engines. With the TDI's impressive fuel economy, you can confidently cruise over 1,195 km of highway on a single tank.
