Riley is a beautiful, large Collie mix that has lived in a loving home for many years but due to his owners failing health has been turned into Father John's. He is a sweet and happy boy who is a bit on the chubby side -- but that just means there's more to love! Riley loves to go for walks and enjoys getting some play time in our yard with some of his dog buddies.  He's well-mannered and has an easy going temperament.  Riley is approximately 7 years old. He's neutered, up-to-date on his shots, neutered and micro chipped. This great dog is looking for his second chance at love...Can you help? ADOPT RILEY!
