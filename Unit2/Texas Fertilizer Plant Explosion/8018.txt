Did you tell her it was hyperhydrosis?
Sweating a bunch, especially at night, is also a sign of a lot of cancers, infections and hormonal imbalances so I'm shocked she didn't think anything of it.

An artist described one of the children's pieces as "a competent execution of abstract expressionism."  by  [deleted]in  todayilearned[+]omar_strollin 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]omar_strollin 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoNo not at all, not the point I was trying to make. I meant if you were trying to differentiate an authentic Warhol from a 4-yr-old or from a knock-off like in this instance it would be very easy to tell.
It's not even using screen printing.
