I had LP for a season once and the local games were blocked. As many people will point out though, you can use a VPN to enable the games. I don't know much about it but Google it if you're desperate for an answer to the problem.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)Anyone know where to buy the Rockets 8 bit tshirt in adult size?  by  mtnb1k3rin  rockets[+]mendicant111 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago* (0 children)[–]mendicant111 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago*Man, I have been on this exact quest for about a year now. I've seen them in kids sizes, but that's it. I even posted this question here and got a bootleg site recommended, but I never tried it. I'll link my submission in a second.
Edit: link to my submission from a couple months back.
http://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1jukfl/has_anyone_seen_this_tshirt_available_anywhere/.json
If you end up using that bootleg site, let me know if it works out please? I want to buy it but am kind of wary.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)BurgerFi B.A.D (Breakfast All Day) burger. Fried egg, bacon, hashbrown, grilled onions, and cheese! (3264x2418)  by  Airspeed35in  FoodPorn[+]mendicant111 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]mendicant111 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agowell, the one pictured looks like it has no beef patty, just the stuff mentioned in the title.
but to answer your question, a burger with a fried egg on top is beyond delicious, imo. it basically adds another layer of flavor, and the yolk becomes a gravy or condiment. i like to make mine with a fried egg over medium so the white is nice and firm and the yolk runs thick but still not solid.

Santa Cruz to be exact. So goddamn beautiful. Now I'm in Houston, which actually is as flat as a board.
I love visiting the hill country for the natural beauty. If you squint your eyes and rub them with Vaseline, you could almost pretend you're in California.

This is a misconception about Texas. While there certainly aren't any beautiful snow capped mountains in Texas, it is not all flat as a board east of Junction. Give the hill country a visit sometime, it's actually quite beautiful.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (8)Apps you regret buying  by  mlkin  Android[+]mendicant111 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago  (0 children)[–]mendicant111 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoI have 40+ podcasts that I subscribe to, some of which I listen to every episode, some I only listen to an occasional episode, and some I don't want to download episodes automatically at all. I listen to every single WTF episode, but NPR's 7am news summary comes out every day, and some days I don't get around to getting to listen to that particular day's episode. So I set it to only keep the latest episode. WTF episodes are set to keep indefinitely. Some podcasts, like Death squad, are full of garbage generally, so I manually select the few episodes I want. All of these settings are possible with categories. In addition, I can set certain categories to download at certain times. For someone like me who needs to have extensive control and groupings available to me, pocket casts doesn't really work for me. My episodes list just becomes a cluttered mess. A pretty mess, but a mess just the same.

After getting used to the features of BP I recently picked up pocket casts because it's admittedly prettier, but I couldn't get used to PC. Maybe I'll give it another go soon.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1)Pilots of Reddit, have you ever been a passenger on a plane and noticed something going wrong?  by  ItsLewisin  AskReddit[+]mendicant111 -1 points0 points1 point 2 months ago  (0 children)[–]mendicant111 -1 points0 points1 point 2 months agoI'm a little late to this party, but I'll share a story anyway.
Last year, on September 11th actually, I was on a Southwest airlines flight from San Diego to San Jose, connecting from Houston. This leg of the journey is relatively short so I was already thinking about the drive I had ahead of me. One more hour in the air and another one driving and I'm done with this day. 
We took off and were up in the air all of maybe 10 minutes before there was an extremely loud boom that came from the right side of the plane. One of the plane's two engines had exploded. Not like a Hollywood style, flames everywhere, explosion, but an explosion nonetheless.
We were routed to LAX for an emergency landing, and when we arrived we could see firefighters and other ground crew all staring in disbelief at the engine. I looked online for a news story about it, but never found anything.
