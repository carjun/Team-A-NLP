I feel like im going to end up doing something i SERIOUSLY regret soon.  by  Throwaway04109in  needadvice[+]Argy 2 points3 points4 points 17 days ago  (0 children)[–]Argy 2 points3 points4 points 17 days agoI'm really sorry this has been happening. I was verbally bullied on and off throughout middle and high school, but it stopped altogether when I graduated and started college. I've found the experience is the same for other people who've been bullied. I know it's incredibly cliche, but it's true that it will get better. You said you're now a senior — dude, you're almost done. Don't let these asshats get the best of you by quitting when you're that close.  
In the meantime, consider wearing a hidden camera so you have undeniable proof of what's happening. Take that footage to the police, superintendent and school board. Do you trust any of the adults at your school? A counselor, a librarian, an aide, even a lunch lady or a janitor? The more adults you can get on your side, the better. If you are having a hard time getting school administrators and police to believe you, they may take you more seriously if another adult gets involved.  
No matter what happens, please keep your parents — or another trusted family member(s) — in the loop.

I hate to admit that I was stunned - I have NEVER seen this happen in WalMart before.  by  keraneuologyin  self[+]Argy 1 point2 points3 points 20 days ago  (0 children)[–]Argy 1 point2 points3 points 20 days agoI live in a small town... this happens about half of the time I go to Walmart (which, unfortunately, is too much since there aren't many options here).

I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like they would need a permit to block traffic in an organized way like that.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (18)Is a Costco membership worth it? I was walking around the store and the prices on things like milk, eggs, and frozen goods didn't seem all that different than, say, target or publix. To those with memberships, do you save enough to justify the yearly fee?  by  el_guapo_tacoin  Frugal[+]Argy 1 point2 points3 points 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]Argy 1 point2 points3 points 21 days agoI buy Kirkland Maintenance Cat Food at Costco because it's economical (about $20 for 25 pounds) and has higher quality ingredients than most brands at other stores. It's a nice medium between feeding your cat a premium, but expensive diet and one that consists mainly of corn (its first ingredient is chicken).

I got the feeling she is still the same person but was putting on that extremely tough face because she had to in order to get the job done.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (18)What's the worst thing a house guest has done in your home?  by  the_Hallelucinatorin  AskReddit[+]Argy 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago* (0 children)[–]Argy 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago*My husband and I woke up one morning to the sound of our friend taking a piss on a table (and cat bed underneath it, sans cat, thankfully) in our living room. He said someone had been in the bathroom, and he couldn't wait. There was no one in the bathroom. The door was five feet away and wide open. Yes, he had been drinking the night before.  
The same friend also used our shower curtain to catch himself when he drunkenly fell while trying to use the toilet (different day). The curtain rod is now bent, so the curtain hangs lower than it used to.  
Another time two of our friends who were left unsupervised grabbed some of my collectibles (action figures) on display and started bashing them into items around our living room. Both figures were broken. Both friends were older than 25.

I began bleeding partway through the trip and had to rush to a drugstore because I hadn't packed any tampons/pads.

A dog trapped in a small cage with limited visibility, rocketing down the freeway at 60 mph and hitting every single bump is probably going to be confused and scared.

The carrier being down that low makes it less visible to other people. It just looks dangerous (also terrifying from the dog's perspective).
