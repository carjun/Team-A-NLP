 WEST, Texas — Rescue crews are searching the smoldering remains of a fertilizer facility in central Texas, and a swath of destroyed homes around it, for victims of a massive explosion that injured more than 160 people and may have killed as many as 15, authorities said.
The estimate of how many may have died in the explosion Wednesday night includes an estimated three or four “first responders” who remained missing hours after the blast, most likely volunteer firefighters or ambulance workers. Officials said they were among many who responded to a fire at the West Fertilizer Co. retail facility and were urgently trying to evacuate people from the area, after realizing that the blaze had the potential to trigger a huge blast.

Fertilizer plant explodes in central Texas: A massive explosion on Wednesday night at a fertilizer plant in West, Tex., left more than 160 people wounded and killed an estimated five to 15 people , officials said, likely including firefighters who had been battling the blaze at the factory that triggered the explosion. West is 20 miles north of Waco.

“Last night was truly a nightmare scenario in that community,” Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R)  said Thursday, adding, “This tragedy has most likely hit every family” in West, a tiny town 20 miles north of Waco with a population of 2,800.

Officials said there was no immediate indication that the fire was anything other than an industrial accident, but added they were examining all possibilities. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, a federal agency that investigates industrial disasters, said they were sending teams of investigators to West to assist local authorities.“We are not ruling anything out,” said Waco police Sgt. Patrick Swanton, a police spokesman. “Until we know that it was an industrial accident, we will investigate it as a crime scene.Courtney Adair, 20, a great-niece of the owner of the facility, said the family is in shock. “They don’t know what to think or what’s going to happen,” she said in an interview.Adair said the family can’t fathom that anyone would have set the blaze on purpose, saying her great uncle has no enemies.“Honestly, I think this was an accident,” she said. “West is a small country town.”Residents in this rural town, which takes pride in its Czech roots, were dazed Thursday as the extent of the damage started to become clear. Wendy Maler, 37, who lives 750 feet from the facility, said her husband, a volunteer firefighter urged her and their kids to evacuate as the fire started spreading.Barely five minutes after reaching her mother-in-law’s house, just down the road, the ground shook as a ball of fire shot into the sky.“We just grabbed the kids and hit the ground,” she said. David Maler, 47, her husband, was wounded as he tried to help put out the fire.Her home was wrecked, Maler said. Windows were blown out, the drywall crumbled, and the doors caved in.“We were able to go into the house and get our wedding rings, but that was it,” she said.Perry told reporters he was declaring McLennan County a disaster area. He said President Obama called him Thursday morning from Air Force One en route to Boston, where the president was to attend a prayer service for victims of Monday’s Boston Marathon bombings.
