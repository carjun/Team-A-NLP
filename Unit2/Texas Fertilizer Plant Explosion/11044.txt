* Several volunteer firefighters missing
* Blast destroyed 60 to 80 houses, apartment building* Town of West known for strong Czech heritage

 (Recasts, details throughout)By Carey Gillam and Corrie MacLagganWEST, Texas, April 18 (Reuters) - Rescuers searched on
Thursday for survivors in the rubble of homes destroyed by a
fiery fertilizer plant explosion in a small rural Texas town, as
authorities struggled to determine how many people had been
killed.Concern and uncertainty gripped the town of West nearly a
day after the chemical blast at West Fertilizer Co. injured more
than 160 people. The cause of the explosion was not known and
officials said no evidence of foul play had been found."All of that unknown ... is really scary, we don't know what
has happened, who is alive, who is hurt, that's probably the
worst part now," said Pat Lee, whose 92-year-old mother was
injured in the blast on Wednesday evening.Police initially put the death toll at up to 15, but later
on Thursday Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Jason
Reyes told reporters that while the explosion had been deadly,
it is not yet known how many had been killed.While authorities stressed the Texas explosion could be an
accident, it happened within days of the deadly Boston marathon
bombings and the discovery of poisonous packages sent to
President Barack Obama and a Republican senator - both incidents
that have revived memories of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Agents with the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, a federal agency
that investigates industrial chemical accidents, and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are on the scene of
the blast, which was the strength of magnitude 2.1 earthquake,
according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Firefighters had been battling a fire at the plant on
Wednesday night for about 20 minutes before the blast rocked the
town of 2,700 people about 20 miles (32 km) north of Waco. Three
to four volunteer firefighters were still missing, police said.The blast destroyed 60 to 80 houses, reduced a 50-unit
apartment complex to what one local official called "a skeleton
standing up" and left a horrific landscape of burned-out
buildings and blackened rubble.Texas Governor Rick Perry described the situation as "a
nightmare scenario." "The tragedy has most likely hit every
family," he said.Bryan Anderson, 41, injured along with his 9-year-old son
Kaden near their home, said: "This doesn't happen in West,
Texas. We are just a little town."West has a strong Czech heritage, and the Czech Republic
Embassy in Washington said on its website the ambassador was
traveling to West, which is known among Texans as the place to
stop on the highway between Dallas and Austin for kolaches, a
popular Czech pastry.'VERY VOLATILE SITUATION'Police said the fertilizer plant was in a highly populated
neighborhood. "It is still a very volatile situation," said
Chief Deputy Sheriff Matt Cawthon of McLennan County.West Fertilizer Co is a retail facility that blends
fertilizer and sells it to farmers. It stored 270 tons of
ammonium nitrate, along with other "extremely hazardous"
chemicals including anhydrous ammonia in 2012, according to a
report the company filed with the state government.Anhydrous ammonia is used by farmers as fertilizer to boost
soil nitrogen levels and improve crop production.According to the Centers for Disease Control, mixing
anhydrous ammonia and water produces a poisonous cloud. When
ammonia mixes with air, it forms an explosive mixture, and
containers may explode when heated, according to the CDC.The West plant is one of thousands of sites across rural
America that store and sell hazardous materials such as
chemicals and fertilizer for agricultural use, many within close
range of residences and schools. The company is privately owned
and has fewer than 10 employees.The plant had not been inspected by state officials since
2006, when a complaint of an ammonia smell was resolved, said
Zak Covar, executive director of the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. State inspections are done only when
there is a complaint, Covar said.The federal Environmental Protection Agency fined the firm
$2,300 in 2006 for failing to implement a risk management plan.The plant's owner could not be reached for comment.'NIGHTMARE SCENARIO'Firefighters had been evacuating several blocks around the
fire before the blast out of concern for dangerous fumes, police
said. That threat had abated by Thursday, police said.The West middle school, which was badly damaged, was one
fifth of a mile from the plant and the high school was one-third
of a mile away.Perry declared McLennan County a disaster area and said he
would request federal disaster aid from Obama. Obama, who flew
to Boston for a memorial service for victims of the Boston
bombings, offered support and prayers to the victims in Texas.Texas is no stranger to industrial disasters. In 1947, 3,200
tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer detonated aboard a ship in a
Texas City port, killing almost 600 people, an incident believed
to be the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history.More recently, a 2005 explosion at a BP refinery in Texas
City killed 15 people and injured more than 170 others when
hydrocarbon vapors exploded in a processing plant.If the West blast was an industrial accident, investigators
would look at whether firefighters ignited the blast by pouring
water on a volatile substance. Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas
Division of Emergency Management, said it was too early to
speculate."A lot of firefighters will use their No. 1 tool, which is
water, in a hazardous materials chemical situation to cool the
surrounding environment," he told a briefing in Austin.
