Who planned that location?

permalinksaveparent[+]searine 115 points116 points117 points 5 months ago  (10 children)[–]searine 115 points116 points117 points 5 months agoJudging by the size on google maps, this isn't a production plant.
It is just a storage facility for farmers buying ammonium nitrate. There are probably less regulations on that type of facility compared to a real nitrogen plant.

permalinksaveparent[+]Obnoxious_liberal 6 points7 points8 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Obnoxious_liberal 6 points7 points8 points 5 months agoNo, but public administrators should take note and realize the policies we put into place matter. Someone granted a permit to build those apartments and that nursing home. That obviously was a horrible idea and shouldn't be repeated.

permalinksaveparent[+]chuggles 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]chuggles 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoAs you said - The business stored anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. State and federal documents describe West Fertilizer as a seller, not a manufacturer.

permalinksaveparent[+]altofanaltofanalt 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]altofanaltofanalt 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI thought ammonium nitrate could be used for meth? If so I'd think there would still be a lot of regulations (maybe not in texas). 

permalinksaveparent[+]MrBojangles528 6 points7 points8 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]MrBojangles528 6 points7 points8 points 5 months agoYes it can be used in some recipes of meth production, but I believe most of the restrictions are to prevent people from making explosives.  The OKC bomber used Ammonium Nitrate and look at the devastation that caused...

permalinksaveparent[+]Procks1061 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Procks1061 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoI imagine the fire on site engulfed one of the tanks and caused a BLEVE. As an Chem Engineer, that's certainly what it looked like.
Edit: After reading some more, my suspicion was confirmed.

permalinksaveparent[+]PENISFULLOFBLOOD 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]PENISFULLOFBLOOD 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoGood point, but moving forward maybe some changes need to be made in the planning process. 

permalinksaveparent[+]legitimatedrapes 9 points10 points11 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]legitimatedrapes 9 points10 points11 points 5 months agoAdditionally, I'm guessing that the area was originally little more than farmland, and the fertilizer plant probably existed in its current location long before any of the surrounding buildings. No source, that's just my hunch.

permalinksaveparent[+]PenguinBomb 6 points7 points8 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]PenguinBomb 6 points7 points8 points 5 months agoThe plant/factory was there before the homes, I believe. They kept saying it was one of the oldest factories there.

permalinksaveparent[+]chemistry_teacher 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]chemistry_teacher 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoWithout firm facts here, I'm gonna have to take your comment with a grain of salt.

permalinksaveparent[+]Cyrius -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Cyrius -1 points0 points1 point 5 months agoDid you know that Houston is the largest city in the country with no zoning?

permalinksaveparent[+]chemistry_teacher -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]chemistry_teacher -1 points0 points1 point 5 months agoThis may be true, but firm facts remain unreported, even by your response.

permalinksaveparent[+]Brak710 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]Brak710 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoJudging by the size of the explosion, I'm not even sure how far is safe. It could have been way far away and still wiped out everything around it. It's like what I'd imagine a small nuke will do...

permalinksaveparent[+]FrankManic 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]FrankManic 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoYou could probably get the geeks over at /r/askscience to try to estimate the equivalent in kiltons of TNT. Things like the seismograph readings and estimates of how much material was on hand should give them enough to go on.

He posted an estimate.
Here's mine:
Energy released by AN: 2479 kJ/kg
54000lbs of ammonium nitrate is 24494 kg.  24494*2479 = 60720626 kJ.
1kt of TNT is 4.184×1012 J, or 4.184x109 kJ
60720626/4.184x109 = ~0.0145kt.
Source for Energy released by AN page 15.
Source for 1kt of TNT
