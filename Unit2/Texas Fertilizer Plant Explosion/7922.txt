So long as daddy fed is paying we're ok with fucking up peoples lives cause they have a 20 sack.  Real cool braugh.  Real.  Cool.

The Sheriff's Office of Hudspeth County stopped taking small checkpoint cases that had become too big of a burden on local taxpayers.

...

On average, his deputies arrest as many as ten people a day at the checkpoint who are caught with a small amount of drugs.
“It’s a full-time job,” West said.
But over the summer, the Hudspeth County Sheriff put the brakes on checkpoint arrests because he said the federal government had failed to reimburse the county as promised. 

People in tx talk real big about small govt this small govt that.  They aren't about it.  When people say small govt they really mean my small govt that does what I want and nothing else.  Pure fantasy.
