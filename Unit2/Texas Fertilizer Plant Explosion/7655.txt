RTÉ HAS CONFIRMED it’s received 41 complaints over a scene at the start of Sunday night’s season premiere of Love/Hate which depicted a cat being machine-gunned to death.
Animal rights groups have criticised the broadcaster for airing the graphic sequence, in which a teenager is seen shooting the animal with a machine gun, and then laughing about the incident with a friend.
In line with normal practice, the programme makers confirmed in the end credits that no animals were harmed in the making of the show. However, groups like the ISPCA and the Animal Rights Action Network aren’t happy that the content was aired in the first place.
ARAN called yesterday for a boycott of the gangland drama, while the ISPCA claims the scene “sparked outrage” amongst animal lovers.
“The cat shooting scene was totally unnecessary given that Ireland is experiencing increasing levels of animal cruelty, neglect and abuse inflicted on innocent animals,” a spokesperson for the charity said.
“We fear youngsters could be influenced to behave cruelly towards cats as a result of what was shown on Love/Hate especially in the run up to Halloween”.
Anaesthetic
A spokesperson for RTÉ reiterated today that no animals were hurt. The cat was given an anaesthetic by a qualified vet for the scene so it appeared lifeless on screen
“Under the supervision of an experienced animal handler, Eddie Drew, the cat had a fishing line attached to its collar to lead it in the necessary direction and stop it as it ran,” the RTÉ spokesperson said.
“The line was removed in post production. The impact blood splatter was created through CGI effects in post production.
“No squibs (for fake blood) were attached to the cat or set off in its proximity during filming.
“Subsequently the cat was given an anaesthetic by a qualified vet – the same technique has been used in previous series of Love/Hate.
“The producer was present and confirmed that the cat was in good health after the scene.”
Of the 41 complaints lodged with the broadcaster, 32 were written and 9 were via phonecall.

I feel the cat should engage in a TV Live Debate to ensure it sets the record straight. It will put the mind if other cats  around the country at rest.
Cat V Nidge… Bring it on.

Send the bailiffs to those 41 homes and repossess their TVs. These people clearly did not go to bed before the watershed.

Surely the drug dealing and murdering is more of a concern! You can’t do anything these days without someone causing a fuss. To be honest it’s a bit of a joke that it’s being reported.

Breaking news…..Herman Melville & Gregory Peck have received complaints from whale enthusiasts over their relentless pursuit of the whale Moby Dick. Animal welfare groups insist that the harassment of Moby Dick by captain Ahab was tantamount to bullying and could encourage readers of the novel/viewers of the movie to start bullying whales.
The author Herman Melville insisted that no whales were harmed in the production of his novel, however animal rights groups have expressed dismay and anger and have requested that the novel be pulled from the shelves while Mr Melville changes the word whale to carrot. They request that all reference to the hunting of whales be removed from the novel so as not to cause distress and discomfort..
……. I really have no respect for some of the people in this country!

The cat was freaking fine why are they getting their knickers in a twist ? There are far more real life harrowing scenes on television everyday to be worried about.

I think the government need to introduce mandatory classes on distinguishing between reality and a TV show!

I’m a vegetarian and support several animal rights causes and even I think this is overreacting.
I can’t for the life of me comprehend why people would complain over a cat being killed on screen but not a human being. Neither are actually harmed in real life.

I’m going to complain that they didn’t shoot more of them, just to balance things out a bit.

Bear Grylls is a legend though so he can do anything he likes in my book and I would happily watch.

This is an absolute cat-tastrophy !!!
41 complaints from nearly a million viewers, that’s not bad going.
No such thing as bad publicity, it’ll probably bring in bigger viewers next Sunday.

“We fear youngsters could be influenced to behave cruelly towards cats as a result of what was shown on Love/Hate especially in the run up to Halloween”.
Yet a television show which contains scene of violence, rape, gun shootings, death, drug abuse, prostitution and adultery and terrorist activity doesn’t cause concern?

Anyone remember the Gerry Ryan “Lamdo” incident back in the 80′s…….the public are as dumb as a bag of hammers sometimes and all “outrage” shouldn’t be taken seriously.

Absolute ridiculous sad busy bodies !! The one good show we have and some do gooders try and ruin it. What I’d love to know is how many of these complainers eat meat or use make up and cosmetics which are tested in animals. It’s a joke !!

All ARAN are doing here is jumping on the publicity that Love/Hate is receiving this week like the leeches they are.
I don’t think anyone agrees that it is how animals should be treated, but I’ve never heard of ARAN making headlines for doing good work, only causing ridiculous controversy for the sake of publicity.

But a child firing off a Heckler & Koch submachine gun in Ballymun was perfectly fine.

Well that’s realistic alright.
Idiots wasting ammo on a useless target that could be done with one well aimed shot.
Must be well financed gangsters too,black market ammo is expensive commodity to be wasting it on cat shooting.

Gotta love Simon’s ‘expert’ comments on the Journal today. First he is telling us how the Gardai should have handled the Abbeylara incident now he is on about killing a cat with a single shot, not wasting ammunition. He’s a real black ops expert lol!

You’d swear it was the cat shooting Olympics or something!!
A more interesting question…. Why was the nidgeweasel watching porn in the dark when he owns a brothel??

Sadly these things do happen. Love hate is based on stuff that does happen. What do we do?  Sweep it under the carpet

It made me cuddle my cat more that night before bed,it’s a dangerous world we live in. Check your neighbours cats are warm and have enough milk people it only takes a couple of minutes.

Typical. Complain about anything.
Have ye nothing better to do. Yes you all have an opinion but cop on.
 IT WAS FAKE.
Wake up and smell the roses.
Then again maybe dont. You might kill a bee in the process.
That would bee, I mean BE bad.

Can see why some people think this is a storm in a teacup and while others think it could promote animal cruelty.. 
Personally i don’t know why they could not have just had the young lad miss shooting the cat

Sad people. These complainers need to do what they did when Pat the Plank left RTE. Turn the Dial.               Do they complain when a character gets gunned down. Doubt it.

Murder, rape, prostitutes, kidnapping, drugs, beatings and people give out about a cat seriously get over it, 40 complaints out of 1 million views think the maths speaks for itself, everyone knows what to expect from the show if u don’t like switch off

With all the hype over this I had to youtube it to see the brutal killing of a cat being spayed with bullets, and blood splattered everywhere. What a disappointment.   The kid was shooting a gun towards another kid and the cat was running across the way, and ran into one of the stray bullets. what a waste of my view time that was.

We are supposed to boycott because of a pesky cat!! Only in Ireland.. The murders, rape, beatings and drug crimes are ok then. Cat lobbyists are an odd bunch…

Typical. Complain about anything.
Have ye nothing better to do. Yes you all have an opinion but cop on.
 IT WAS FAKE.
Wake up and smell the roses.
Then again maybe dont. You might kill a bee in the process.
That would bee, I mean BE bad.

So Brian, your trying start a debate on a story that has nothing to do with abortion. There are plenty of website’s out there where you can debate this matter.

Considering that we aren’t talking about the above story, I have a vent in my room but I’m not sure will I cover it up. I leave my windows open during the day so the vent is pointless and it’s only leaving in a draft at nighttime. Anybody have idea’s with what to use to cover it, can’t block it permanently as its rented accommodation.
