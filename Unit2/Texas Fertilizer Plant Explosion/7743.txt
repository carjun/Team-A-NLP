Host Chad Crawford takes you from Key Largo thru Key West to show you the best of the Florida Keys — and why the Conch Republic has a rhythm all its own. See marine life up close and personal at Captain Slate's Atlantis Dive Center in Key Largo, build your fly fishing skills, go lobstering and dive on a shipwreck — all within the span of a little over a hundred miles.
