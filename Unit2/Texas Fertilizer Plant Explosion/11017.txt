vintage synth demo by RetroSoundRoland Jupiter-4 4-Voice Analog Synthesizer from the year 1978. The JP-4 sound is very warm and organic. The 4 VCO`s are always a bit out of tune but this is the typical JP-4 sound. A very nice analog synth! Unfortunately a bit underrated. Not compared to the bigger JP-6 or JP-8. For me the best sounded Jupiter.the demo shows some sound settings, arpeggiator and unisono modeFX: Lexicon MPX for delay and reverbused by: Human League, Depeche Mode (Vince Clark), Tears for Fears, Duran Duran, Vangelis, Thomas Dolby....more info: http://www.retrosound.de andhttp://www.myspace.com/retrosound72
