Geopolitics refers broadly to the relationship between politics and territory on local or international scale. Specifically, it is a method of foreign policy analysis, by which to try and understand, explain and predict international political behavior primarily in terms of geographical variables. This concerns factors such as: geographic location, size of the involved countries, topography, demography, natural resources and technological development among many other factors.

Rules


On this subreddit, we encourage long, in depth articles. Geopolitics and Foreign Affairs are complicated subjects and cannot be explained in a few sentences. Instead of bringing the latest news first, the focus should be on in depth analysis of the news.
We encourage discussion and welcome anyone to pose hypotheses and ask questions. Discussions don't have to based on a posted article. Self-posts are allowed. 
Comments should be as long as you think they need to be in order to explain yourself. TL; DR's are not encouraged.
We welcome articles and videos from most sources. We do not automatically remove blogposts but frequent blogspamming will result in a ban.
This is not a place to discuss general news or domestic politics.
This is not a place to discuss conspiracy theories.


/u/TheTruthYouHate1 was kind enough to share some neat archives on China, North Korea and the War on Terror.
