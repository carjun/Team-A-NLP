permalinksavecontextfull comments (844)What story are you NEVER telling your kids?[NSFW]  by  Dhankins98in  AskReddit[+]iamaredditer 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]iamaredditer 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoDamn bro!  So you're a cop?  I'm sorry for the ordeal you endured.  Maybe you should sue her for defamation of character.  Cops stick together for the most part.  However there are some cops that justice and truth is above everything else including the politics of the office.  I dealt with cops that were all about proper justice.  I am very lucky.  It sucks when your good name get's drug through the mud.  Been there and done that.  I am currently paying off some of her fraudulent spending on my credit card.  I could have prosecuted and she would have gone to jail, but the part I left out of all of this was her little girl.  I loved that little girl so much that I let her mom off the hook for fraud so she could continue to raise her.  My friends tell me I'm a better man than they could ever be but honestly I could never destroy the image of her mother in her little eyes.  
I know how you feel about the liquor store charges.  I was spending $42/day every day for about 6 months.  20 bucks a day on the beer then 9 bucks a bottle X2 per day + tax.  I was spending a very nice house payment each month on just alcohol.  And get this we were both smokers throw in almost 10 bucks a day in smokes.  Yeah we were very sick at that time.  We were spending around 1500 bucks per month on shit you never actually own.  ------Face Palm!
I hope you're doing better after this ordeal and use this experience to allow you to see both sides of the situation.  
My dad is retired hwy patrol.  He went through the academy when it was old school and a couple dudes died during boxing sessions.  He said that one of his instructors during the class time said something that always stuck with him "Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear."  My dad was later invited to become part of the Texas Rangers.  (not the baseball team)  
Good luck bro!  I would be glad to know a cop like you that knew how easy it is to sway a listening ear and knowing better than to fall for the dansel in distress with blood on her knuckles.  
My father's words have stuck out in all aspects of my life.  (even though I'm not a cop)
"Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear."
