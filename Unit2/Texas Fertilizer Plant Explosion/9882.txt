This was not the first aggravated assault charge brought on Striler.  He was accused of spanking his mistress for being a naughty, naughty little girl.  She liked it.  She was bad.  In 1969, Striler was arrested after shooting a neighbor four times. However, because Striler claimed to have a psychiatric condition, his sentence was reduced.
In 2005, a jury convicted Striler of attempted first-degree murder. On March 17, 2006, Judge Rand Rubin sentenced Striler to life in prison, plus twenty-five years. In addition, Striler was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $3,000 in restitution to Curry.
