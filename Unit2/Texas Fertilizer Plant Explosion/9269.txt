This is after Joel and Ellie leave the hydro electric dam after meeting up with Joel's brother and they set off for the Firefly lab at the college. I had just cleared the dorm filled with about 6 clickers and 1 bloater. I came out of the dorm, power the gate to let Ellie and the horse through. Once I mounted the horse she had her horrible glitch. She stayed like that until I moved to the area where they see the monkeys running around and she loaded fine.

So when the come in once a month, they are usually disgusting in need of haircuts etc... They also "evolve" and start doing these weird things and wear weird clothing that they normally wouldn't.
Fast forward, we meet up with them on this one particular time they were home and they had just bought a new truck. The text was intended for my wife as an "across the room text message" but, mom received it. It went as follows:
"Jesus fucking christ, kill me. Kill me violently! Look at my dads fag haircut that matches his new fag earring. And WTF is my mom wearing!? Leopard print pants!? gag PS, dad showed me that truck. Talk about a POS... 190000 miles on it and they are paying over $30000!? Icing on top... they have Real Tree Camo steering wheel cover, seat covers and floor mats! WTF MAN!"
The rest of the day was so awfully awkward and I made my mom cry. Shit sucked...
