The ENT I went to said 1/5 of my eardrum was missing.  It grew back, and I did have some hearing loss for a while, but as far as I can tell my hearing is fine now.', 'It was the second most painful thing I\'ve experienced, following my broken tailbone.  I\'m lucky I was able to get out of the pool because I couldn\'t tell which way was up and no one was paying attention to me.  I crawled out of the pool and fell over on the concrete because I had no balance.  It was miserable and the doctors couldn\'t do anything to treat it or and didn\'t do anything for the pain.  They just looked at it and sent me home.
