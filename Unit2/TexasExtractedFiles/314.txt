In east Texas they tried to put the courthouse within a days horseback ride of everyone, couldn't do that in west Texas though or every house in 1880 would have a judge in it. Some are smaller because of social/economic differences, or because of drainage areas (water matters).", 'However, in the northeast US the counties were always divided into townships (which has nothing to do with towns, a township can contain many large "villages"), and these have become more important than the counties some places. California and some other western states followed the northeastern pattern originally, but now people out there can\'t even tell you what town they live in.', "permalinksaveparent[+]Isatis_tinctoria 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours ago (7 children)[]Isatis_tinctoria 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours agoI see what you're saying.

And the Federal District Courts never have a interesting architecture as the County Courthouse down the street.", "The reason people like to file federal suits there has to do with the local politics (which determines the judge; who's even around to be appointed judge) and with the make up of the 5th circuit, the next level on appeal, and the most conservative in the US.", "(I was a history undergrad and went to law school (what else do history undergrads do?), but I knew I didn't have the personality for it by 3L (I passed the bar anyway though).

I work for a smaller than giant publisher, they call me a copy editor, which sounds grander than it is. It isn't editor, it is closer to proofreader, but I'm not that good at wrangling commas.

But they approach it from completely different angles. Linguistics is my favorite autodidact study, and I wince every time Scolia wanders into that area (which he does way more often than he needs too). (Douglas and Cordozo did so much better and they didn't even know linguistics was a field).", "Studying law is going to teach you how to parse a sentence better than any course in the English Department or any other field. But when you move to writing fiction or journalism, you have to remember you aren't writing for people getting paid to find ways to misunderstand you (you've left combat); you're being paid (indirectly) by peeps that want to get to the next paragraph quickly and understand what the last one said.
