If there is a God, then He gave us brains for deduction.  When something we say can mean multiple things, which we often do because language isn't perfect, we trust that the people who have gotten to know us will be able to deduce what we meant from everything else we have ever said to them.  You don't go around just taking one, or two sentences, anyone said and make conclusions out of them.  When we read we should be asking ourselves what the writer necessarily means.  We take the possibilities and we start to compare them to all of the evidence.

He was possibly saying that we shall forgive those who wouldn\'t otherwise be able to be forgiven.  It\'s best shown in the parable after Peter asked him how many times he should forgive his brother.  People overlook the part about the masters slave being unable to pay back his debts (Matthew 18:~40).  They also overlook that the slave had to ask for forgiveness in a contrite manner.  But my point here is that renumeration should be made if possible.  That never changed.  Even the process of forgiveness didn\'t change, and the sanctuary system described in the OT clearly shows that the offender needed to make a sacrifice suitable to their income level.  All of Matthew 18 is really dealing with this, and the context is about those who are fellow believers.  Verses 15-17 deal with the process of judgement and punishment.  It can be seen in action in 1 Corinthians 5.  The church was supposed to deal with these offenses between church members.  Anyone disagreeing with the church on being punished would be removed from church membership, but of course not in a mean way or in a way that their family and friends would have to disown them.', "permalinksavecontextfull comments (1552)So why DON'T Adventist's believe that EGW is a prophet?  by  redman7tin  exAdventist[+]musexistential 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago \xc2\xa0(0 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]musexistential 0 points1 point2 points 27 days agoTheir behavior is very tribal.
