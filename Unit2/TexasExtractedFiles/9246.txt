['This forum is heavily moderated by people who support both the Israeli and Palestinian positions.  The goal is to have an honest and hate-free environment to discuss problems, solutions, and to try to bring people together in a common understanding.', 'Be polite -  Disagreements are fine ... but we want to keep this discussion civil', "Be open minded - We are here to learn from one another and foster understanding.  Try to see where the other person is coming from even if you don't agree with them.", 'What is good: Anything that fosters discussion and can help people to see a different perspective.', 'What is bad: Clearly one-sided stories that are more about accusations rather than openness and understanding.  Think about it this way ... if your article serves to primarily make one group or another look bad ... it will be removed.', 'Middle ground: If you feel that you can add to the discussion with an article that fits the "bad" category; submit it as text with an explanation and the link in your description.', 'we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but', 'username:try anotheravailable!account recovery email: (optional)we only send email at your requestpassword:verify password:remember mecreate accountis it really that easy? only one way to find out...loginalready have an account and just want to login?username:password:remember merecover passwordloginclose this windowinterface languageEnglish [en] [ar] (*)  [be] (*)  [bg] (*)catal [ca] (*)esky [cs]dansk [da] (*)Deutsch [de] [el]English (Australia) [en-au] (*)English (Canadian) [en-ca] (*)English (Great Britain) [en-gb]English [en-us] (*)Esperanto [eo] (*)espaol [es]espaol [es-ar]eesti keel [et] (*)Euskara [eu] [fa] (*)suomi [fi] (*)franais [fr] [he] (*)  [hi] (*)hrvatski [hr]Magyar [hu] (*)  [hy] (*)Bahasa Indonesia [id] (*)slenska [is] (*)italiano (Italy) [it] [ja] (*) [ko] (*)Latin [la] (*)1337 [leet]LOL [lol] (*)lietuvi kalba [lt] (*)latvieu valoda [lv] (*)Nederlands [nl]Nynorsk [nn]Norsk [no]Arrrrrrrr!
