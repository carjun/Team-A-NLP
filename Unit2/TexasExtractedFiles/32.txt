Love Doll" features a buxom young woman who looks remarkably similar to Cyrus, holding a guitar and nearly exposing her privates.The box promises that the blow-up doll has "3 achey love holes"  perhaps an X-rated nod to Billy Ray Cyrus\' hit song, "Achy Breaky Heart."In an alternate version, the item\'s packaging features the look-alike posing provocatively with a microphone."The wait is over!" the box reads.
