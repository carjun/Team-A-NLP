Also, some areas tax different items differently. For example, if I go to the grocery 1 mile west of me, it's 7% sales tax. If I go 1 mile east, it's 0% sales tax because that county doesn't allow taxing grocery. When I lived in Columbus, OH they didn't tax grocery there either, and any kind of takeout food was considered a grocery item. Where I live now, there is an additional tax on takeout / fast food items.
