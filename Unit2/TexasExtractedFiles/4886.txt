['The deadly fire and explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant highlights the often-overlooked risks of storing large amounts of potentially combustible fertilizer, a common practice across rural America.', 'The West Fertilizer Co. plant had operated in the small town of West, Texas, for more than half a century, little noticed by neighbors or government regulators.', 'The fertilizer plant has just always been there and the town just grew out that way, said Floyd Wolf, a utility designer and lifelong resident who was at home when the walls started shaking Wednesday evening. Over time, the plants neighbors grew to include two schools and a nursing home. We never thought about an explosion, Mr. Wolf said.', 'According to a report filed to state and local officials as required by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency, the West Fertilizer plant stored as much as 540,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and 110,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. It is one of at least 587 Texas facilities that store anhydrous ammonia, according to an analysis of EPA data by the Center for Effective Government, a private group. West Fertilizer employed seven people, according to its EPA filing.', 'The explosive properties of ammonia-based fertilizers are well documented. Ammonium-nitrate fertilizer exploded aboard a ship docked near Texas City, Texas in 1947, killing 581 people in one of the nations worst industrial accidents. Ammonium nitrate is considered stable, but is highly flammable when exposed to heat or other sources of energy. Ammonium nitrate can also be used to make bombs.', 'There are hundreds of distributors like West Fertilizer scattered across farm states. The businesses and farmer cooperatives take delivery from fertilizer producers and resell it to area farmers, often making blends to match soil conditions or other local factors. Fertilizer is moved around the nation by rail, barge and truck, with U.S. farmers using 60.4 million tons in 2011, the most recent data, up 8.6% from 2010, according to the Fertilizer Institute, a trade group.', 'The end product, either they use it as fertilizer or they use it as bombs, said Kim Nibarger, health and safety specialist for the United Steelworkers. When its fertilizer, its OK. But when its mixed with diesel or petroleum products, its volatile.', 'Despite their prevalence and risks, fertilizer operations often receive little regulatory oversight. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration hadnt conducted an inspection at the West Fertilizer plant since 1985, according to its records.', 'There are a number of workplaces the agency will never get to, said Peg Seminario, an expert in workplace safety for the AFL-CIO. Absent there being a fatality or a worker complaint, youre not likely to inspect these places.', 'The EPA fined the plant $2,300 in 2006 for not having an emergency plan for handling anhydrous ammonia; operators were supposed to file the plan in 2004. The most recent plan, filed in 2011, said the operation did not pose a risk of either explosion or fire.', 'Both the EPA and OSHA dont specifically cover ammonium nitrate for their risk-management planning programs, according to experts, since explosives arent covered under those requirements. (Wests storage of anhydrous ammonia, a toxic gas hazard, was regulated by the EPAs risk management program.)', 'The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said it had investigated the facility several times, initially in 2002 after dust complaints, and didnt find nuisance conditions. A 2006 inspection after a separate complaint of a very bad ammonia smell found that the plant didnt have required air-emission permits. The plant applied for and received the permits later that year. The commission also required the plant to install a cement barrier to protect the storage tanks. The commission said it hadnt received any other complaints about the plant.', 'In January 2012, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer more than $5,000 for transporting anhydrous ammonia in unauthorized cargo tanks and for failing to develop and follow a security plan, according to agency records.', 'Safety advocates say fertilizer-storage facilities are lower priorities for regulators than larger polluters, like power plants and refineries. Neither Texas nor the federal government restricts where facilities storing ammonia or chlorine can operate, said Neil Carman, a former inspector for the environmental-quality commission who is now the director of Sierra Clubs clean-air program in Texas.', 'These things fly under the radar, Mr. Carman said. I guess its surprising there arent more accidents, he said.', 'On Thursday, government officials flooded the small town of 2,800 people. The EPA said it is working with Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Texas Committee on Environmental Quality to monitor air quality in the area. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which investigates chemical accidents, dispatched an investigative team.', 'The town and the fertilizer plant grew up together. The Plasek family started the company as Texas Grain Storage Inc. in 1957, according to a lawsuit the company filed in 2007. It later built a small fertilizer-blend plant and started selling fertilizer to area farmers.', 'Zak Covar, executive director of the environmental-quality commission, said the fertilizer storage and blending facility had existed since 1962, before permits were required, and was allowed to remain on the site.', 'The Plasek family sold the plant around 2006. Texas corporation records list the current president as Donald R. Adair, who couldnt be located Thursday.', 'Matt Nors, 30 years old, owner of the Nors Sausage and Burger house on Main Street, said he didnt think any of the workers were in the plant during the explosion.', 'As schools, apartments and nursing homes were built around the plants, safety never crossed our minds, Mr. Nors said. It wasnt an issue.', 'Write to                 Alexandra Berzon at alexandra.berzon@wsj.com, Ben Lefebvre at ben.lefebvre@dowjones.com and Daniel Gilbert at daniel.gilbert@wsj.com', 'Latest Headlines is home to all the latest, up to the minute news headlines from The Wall Street Journal in a streaming continuous headline experience.']
