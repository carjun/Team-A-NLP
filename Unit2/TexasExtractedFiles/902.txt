NEW YORK DAILY NEWS    Published: Tuesday, August 21, 2012, 12:47 AM  Updated: Tuesday, August 21, 2012, 3:58 AM                 Print            Print  Comment            Howard Simmons/New York Daily News", 'Melky Cabrera is obviously not safe from the people who are giving him bad advice.', "Related Stories   Melky Cabrera's positive test for testosterone could give TV networks pause", 'Ed Coleman has one problem with the Daily News Sunday story about Melky Cabreras attempt to beat baseballs drug rap through a bogus website.', 'And it has nothing to do with the Giants outfielder. Or whatever role he had in concocting the idiotic scheme.', 'The only problem I have is the Levinsons (Cabreras agents Sam and Seth) have been drawn into it, Coleman said Sunday on WFAN. They have nothing to do with it. I have known them for years. No one is more above board.', 'The bizarre plan, designed to get Cabreras 50-game suspension for testing positive for testosterone overturned, and the notion whoever authored and approved it actually thought they could get away with it, has brought an unusual focus on the people around the player.', 'According to the Daily News report, Juan Nunez, whom the Levinsons call a paid consultant to their company  ACES  has taken sole responsibility for the website. Nunez said the Levinson brothers were not involved.', 'In the long and winding history of baseball performance-enhancing drug scandals other lackeys, toadies and sycophants  like Greg Anderson, Barry Bonds trainer, or Angel Presinal, Alex Rodriguezs mule, er, cousin  have been part of the medias narrative.', 'But in this case, the attempt to create a fictitious website, which included a make-believe sports cream, has brought a comical touch to a deadly serious matter, which could eventually have someone gazing out at freedom from the wrong side of a jail cell.', 'Can you be slapped down for stupidity? Do you give (whoever came up with the idea) points for creativity? Mike Golic asked Monday on ESPN Radio. After all, its a lot better than the dog ate my homework.', 'Face it, the kind of planning that went into the Lufthansa heist didnt go into this caper.', 'I would have loved to have been in that room, Golic said. You could just hear these guys: Yeah, it could work. We can create a website and say okay, Melky, youre cool. ', 'Yes, this wasnt such a great day for the Gang Who Couldnt Think Straight.', 'And since the Levinsons admitted to bringing Nunez in as a paid consultant, and since he has admitted to creating the phony site, we wonder what particular skill sets attracted the Levinsons to him in the first place?', 'According to Seth Levinson, Nunez, who speaks Spanish, was hired to help the agents sign and take care of their Dominican clients. Could there have been other skills? The last time we checked, there were no shortage of folks around here who speak Spanish.', 'Just not great decisions by Melky or whoever else is helping him with these decisions, John Kruk said Sunday on ESPNs Baseball Tonight.', 'Players dont believe the (drug) test is state of the art. Either that or (they believe) the cheating performance-enhancing substances are ahead of the testing, Curt Schilling added on the broadcast. He (Cabrera) clearly thought he was going to be able to get away with doing this.', 'Steve Berthiaume suggested to Kruk and Schilling that this was a situation where someone whispers in someones ears and tells them how to beat the system even if you get caught.', 'This is no surprise. I havent talked to anybody (in baseball) who says: Im shocked that this still happens. Theres always a way to get around the drug test thing. Theres nothing you can do about it, Kruk said. But to say the issue is over because theres drug testing now? Its been proven that aint happening.', 'Neither are those mysterious people around these players, shadows MLB cant control. The market for them apparently is growing. How many more will surface during this Cabrera investigation? How many will eventually be busted?', "Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in  .
