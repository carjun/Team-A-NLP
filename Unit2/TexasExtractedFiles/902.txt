Or whatever role he had in concocting the idiotic scheme.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe only problem I have is the Levinsons (Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s agents Sam and Seth) have been drawn into it,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman said Sunday on WFAN. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have nothing to do with it. I have known them for years. No one is more above board.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tThe bizarre plan, designed to get Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s 50-game suspension for testing positive for testosterone overturned, and the notion whoever authored and approved it actually thought they could get away with it, has brought an unusual focus on the people \xe2\x80\x9caround\xe2\x80\x9d the player.', '\tAccording to the Daily News report, Juan Nunez, whom the Levinsons call a \xe2\x80\x9cpaid consultant\xe2\x80\x9d to their company \xe2\x80\x94 ACES \xe2\x80\x94 has taken sole responsibility for the website. Nunez said the Levinson brothers were not involved.', '\tIn the long and winding history of baseball performance-enhancing drug scandals other lackeys, toadies and sycophants \xe2\x80\x94 like Greg Anderson, Barry Bonds\xe2\x80\x99 trainer, or Angel Presinal, Alex Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s mule, er, cousin \xe2\x80\x94 have been part of the media\xe2\x80\x99s narrative.', '\tBut in this case, the attempt to create a fictitious website, which included a make-believe sports cream, has brought a comical touch to a deadly serious matter, which could eventually have someone gazing out at freedom from the wrong side of a jail cell.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cCan you be slapped down for stupidity? Do you give (whoever came up with the idea) points for creativity?\xe2\x80\x9d Mike Golic asked Monday on ESPN Radio. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot better than the dog ate my homework.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tFace it, the kind of planning that went into the Lufthansa heist didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into this caper.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cI would have loved to have been in that room,\xe2\x80\x9d Golic said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could just hear these guys: \xe2\x80\x98Yeah, it could work. We can create a website and say okay, Melky, you\xe2\x80\x99re cool.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d', '\tYes, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a great day for the Gang Who Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Think Straight.', '\tAnd since the Levinsons admitted to bringing Nunez in as a \xe2\x80\x9cpaid consultant,\xe2\x80\x9d and since he has admitted to creating the phony site, we wonder what particular skill sets attracted the Levinsons to him in the first place?', '\tAccording to Seth Levinson, Nunez, who speaks Spanish, was hired to help the agents sign and take care of their Dominican clients. Could there have been other skills? The last time we checked, there were no shortage of folks around here who speak Spanish.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cJust not great decisions by Melky or whoever else is helping him with these decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d John Kruk said Sunday on ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBaseball Tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cPlayers don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the (drug) test is state of the art. Either that or (they believe) the cheating performance-enhancing substances are ahead of the testing,\xe2\x80\x9d Curt Schilling added on the broadcast. \xe2\x80\x9cHe (Cabrera) clearly thought he was going to be able to get away with doing this.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tSteve Berthiaume suggested to Kruk and Schilling that this was a situation where \xe2\x80\x9csomeone whispers in someone\xe2\x80\x99s ears\xe2\x80\x9d and tells them how to beat the system even if you get caught.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no surprise. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to anybody (in baseball) who says: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m shocked that this still happens.\xe2\x80\x99 There\xe2\x80\x99s always a way to get around the drug test thing. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can do about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Kruk said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to say the issue is over because there\xe2\x80\x99s drug testing now? It\xe2\x80\x99s been proven that ain\xe2\x80\x99t happening.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tNeither are those mysterious \xe2\x80\x9cpeople around\xe2\x80\x9d these players, shadows MLB can\xe2\x80\x99t control. The market for them apparently is growing. How many more will surface during this Cabrera investigation? How many will eventually be busted?', "   Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in \xc2\xbb .
