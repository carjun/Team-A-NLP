Not if he keeps pitching the way he has in his past three outings.', '\tSabathia took a matter-of-fact approach with his comments as he fielded one question after another about his lack of velocity. Where most power pitchers would shy away from the inevitable loss of a few ticks on their fastball, Sabathia was practically embracing it.

If all that work is finally catching up with Sabathia, is he due for a drop-off that will make the Yankees regret adding another year plus a vesting option to his $161 million contract two years ago?', '\tSabathia was admittedly terrible in the first inning Wednesday, needing 31 pitches to record the first three outs against Arizona. Paul Goldschmidt belted a two-run homer on a dreadful changeup to give the Diamondbacks a quick lead, making Sabathia consider abandoning the pitch for the rest of the night.', '\tBut Francisco Cervelli kept calling the pitch, so Sabathia kept throwing it.

I would have just left it alone.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tIncredibly, Sabathia didn\xe2\x80\x99t throw a single pitch harder than 89 mph after the fifth inning, yet he sat down nine of the 10 batters he faced over that span, throwing only 26 pitches to get through his final three frames.', '\tTwo weeks ago in Detroit, Torii Hunter said Sabathia was no longer the thrower he was in Cleveland, but rather a guy who has learned how to pitch with the best of them.
