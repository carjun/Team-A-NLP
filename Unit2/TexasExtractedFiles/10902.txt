That is weird, you are weird, and whatever culture you come from that does this as a tradition or whatever is weird as well.  Sorry, I'm sure you're a nice person and are probably very smart and all that but countries that have and use water treatment are not inherently lazy because of that.

You will stop noticing it after awhile.  I believe it's called banding.  I bought a new set last year and noticed the banding when I brought it home.  Took it back for an identical set and had the same problem.  I went to the store with some gray test slides (really made the banding stand out) on a USB stick and displayed it on every LED model that I could, they all exhibited the same issue to some degree.

It took me an afternoon and greatly improved my commute.  Replace the factory speakers while you're at it.  I'm not sure if they still do this, but I got the dash kit for half off when I bought the head unit through crutchfield, harness for free.  I got the kit that replaces the stock radio paneling, rather than the one that fits in the spot where the cubby mounts.  It fits well but the color is a bit off and the contour doesn't quite match the rest of the console, but it still looks good.
