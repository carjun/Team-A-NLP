The identities of the deceased weren\xe2\x80\x99t released.As many as 35 people were unaccounted for as of yesterday evening, including five volunteer firefighters, four emergency medical personnel, an off-duty Dallas firefighter and two local people who stopped to help at the scene of the fire at Adair Grain that preceded the explosion, West Mayor Tommy Muska said. The facility had a stockpile of ammonium nitrate, a nitrogen fertilizer so volatile that it has been used by terrorists to build truck bombs.\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounded like a mortar round -- whoomp!\xe2\x80\x9d when the facility erupted, Robert Neill, who lives three blocks from Adair Grain, said in an interview today.The explosion, which rocked the town of 2,800 residents with the force of a small earthquake, destroyed about 50 homes, three of the town\xe2\x80\x99s fire trucks and an emergency medical services vehicle, Reyes said. Authorities didn\xe2\x80\x99t say where they had found the bodies.Nursing HomeThe death toll is the highest for a U.S industrial catastrophe since April 2010, when 29 coal miners perished in Massey Energy Co.\xe2\x80\x99s Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia. Waco Police Sergeant William Patrick Stanton said yesterday that as the search of the ruins progresses, the number of dead may rise. Waco is 20 miles south of West and is the seat of McLennan County.Firefighters in West were already battling a blaze at the plant, and had begun evacuating nearby residents, when it exploded about 7:53 p.m. local time. A nursing home, hospital and two schools are situated within a mile of the facility on the northeast edge of town.Neill, a 67-year-old Vietnam War veteran, watched as firefighters tried to douse the fire burning at the top of a tower similar to a grain silo. He realized the firefighters weren\xe2\x80\x99t making progress because the wind was dispersing the water from their hoses before it reached the flames.Neill was trying to evacuate with his son when the mill exploded, crumpling a tire on his pickup truck and showering them with windshield glass.Deadliest AccidentsAmmonium nitrate was responsible for some of the deadliest industrial accidents in the last century, including a 1947 explosion in Texas City, Texas, that killed more than 570, said John Verkade, a chemistry professor at Iowa State University in Ames.There were no indications that the fire or explosion was triggered intentionally, Swanton said yesterday. Teams of urban search-and-rescue experts known as Texas Task Forces 1 and 2 arrived on the scene yesterday. A contingent of forensic chemists and explosive specialists from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also was deployed.The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which looks into industrial chemical accidents, said on its website yesterday that a \xe2\x80\x9clarge investigation team\xe2\x80\x9d had been sent to West.A 2011 inspection of the plant by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration revealed violations of material-handling rules, according to an agency document. The inspector said the company planned to ship anhydrous ammonia in unauthorized cargo tanks, and had failed to develop a security plan for the transportation.EPA FineThe agency initially proposed a fine of $10,100. It was reduced to $5,250 last year, which the company paid. The agency said in its final order in the matter that the company had addressed the violations and \xe2\x80\x9cno further corrective actions are required.\xe2\x80\x99The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inspected the West plant\xe2\x80\x99s risk management plan in March 2006 and found deficiencies. The EPA fined the facility $2,300 in August of that year and directed Adair Grain to correct the shortcomings, Alisha Johnson, an agency spokeswoman, said by e-mail.--With assistance from David Mildenberg in Austin, Darrell Preston in Dallas and Jack Kaskey in Houston.
