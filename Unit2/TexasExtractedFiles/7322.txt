Drag racing is a well-conceived, well executed racer that\xe2\x80\x99ll keep petrolheads coming back for more." - Michael Brook, Life of Android ***TIPS:0. Updating the game- Your cars and money are saved on your device. DO NOT EVER uninstall the game before updating, or you will lose ALL of your stuff.1. Racing- Launch and shift when the dashboard indicator turns blue or green - If there is too much wheelspin, you are not going anywhere - watch the orange indicator on your dashboard - Once you learn how to drive properly, ignore the lights and find your own winning strategy - Nitrous is more effective on underpowered cars with lots of grip. Timing is crucial!2. Cars and upgrades- Test drive before you buy a car!- The more your car costs, the tougher opposition you\'ll face both offline and online- Upgrades count towards increasing car cost/level, while tuning doesn\'t- Keep your car cost just under your level cap to get an advantage- Adjusting gear ratios (Garage -> Upgrade -> Tune) is costly, but lets you achieve times that are impossible on stock settings3. Game modes and winnings- Race against beginner/amateur AI to get some quick cash and build your car- Defeat bosses and unlock achievements for extra RP- Go online and race against others to earn maximum cash/RP- If your car isn\'t ready for online races, earn some cash in "Drivers Battle"- For the ultimate challenge, race against top players in Pro League4. Misc- Like http://facebook.com/DragRacingGame for news and strategy- Visit the official forums: http://www.dragracingforum.net- Try playing with vibration on (enable it in the "Settings" menu)!- If the game runs slow on your phone, use the task manager to kill unnecessary background tasks- XPERIA PLAY Optimized                    1  Free     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Slingshot Racing     Crescent Moon Games    1  $0.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           Slingshot Racing is an original racing game developed exclusively for touchscreen devices.

The trio made an album that was truly progressive and also super catchy and fun. The follow-up, Some Nights, ramps up the ambition and sonic bombast, but also manages to be even more powerful and impressive. While writing and planning the album, singer Nate Ruess, guitarist Jack Antonoff, and multi-instrumentalist Andrew Dost were heavily influenced by both the sound and scope of Kanye West\'s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and made every attempt to achieve something similar, even to the point of hiring that album\'s co-producer Jeff Bhasker to produce and craft beats for them. (Also Emile Haynie, who has worked with Eminem among others) Though the album has more of a hip-hop influence than Aim and Ignite did, there are still large doses of Queen and ELO coursing through the band\'s blood, both in the machine-crafted vocal harmonies and the ornate bigness of the sound. The album is overloaded with strings and horns, backing vocals, keyboards, and programmed drums surrounding Ruess like a clamoring crowd, but never drowning out his innately sincere vocals and painfully honest lyrics. He has the kind of voice that could cut through any amount of noise, not by using volume but honesty. Even when he\'s fed through Auto-Tune, you know he\'s telling you the truth all the time. On songs like the lead single "We Are Young" or the rollicking "All Alone," he provides a very human core that grounds things even as the music builds to ornate crescendos. Indeed, the album is really, really big sounding and could easily have ended up collapsing under its own weight and pretension, but the opposite happens and Some Nights takes flight instead. The songs are both anthemic and human-sized, the heartfelt words and naked emotions are never buried, and the music is uplifting, not overpowering. The trio has crafted a record that measures up to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy musically and delivers enough emotional charge to power a small town for a month. It\'s an impressive achievement and Fun. deserves every bit of acclaim that comes its way because of it.Tim Sendra, Rovi                    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Clarity (Deluxe)     Zedd    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           After releasing huge hits on Steve Aoki\'s Dim Mak and Skrillex\'s OWSLA labels, 23-year-old Zedd unleashes an album\'s worth of peak-time dance-pop gold.

If you prefer more hypnotic vibes, "Stache" and "Shave It Up" are heavy-hitting floor-fillers.

After putting his entire generation on his back with the acclaimed (if rambling) sociological treatise Section 80, the Compton rapper turns the lens back on himself with his major label debut. good kid m.A.A.d city is an autobiographical rap album of epic proportions, told by more than one narrator and across an overlong sprawl of multi-movement songs and interwoven skits. It\'s a record so ambitious\xe2\x80\x94arrogant even\xe2\x80\x94that it would seem destined to be a complete mess. And yet good kid never comes unhinged. In part this is due to its stunning production bed, which contemporizes Outkast\'s space age thump and rounds out the more decadent musical affections of The Roots, but mostly it succeeds because Kendrick is just a superb rapper. His rhymes are elastic, his cadences melt rhythms and he possesses an eye for writerly detail that evokes Nas in his prime.

But even then, he displayed a vocal style closer to a cross between Chris Martin and Dave Matthews, and it\'s that amalgam that he explores on his debut album. Tracks like "Gone, Gone, Gone" and "Hold On" have all the grandeur of Coldplay times ten, while the combination of acoustic axes and anthemic touches on other tracks underlines a Mumford & Sons influence. The disco-tinged "Get Up Get Down" nods to Phillips\' funkier side, but for the most part, we hear him trading groove-based moves for grand drama and panoramic pop.Jim Allen, Google Play                    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Overexposed     Maroon 5    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           For Adam Levine, love and sex are wars, and he\'s a soldier who can\'t help but be wounded and tortured by all the gorgeous women he engages in battle.

However, despite his unprecedented success, there\'s still a question as to whether he can apply his now trademark, demonic, wobble bass drops and thumping syncopated beats to a whole album. Named after the battle cry of the lost boys in Steven Spielberg\'s "Hook", his fourth consecutive EP Bangarang (also his first Top 40 entry in both the U.K. and U.S.) suggests he\'ll have to be on his game on the forthcoming full-length Voltage if he\'s to avoid an Emperor\'s New Clothes scenario. While the bombastic Wall of Sound displayed on 2010\'s Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites initially provided a unique take on the U.K. dubstep genre, Skrillex\'s lack of progression means there\'s a distinct sense of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu among its seven tracks, particularly on the relentless, scattershot bleeps, chopped-up vocal hooks, and repetitive loops of opener "Right In" and the rap-metal fusion of "Kyoto." Even when he does think outside the box -- as on "Right on Time," a percussive, hard house collaboration with 12th Planet and Kill the Noise which eventually builds into a feverish slice of happy hardcore, and "The Devil\'s Den," a chaotic hook-up with Wolfgang Gartner which takes in everything from old-school rave to ska to techno -- the results are more headache-inducing than thrilling. There are a few more encouraging signs, such as the Doors-featuring "Breakin\' a Sweat," which combines proggy guitar hooks, psychedelic organ chords, and Jim Morrison samples with a snarling, Prodigy-esque vocal and a filthy slab of dub bass to produce one of the year\'s most unexpectedly successful partnerships, and the multi-layered trance of closer "Summit," given an ethereal sheen thanks to Ellie Goulding\'s lilting tones, both of which suggest Skrillex should utilize his melodic leanings more often. But overall, Bangarang is a disappointingly formulaic affair which hints for the first time that the wheels may soon slowly begin to fall off.                    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Greatest Hits     The Notorious B.I.G.    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                             1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Sublime     Sublime    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           Sublime\'s eponymous major-label debut arrived a few months after the band\'s leader, Brad Nowell, died tragically of a heroin overdose. As a show of sympathy, the album tended to be slightly overrated in some critical quarters, who claimed that Nowell was an exceptionally gifted lyricist and musical hybridist, but Sublime doesn\'t quite support those claims. Even so, the trio does have a surprising grace in its unabashedly traditionalist fusion of Californian hardcore punk, light hip-hop, and reggae. Switching between bracing hardcore and slow, sexy reggae numbers, Sublime display supple, muscular versatility and, on occasion, a gift for ingratiatingly catchy hooks, as on the hit single "What I Got." What they don\'t have is the vision -- either lyrical or musical -- to maintain interest throughout the course of the entire album. Sublime sags when the band delves too deeply into their dub aspirations or when their lyrics slide into smirking humor. The low moments don\'t arrive that often -- by and large, the album is quite engaging -- but they happen frequently enough to make the record a demonstration of the band\'s blossoming ability, but not the fulfillment of their full potential. Of course, Nowell\'s death gives the record a certain pathos, but that doesn\'t make the album any stronger.Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi                    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Born To Die     Lana Del Rey    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           Lana Del Rey\'s debut Born To Die was confounding indie critics long before its release, simply by being unapologetically pop.

That song\'s persona, its sedative languor and sweeping strings inform much of Born to Die\'s ballads, but so do moody hip-hop beats and distorted background shouts that recall, among other things, Kanye West\'s "Runaway." Better still are the more sprightly and playfully knowing pop moments of "Off to the Races, "Diet Mountain Dew," "Radio" and  "National Anthem," where Del Rey almost breaks into a rap cadence. Of course Lana Del Rey is a put-on, but it\'s not an unpromising act.Eric Grandy, Google Play                    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                 Show More     \xc2\xa92013 Google  Site Terms of Service  Devices Terms of Sale  Privacy Policy  Developers  Artists   ']

Updating the game- Your cars and money are saved on your device. DO NOT EVER uninstall the game before updating, or you will lose ALL of your stuff.1. Racing- Launch and shift when the dashboard indicator turns blue or green - If there is too much wheelspin, you are not going anywhere - watch the orange indicator on your dashboard - Once you learn how to drive properly, ignore the lights and find your own winning strategy - Nitrous is more effective on underpowered cars with lots of grip. Timing is crucial!2. Cars and upgrades- Test drive before you buy a car!- The more your car costs, the tougher opposition you\'ll face both offline and online- Upgrades count towards increasing car cost/level, while tuning doesn\'t- Keep your car cost just under your level cap to get an advantage- Adjusting gear ratios (Garage -> Upgrade -> Tune) is costly, but lets you achieve times that are impossible on stock settings3. Game modes and winnings- Race against beginner/amateur AI to get some quick cash and build your car- Defeat bosses and unlock achievements for extra RP- Go online and race against others to earn maximum cash/RP- If your car isn\'t ready for online races, earn some cash in "Drivers Battle"- For the ultimate challenge, race against top players in Pro League4.

The trio made an album that was truly progressive and also super catchy and fun. The follow-up, Some Nights, ramps up the ambition and sonic bombast, but also manages to be even more powerful and impressive. While writing and planning the album, singer Nate Ruess, guitarist Jack Antonoff, and multi-instrumentalist Andrew Dost were heavily influenced by both the sound and scope of Kanye West\'s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and made every attempt to achieve something similar, even to the point of hiring that album\'s co-producer Jeff Bhasker to produce and craft beats for them. (Also Emile Haynie, who has worked with Eminem among others) Though the album has more of a hip-hop influence than Aim and Ignite did, there are still large doses of Queen and ELO coursing through the band\'s blood, both in the machine-crafted vocal harmonies and the ornate bigness of the sound. The album is overloaded with strings and horns, backing vocals, keyboards, and programmed drums surrounding Ruess like a clamoring crowd, but never drowning out his innately sincere vocals and painfully honest lyrics. He has the kind of voice that could cut through any amount of noise, not by using volume but honesty. Even when he\'s fed through Auto-Tune, you know he\'s telling you the truth all the time. On songs like the lead single "We Are Young" or the rollicking "All Alone," he provides a very human core that grounds things even as the music builds to ornate crescendos. Indeed, the album is really, really big sounding and could easily have ended up collapsing under its own weight and pretension, but the opposite happens and Some Nights takes flight instead. The songs are both anthemic and human-sized, the heartfelt words and naked emotions are never buried, and the music is uplifting, not overpowering. The trio has crafted a record that measures up to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy musically and delivers enough emotional charge to power a small town for a month. It\'s an impressive achievement and Fun. deserves every bit of acclaim that comes its way because of it.Tim Sendra, Rovi                    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Clarity (Deluxe)     Zedd    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           After releasing huge hits on Steve Aoki\'s Dim Mak and Skrillex\'s OWSLA labels, 23-year-old Zedd unleashes an album\'s worth of peak-time dance-pop gold. Most of these 10 tracks mesh heartfelt ballads with huge, clubby sounds: Ellie Goulding candy-coats the electrostep monster "Fall Into the Sky," Bright Lights sounds silvery over the soaring progressive house number "Follow You Down," and the title track melds Foxes\' breakup lyrics, a men\'s chorus and huge drum buildups into a cheery dancefloor sing-along. If you prefer more hypnotic vibes, "Stache" and "Shave It Up" are heavy-hitting floor-fillers. With a surprising wealth of ideas and melodies for such a young producer, don\'t be surprised if Zedd is soon giving Deadmau5 and Swedish House Mafia a run for their money.                    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 good kid, m.A.A.d city     Kendrick Lamar    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           Kendrick Lamar is a little rapper with big ideas. After putting his entire generation on his back with the acclaimed (if rambling) sociological treatise Section 80, the Compton rapper turns the lens back on himself with his major label debut. good kid m.A.A.d city is an autobiographical rap album of epic proportions, told by more than one narrator and across an overlong sprawl of multi-movement songs and interwoven skits. It\'s a record so ambitiousarrogant eventhat it would seem destined to be a complete mess. And yet good kid never comes unhinged. In part this is due to its stunning production bed, which contemporizes Outkast\'s space age thump and rounds out the more decadent musical affections of The Roots, but mostly it succeeds because Kendrick is just a superb rapper. His rhymes are elastic, his cadences melt rhythms and he possesses an eye for writerly detail that evokes Nas in his prime.

But even then, he displayed a vocal style closer to a cross between Chris Martin and Dave Matthews, and it\'s that amalgam that he explores on his debut album. Tracks like "Gone, Gone, Gone" and "Hold On" have all the grandeur of Coldplay times ten, while the combination of acoustic axes and anthemic touches on other tracks underlines a Mumford & Sons influence. The disco-tinged "Get Up Get Down" nods to Phillips\' funkier side, but for the most part, we hear him trading groove-based moves for grand drama and panoramic pop.Jim Allen, Google Play                    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Overexposed     Maroon 5    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           For Adam Levine, love and sex are wars, and he\'s a soldier who can\'t help but be wounded and tortured by all the gorgeous women he engages in battle. "Baby, there you go again making me love you," his falsetto chirps on Overexposed\'s opener "One More Night." Several songs later, on "Lucky Strike," the lady has Levine "so highand then she dropped me." Even on the deceptively titled "Ladykiller," the singer warns, "She\'s in it just to win it/ Don\'t trust her for a minute." Musically speaking, Maroon 5 continue to bury their neo-U2 alt-rock roots in urban glitz and bounceHall & Oates meets Justin Timberlake, in other words. Then again, the soaring romance that is "Daylight" proves they\'re just as comfortable softening their sound for a modern adult-contemporary scene that was weaned on arena rock.

However, despite his unprecedented success, there\'s still a question as to whether he can apply his now trademark, demonic, wobble bass drops and thumping syncopated beats to a whole album. Named after the battle cry of the lost boys in Steven Spielberg\'s "Hook", his fourth consecutive EP Bangarang (also his first Top 40 entry in both the U.K. and U.S.) suggests he\'ll have to be on his game on the forthcoming full-length Voltage if he\'s to avoid an Emperor\'s New Clothes scenario. While the bombastic Wall of Sound displayed on 2010\'s Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites initially provided a unique take on the U.K. dubstep genre, Skrillex\'s lack of progression means there\'s a distinct sense of dj vu among its seven tracks, particularly on the relentless, scattershot bleeps, chopped-up vocal hooks, and repetitive loops of opener "Right In" and the rap-metal fusion of "Kyoto." Even when he does think outside the box -- as on "Right on Time," a percussive, hard house collaboration with 12th Planet and Kill the Noise which eventually builds into a feverish slice of happy hardcore, and "The Devil\'s Den," a chaotic hook-up with Wolfgang Gartner which takes in everything from old-school rave to ska to techno -- the results are more headache-inducing than thrilling. There are a few more encouraging signs, such as the Doors-featuring "Breakin\' a Sweat," which combines proggy guitar hooks, psychedelic organ chords, and Jim Morrison samples with a snarling, Prodigy-esque vocal and a filthy slab of dub bass to produce one of the year\'s most unexpectedly successful partnerships, and the multi-layered trance of closer "Summit," given an ethereal sheen thanks to Ellie Goulding\'s lilting tones, both of which suggest Skrillex should utilize his melodic leanings more often. But overall, Bangarang is a disappointingly formulaic affair which hints for the first time that the wheels may soon slowly begin to fall off.                    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Greatest Hits     The Notorious B.I.G.    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                             1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Sublime     Sublime    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           Sublime\'s eponymous major-label debut arrived a few months after the band\'s leader, Brad Nowell, died tragically of a heroin overdose. As a show of sympathy, the album tended to be slightly overrated in some critical quarters, who claimed that Nowell was an exceptionally gifted lyricist and musical hybridist, but Sublime doesn\'t quite support those claims. Even so, the trio does have a surprising grace in its unabashedly traditionalist fusion of Californian hardcore punk, light hip-hop, and reggae. Switching between bracing hardcore and slow, sexy reggae numbers, Sublime display supple, muscular versatility and, on occasion, a gift for ingratiatingly catchy hooks, as on the hit single "What I Got." What they don\'t have is the vision -- either lyrical or musical -- to maintain interest throughout the course of the entire album. Sublime sags when the band delves too deeply into their dub aspirations or when their lyrics slide into smirking humor. The low moments don\'t arrive that often -- by and large, the album is quite engaging -- but they happen frequently enough to make the record a demonstration of the band\'s blossoming ability, but not the fulfillment of their full potential. Of course, Nowell\'s death gives the record a certain pathos, but that doesn\'t make the album any stronger.Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi                    1  $3.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                                 Born To Die     Lana Del Rey    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed           Lana Del Rey\'s debut Born To Die was confounding indie critics long before its release, simply by being unapologetically pop. Lead single "Video Games" set up an intriguing, troublesome charactera passive, objectified girlfriend with outsized romantic daydreams and facile notions of "old Hollywood" glamour and noirbut Del Rey\'s drawling delivery sold it. That song\'s persona, its sedative languor and sweeping strings inform much of Born to Die\'s ballads, but so do moody hip-hop beats and distorted background shouts that recall, among other things, Kanye West\'s "Runaway." Better still are the more sprightly and playfully knowing pop moments of "Off to the Races, "Diet Mountain Dew," "Radio" and  "National Anthem," where Del Rey almost breaks into a rap cadence. Of course Lana Del Rey is a put-on, but it\'s not an unpromising act.Eric Grandy, Google Play                    1  $5.99     Listen   Read    Device Only   Watch   Installed                 Show More     2013 Google  Site Terms of Service  Devices Terms of Sale  Privacy Policy  Developers  Artists']
