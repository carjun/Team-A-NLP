The problem is that people tend to ignore me, especially people on bicycles and rude pedestrians. They seem to think that because I am not as big as a car that it would not hurt to get hit by me. It is amazing the kids that ride their bicycles with headphones on and run right through stop lights and signs.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (22)City Riding...

The Doppler effect has to do with change in frequency of a wave, not with the amplitude. That means that the pitch of the sound is effected by the Doppler effect, not the loudness.', "permalinksavecontextfull comments (22)6001City Riding... I need a new pipe.

He said that the material's strength testing wasn't physics and that unless I could create a lab that had to do with measuring something and collecting data, that quantum tunneling wasn't OK either. Apparently just demonstrating a phenomenon is not good enough. Our experiment has to do with lots of measuring (that's the gist of what he said).", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)Experimental Apparatus Construction  by  RegainingControlin  AskPhysics[+]RegainingControl[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]RegainingControl[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoI'm liking the idea of the heated version of a bending experiment, although I'm not certain that my professor would clear it as it isn't necessarily pure physics.

The professor talked about a simple osculating apparatus to explore chaos theory, but another group has decided to work on that. Another person is working on a high vacuum chamber.', "I am personally interested in something like this but I don't know if my professor will OK that (I have an email out to him about it right now). Beyond that, I really didn't have a specific direction that I wanted to take. I was honestly posting in hopes of having a handful of ideas thrown out there and finding one or two that I actually found interesting. I'm planning on going into a field that has to do with engineering and ultimately explosives applications and demolition, but I couldn't find anything in higher level physics that I could experiment on in a lab setting.", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)10012Experimental Apparatus Construction (self.AskPhysics)submitted 6 days ago by RegainingControl to AskPhysics6 commentssharecancelloading...To medicate or not to medicate?
