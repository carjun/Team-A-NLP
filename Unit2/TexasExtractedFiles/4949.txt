The problem is that people tend to ignore me, especially people on bicycles and rude pedestrians. They seem to think that because I am not as big as a car that it would not hurt to get hit by me.

The Doppler effect has to do with change in frequency of a wave, not with the amplitude. That means that the pitch of the sound is effected by the Doppler effect, not the loudness.

He said that the material's strength testing wasn't physics and that unless I could create a lab that had to do with measuring something and collecting data, that quantum tunneling wasn't OK either. Apparently just demonstrating a phenomenon is not good enough. Our experiment has to do with lots of measuring (that's the gist of what he said).", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)Experimental Apparatus Construction  by  RegainingControlin  AskPhysics[+]RegainingControl[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago \xc2\xa0(0 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]RegainingControl[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoI'm liking the idea of the heated version of a bending experiment, although I'm not certain that my professor would clear it as it isn't necessarily pure physics.

Beyond that, I really didn't have a specific direction that I wanted to take. I was honestly posting in hopes of having a handful of ideas thrown out there and finding one or two that I actually found interesting. I'm planning on going into a field that has to do with engineering and ultimately explosives applications and demolition, but I couldn't find anything in higher level physics that I could experiment on in a lab setting.
