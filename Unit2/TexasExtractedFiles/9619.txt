Because real CS is mathematics, it's based on information theory which is built upon heavy statistical analysis. Information theory (information entropy to be specific) has a lot of mathematical similarities with physics as well. On top of that, the study of algorithmic time complexity (basically the whole field of algorithms) it math. Try studying P vs NP without knowing any mathematics. Many techniques used in CS are based off of linear algebra as well.", "Anyways, maybe you just find programming easier than math (I know I do) , and so you scrape by in your math classes while putting more effort into programming, where you see more immediately beneficial results.
