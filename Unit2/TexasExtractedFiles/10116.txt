I OWN NOTHING, NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED.!!!DO NOT STEAL my video or parts of them, or you'll get big troubles with me and my friends!!!(FOR AIMC)DESCRIPTION: Damon tries to reach Elena's heart and does some steps to make her love him. But she against this and rejects everything by hurting him. Damon's in a big pain. His pains much bigger than his force. He cant control himself and becomes a monster. Blood-thirsty and ruthless, he scares and attacks Elena anywhere its possible. One night Damon appears in her house and almost kills her (turning to the vampire), but love he used to feel before knocks in his veins again. Once you felt some feeling, you can simply feel it again even if you're not expecting it. Damon leaves for good. Theres no other choice, Elena will be safe. As soon as he goes away, Elena's haunted by the memories of him and him being a monster. She starts to realize why he became this. Because of her. Some day she decides to go to Damon's place to clean all the mistakes. But his way too far.AUTHOR'S POV:Ksenia's Note:This my second video about Damon and Elena. BUT this MOST INCREDIBLE!!!
