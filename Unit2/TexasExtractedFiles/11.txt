Meanwhile, U.S. Representative Roger Williams said he expects the small farming community north of Waco to rebuild. Cruz, Williams and Senator John Cornyn (KOHR\'-nihn) all offered prayers for the community during Friday\'s news conference to discuss what they\'d seen following the fatal blast that killed 12 people and injured more than 200 others. Cornyn and Cruz said they would wait for more information about the explosion before delving into whether there should be more regulation of anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer that can be directly injected into soil. West Fertilizer Company stored and distributed the chemical.

PLANT EXPLOSION-CHEMICAL SAFETY BOARD Federal inspectors at scene of blast in West WEST, Texas (AP)     A dozen investigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board are inspecting the site of this week\'s fertilizer plant explosion in the Central Texas town of West. A spokeswoman for the federal agency that\'s charged with investigating chemical accidents says the group arrived in the small farming town on Thursday and was "inspecting the areas of impact" midday Friday. The group includes fire experts as well as people trained in explosive modeling. They\'re working to figure out what caused Wednesday\'s deadly fire and explosion. The blast killed 12 people and injured about 200 others, while destroying 50 area homes in the town about 20 miles north of Waco. PLANT EXPLOSION-OWNER Plant owner: \'My heart is broken with grief\' WEST, Texas (AP)     The owner of the fertilizer plant that shattered a Central Texas town and killed at least 14 people says his "heart is broken with grief for the tragic losses." In a statement Friday, West Fertilizer owner Donald Adair said the Wednesday explosion "will continue to hurt deeply for generations to come." The blast also injured more than 200 people and destroyed about 50 homes nearby. Adair said one of his own plant employees was among the dead.

DAVIDIANS-ANNIVERSARY Davidian survivors mark 20th anniversary of siege WACO, Texas (AP)     Dozens have gathered to remember the siege on the Branch Davidians\' Texas compound on the 20th anniversary of the 51-day standoff\'s fiery end. Survivors and others who see the events as an unwarranted government intrusion into personal and religious freedoms are attending a Friday memorial service at a Waco museum. One survivor read the names of the nearly 80 sect members who died in the blaze on April 19th, 1993. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents raided the compound February 28th, 1993, trying to arrest sect leader David Koresh for stockpiling illegal weapons. But the group had been tipped off about the raid and a shootout ensued. Four agents and six Davidians were killed. Critics of the raid insist Koresh could have been arrested in town away from his followers. Several women and children left the compound during the standoff, which ended after tear gas was fired inside and caught fire. WRONGFUL CONVICTION-PROSECUTOR Judge: Ex-Texas district attorney acted improperly GEORGETOWN, Texas (AP)     A Texas judge has ruled that a former district attorney acted improperly when he prosecuted an innocent man who spent nearly 25 years in prison for his wife\'s murder. District Judge Louis Sturns of Fort Worth said Friday he will issue an arrest warrant for Ken Anderson on criminal contempt and tampering charges for his handling of the case of Michael Morton. Morton was released in 2011 after new DNA testing showed he had not killed his wife in 1985. His attorneys say Anderson hid evidence from Morton\'s defense that could have pointed to his innocence. Anderson, who is now a judge, has denied any wrongdoing. DISTRICT ATTORNEY-DWI ARREST Travis County DA sentenced to 45 days for DWI AUSTIN, Texas (AP)     Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg refused a breath test, kicked her cell door and had to be placed in restraints according to her arrest records. The Travis County prosecutor\'s office released the documents Friday after she pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and a judge sentenced her to 45 days in jail. The police report details how a 9-1-1 caller reported her dangerous driving and how deputies immediately realized her identity, even though she didn\'t have her driver\'s license. Once at the jail, she refused a breath test and resisted deputies when they tried to search her. They placed her in a special restraint chair. A court-ordered blood test showed her blood alcohol level was .239, almost four-times the legal limit. She has said she will not resign. WATER DISPUTE-TEXAS Amistad Dam water releases increased EL PASO, Texas (AP)     The international commission in charge of administering U.S. and Mexico rights to Rio Grande water says it\'ll begin releasing more water from the Amistad Dam near Del Rio. In a statement Friday, the International Boundary and Water Commission said the increased water releases this month will bring a higher flow to the river. It\'ll also help replenish the rapidly falling lake levels downstream that are approaching record lows. Commission spokeswoman Sally Spener says releases will bring Rio Grande water levels briefly to flood stage at Del Rio each evening and action stage just upstream of Laredo, starting Sunday. The water is being released to meet irrigation and municipal demand downstream in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Downstream U.S. interests have complained that Mexico wasn\'t meeting its 1944 Water Treaty obligations. DELL ACQUISITION Report: Icahn backing away from Dell bid ROUND ROCK, Texas (AP)    According to a published report, billionaire investor Carl Icahn is unlikely to follow through on a preliminary offer to acquire Dell, becoming the second suitor to revise views of the company after reports showed a staggering decline in PC sales. The Wall Street Journal says Icahn will now likely wait to see if shareholders approve a February deal for the company to be taken private by founder Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners for $24.4 billion. The newspaper says that if the deal is rejected, Icahn may pursue a hostile takeover. The Journal cites an unnamed person familiar with Icahn\'s thinking. The news comes after the company said in a securities filing Friday that Blackstone Group LP is withdrawing from the bidding process.
