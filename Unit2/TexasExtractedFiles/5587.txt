I was there too. His set was so real, and so raw. He did the jokes he planned to do, but he had to address the Hartford, CT situation. Comedians can feed off of hecklers and use it to their advantage, but those weren\'t hecklers in Connecticut. They were drunk, entitled people that didn\'t want to see Dave tell jokes, they wanted chappelle show clips. They did turn on him eventually. I remember him saying "someone called me a pussy last night. I\'m a forty year old man, I didn\'t think someone could hurt my feelings anymore" or something similar to that.', 'He really thought his career was over after that night, and talked about it frequently.

This is what you seriously need to do to change a headlight bulb.  by  KOB4LTin  WTF[+]Buster_Hazelwood 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]Buster_Hazelwood 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI work in an auto parts store and our policy on bulb installation is we will try to install them for free, unless they are too labor intensive. The only bulbs I say no to are Cobalts, HHRs, Pontiac G6s, and GMC Accadias. The cobalt and G6 aren't too bad, but they require you to remove a few trim retainers on the front bumper and pull back on it so the headlight assembly can slide forward enough to get to the back of the bulb. Not something I'm willing to do for free. The Chevy HHR makes you remove the cover in the wheel well, and reach your arm up through the hole to get to it. I once unbolted every nut and bolt on an Accadia, and still couldn't move the headlight assembly, the customer took it to a GM garage, and he said they put the vehicle on a lift and removed the tire to change the bulb.", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (4858)I think I will do a little shopping today...  by  maidenvoyage14in  funny[+]Buster_Hazelwood 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]Buster_Hazelwood 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI used to ride on the bottom part of the grocery cart sometimes when I was a little kid.

He knew he had grandkids, and knew generally what the names of his children\'s children were, but couldn\'t match them. When he saw my grandma through the door, his eyes lit up as if he hasn\'t seen her in years, when it had only been hours. He said "hey, mom!" (What he\'d always called her). He passed, thankfully always knowing who his soul mate was. It\'s one of the happiest memories I have.
