Obama's order Friday night authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the town of West. Wednesday's explosion at the West Fertilizer plant killed at least 14 people, injured more than 200 others and demolished buildings for blocks around. After addressing the arrest of the second Boston Marathon bombing suspect Friday night, the president extended his sympathies to the community of West and everyone else affected by the explosion. Obama said he's spoken with Texas Gov. Rick Perry and West's mayor, and he pledged that the community will have the resources it needs to rebuild. West Mayor Tommy Muska announced earlier Friday that ten of the dead were first-responders -- including five from the", "West Volunteer Fire Department and four emergency medics. All the bodies have yet to be identified by the Dallas County medical examiner's office. Even before investigators released a confirmed number of fatalities, the names of the dead were becoming known in the town of 2,800 and a small group of firefighters and other first responders who may have rushed toward the plant to battle a pre-explosion blaze was believed to be among them.", 'An apartment complex suffered massive damaged from the explosion of the West Fertilizer plant in West, Texas, April 18, 2013.', 'Rescue crews spent much of the day after Wednesday night\'s blast searching the town for survivors, and Reyes said those efforts were ongoing. He said authorities had searched and cleared 150 buildings by Friday morning and still had another 25 to examine.  The mourning already had begun at a service at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church the previous night.  "We know everyone that was there first, in the beginning," said Christina Rodarte, 46, who has lived in West for 27 years. "There\'s no words for it. It is a small community, and everyone knows the first responders, because anytime there\'s anything going on, the fire department is right there, all volunteer."  One victim Rodarte knew and whose name was released was Kenny Harris, a 52-year-old captain in the Dallas Fire Department who lived south of West. He was off duty at the time but responded to the fire to help, according to a statement from the city of Dallas.', 'With search and rescue efforts continuing, it was clear the town\'s landscape was going to be changed forever by the four-to-five block radius leveled by the blast. An apartment complex was badly shattered, a school set ablaze, and a nursing home was left in ruins.  Residents were kept out of a large swath of West, where search and rescue teams continued to pick through the rubble. Some with permission made forays closer to the destruction and came back stunned, and it was possible other residents would be allowed to retrieve some personal belongings Friday, emergency workers said.  Garage doors were ripped off homes. Fans hung askew from twisted porches. At West Intermediate School, which was close to the blast site, all of the building\'s windows were blown out, as well as the cafeteria.  "I had an expectation of what I would see, but what I saw went beyond my expectations in a bad way," said Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott after his visit. "It is very disturbing to see the site.  Fifteen years ago, Brenda Covey, 46, lived in the now-leveled apartment complex across the street from the plant.', 'Mangled metal and crushed vehicles are all that remains at the blast site of the West Fertilizer Company in West, Texas.', 'On Thursday, she learned that two men she knew, both volunteer firefighters, had perished. Word of one came from her landlord because they live in the same complex in nearby Hillsboro. The other was the best man at her nephew\'s wedding.  "Word gets around quick in a small town," said Covey, who spent her whole life living in and around West.  Firefighter Darryl Hall, from Thorndale, about 50 miles away from West, was one of the rescue workers helping with the house to house search.  "People\'s lives are devastated here. It\'s hard to imagine," Hall said.  The explosion apparently was touched off by a fire, but it remained unclear what sparked the blaze. A team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives still had not been able to begin investigating the scene Thursday because it remained unsafe, agency spokeswoman Franceska Perot said.  The West Fertilizer Co. facility stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer that can be directly injected into soil, and a blender and mixer of other fertilizers.  Records reviewed by The Associated Press show the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer $10,000 last summer for safety violations that included planning to transport anhydrous ammonia without a security plan. An inspector also found the plant\'s ammonia tanks weren\'t properly labeled.  The government accepted $5,250 after the company took what it described as corrective actions, the records show. It is not unusual for companies to negotiate lower fines with regulators.  In a risk-management plan filed with the Environmental Protection Agency about a year earlier, the company said it was not handling flammable materials and did not have sprinklers, water-deluge systems, blast walls, fire walls or other safety mechanisms in place at the plant.', "This aerial photo shows the remains of a fertilizer plant destroyed by an explosion and an emergency responders vehicle, bottom left, in West, Texas, Thursday, April 18, 2013. Rescuers searched the smoking remnants for survivors of Wednesday night's thunderous fertilizer plant explosion, gingerly checking smashed houses and apartments for anyone still trapped in debris while the community awaited word on the number of dead. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)", 'State officials require all facilities that handle anhydrous ammonia to have sprinklers and other safety measures because it is a flammable substance, according to Mike Wilson, head of air permitting for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  But inspectors would not necessarily check for such mechanisms, and it\'s not known whether they did when the West plant was last inspected in 2006, said Ramiro Garcia, head of enforcement and compliance.  That inspection followed a complaint about a strong ammonia smell, which the company resolved by obtaining a new permit, said the commission\'s executive director Zak Covar. He said no other complaints had been filed with the state since then, so there haven\'t been additional inspections.  The Rev. Ed Karasek told the hundreds gathered at Thursday\'s church service that the community needed time to heal.  "I know that every one of us is in shock," Karasek said. "We don\'t know what to think."  "Our town of West will never be the same, but we will persevere."    2013 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Apparently there is no money with his sequestration since he can\'t seem to properly fund our military. Maybe he\'s going to cut back the ammunition order that the DHS has no need of.     reply        WewillSECEDE replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Smartest comment I\'ve yet to see on this forum!               linkicon reporticon emailicon  mjbrin says: i don\'t understand. i am for giving them federal aid since these people will need this but shouldn\'t the republicans be against that since it wasn\'t a natural disaster? shouldn\'t the company be paying for all of this? i wonder how much insurance the company had, how much the city had and the homeowners as well knowing they lived by such a dangerous company......just thinking this     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  mississippigirl2012 says: Didn\'t Texas want to SECEDE? Surely, they do not want or need no help from the Federal government. I would bet 90% of the town had there names on the petition. Didn\'t Mr. Perry say it was treason for the president to keep spending money? Didn\'t both of the senators from Texas vote No to Sandy Victims? There are more billionaires in Texas than anywhere get from them.     reply        WewillSECEDE replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  You are absolutely right, we do NOT need any Obama handouts unlike you and your state when a hurricane destroyed it just a couple of months ago. Unlike your state we have what\'s called a surplus in our states treasury...something I would not expect you to understand. You DON\'T represent Mississippi with your comment as it too is a RED STATE but you do represent the low life black trash that has unwantedly overextended its stay there.            ManOfSteel-Velvet replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  @WewillSECEDE You not only act stupid, you defined the criteria of what stupidity is. If your state do not need Obama handouts than tell your stupid governor Rick Perry and your hypocrite state senator Republican Ted Cruz to stop begging for Obama handout. It is time to walk the talk - Talk is cheap. dummy! FYI: Your governor of Texas Rick Perry did ask for federal aid at the press conference and so is your Texas Senator Republican Ted Cruz who opposed federal aid to Hurricane Sandy victims while urging federal government to provide aid for the victims of the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas.It is on CNN and YouTube and reported all over the media. Look it up. Next time, try to keep up with current event. What a stupid Texan! Some raise the group collective IQ when they arrive - With you, it is when you leave. Go ahead SECEDE! The union is better without STUPID TEXAS!               linkicon reporticon emailicon  Krowster says: WHY???? This state doesn\'t need or deserve any federal moneys. They have the riches people in the world there; moreover, this money will be a drop in the bucket of the moneys made from their high price oil.     reply        WewillSECEDE replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  That is correct!!!! We have the richest people in the USSA because we ******* WORK!!!!!!!

I guess he is the president of Iran and North Korea, too.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  TeamClinton says: Dear President Obama, Gov. Perry and Mayor & people of West, TX,BACKGROUND FACTS: Texas has lauded itself as independent from govt. intervention as it plans its prosperous future and allows speculators to run wild in haphazard work, my heart goes out to them but my wallet does not. I believe help should be offered in the terms of loans only! Texas is a fellow state, so the Union must go to their aid, but irresponsible actions should not be rewarded when the foolhardy actions lead to horrendous consequences, especially when any Jr. High School investigation would show that these activities are just an accident waiting for Father Time to say this is long enough.NOT A TEACHING MOMENT FOR A CHILD: Mr. Obama, Kind Sir, while Texas and all of the South attract jobs from the responsible people in the North, where they do NOT have wild west shows on public streets and call them acts of justice, you reward them for bad irresponsible behavior? This is a spoiled child being rewarded for not shooting out his neighbor\'s window with a new car. This is not a teaching moment for Malia and Sasha, this is a national foolish tragedy where some guts are needed to stand up. Sandy was an act of God and the South bristled at the acts to help out. Now, I do not believe in an eye for an eye but a lesson is not learned if all the other kids have to pay for the bullies bad mistake and that is what this really is.SECEDE FROM THE US: If Gov. Perry really believed in all of his bravado and don\'t mess Texas, he would turn you down and say, don\'t worry, we good old boys have this, we\'ll fix it, thanks anyways. Right? Gov Perry and Mr. Mayor of West. ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY: I am a very liberated minded humanitarian person, Mr. Obama, I want to help my neighbors become strong and more self reliant, more willing to accept both fiscal and moral responsibility, more educated so that they can compete on the world stage where knowledge is king, we simply cannot have you writing out blank checks each time a non inspected oil pipeline burst or a badly managed southern Louisiana oil refinery finally ignites or West, Texas fertilizer plant has an explosion. Help your brothers but make them at least learn to do their own toilet paperwork. I know that it is not your nature to use the rod unless it is bin Laden but taking a fiscal rod to the butt of some would not be a bad idea at some time. You are not Santa Claus, with the public bag of goodies, that you can use to win over the gun vote.CLOSING: My heart goes out buy there are strings on my purse.     reply        TeamClinton replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Please forgive a few typos at 3 in the morning; in para SECEDE Don\'t Mess WITH Texas, Para Closing, My heart goes out but there are strings on my purse.            js555554 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  I\'m willing to bet you are a liberated minded humanitarian person, so long as the funds used are not yours for most things. Background Facts: Texas plants are not immune to federal regulations. An example being the fine received in 2006 by EHS for not having the right documentation in place. The Fed you might say had ample time to remove this threat to the town of West Texas, but did nothing except for make them do more paper work. The issues most "thinking" people had with aid for Sandy victims was not the aid to Sandy victims. It was all the other pork attached to the bill for unrelated items. I won\'t even get into the direct aid from Southern States after the storms passing. Stand your ground though. I wish you and your purse strings a good life.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  HighlanderP says: The President pledged on his own. Trust me, not only can we help each other in time of need, but we also have welcomed our neighbors to the the west with open arms when they were faced with Katrina. Setting up shelters, donation centers, and charities is what we do best! In addition not only do we give but we also welcome strangers into our own homes! Instead feeling all high and mighty about your crappy personality, please consider yourself lucky for not being in either Boston or West, Texas during the horrific situations that took place. As matter of fact, perhaps you should consider yourself unfortunate because a personality like yours only means that you are in desperate need of a friend.     reply        WewillSECEDE replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  100% correct- we don\'t need any sequestered handouts!', 'TEAMCLINTON= 8 up!               linkicon reporticon emailicon  freewillybird says: I know ya can\'t win- it is either:A) burdensome gov\'t regulations and bigger gov\'t to enforce them, including higher taxes, or B) companies free to cut corners to make more money but risking disaster. But I guess it is one or the other. Which do you want??The last time this plant was inspected by the gov\'t was 1985. Enough said??? This is what smaller gov\'t gets ya.Texas, ya really want smaller gov\'t???     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  jgg000010 says: this is now the subject of a criminal investigation and the explosion is regarded as "highly suspicious".
