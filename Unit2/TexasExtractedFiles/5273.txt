Earlier concerns of gas and chemical vapors seem to have been resolved at this point.', 'Relevant Information on the Fertilizer Plant: West Fertilizer Co, owned and operated by Donald Adair, employs roughly 10 people in West, TX, none of whom are believed to have been at the facility at the time of the fire or subsequent explosion. The plant was last inspected in 2006 as a result of a complaint of a smell of ammonia, which resulted in an EPA fine of $2,300 for failing to implement a Risk Management Plan. This type of facility is inspected only in the event that a complaint is received.', 'Time is reporting that the plant was fined $10,000 last year for safety violations relating to the storage and transport of anhydrous ammonia, $5,250 of which was paid after corrective actions were taken by the plant.
