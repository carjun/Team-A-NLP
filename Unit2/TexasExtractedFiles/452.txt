The real crux of his problem is that he is the predominant shareholder of a publicy traded company.  Based on the latest public finance info I could dig up, he currently owns 4,348,253 shares of 23.13M outstanding, or roughly 19%.  With the stock trading at $49.62/share, his stake in Papa John's sits at $215,325,488.56.  Based on their own website, Papa John's employs 16,500 people.  Providing health care for those 16,500 people will obviously raise costs for the company, how much so depends really on how many of those people were already covered and how many Papa John's is going to have to start springing for that they previously didn't.  But it's obvious that they will incur more healthcare costs.  Now there's two choices here.  The company can eat the cost of this increase in employee healthcare costs or they can pass the cost along to the consumer.  This is where the problem comes in, and not just with Papa John's but with every publicly traded company.  They can't eat the cost of this new healthcare mandate as this will reduce their profits.  As a publicly traded company, they must constantly churn out higher and higher profit, quarter over quarter, or else they are a failure in the eyes of Wall Street and investors dump their stock and the stock price tanks, thereby obliterating John Schnatter's paper value.  So in reality this is a Wall Street problem.  This is true of every single publicly-traded company.  This is why banks must constantly find new ways to charge fees, food manufacturers break out the grocery store shrink ray (less product at the same price = higher profit), cell phone carriers constanly change their plans to milk every penny, etc, etc, etc.  Given the choice, every single company will pass the cost on to the consumer.  They do it every single day.  The difference here is that most companies that do this do it quietly, or at least attempt to do it quietly, without making a political circus out of it.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (3576)Washington City Paper is unilaterally renaming the local NFL team to avoid using its racist nickname any longer.

Now if I had a home inspector inspect the house prior to purchasing and he said the roof over the bedroom was dangerous and could collapse and I bought it anyway and moved my wife into that bedroom and it collapsed and killed her, then yes, I could be charged with murder.  The judge in this case had evidence that that this guy was dangerous and still allowed him to walk free when he could have erred on the side of caution and denied bail.

The real crux of his problem is that he is the predominant shareholder of a publicy traded company.  Based on the latest public finance info I could dig up, he currently owns 4,348,253 shares of 23.13M outstanding, or roughly 19%.  With the stock trading at $49.62/share, his stake in Papa John's sits at $215,325,488.56.  Based on their own website, Papa John's employs 16,500 people.  Providing health care for those 16,500 people will obviously raise costs for the company, how much so depends really on how many of those people were already covered and how many Papa John's is going to have to start springing for that they previously didn't.  But it's obvious that they will incur more healthcare costs.  Now there's two choices here.  The company can eat the cost of this increase in employee healthcare costs or they can pass the cost along to the consumer.  This is where the problem comes in, and not just with Papa John's but with every publicly traded company.  They can't eat the cost of this new healthcare mandate as this will reduce their profits.  As a publicly traded company, they must constantly churn out higher and higher profit, quarter over quarter, or else they are a failure in the eyes of Wall Street and investors dump their stock and the stock price tanks, thereby obliterating John Schnatter's paper value.  So in reality this is a Wall Street problem.  This is true of every single publicly-traded company.  This is why banks must constantly find new ways to charge fees, food manufacturers break out the grocery store shrink ray (less product at the same price = higher profit), cell phone carriers constanly change their plans to milk every penny, etc, etc, etc.  Given the choice, every single company will pass the cost on to the consumer.  They do it every single day.  The difference here is that most companies that do this do it quietly, or at least attempt to do it quietly, without making a political circus out of it.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (3576)Washington City Paper is unilaterally renaming the local NFL team to avoid using its racist nickname any longer.
