On Sunday, the Saudi Arabian woman moved a step closer to political autonomy when King Abdullah accorded her the right to both vote and stand for municipal election. These rights take full effect in 2015. While many have expressed astonishment, these reforms are consistent with the feminist narrative Abdullah has authored in his seven-year rule. Indeed, the social and political changes under the aegis of Abdullah outstrip that of every other era in Saudi history. At his decree, the first co-educational undergraduate facility in the kingdom, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, was dedicated in Thuwal, on the Red Sea. In September 2009, it enrolled its first class. The student body is thoroughly mixed.This past May, construction of the Princess Nora Bint Abdul Rahman University - the nation\'s first exclusively for women - neared completion in Riyadh. The university is currently enrolling its first 22,000 undergraduates.Now it is the political playing field Abdullah seeks to level. His moves to overturn legislation, muzzle extremist clerics and curb pit-bull puritanical police have been bold. And it all started with a single appointment.In February 2009, Abdullah named the kingdom\'s first female minister, Nora bint Abdullah al-Fayez. Her appointment to the Education Ministry was followed by the king\'s subsequent directive inaugurating the first council of women. Today, this shadow council functions as a consultative body to the full Shura, the exclusively male assembly of 150, all of whom are appointed (and serve) at the pleasure of the monarch. The female Shura was initiated in 2009 with the appointment of six women, soon expanding to 12. Sunday\'s momentous ruling ushers in the reality of a more muscular female Shura, formally recognized and fully empowered like its male counterpart to propose laws to the king. Quite possibly, among these women may be the first to stand election in Saudi Arabia.Unimaginable as the comparison may be, we would do well to remember that American women only won the right to vote in 1920, while Britain ushered in universal suffrage in 1928.This first generation of political Saudi women, while never standing for election, has nonetheless served the public interest, without international (and often even domestic) recognition. Yet we continue to minimize its contributions by distilling all matters Saudi through the myopic prism of the veil and the vehicle. In doing so, we devalue the strides Saudis are making toward gender parity.Critics rightly bemoan the driving ban and the designation of women as legal minors - sanctions I experienced in my years practicing medicine in Saudi Arabia. Bizarrely, I could steer patients through advanced medical procedures, yet was prohibited from driving my own car; I could direct teams of Saudi male physicians, but needed permission to exit and reenter the country.And these Draconian restrictions are still enforced - the BBC just reported a woman was sentenced to 10 lashes for driving her own vehicle in Jeddah. An appeal is in progress. The consequences on women\'s lives and their male relatives run deeper than the specter of reprisals. The economic burden of providing transport for half the population - mandating that more than a million international drivers be hired and housed - is enormous. Further, the logistics in coordinating life around millions of residents rendered immobile by gender are staggering.Curious, then, that even during these lengthening shadows of the Arab Spring, significant protests for ending the driving ban and terminating mandatory veiling are lacking among Saudis. There isn\'t the kind of violence now shaking Syria to the core. If the surrounding region has dissolved into frightening anarchy, why not the kingdom? Because Saudis simply have great confidence in Abdullah\'s stewardship of Saudi Arabia toward gender equality. In Saudi Arabia\'s case, the monumental changes regarding women\'s rights will not require the proverbial village. Rather, to fight deeply entrenched clerical opposition, and cultural mores, it takes a bold and audaciously unconventional monarch.Only those unfamiliar with the king\'s ambitious, relentless sense of mission and the kingdom\'s unique distance from the Arab Spring would fail to see that Sunday\'s decisions are no more than business as usual in Abdullah\'s kingdom. Whether we acknowledge it or not, the disempowered Saudi woman is a rapidly dissipating mirage to which myopic Westerners continue to hold dear, even as it dissolves at the vanishing point on a fading horizon.Ahmed is author of "In the Land of Invisible Women: A Female Doctor\'s Journey in the Saudi Kingdom."
