The speed at which these files can be streamed varies depending on your computer\'s "bandwidth". In other words, if you have a high bandwidth connection (i.e. cable, DSL, T1/LAN connection), your computer can receive streaming video at a higher speed than a user with low bandwidth (i.e. modem / ISDN) connection. This also means that a user with high bandwidth can receive larger, better quality video stream. On the other hand, a user with a lower bandwidth may receive the video as a slide show or choppy if they cannot receive the full video stream. You can also check your video card settings. Set the number of colors higher than 256k colors.  Finally, you may be experiencing problems due to bandwidth congestion. If the problem persists, we also recommend checking back at a time when your Internet service provider may experience less congestion to see if there is an improvement. [Back to top] 7.
