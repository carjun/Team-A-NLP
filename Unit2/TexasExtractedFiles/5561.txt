Humans aren\'t allowed to reach heaven with our own power.  The main idea behind this was to show people what their place in society is.  Gilgamesh, the half god king can sleep with all the wives on their honeymoons, how the people living in Mesopotamia are simply humans and their role is to farm and feed people and eat animals, not be their buddies, have sex and you\'ll be a civilized man, etc.  We limit our potential morally because there were people long long ago who wanted to limit the potential of citizens.  Religion was an easy way to convince people into certain ethics and moral ideas and keep society in the place it "should be" in it\'s time.  People cling so tightly to these ideas and they carry for generations.  This isn\'t even limited to religion.  The role of women has hardly changed, still being portrayed as damsels in distress in popular culture for example, an idea stemming from early civilizations, but not from \'nature\'.  People still believe in the hunter gatherer idea where men hunt and women gather, but there is substantial evidence suggesting very much that they did not hunt often and they simply worked together to gather.  People think these are all modern issues, like it\'s Nintendo\'s fault for making Mario save a helpless princess as it\'s main premise, even though this idea had been common and persistent throughout most of our written history.', "Quit clinging to ideas because you were brought up to think a certain way and start thinking logically.  You may not dig having children with 3 parent DNA sources, but that's no reason to make it illegal, especially for the future.  It may be a slow process, but people's definitions of right and wrong are always changing.  Once it was okay to kill fugitives for bounty, to stone homosexuals, etc.  Make it illegal for a man to marry another man because religious beliefs make you think it's wrong is going to cause issues for future gay couples who love each other and want the benefits and experiences other couples have.", 'Make it illegal to have a 3 parent child is going to cause issues for people who want this, who want a healthier humanity in the future.', 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (1287)Scientists have found way to use a third person\'s DNA to greatly reduce the potential for disorders of the heart, brain, and muscle.
