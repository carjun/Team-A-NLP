Local media said as many as 70 people may have died.The blast occurred after 7 p.m. local time yesterday following a fire at about 6:30 p.m. at the site, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Dallas, West Mayor Tommy Muska said.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of people who are hurt, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, who aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be here tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Muska told reporters, saying that his town of about 2,800 residents needs \xe2\x80\x9cyour prayers.\xe2\x80\x9dTrooper D.L. Wilson, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a separate conference that at least 100 were injured and that as many as 75 homes had been destroyed. The main fire was under control as of 11 p.m., Wilson said, urging residents to remain indoors because of the threat of new explosions or leaks of ammonia from the plant\xe2\x80\x99s ruins.Adair Grain\xe2\x80\x99s DBA West Fertilizer Co. is an anhydrous ammonia facility, according to Wilson. Anhydrous ammonia, a liquid source of the fertilizer nitrogen, is applied directly by farmers to the soil to increase crop yields.Ammonia StoredWest Fertilizer said it stored as much as 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at the site in an emergency planning report filed to the Environmental Protection Agency, according to the Dallas Morning News.More than six hours after the explosion, law-enforcement officials were still pulling injured people from homes, Waco Police Sgt. William Patrick Swanton said at a press conference at 2:15 a.m. local time. The authorities didn\xe2\x80\x99t yet know whether the fire and subsequent blast were an accident or intentional, Swanton said, according to the Associated Press.Swanton said that police had been at the scene of the initial fire, and were aware that there was anhydrous ammonia inside the plant.\xe2\x80\x9cAbout 50 minutes later, there was a massive explosion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Swanton declined to say how many people died in the incident, noting that several firefighters were unaccounted for.The worst-hit areas appeared to be a nursing home and a 50- unit apartment building near the fertilizer plant where there was \xe2\x80\x9cquite a bit of devastation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Seismic EventLocal television station KWTX said as many as 70 people had died, citing West EMS Director George Smith. Television images showed fires in the ruins of the plant and in surrounding buildings, and people being treated on a flood-lit sports field.Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey, said a magnitude 2.1 degree seismic event had been registered as the explosion occurred. The impact would have generated a shock wave, she said by phone from Golden, Colorado.Muska said five or six volunteer firefighters were tackling a blaze at the site when the explosion happened. The mayor, himself a volunteer firefighter, said his hat was knocked off by the blast and the windows of his nearby home were shattered.Wilson, who likened the scene to the Iraq war, said the 50- home apartment complex now resembled a \xe2\x80\x9cskeleton,\xe2\x80\x9d while a middle school and the West Rest Haven Nursing Home had both been badly damaged. Emergency responders evacuated 133 residents, including some in wheelchairs, from the nursing home.Apartment DamageElizabeth Marquez-Perea, who lives in West about a mile north of the plant, said about 50 families lived at Tucker Apartments, the damaged block close to the facility. She and her three daughters fled after the blast shattered windows of their apartment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt smelled like gas, a real terrible smell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.About a month ago, the school close to the plant had sent parents a note explaining that children had been moved for the day to a different location because of smells coming from the fertilizer plant, Marquez-Perea said.Vicky Pustejovsky, who works in customer service for Blue Cross Blue Shield and lives two blocks from the facility, said the town was in \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete disarray.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cWe were watching TV when we heard the explosion,\xe2\x80\x9d Pustejovsky said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur doors started caving in.\xe2\x80\x9dResidents were told by authorities to remain indoors because of the threat of new explosions or an ammonia leak from the plant.Walls MoveJonathan Moore, a 30-year-old truck driver, felt the blast from about 35 miles to 45 miles north in the town of Itasca. He said he heard a loud boom and saw the walls shake inside the truck-stop he was in at the time.\xe2\x80\x9cAll of a sudden I could see the walls move both ways,\xe2\x80\x9d Moore said in a telephone interview. As he and his friend drove closer to the explosion on Interstate 35, the smell became so strong their eyes started burning, he said.The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which investigates industrial chemical accidents, said on its website it deployed a \xe2\x80\x9clarge investigation team\xe2\x80\x9d that should arrive today.Two hospitals in Waco were treating at least 150 people, according to local media, with other patients sent to neighboring areas.The U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s worst industrial accident also occurred in Texas, in April 1947, when a fire on board the SS Grandcamp freighter in the port of Texas City detonated a cargo of ammonium nitrate. The resulting explosions and fires killed more than 570 people.Waco RaidYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s blast came two days before the 20th anniversary of the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s raid on the Branch Davidian sect in Waco that killed 76, including cult leader David Koresh. In revenge for that incident, exactly two years later Timothy McVeigh detonated a truck bomb containing ammonium nitrate in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people.Calls to the Waco McLennan County Emergency Management office weren\xe2\x80\x99t answered.The town of West was named after a local business owner, Thomas West, and attracted German and Czech immigrants at the turn of the 19th century, according to the The Handbook of Texas Online.--With assistance from David Wethe in Houston and David Stringer in Melbourne.
