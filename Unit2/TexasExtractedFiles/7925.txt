I usually switch between these three at random, depending on how I'm doing in the game.

This is my well rounded class, it's good for pretty much any play style in any game mode.  I switch the sight out a lot, usually rotating between Target Finder, MMS, and Hybrid Sight (whichever one I fancy at the time, really). ", "Next, there's my run'n'gun class.  This is the class I use when I want to go crazy.  Really good for hit and run play, fast movement and stealth.  You can easily have a crazy high K/D with this class.", "Finally, there's my machine gunner class.  I'll admit, I'm a massive bitch with this class.  I sit behind my claymore and a trophy system and just pick people off.  Adding the dual-band/variable zoom combo makes it almost an automatic sniper.  Great for holding down a position, especially if you have someone to watch your back.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (100)11123My puppy Samson likes to make faces at me.

I think the only thing that would pull him away from his contract extension here is a metric shit-ton of money.  Much more money than UT could offer.
