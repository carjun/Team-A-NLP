I wasn't expecting such a response, and although I am saddened by your stories, I m also heartened by seeing such a strong community. I know my daughter is finding strenght in solidarity, knowing that she isn't alone and that our family will provide strong support for her.  In 3 hours we will be at the Doctor, and hopefully we will have an answer, but I know it isn't that straightforward with JA.
