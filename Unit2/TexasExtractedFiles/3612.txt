I must beg your advice.  by  sunhelixin  actuallesbians[+]middlenamesneak 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]middlenamesneak 2 points3 points4 points 2 months agoHi! Fellow first time love- intoxication experiencer. Congratulations bud.  All my 27 years  Ive felt Im always the one being chased, was always too scared to do the chasing after the ones I really liked (super lame, I know). And about a month ago (ohhh girls with girls) I finally found somebody worth risking and losing my cool for, and WOW, thiiis is what everyone has been blathering on about all these years...', 'Getting a whatsapp or call from her is like Christmas morning, I walk around with this silly smile on my face all day, holding her hand is like getting a hug from the sun and the clouds, and kissing her and holding her and being with her is like nothing else I have ever felt before. Crazy, opposites on the zodiac, want to own your soul passion.  I want to be with her all the time; I dont even know what I used to think about during all the time I now think about her.', 'Falling in love, man; crazy, sickening, exhilarating, life altering, game changing, meaning giving, beautiful, butterfly birthing, knee weakening, googly eye causing,  stars and spaceships and rockets and firecrackers in your chest, fourth of July;  love.', 'I realize how absolutely ridiculous this can read to anyone who isnt currently experiencing this, or who like me, hadnt felt it and was beginning to feel like it wasnt ever going to happen (pardon my late twenties angst.) But if you get the opportunity to live it, for the love of everything worthwhile in life, grab that rope with both hands and leap. Yes, most love stories come to an end, yes love is life and life is pain and the human condition is to suffer, but fuck, sappy shit like this just doesnt come around every day and however fleeting it is, I know its worth it. I used to feel like a zombie inside, dead and dull and thirsting for anything to give me life. And maybe Ill feel like that again, maybe the pain from a broken heart will be equal parts worse to what Im enjoying right now, and for sure that is a scary, scurry thought. But I dont freaking care, my chest gets a little tight when I think of the possible pain, but I honestly dont care and Im going to give this girl the best loving I can. Because, it just feels so wonderful. And I want it to last as long as it possibly can.', 'So my advice? Go to the great (and un-romantically simple) lengths of our modern day era to find her, and make your move.

People do not wear gas masks to avoid breathing the smog, although you can sometime see people wearing the dentist-mouth-cover-things (but more so for avoiding colds and the like.) It is not usually hot, the climate in Mexico Df is temperate, cool mornings and evenings with sunny afternoons. Ive never seen anyone get mugged or kidnapped.
