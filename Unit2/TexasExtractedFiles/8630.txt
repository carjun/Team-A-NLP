Pollution from coal plants is powering my house right now, instead of the solar and wind technologies that could have been developed decades ago, besides the fact that carbon sequestration on a monumental scale is what we needed to do - decades ago. China and India are developing a need for crude: it's obvious they don't care about emissions standards. Our planet should have been taken care of, instead of cutting down the forests, or how about the overfishing done exclusively by executives much older than me?

I'm doing my part now, but who was doing their part in the 80's when global warming was discovered to be a risk, and I was only a child? Who exactly voted for better emissions standards and alternative fuels and solar power and electric cars and all that shit back when it was time for it to happen? Or did those lower end of the Bell curve wastes of functioning organs sit on their asses watching TV, allowing our republic to be utterly subverted and doing nothing before it was too late, and raise fat little idiots in suburbia, and get bigger and bigger cars and trucks and houses, and leave the younger generations with less of everything than what they had?
