Last year she had a prostitute come in complaining of "stomach pain". Not uncommon. They\'re usually pregnant, just want drugs, or both. My mom\'s about to do a trans-vaginal scan (putting special vaginal transducer in vaginally), when she sees that the lady still has a tampon in. She asks the woman to take it out, and she does so.', 'The second the tampon is out, the most foul stench (on par with the dagobah ass pus) pours out, permeating the room. My mom starts dry heaving. The woman cries out "OOH WHAT THAT SMELL!". Doing her best not to vomit, my mother asks her how long she\'s had the tampon on. The prostitute looks confused and replies "oh, i don\'t know, a week or so".', 'My mom quietly exits the room and gets help. Some low level nurses come in, clean her up. They had to wear facegear while doing so. The hallway had to be closed off for the rest of the day for de-stenching/cleaning.', "Not as cool as some fat lady ass-puss, but the smell of a crack-whores week old tampon vag?
