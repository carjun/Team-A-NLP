It\'s almost certain that your coverage would be far better than anything you could get through the exchanges. The less expensive plans don\'t cover much, and the more expensive ones still don\'t cover as much as any other country\'s health insurance for half the price. Part of the reason cheap insurance will be more expensive is because of the minimum standards set by the ACA, so it seems like your coverage would pass that test.', 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (2068)"I shouldn\'t have to offer anything," Obama said.
