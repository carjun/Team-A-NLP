Latest on deadly Texas fertilizer blast  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated West Fertilizer on June 20, 2006, after receiving a complaint June 9 of a strong ammonia smell. Agency records show that the person who lodged the complaint said the ammonia smell was "very bad last night" and lingered until after he or she went to bed.', 'Wednesday night\'s explosion leveled the plant and severely damaged other area buildings. Authorities say people were killed, but they don\'t know how many.  Authorities were still trying to evacuate area homes early Thursday morning.   Meanwhile, the Dallas Morning News reports that documents show West Fertilizer told the Environmental Protection Agency that it presented no risk of fire or explosion, despite having 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  According to the newspaper, an emergency planning report shows West Fertilizer stated "no" under the section asking about fire or explosion risks. The fertilizer plant indicated the worst case scenario would be a 10-minute release of ammonia gas that would not harm anyone.  According to the CDC, anhydrous ammonia can be immediately dangerous to life or health when handled improperly and "exposure can be fatal at high concentrations."     2013 CBS Interactive Inc.

Rick Perry wants less "government intrusion" into business and look at the results.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  Khutu says: Another incident indicating that Texas has all the trappings of a third-world country: penal/death row rates, education results, poverty rates, autocratic and backward-thinking Congressmen (DeLay, Cruz, etc.) and governor (and HE wanted to close the EPA if he\'d been elected President), and clearly total disregard for rules of industrial and employee safety (look at their history re refineries). I feel sorry for the citizens who unwittingly helped to create a system that cares so little for them...     reply        bajajohn1 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  The right wing has brainwashed most Texas citizens. Talk about people who can\'t think.            MikeRight1 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  You forgot the best economy in the nation. If that makes Texas like a third-world country, what\'s that say about the rest of the states?               linkicon reporticon emailicon  pasogal1 says: Did the plant operate from 2006 to 2013 without a permit? If so, why? And, how could that happen? Aren\'t inspections supposed to take place yearly? If this loss of life could have been prevented, it is a double tragedy. Safety inspections should have protected both the employees and the people who live in West, Texas. Disregarding safety procedures is unethical and stupid.     reply        AmazingGrce replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  They got the permit shortly after the 2006 complaint. (Stated in the News conference this morning,)Now as to the EPA acceptance of the application - That falls on their shoulders. The bigger issue still comes back to why the city allowed homes, schools and businesses to be built so close to a known chemical facility. Lack of knowledge by that zoning board/committee is perhaps at the heart of this. To me the clear issue is either ignorance on the planning board or willful disregard for the safety of the people. It doesn\'t matter if the board had a clue or not - ultimately, unless the plant operated outside the law repeatedly, the zoning board and the EPA are responsible for their actions and ultimately for the devastation that resulted from the explosion. Plant accidents do happen but the job of the EPA and zoning boards are to mitigate the potential damage by oversight, building restrictions and inspections. If those were not done then the plant owners are culpable but.... the others bear responsibility too.The saddest part is that the firefighters best intended actions may in fact have contributed to or caused the eventual massive explosion. It appears to have cost them their lives and the lives of the people in the community.            Raptorsmasher replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Since one can\'t sue the federal government, liability falls on West Fertilizer, the zoning board and the the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  August100 says: The fertilizer plant\'s operator said that it presented "NO RICK"to the community....BOY, they got that one wrong....     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  ahrats says: Fire at fertilizer plant got out of hand because inexperianced fire fighters did not realize what they were dealing with. Texas inspectors did not do their job, allowing this plant to regulate itself. I\'ll bet the owner of the plant is no where to be found. Do not worry the plant will never be rebuilt, they would have to follow regualtions now to rebuild the plant. Good luck to the surviviors suing the owner of this plant.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  jntlw says: The EPA under Bush was worthless.     reply        sgbarnes1 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  The EPA is worthless today as well. I\'d like to know if the plant ever got the permit. 2006 is many years from 2013.            formerlyluvnut replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  EVERYTHING under bush was worthless except the military & he misused them.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  KPeters_from_UK says: Why was the plant built right on the edge of a school? Or why was the school built next to the plant. I can\'t believe that someone thought a fertilizer plant yards away from a school was a good idea.     reply        EmpireGeorge____-------_ replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Why would it matter ? are adults outside of school or not near a school somehow expendable ??? killing people not near a school = ok.....near a school = not ok.
