["            A national trade group that represents fertilizer suppliers sought to convince federal lawmakers that retailers which blend fertilizer \xe2\x80\x94 such as West Fertilizer Co. \xe2\x80\x94 should be excluded from rules requiring them to cooperate in the development of emergency plans and publicly reveal their chemical inventories.The Agricultural Retailers Association said in its 2012 congressional lobbying report that it seeks to \xe2\x80\x9cwork with the EPA to clarify their new Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act interpretation of fertilizer retailer to exclude facilities that blend fertilizer.\xe2\x80\x9dAccording to association representatives, the blending of dry fertilizer, such as ammonium nitrate, is extremely safe and lumping blenders in with manufacturers represents a regulatory burden for small businesses. (It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear what caused Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s explosion at the West plant, which occurred after business hours.) During a Senate Environment & Public Works Committee meeting last year, Sen. James Inhofe, R-OK, declared that \xe2\x80\x9cif EPA continues down this road they will be imposing additional costs on hundreds of small businesses and farmers in rural America.\xe2\x80\x9dHowever, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the West Fertilizer explosion that shows the potential dangers inside blending facilities. In 2009, the El Dorado Chemical Co. in Bryan, which also stores and blends fertilizer, caused the first mandatory evacuation in the city\xe2\x80\x99s history and injured dozens.According to the Sunlight Foundation, which first reported the lobbying effort, the Agricultural Retailers Association has spent $2.9 million since 1998 to lobby Congress on issues affecting its members. An EPA spokesperson told the Statesman Friday that the agency has not amended its rules and continues to require enhanced reporting from fertilizer blenders.West Fertilizer, which the association says is not a member of the group, has been fined for lax compliance with similar planning requirements.The Environmental Protection Agency fined the plant $2,300 in 2006 after inspectors found that the company had failed to update its risk management plan in a timely manner.And the company\xe2\x80\x99s most recent risk management plan, filed in 2011, drastically underestimated a \xe2\x80\x9cworst case\xe2\x80\x9d incident at the plant, stating that it would be a 10-minute leak of anhydrous ammonia, not the catstrophic explosion that occurred Thursday night, for which the death toll \xe2\x80\x94 at least 14 so far \xe2\x80\x94 is still not finalized.comment(1)More News\xc2\xa0NewslettersRSS FeedsMobileLatest News Galleries\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ken Anderson ordered to be arrested for acts during 1987 Michael Morton murder trialWeek in photos - April 19, 2013Around the world in 50 photosTravis DA Lehmberg pleads guilty to drunken drivingPolice converge on Watertown, Mass.Boston Marathon vigil at Austin High, 4.18.13FBI releases images of Boston bombing suspectsWest plant explosion, 04.17.13UT unmanned aircraft competition, 04.17.13Victims of Boston bombing suspectsBoston Marathon bombings: The day after'Iron Lady' laid to rest in EnglandExplosions at Boston MarathonFashion week wraps up in LimaStatesman Investigates: Bonds granted without input, 04.14.13Austin Moto Fest, 04.13.13Habitat for Humanity dedication, 04.13.13Lion Air passengers survive crash into sea near Bali  Jacob's Well, 04.12.13Week in photos - April 12, 2013Texas Border Crossing, 04.11.13State workers rally at the Capitol, 04.10.13Houston-area college stabbing, 04.09.13Pedestrian killed in Texas 71 crash, 04.08.13Latest AP Texas NewsFederal agents to search blast site into weekendSpurs head into playoffs slumpingTexas town grieves for dead first-respondersDavidian survivors mark 20th anniversary of siegeWrinkled Texas dog that got facelift has new home>\xc2\xa0More\xc2\xa0NewsLocal NewsArchivesBlogsObituariesPhoto and Page ReprintsRSSSend us a news tipEntertainmentAustin EntertainmentEventsSuggest an eventTV ListingsSocial MediaFacebookTwitterGoogle+More SocialServicesContact UsDigital ProductsFAQsFeedbackAdvertiseCareersCommunity DevelopmentETearsheetsNewsroom StaffSubscriber ServicesAdvertisers and SponsorsCars at AutoTraderLocal Services at KudzuCoupons at ValpakMarketplaceJobsCarsClassifiedsReal EstateAdvertise\xc2\xa9 2013 Cox Media Group.
