We  have lost the safety and comfort of our homes. But as scary as this is,  we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9dAuthorities have not yet identified  what caused the blast, which was so powerful it registered as a small  earthquake. Assistant State Fire Marshal Kelly Kistner said the blast  left \xe2\x80\x9ca large crater.\xe2\x80\x9dThe explosion destroyed about 50 homes and  severely damaged a nursing home and other buildings nearby. Fire Marshal Kistner said  all fires have been extinguished at the explosion scene and the  remaining fertilizer tanks at West Fertilizer Co. are not a danger.Some of the people who attended Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s outdoor service wore T-shirts calling on others to \xe2\x80\x9cpray for West.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cEvery  time I close my eyes, all I can think about is the explosion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edi  Botello, a senior at West High School. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople running around.

The building\xe2\x80\x99s roof was collapsed, its windows were blown out, and  chunks of concrete from the plant littered the space between the tracks  and the apartments.\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral blocks we had projectiles or shrapnel  that has been found of different sizes,\xe2\x80\x9d Fire Marshal Kistner said. \xe2\x80\x9cSmaller pieces  have been found blocks away.\xe2\x80\x9dThe wave radiating from the blast  also hit the nursing home across the street from the apartments. There,  too, windows were blown out, ceiling tiles were visible throughout the  rooms, and the red brick exterior was cracked. At West Intermediate  School, a northern wall was charred and the southern wall showed  structural damage.Crews from Union Pacific were repairing the  railroad tracks, but reporters were kept from climbing the berm to see  what was happening at the fertilizer plant.
