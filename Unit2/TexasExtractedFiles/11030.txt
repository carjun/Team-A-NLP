Rick Perry declared McLennan County a disaster and said he would request the emergency declaration from President Barack Obama. Though there are no damage estimates for West, the designation is reserved for the areas most severely impacted by natural or man-made disasters. Perry said the state had activated the Texas Department of Public Safety, special Texas Task Forces, Texas National Guard and agencies dealing with the environment, education, pipelines and health services. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said the Legislature will be absolutely supportive, do everything that we can to help provide the resources and help the citizens of this tragedy move forward.Over the years, I've seen Texas move forward after Hurricanes Rita and Dolly and Ike and explosions, and we'll move forward, Dewhurst said. But it's a painful time for the people in West. Our prayers go out to them. Throughout the day, Mayor Muska told various media outlets that up to 40 people were unaccounted for but then later said the number of fatalities had dropped to 10 or fewer. Waco police in the early hours of the day had said there could be five to 15 people dead.The Texas Department of Public safety would only say there are fatalities.But Thursday afternoon, the State Firemen's & Fire Marshals' Association of Texas reported on its website that the casualties included five West firefighters, one Dallas firefighter, four EMS responders and one unidentified person.Although city and emergency officials would not confirm the number of dead or their names, the identities of at least six firefighters were confirmed by their families: Perry Calvin, Morris Bridges, Buck Uptmor, Joey Pustejovsky, Cyrus A. Reed and Dallas-Fire Rescue Capt. Kenny Harris. Two other firefighters were also missing and feared dead by their family: brothers and West volunteer firefighters Robert and Doug Snokhous.Buck Uptmor's nephew, Reagan Uptmor, 17, said his uncle had not been heard from since he responded to the first small fires at the fertilizer plant. Reagan Uptmor and two friends, Tyler Goody, 18, and Jason Lucien, 15, talked about the explosion while helping to unload supplies at the West Auction House, which was serving as a command center.He described his uncle Buck, 45, as the type who would help out in emergencies. He said his uncle left a daughter who graduated last year and two young sons.By nightfall Thursday, hundreds packed the Church of the Assumption for a candlelight vigil, where therapy dogs greeted attendees, some of whom wore T-shirts with GOD BLESS WEST in bright red letters. We don't know what to think, said Father Ed Karasek. West is known for partying, having a good time, Westfest and kolaches. But we're also known for being there for each other, and that's what we need to do now. He told attendees that Pope Francis sent him a note to express his condolences for the community. We are being lifted up all over the world, Karasek said. Our town of West will never be the same, but we will persevere. Officials said the fire department was called to the plant  which sells fertilizer to area farmers  about 7:30 p.m. after a fire broke out. The massive explosion followed about 20 minutes later. Officials weren't sure yet where in the building the fire started. State and federal environmental agencies were at the site as well as local, county, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Waco Police Sgt. William Patrick Swanton estimated anywhere from 300-400 emergency personnel from around the area responded soon after the explosion. Officials said more than 160 people were sent to area hospitals, most to Hillcrest Baptist in Waco.Hospital officials described victims with multiple injuries, including burns, broken bones and large lacerations. Mayor Muska, a firefighter himself, was still dressed in a dirty West volunteer fire department shirt during a pre-dawn news briefing.Search and rescue teams had been working through the night, he said. We've got a lot of people who are hurt, and there's a lot of people, I'm sure, who aren't gonna be here tomorrow, he told the Dallas Morning News. We're gonna search for everybody. We're gonna make sure everybody's accounted for. That's the most important thing right now.After an aerial and ground tour of the blast site, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said the damage he saw surpassed all of his expectations of just how devastated the town would be.One witness to the destruction, Julius Archie, a former West resident who now lives in Waco, said, It looks like a bomb was dropped in there. It looks like a war zone.Three of West Independent School District's campuses were damaged, said Superintendent Marty Crawford, but district students will be in class on Monday. The school board held an emergency meeting Thursday morning to set a plan for the rest of the year, Crawford said, and students will attend classes at West Elementary School, along with neighboring districts. STAAR testing that was set to take place next week will be rescheduled, Crawford said.We've all got challenges here, and certainly we have a big mission to educate kids for the next 30 days, he said, adding that resuming school quickly brings normalcy and consistency in the kids' lives, and allows their parents to begin the rebuilding process.All of the district's employees are accounted for, he said, and although he doesn't know for sure if any of the district's 1,500 students were injured or killed, he hadn't heard of any.Two months ago, students at the intermediate school were evacuated after school officials noticed a controlled brush burn near the plant. They weren't informed about the burn, Crawford said, but the evacuation went well and students and staff got out quickly. He added that the district was lucky that the blast didn't occur during school time.We are very fortunate that God was looking out for us yesterday and hopefully he'll continue to look out for us in West ISD, he said. The schools were built after the plant, Crawford said, adding that the proximity to the fertilizer plant was a concern to him when he joined the district.That was one of my concerns, and we crossed our fingers that that would never happen to us, he said. But in communities like West, your tax base and property value don't always mesh with what your district needs. Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Jason Reyes said he had no timeline for when people may be allowed to go back into the affected area to see their homes. We are taking this all day by day, he stressed.As darkness settled on the small, tight-knit community, Red Cross volunteers continued to assist those who were displaced, while residents walked around town, chatted with friends or simply watched the media blitz.At one small gas station, a group of about 10 people watched on television as CNN's Anderson Cooper interviewed people they knew just two blocks away.Lifelong West resident Kevin Smith said his home was destroyed. He bought the house, about 100 feet from the plant, last year, he said.When I saw it was one of the ones on CNN, that's how I knew it was gone, he said.bzwerneman@express-news.netTwitter: @brentzwernemanStaff Writers Peggy Fikac, Eva Ruth Moravec, Michelle Casady, Hector Saldana, Brent Zwerneman and Nolan Hicks and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", 'Copyright 2013 Express-News.
