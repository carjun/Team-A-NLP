It is a human being\xe2\x80\x99s natural tendency to make unsubstantiated assumptions when there are no concrete explanations for a tragic event, and after the bombings at the Boston Marathon yesterday, after the shock, sadness, and anger subsided into semi-rational thought, the first inclination was to speculate on who planted the bombs that wreaked havoc and carnage on innocent Americans. Although it is much too early to blame any specific terror group for the bombings, it is not too early to note the significance of the date and location that make speculating the bombings were a domestic terror attack as reasonable assumption as not.', 'Over the past three years, so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpatriot\xe2\x80\x9d groups have called for civil war, race war, and outright rebellion against the United States government\xe2\x80\x99s unfair taxation and attacks on personal liberty. Several militant groups have panted for a government crackdown to initiate a violent response from patriots to \xe2\x80\x9ctake their country back\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwater the tree of liberty\xe2\x80\x9d with blood harkening back to the Revolutionary War and the idea that patriots will battle oppressive government to preserve their liberties. Yesterday, in Boston, the home of America\xe2\x80\x99s first Tea Party and original patriot uprising, it was \xe2\x80\x9cPatriot Day\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9ctax day\xe2\x80\x9d that marked the earliest beginnings of the Koch brothers anti-government tea party.', 'President Obama noted during a briefing that it is too\xc2\xa0 early to know who was behind the bombings in Boston, but he did mark the significance of the \xe2\x80\x9cday that celebrates the free and fiercely independent spirit that this great American city of Boston has reflected from the earliest days of our nation.\xe2\x80\x9d This \xe2\x80\x9cpatriot day\xe2\x80\x9d is more than just commemorating the start of the Revolutionary War and the battles of Lexington and Concord that occurred on April 19, 1775. The day, and more importantly, the week marks the anniversary of several clashes between government and so-called patriots that make speculating the bombings in Boston were a domestic terror attack associated with the \xe2\x80\x9cright-wing patriot\xe2\x80\x9d movement relatively easy, and significant, for those who track militant hate groups harboring grudges against the government and threaten violence for their alleged \xe2\x80\x9closs of liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'There are more than a couple anniversaries of violence involving so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpatriots\xe2\x80\x9d that occurred during this week including the Oklahoma City Bombing on April 19, 1995, and the Waco assault on the same day in 1993. Of particular interest is the Waco assault that began on a Monday, and it is a favorite rallying cry for militant anti-government groups and white supremacists who claim a similar event will be the reason for real American patriots to begin revolting against the government. It is noteworthy that the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms attempt to serve search warrants on David Koresh\xe2\x80\x99s Branch Davidian compound that ignited a gun battle and subsequent standoff did occur on Patriot\xe2\x80\x99s Day in 1999, and for anti-government uber-patriots, it is a day that the government overstepped their authority by searching for illegal firearms. With all the outrage and threats of violence from gun fanatics over expanding gun safety laws, one cannot help but speculate what the connection is between the Boston Tea Party, Patriot Day, Waco, and the raging debate over gun safety laws \xe2\x80\x9cpatriots\xe2\x80\x9d consider an\xc2\xa0 assault on the greatest of American liberties.', 'If there were not an increase in violent patriot groups clamoring for a revolution to establish what \xe2\x80\x9cpatriots\xe2\x80\x9d claim is the original intent of the Revolutionary War, or gun zealots promising violence if gun safety laws were enacted, one may be inclined to wait for the FBI to complete their investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice as the President promised. But the flurry of calls for violence against this President and the government by so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpatriots,\xe2\x80\x9d and their embrace of the Gadsden (don\xe2\x80\x99t tread on me) Flag, coupled with the four-year persistent and unsubstantiated claims their liberties are trampled on certainly make speculating that it is no coincidence that the location, date, tax filing deadline, and anniversary of two other acts of violence against the government are not acts of domestic terrorism.', 'However, these may be just coincidences; but after three straight years of \xe2\x80\x9cpatriot\xe2\x80\x9d groups openly calling for violence against the government, intimations from militant groups that it only takes one incident to ignite all out revolution or civil war, and calls by extremists to be ready to start shooting over an imaginary government crackdown, it appears to be more than coincidence and increasingly like an act of homegrown terrorism. In the end though, it is just speculation and without any firm evidence it is an unsubstantiated assumption based on three years of threats from militant hate groups, gun fanatics, and so-called patriots.', 'The Date and Location Could Yield Significant Clues In the Boston Terror Attack was written by Rmuse for PoliticusUSA, \xc2\xa9 Apr. 16th, 2013.
