He needs good support (probably a tri-lane) to do well, and that's probably the most lacking thing in pubs.

Yeah, it'll be tricky, but I think there's some real potential here. I haven't played Pathfinder yet, but I think for now I'd probably stay away from RPGs and focus more on economic/placement games.
