I just lie to everyone and mask my emotions to keep others from seeing how miserable I really am.  I always try to help others with what they need and they just take advantage.  I can\'t trust my girlfriend who goes to see her "friend".  And it\'s really her ex she is seeing behind me.  I can\'t trust my friends because all they really want is money.  Even when people vent to me and I talk them through things they always seem to forget later on.   Now I just act everything.  I hide all my emotions.   I cover them up with fake ones.  I don\'t want to kill myself.  No.  I just want to make others happy while being happy myself.   I don\'t know what to do.
