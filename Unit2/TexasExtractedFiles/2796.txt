On Friday, local authorities put the number of dead at 12, with at least 200 wounded.In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency fined the company $2,300 for failing to update its risk management plan in a timely manner. It had been due in 2004. The EPA said it had poor employee training records, failed to document hazards and didn't have a written maintenance program. The EPA said the company corrected the deficiencies and filed an updated plan in 2011. It said it now complies with EPA regulations.The companys 2011 safety plan said the facility posed no fire or explosive risk, according to the Dallas Morning News. Even if there were a 10-minute release of ammonia, the worst-envisioned scenario, no injuries could be expected.The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said the facility has been subject to routine oversight and complaint-driven investigations, but no major problems were found besides the missing permit in 2006. It had issued permits for two 12,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks and for the material loading and storage operations of dry fertilizer materials.The company declined to comment when reached by phone by NBC News.Late Thursday it was learned that West Fertilizer told the Texas Department of Health Services on Feb. 26 that it was storing up to 540,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate, along with up to 110,000 pounds of the liquid ammonia, according to the disclosure report. Ammonium nitrate is the highly explosive chemical compound used in Oklahoma City federal building bombing April 19, 1995.It was also reported that U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration last summer fined West Fertilizer $10,000 for safety violations, including planning to transport anhydrous ammonia without adequate security and failing to properly label ammonia tanks. The company paid a reduced fine of $5,250 after agreeing to take corrective action.I know they were up to date on safety issues and the regulation sides, said Shane McLellan, an agent with the Texas AgriLife Extension Service, a Texas A&M education-based partnership with federal, state, and county governments that works with farmers and their suppliers. A fire at the facility earlier this year caused officials to evacuate a nearby middle school, according to the  Waco Tribune-Herald, but it turned out to be a controlled burn of brush and pallets.
