Posada took his base, but after he scored from second on Nick Swisher\'s triple, he told Girardi his night was over. "When I scored, I hit third base and then going home, I really couldn\'t feel the leg," Posada said. "It was kind of numb."No tests were done at the ballpark; Posada was diagnosed with a right knee bruise. Girardi said it was unlikely that Posada would play Thursday night, although it was unknown whether the Yankees would bring up a third catcher.Girardi appeared to be annoyed in the dugout after Guthrie - the same pitcher who drilled Mark Teixeira and Francisco Cervelli in a March 29 spring game - hit Posada."I don\'t think he\'s doing it on purpose, but he hits a lot of people," Girardi said. "That\'s frustrating for us. We know he\'s going to pitch inside and I don\'t have a problem with that. What do you expect, me to be happy that our guys are getting plunked? I\'m frustrated by it. I wish he had better command in there."Guthrie apologized to Posada in his postgame comments, agreeing with Girardi\'s assessment. "I wish I had better command," Guthrie said. "If I did, I think I would pitch much, much better and we\'d all see better results."
