This means that you are charged a flat fee for every 1,000 impressions you want to receive. Our CPM rate is $0.75, so 75 cents per 1,000 times your ad gets "delivered" (displayed to a redditor). The front page, along with each subreddit has a different amount of impressions it\'s able to deliver. This is known as "inventory". The larger subreddits have more inventory than the smaller subreddits, because they have more traffic and more importantly, more pageviews.
