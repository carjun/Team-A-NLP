My main research is in nitrogen biogeochemistry.", 'My (very probable) guess for the reason these explosions occurred with fertilizers is due to the presence of ammonium nitrate. Ammonium ions (which may be converted to nitrate through nitrification) and nitrate ions are both extremely useful for plants (e.g. formation of proteins), so ammonium nitrate is abundant in fertilizers. Industrial fertilizer production, thanks to the Haber-Bosch process, is now a major way atmospheric nitrogen is fixed for agricultural use. The ammonia from industrial fixation can then be reacted with nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate.', 'Normally, these would decompose slowly, releasing nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a potent greenhouse gas, but not an immediate threat. However, under quick change, like through detonation, the reaction favors a higher production of oxygen, which forms extremely rapidly.', 'This high oxygen content combined with the quick reaction and gas evolution rate results in an extremely potent explosion!', "So, once something sparks combustion in a place where ammonium nitrate is abundant, it's easy to see how the whole place can go up quite quickly. I'm unsure of how high quantities of this is stored, as the amounts that I work with are relatively small.", 'permalinksaveparent[+]Damnmorrisdancer 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]Damnmorrisdancer 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoNote to self, do not live within 10 miles of a fertilizer plant.
