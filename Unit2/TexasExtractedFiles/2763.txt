We are trying to locate each and every citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Tommy Muska said in a telephone interview with The Times.', 'Muska said he arrived at the count of 35 to 40 dead because all other residents and first-responders in the area have been identified. Among those who were missing and believed dead, he said, were as many as six firefighters and four emergency medical technicians.\xc2\xa0', 'The explosion occurred Wednesday night, damaging or destroying buildings within a half-mile radius.', 'State public safety officials declined to say how many have died in the accident, and confirmed only that there were fatalities.', 'Rescue workers and federal investigators continued to face\xc2\xa0 a \xe2\x80\x9cvolatile situation\xe2\x80\x9d at the site, they said.', '\xe2\x80\x9cThe area where the incident occurred\xc2\xa0 is highly populated, it is a neighborhood, it is devastated, it is still a very volatile situation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matt Cawthon, chief deputy of the McLennan County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department.', 'Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are attempting to determine the cause of the explosion, which occurred around 8 p.m. Wednesday as firefighters battled a blaze at the site.', 'Cawthon said that the presence of the explosive substance ammonium nitrate increased the danger. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fertilizer company and, as it is, it has that type of component in it. It is a volatile product.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Texas Atty. Gen. Greg Abbott said he will be doing a flyover shortly to survey the damage, and also warned against price gouging.', 'Many of those injured in the explosion were taken to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco, about 20 miles south. On Thursday afternoon, the Texas flag there flew at half staff.', "Glenn Robinson, the hospital's chief executive, said that the center was still treating 28 patients, five of them in critical condition in intensive care.", 'Many of the patients, hospital staff, and first responders are friends and neighbors. When word went out late Wednesday of the explosion, 285 hospital employees poured into the Waco facility.', '\xe2\x80\x9cOver the last 19 hours, their efforts have truly been heroic,\xe2\x80\x9d Robinson said.', 'Dr. Danny Owens, head of the trauma team, said no training could have prepared his staff for what they encountered Wednesday night.', '\xe2\x80\x9cWe talk about this, we train for it, we think about it. But you never know if you\xe2\x80\x99re ready until it happens,\xe2\x80\x9d Owens said.', "Owens classified most of the injured as suffering from what he termed \xe2\x80\x9cblast wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d He described those injuries as soft tissue and skin lacerations, large and small wounds, and abdominal injuries. He said many of the injuries were compounded by blowing debris which lodged in patients' eyes. The power of the blast also perforated eardrums.", 'Owens said has not seen any injuries that might have been characterized as chemical burns.', 'The wounded began appearing at the facility within minutes of the blast, many by ambulance, others in personal vehicles.', 'As rescuers searched the blast rubble for more survivors, Owens worried that a cold spell expected to hit the area Thursday night could worsen the conditions of any victims trapped beneath debris.', 'Owens said he recognized several of the EMTs and firefighters who were brought to the hospital.', '\xe2\x80\x9cLast night was controlled chaos. Now all the patients are in rooms. Our doctors are going over them for missed injuries or those that have worsened,\xe2\x80\x9d Owens said.', 'Melissa James, a social worker who has been at the hospital for 15 years, rushed to work as soon as she heard about the disaster.', 'Three of her family members were seeking treatment \xe2\x80\x93 her stepmother, nephew, and grandfather who lived in a nursing facility that was severely damaged in the blast.\xc2\xa0', '\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s certainly difficult coming into work, knowing that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to see my own family as patients in this hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.', 'Her stepbrother and nephew were driving near the factory when the blast blew out the windows in their pickup truck.\xc2\xa0 James said that all of her family members are in good condition, even though their house has been destroyed.', '\xe2\x80\x9cThey were just so grateful to be alive and still be here,\xe2\x80\x9d James said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose any of our family members and that\xe2\x80\x99s just so good.\xe2\x80\x9d', "                Most of us have pretty short attention spans and while the people of West Texas can never forget, tragically, the rest of us will, in a very short time, move on, once again consumed by the day-to-day details of our own lives.\xc2\xa0 That's why it's important to think/talk about these things now.\xc2\xa0 It isn't about blame, maybe it is about politics.\xc2\xa0 But what it's really about is doing whatever can be done to keep things like this from happening again and again.\xc2\xa0 I'm sorry if it offends some or steps on other's toes but...The fact the matter is is that this plant went uninspected for so long because of the great state of Texas favors deregulation over the health and welfare of its citizens and yes, sometimes government has to protect us from ourselves especially when it comes to telling us not to build too close to a bomb waiting to go off.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it's about paying the price of a professional fire department that won't make the mistakes that may have been made here.The bottom line is that this is what happens when you cut government services.", '                Focus on Boston people.\xc2\xa0 Terrorism is the real danger, not unsafe working conditions that has a far greater death toll.', "                I live near West, TX. \xc2\xa0Right now we are more concerned about finding and helping our friends and family and comforting those who have lost loved ones, rather than assigning blame. There will be plenty of time for that later. We have emergency and medical personnel working around the clock. I'd like to think that others hold us in their thought and/ or prayers and wish us well.\xc2\xa0", "Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
