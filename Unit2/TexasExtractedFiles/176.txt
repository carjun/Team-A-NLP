Hurricane Alex\xc2\xa0hit this week.For TV folks, the first storm has the effect of those mind-erasing devices from "Men in Black."In an instant, the brains of many TV journalists are cleared of sensibility and replaced with stupidity. Just watch: In the coming months, we\'ll see them repeatedly venture into dangerous situations to bring us storm coverage.Like insects drawn to their death in a bug zapper, TV reporters can\'t help risking a zap from a hurricane.That\'s okay - really - because, no matter how dangerous we know it is, the result is can\'t-miss hurricane TV porn.Blame Dan Rather. In 1961, he was the first to report live during a hurricane when Carla hit Texas. Ever since, reporters have sought their own Rather moment.Now, we just can\'t get enough of watching some dopey correspondent struggling to hold a mic, hat and a wet windbreaker while telling us it\'s windy and bad out. Really, imagine that in a storm?The sad thing is, the unspoken part of the appeal of such coverage is that, at any moment, something could fly from out of camera range and whack them upside the head - or worse.Sure, we care about the storm and potential impact on our lives. And reporting is important. However, there\'s no doubt the draw of hurricane porn is similar to watching ABC\'s "Wipeout": We want to see people fall.Luckily, TV people can\'t help but give us what we want, too.At the height of a storm, long after the police have told everyone they\'re not coming to help, there stands a wind-blown reporter, struggling to stand.The Weather Channel was giving viewers just a tease Wednesday when its meteorologists were around the Texas coast region where Hurricane Alex had hit."We\'re not leaving you, we\'re your hurricane authority," Stephanie Abrams said Wednesday from a beach in South Padre Island, Tex. "We\'re going to be here all night long, baby."To be fair, the Weather Channel team, perhaps because they know weather, tends to avoid the kind of sticky situations that trap mainstream reporters who parachute in for the big ones.But the Weather Channel folks were not alone Wednesday. ABC\'s "Nightline" began with a pitch on being live in the hurricane zone.Others came, too. Shortly before midnight, Weather\'s Jim Cantore was in Texas, about 100 miles from the eye of the storm, and way out of danger. "We got lucky," he said. "We dodged one."This time.Random observationsWhat do I know? Last March, I slammed WCBS/Ch. 2 for having Don Dahler and Kristine Johnson anchor the news in waist-deep floodwaters.Earlier this week, that newscast won the "Outstanding Locally Originated Newscast" award from the New York State Broadcasters Association.Go figure."Let\'s take a hyper-local look at our forecast," News 12 New Jersey\'s Dave Curren said earlier this week, followed by a screen of temperatures, presumably for the state.In my book, "hyper-local" is what the thermometer in my backyard reads.Anything else is, well, not.rhuff@nydailynews.com   ', "   Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in \xc2\xbb .
