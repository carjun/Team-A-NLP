They pointed out that NFC East games matter more, and that they are focused on themselves and not their opponents.', 'But Giants punter Steve Weatherford isnt having it. Yes, there are more important things than Saturdays preseason clash against the Jets at MetLife Stadium. But dont try to say this isnt a rivalry game.', 'Maybe thats because I used to wear that other jersey, said Weatherford. They share the city with us. And when you have bragging rights in your own city  especially in New York City  thats a pretty big deal.', 'Although getting a win in our division is worth one-and-a-half (wins), beating the Jets is pretty sweet.', "It's especially sweet for Weatherford, who spent two seasons with the Jets, then listened to Gang Green special teams coach Mike Westhoff question his performance after he joined the Giants in 2011.", 'And it was especially sweet last season. When the Giants and Jets clashed on Christmas Eve, both teams were clinging to faint playoff hopes. But the Giants left that away game with a 29-14 victory, touching off a six-game win streak that carried them to the Lombardi Trophy.', 'Without the Jet game, without the fire that emerged from that one, there would have been no opportunity for all those other good things to happen, Tom Coughlin said.', 'That was kind of what started the avalanche of wins for us, Weatherford added.', 'The pivotal play? Victor Cruzs 99-yard TD catch and run in the second quarter, a play that gave the Giants a 10-7 lead and a boost of confidence that Weatherford said they never lost.', 'And we were able to parlay that into putting a lot of road wins together, the punter said.', 'This preseason game wont have anywhere near those same ramifications, and the trash talk wont be nearly as explosive, Weatherford said. He doesnt know how much jawing the team in Cortland will do this week, but he does know that his own club wont yap too much.', 'Weatherford said his Giants would love to beat Gang Green. But they also plan to focus on their own corrections after a Week 1 preseason loss in Jacksonville.', 'I think at this point in the season, everybody is so focused and concentrated on themselves right now, Weatherford said.', 'Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in  .
