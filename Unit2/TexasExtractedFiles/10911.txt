Your headline should match the article's headline as closely as possible, to avoid misrepresenting the gist or facts of the article.", 'Resort to racist/sexist insults, in submissions or comments. They add nothing to the discussion, and they will be removed. If you use repeated hate speech or abusive language you may get a temporary ban from the community. Repeated violators will be permanently banned.', 'Use link shorteners. Reddit usually assumes that theyre spam, so they end up in the spam filter. If you have a comment or submission that you want to be seen immediately, dont use link shorteners.', "Post users' personal information.
