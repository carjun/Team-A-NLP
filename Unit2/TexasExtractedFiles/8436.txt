If someone tries to tamper with it, have extra grounds lying around to make it likely to wipe the ram again. Have loose grounds near important areas, if they are broken, a mosfet is released that again, grounds the ram. Since it\'s volatile ram you should get some resistance to cryo attacks, and for duress, if you "accidently" trigger it, it should act like the sequence was successful but give you gibberish data. Better yet it should default to reading out a duress message from rom as the default state on powerup before the ram is programmed. Also, once programmed and committed, all debug and communications mechanisms beyond those required for function should be disabled, any attempt to force them, you know the answer by now.', "It's a bit of a pain in the ass, and you'll have to reset it a few times before it works, but that's the way it goes.", "Bonus points if you carry around an embedded device that can program it, but has an encrypted copy of the key only the device can decrypt while being programmed, and has a passcode to decrypt it for the device also.
