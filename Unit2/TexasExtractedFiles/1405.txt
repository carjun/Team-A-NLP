['WEST \xe2\x80\x94 In this small, shattered town 80 miles south of Dallas, residents awaiting word on missing loved ones spent most of Thursday finding hope in not knowing for sure.But Thursday evening, officials finally laid out what they knew so far: that eight to 10 bodies had been recovered in the devastated areas around Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s horrific explosion at West Fertilizer Co. and that they expected to find about a half-dozen more inside the facility.Although the death toll remained uncertain, it\xe2\x80\x99s a far smaller number than the 35 to 40 that West Mayor Tommy Muska had calculated earlier. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very good news,\xe2\x80\x9d Muska told The Dallas Morning News. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very relieved that it\xe2\x80\x99s not that high.\xe2\x80\x9dBut for many in West, a close-knit town of about 2,800 from which more than 160 people were taken to hospitals with injuries, other answers would have to wait. Many spent the day unsure whether their homes survived the sudden, devastating explosion, so powerful that it registered on seismographs hundreds of miles away.And determining the cause of the fire at West Fertilizer that triggered the explosion could take a while, more uncertainty for a town searching for answers.Muska\xe2\x80\x99s fatality estimate included four EMS members, five volunteers with the West Fire Department, an off-duty Dallas fire captain who lived in West and two volunteers who had seen the fire and stopped to help.One resident of West Rest Haven, a nursing home across from the fertilizer company, died from injuries suffered in the explosion, according to the state agency that regulates nursing homes and David Moon, the home\xe2\x80\x99s former board president and a co-owner.The rest, Muska guessed, were residents who lived within a few blocks of the fertilizer company. Their homes took the full impact of the explosion, with windows blown out, roofs ripped off, walls toppled, with some burning brightly into the night.Many homes and other buildings were said to be flattened. Through the day Thursday, search and rescue crews moved carefully from house to house near the site of the explosion, the buildings so fragile that they had to shore up damaged ceilings and walls before they could search for survivors.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very slow and methodical search,\xe2\x80\x9d Waco police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton said Thursday morning. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some true heroes out there that aren\xe2\x80\x99t police, that aren\xe2\x80\x99t firefighters.\xe2\x80\x9dCondolences poured in from around the world, including from Pope Francis, along with help from around the state. President Barack Obama called Gov. Rick Perry to offer federal support, and the governor quickly declared McLennan County a disaster area as a preliminary step to receiving federal aid for cleanup and reconstruction.\xe2\x80\x9cWe greatly appreciate his call and his gracious offer of his support, and very quick turnaround of the emergency declaration that will be forthcoming, and his offer of prayers,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry said of Obama.Later, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told CNN that the cause was still a mystery and could remain so for weeks.\xe2\x80\x9cUnless we know something else, right now it\xe2\x80\x99s an industrial accident,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get to the bottom of this to find out what happened because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see this ever happen again.\xe2\x80\x9dSearch incompleteOfficials initially said there were no environmental concerns. But later, inspectors from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the federal Environmental Protection Agency tried to determine whether it was safe for rescuers to be on the site.Muska said the Texas Forest Service, which helped coordinate the search and rescue operation, told him late Thursday that crews had searched 80 percent of the devastated area of town, including a nursing home and a 50-unit apartment complex. The teams found the eight to 10 bodies in that search but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t entered the fertilizer company building yet.Residents were eager to get back into their homes, to see if there was anything to salvage. The state\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. senators, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, planned to visit Friday to tour the damage and show support. But Sgt. Jason Reyes of the Texas Department of Public Safety said it was unclear when the affected area would be opened to residents.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still a very volatile situation,\xe2\x80\x9d added McLennan County Chief Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Matt Cawthon.In a town like West, almost everyone knows the missing and the presumed dead, among them, Joey Pustejovsky, West\xe2\x80\x99s city secretary and a member of the volunteer fire department.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a mayor and we have Joey,\xe2\x80\x9d said resident Laura Bettge, who said she spent Thursday morning praying and crying. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a friend to everybody, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also our leader.\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Secretary\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really describe what he does,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have a city manager, so he kind of just helps run everything.\xe2\x80\x9dThe only victim publicly identified Thursday was Capt. Kenny Harris of Dallas Fire-Rescue, a 52-year-old father of three grown sons who lived in West and had volunteered to help fight the fire.\xe2\x80\x9cHe was one of the most genuine people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met,\xe2\x80\x9d said Presley Hoffman, 18, who said she knew Harris\xe2\x80\x99 son.At least two people with family members in the West Fire Department said they were told their loved ones were missing and presumed dead.But even in the most terrible hours West has ever known, residents banded together, helping one another get through that first night and the hard day that followed.Outpouring of helpHundreds of residents hauled cases of bottled water, bags of food and other supplies to the West Community Center. Volunteers said they were so inundated with supplies they had to open other drop-off locations at nearby schools and churches.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a nonstop flow of goods,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dwayne Young, a volunteer who guided traffic outside the community center.The Red Cross opened a shelter for displaced residents but quickly realized no one was waiting for help.\xe2\x80\x9cWe really didn\xe2\x80\x99t need it because they stayed with family and friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan Halyburton, a public affairs volunteer with the Red Cross. \xe2\x80\x9cThat says there\xe2\x80\x99s something special about this community.\xe2\x80\x9dVolunteers from nearby towns, and some from as far away as Dallas, flooded into West early Thursday, eager to help in any way they could.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople from all over have been here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Derek Phipps, a Dallas insurance adjuster who arrived at dawn to volunteer. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t even know where to go. They just drove into town.\xe2\x80\x9dAsked what survivors needed most when they arrived at the community center, Phipps smiled sadly.\xe2\x80\x9cRight now, they just need a hug,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is stone-faced and in shock. So we try to smile, give them a hug, ask how we can help.\xe2\x80\x9dMembers of San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s fire department helped put up an inflatable medical tent at the community center, and chaplains and traumatic stress counselors waited around at the library Thursday afternoon, but families weren\xe2\x80\x99t coming in as they had expected.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say there are more people here to help than in the town, I\xe2\x80\x99d guess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chuck Bridge, a member of the Austin Disaster Relief Network. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just unusual, but it\xe2\x80\x99s early yet.\xe2\x80\x9dPerry, who grew up in an even smaller community, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis tragedy has most likely touched every family, has touched practically everyone in that town.\xe2\x80\x9dAlong the edges of the blast area, the people of West were beginning to put things in order again.
