I love Texas but not your Texans. When Obama was reelected I went on about 50 newly spawned FB pages and made fun of the idiots who wanted TX to secede. None of them had any type of plan for any type of govt, or how the hell they would get people or businesses that disagreed to just leave. It just made our great state look like a bunch of fucktards and I'd bet this guy is right at the top. I'd also bet he'd say he's a bigger patriot although he's the one up and ready to leave. I directed all of them to websites of companies that sold islands and told them that they should practice on an uninhabited island before they took on a challenge like TX. Fake ass patriots make me want to vomit.", "permalinksaveparent[+]PunjabiPlayagot here fast[S] 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago (5 children)[]PunjabiPlayagot here fast[S] 4 points5 points6 points 2 days agoI agree with you. But you're over-generalizing Texans. All of the urban counties are blue. It's just that the crazies are louder than the normals. Ignore them instead of enabling them.", 'permalinksaveparent[+]rammalammadingdong  comment score below threshold (4 children)[]rammalammadingdong -16 points-15 points-14 points 2 days agoI\'m not "over-generalizing" anything. If you think a guy that has "come and take it" on his tailgate is a Democrat, you are sorely mistaken. 100 dollars says he\'s a TeaBagger.

He also has that big ass Republican Texan bumper sticker. I\'m at least moderately liberal and I love the "come and take it" part of Texan culture and history. Yes there are still plenty of good ol boys in brodozers rolling around. But as far as demographics of the urban population in Texas, it\'s turning more and more blue.', "permalinksaveparent[+]rammalammadingdong  comment score below threshold (1 child)[]rammalammadingdong -11 points-10 points-9 points 2 days agoI never said it wasn't turning more blue, I was just pointing out the fact that the guy is obviously not. For the record, I've never once seen a come and take it sticker alongside an Obama sticker. I was siding with fact, not speculation.", 'permalinksaveparent[+]bornandbred -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]bornandbred -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 days agoI appreciate the generalizations, I figure that is what people think of me, but I am about as far left as one can go. I have thought about adding stickers touting my liberalism and atheism, but decided to keep it just about Texas. The other stickers are "Native Texan", one for Lone Star Beer, and the one on the back windshield is "HOU" for Houston, the best city in the state.', 'permalinksaveparent[+]lonestarbeer 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]lonestarbeer 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoI\'ve had a come and take it tattoo long before there was any "Tea Party" bullshit going on.', 'Some of us have a healthy knowledge, love, and respect for the history of this great state.', 'permalinksaveparent[+]OverlordQ 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]OverlordQ 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoSo pretty much what the Democrats did when Bush was elected?', "permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelpwikiFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2013 reddit inc.
