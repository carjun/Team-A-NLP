She was in the driveway with her two daughters preparing to flee when the plant exploded.\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the time that I got to the car, you could hear the boom and within seconds, it just sucked you in and just threw you to the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Jerigan told TODAY.Crystal Ledane shares the dramatic story and her concern for neighbors after her home was damaged by fertilizer plant explosion. Another local resident, Derrick Hurtt, who was sitting in his truck with his daughter Khloey taping the burning plant, caught the moment of the blast on camera.

It all happened so quick that things just kind of went black for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9dAnother bloodied, shaken resident, identified as local EMS doctor George Smith, told reporters: \xe2\x80\x9cThere was just a major, major explosion. The windows came in on me, the roof came in on me, the ceiling came in. We lost all communication when the power went out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole street is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.Even standing several blocks from the plant, residents said they were knocked back by the terrific shock that radiated from the plant explosion.\xe2\x80\x9cA nearby nursing home is really bad, there\xe2\x80\x99s an apartment complex and the school that caught fire,\xe2\x80\x9d Crystal Anthony, who serves on the town\xe2\x80\x99s school board of trustees, told the Waco Tribune-Herald. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been moving patients out of the nursing home and taking them to the football field and gymnastics building on Davis Street.\xe2\x80\x9dOther residents speculated about the cause of the explosion that wiped out homes and killed friends in the town about 20 miles north of Waco.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a small fire and then water got sprayed on the ammonium nitrate, and it exploded just like the Oklahoma City bomb,\xe2\x80\x9d local hotel clerk Jason Shelton told the Dallas Morning News. \xe2\x80\x9cI live about a thousand feet from it and it blew my screen door off and my back windows. There\xe2\x80\x99s houses leveled that were right next to it.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\xe2\x80\x9cThat whole side of town looks like a disaster,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Manolakis told the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cWho in their right mind sticks a damn plant next to houses?\xe2\x80\x9dBill Bohannan was visiting his parents in one of the houses near the plant, and witnessed the devastating explosion.\xe2\x80\x9cI said, \xe2\x80\x98This thing is going to blow,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d as he hurried his parents into the car, Bohannan told the Waco Tribune-Herald. \xe2\x80\x9cI was standing next to my car with my fianc\xc3\xa9e, waiting for my parents to come out and [the plant] exploded.
