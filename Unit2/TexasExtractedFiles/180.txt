['            WEST, Texas \xe2\x80\x94 The scope of the explosion that devastated a large part of this quiet central Texas town became clearer Thursday as search teams scoured damaged and collapsed buildings for survivors and those who perished when a tank reportedly containing liquid ammonia exploded at a local fertilizer business.Officials at one point put the death toll as high as 15, but later in the day backed away from any estimate.Several family members and organizations confirmed that as many as eight emergency workers, five of them West volunteer firefighters, were among the dead or missing.The blast shook the ground with the strength of a small earthquake and crumpled dozens of homes, an apartment complex, a school and a nursing home. Its dull boom could be heard dozens of miles away from the town about 20 miles north of Waco. There was no indication the blast, which sent up a mushroom-shaped plume of smoke and left behind a crater, was anything other than an industrial accident touched off by a fire.More than 160 people in the town of about 2,800 were injured in the Wednesday night explosion, which damaged structures more than a mile away and rained burning embers and debris down on terrified residents. The landscape Thursday was wrapped in acrid smoke and strewn with the shattered remains of buildings, furniture and personal belongings.Daylight revealed areas that looked like they had been pounded by artillery, leaving acres of collapsed roofs and buildings, twisted trees and railroad tracks, and demolished vehicles.A 15-unit apartment complex less than 1,000 feet from the family-run West Fertilizer Co. was heavily damaged.\xe2\x80\x9cA significant area around the fertilizer plant \xe2\x80\xa6 has been destroyed. Homes have been destroyed. There are homes flattened. Part of that community is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sgt. William Patrick Swanton, a Waco police spokesman who is helping the town with communications.West Mayor Tommy Muska said 50 to 60 homes were damaged within five blocks of the blast.Swanton said volunteer firefighter and a constable were at the scene fighting a fire when the plant exploded.Several of the volunteer firefighters who responded to the initial fire were unaccounted for Thursday, Swanton said.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some true heroes out there today,\xe2\x80\x9d Swanton said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they are civilians.\xe2\x80\x9dPresident Barack Obama said Thursday: \xe2\x80\x9cToday our prayers go out to the people of West, Texas, in the aftermath of last night\xe2\x80\x99s deadly explosion at a fertilizer plant.
