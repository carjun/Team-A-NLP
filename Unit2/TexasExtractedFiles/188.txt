CLICK ABOVE FOR PHOTOS OF WILL AND KATE\'S ROYAL WEDDING.     A wife and husband can divorce and yet still be soul mates.At least that\'s Sarah Ferguson\'s take on her failed marriage with Prince Andrew.The Duchess of York, who was divorced from the prince in 1996 after nearly 10 years of marriage, lavished him with a surprising amount of praise in a new interview featured in the June issue of Harper\'s Bazaar."He\'s a great man and a first-rate father and the bestest friend," she told the magazine. "I love him. He\'s my soul mate," Ferguson, 51, continued. "It\'s actually what we said in front of God at the altar: We honor and respect each other until death do us part. The only thing is, he has girlfriends and I have boyfriends."But what about the not-so-small matter of the 2010 scandal that followed after Ferguson was caught on video offering an undercover reporter access to her royal ex in exchange for $724,000?"He felt very, very sorry for me," she told Harper\'s, claiming that the whole incident was a misunderstanding where she was actually the victim."He was so angry that I should have been trapped, \'cause he knows me," she said. "He knows I would never, ever put him in a position that would compromise him, ever!"Still, Ferguson knows she had made "a huge lapse in judgment," and really only gives herself true credit for one thing -- her parenting of their daughters, Princesses Beatrice, 22, and Eugenie, 21."The only thing I know I\'ve done 100% right is be a good mother," she said. "I\'m proud to say I\'m the best mom I know."She was also proud that her girls had the opportunity to attend Prince William and Kate Middleton\'s wedding, which she was not invited to.Prince Andrew and Ferguson wed at Westminster Abbey on July 24, 1986. (AP Photo)Ferguson said she understands why she was snubbed \xe2\x80\x93 and revealed she has never even met Middleton \xe2\x80\x93 but admitted it made her reflect deeply on her own life."It brings back huge memories. I look at it and think, I was once that bride," she said. "It\'s very sad." "You\'re happy for them, of course, but it\'s sad because you\'d love to do it all over again, but with the awareness that you have now," she explained.But the fact that there are no redos in life doesn\'t make Ferguson take for granted the fairly comfortable existence she still has."I have a very lucky life. I\'m able to travel. I have great friends who have been very generous," Ferguson said, as if going through the check list of requirements for happiness."I\'ve got a wonderful family. Andrew and the girls are really the most extraordinary people you\'ll ever meet," she continued."So the fairy tale does go on," she concluded. "It\'s just that my fairy tale has a slightly different ending."   ', "   Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in \xc2\xbb .
