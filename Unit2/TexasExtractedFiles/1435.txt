Comparing runs made by different riders under different conditions isn't very useful, and that site doesn't mention anything about the circumstances of each run. For instance, according to that site a 1987 Honda Hurricane 600 is faster than a 2004 CBR600RR, and a 2012 Triumph Daytona 675R is somehow slower than a 2005 Daytona 650. Oh, and a 2011 R6 is as fast as a 2012 R1, and a 2012 KTM RC8R is slower than just about every 600 ever made (it's one of the slowest sportbikes on the list!). It also claims that there is a .7 second difference in 0-60 acceleration between the 2010 and 2011 Z1000s, despite there being essentially no difference between the two. So, not exactly the scientific method.", "It's a lot more useful to compare times posted by a particular magazine, preferably by a particular rider.

Which rider? Comparing numbers between different publications and different riders would be pretty pointless.
