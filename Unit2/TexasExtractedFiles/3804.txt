Initial reports put the number of fatalities as high as 15, but later in the day, authorities backed away from any estimate and refused to elaborate. More than 160 people were hurt, and three to five volunteer firefighters were among those believed to be dead. The mayor of the city said five bodies have so far been recovered. ', ' Daybreak revealed a breathtaking band of destruction extending outward from the West Fertilizer Co. in this small farming community about 20 miles north of Waco. The thunderous blast shook the ground with the strength of a small earthquake and could be heard dozens of miles away. Gov. Rick Perry declared McLennan County a disaster area Thursday, CBS DFW reports. Officials said at a press conference the area was still volatile because of the presence of hazardous ammonium nitrate fumes. Several buildings with smashed roofs and leveled walls still were smoking early Thursday. An ATF official told CBS News that that the fire scene is still too hot for officials to start a serious investigation. Some initial responders may be near the site of the explosion, but any real investigation cannot begin until the scene cools.  "They have not gotten to the point of no return where they don\'t think that there\'s anybody still alive," Waco Police Sgt. William Patrick Swanton said of rescuers. ', 'On Thursday, Texas Governor Rick Perry hailed the emergency response to what he said was "truly a nightmare scenario" for the community.', 'Perry said at least 75 homes were damaged in the blast. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst says the explosion Wednesday night knocked people "all over the town" back 10 feet, including some through windows.', 'President Obama, while en route to Boston aboard Air Force One, called Perry to tell him that his prayers are with the people of West, Texas as they respond to the explosion, CBS News White House correspondent Major Garrett reports. Mr. Obama offered any federal resources that may be needed to assist in the ongoing response and recovery effort.  The explosion that struck around 8 p.m. sent flames shooting into the night sky and rained burning embers and debris down on shocked and frightened residents. It leveled a four-block area around the plant that a member of the city council, Al Vanek, said was "totally decimated." ', 'A map showing the blast radius of the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, April 17, 2012. ', '  There is no indication the blast was anything other than an industrial accident, Swanton said.  The toll included 50 to 75 houses, an apartment complex with about 50 units that one state police officer said was reduced to "a skeleton," a middle school and the West Rest Haven Nursing Home, from which first-responders evacuated 133 patients, some in wheelchairs. CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy reports that five square miles were evacuated. The high school football field became a triage center. On Thursday people in West were cleaning up their now boarded homes. "Some of my closes friends have had their houses destroyed," April Puckett told Tracy. "And I just -- we\'re going to try to pull together and recover from this. I mean that\'s all we can do." ', '   In the hours after the blast, residents wandered the dark, windy streets searching for shelter. Among them was Julie Zahirniako, who said she and her son, Anthony, had been playing at a school playground near the fertilizer plant when the explosion hit. She was walking the track, he was kicking a football.  The explosion threw her son four feet in the air, breaking his ribs. She said she saw people running from the nursing home and the roof of the school lifted into the sky.  "The fire was so high," Zahirniako said. "It was just as loud as it could be. The ground and everything was shaking."  William Burch and his wife, a retired Air Force nurse, entered the damaged nursing home before first responders arrived. They split up, searching separate wings, and found residents in wheelchairs trapped in their rooms. The halls were dark and the ceilings had collapsed. Water filled the hallways and electrical wires hung eerily from the ceilings.  "They had Sheetrock that was on top of them. You had to remove that," Burch said. It was "completely chaotic."  Some witnesses compared the scene to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and authorities said the plant made materials similar to that used to fuel the bomb that tore apart that city\'s Murrah Federal Building.  Although authorities said it will be some time before they know how many lives were lost, they put the number of those injured at more than 160 early Thursday. West Mayor Tommy Muska told reporters that his city of about 2,800 people needs "your prayers."  "We\'ve got a lot of people who are hurt, and there\'s a lot of people, I\'m sure, who aren\'t gonna be here tomorrow," Muska said. "We\'re gonna search for everybody. We\'re gonna make sure everybody\'s accounted for. That\'s the most important thing right now."  At the Hillcrest Baptist Medical Hospital in Waco, elderly people were wheeled in on stretchers. A man in a wheelchair with his T-shirt covered in blood winced as medical professionals tended to wounds on his head and left arm.  The town\'s volunteer firefighters had responded to a call at the plant at 7:29 p.m., Swanton said. Due to the plant\'s chemical stockpile, "they realized the seriousness of what they had," he said.  Muska was among the firefighters, and he and his colleagues were working to evacuate the area around the plant when the blast followed about 20 minutes later. ', "Dozens of emergency vehicles amassed at the scene in the hours after the blast. Firefighters used flashlights to search the still-burning skeleton of an apartment complex that was all but destroyed. All that remained of a nearby house was the fireplace and chimney, standing tall among smoldering embers of what was once someone's home. Smoke filled the air. ", 'A flood-lit football field initially was used as a staging area, then other triage centers sprung up around the blast site. At one, an army of first responders evaluated senior citizens, many of whom were disoriented, dazed and panicked.  "Get them into an ambulance now," workers shouted.  Those who were OK were loaded onto school buses, many in wheelchairs, to be taken to evacuation centers.  About 100 of the injured were treated at Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco, where five people were in intensive care. Another 65 were taken to Providence Health Center in Waco. Officials said the injuries included broken bones, bruises, lacerations, respiratory distress, and some head injuries and minor burns.', 'The U.S. Chemical Safety Board said it was deploying a large investigation team to West. An Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms national response team that investigates all large fires and explosions also was coming in, bringing fire investigators, certified explosives specialists, chemists, canines and forensic specialists. But entry to the blast site wasn\'t expected until later. "It\'s still too hot to get in there," said Franceska Perot, an ATF spokesperson.  The Dallas Morning News reports that documents show West Fertilizer told the Environmental Protection Agency that it presented no risk of fire or explosion, despite having 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  According to the newspaper, an emergency planning report shows West Fertilizer stated "no" under the section asking about fire or explosion risks. The fertilizer plant indicated the worst case scenario would be a 10-minute release of ammonia gas that would not harm anyone.  There were no immediate details available from police on the number of people who work at the plant, which was cited by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2006 for failing to obtain or to qualify for a permit. The agency acted after receiving a complaint in June of that year of a strong ammonia smell.  In 2001, an explosion at a chemical and fertilizer plant killed 31 people and injured more than 2,000 in Toulouse, France. The blast occurred in a hangar containing 300 tons of ammonium nitrate, which can be used for both fertilizer and explosives. The explosion came 10 days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S., and raised fears at the time it was linked. A 2006 report blamed the blast on negligence.

I reckon it will come out that there wasn\'t actually enough time and there were probably plenty who didn\'t make it out. it\'s so stupid, negligent, disrespectful of fellow life that it was only reported to the fire department at the time that it was, instead of when it actually first broke out. I\'m sure the call for help was delayed, it does sound like it. 2 schools right near it. and would a blast and fire like that if anybody was in it\'s path, leave any trace of them to be solidly accounted for? and SURELY that fire and smoke would have been noticeable by the nearby people enough to get away from it, unlike that woman playing athletics in a park with her little boy, and unlike that guy in his car taking a stupid video of it with his little boy, just so he could get a million hits on youtube. did you hear the frantic terror in that boy\'s voice? how could his dad put him there to scar him with that experience for the rest of his life. and this has happened before, and plenty of locals would have worked there to pass on the common knowledge of the risk of danger if that plant was on fire .. yet they\'re all plodding along complacently going about their day to day trivia while they see and smell that fire going on. perhaps that plant had been leaking toxic fumes all this time, numbing people out of sense.far out.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  ludvig1-2009 says: Move those jobs to Texas where there aren\'t any dumb guvament regulations that keep you from having a bomb factory close to schools and a nursing home.     reply        mturner1938 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Speaking of dumb, stupid is as stupid does.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  mary555555 says: How can an explosive plant be so close to residential and commercial buildings?

Companies seek states with lax oversight for a very good reason, They do not want to be inspected or cited for things that they consider minor but kills employees.Texas and Louisiana attracts them and you hear news of major accidents year in and year out and it all goes on like there was nothing that happened. People are losing their lives because of lax safety standards and regular inspections with the power to shut it down when necessary, that is the bottom line.     reply        7lucky_seven- replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Texas and Louisiana are the most industrialized states in the union. Especially Texas. They are under the same federal regulations as every other state and the states also have their own standards.Where do you people come up with these fairy tales?            jmilbrat replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  ever heard of a place called 3 mile island, the big earthquake in san fransisco in which the bridge that collapsed on itself (why wasn\'t the bridge tested for collapse), buffalo creek flood in virginia(why wasn\'t the dam tested), natural gas explosion in indiana(where were their regulations). Yes TEXAS and LOUISIANA are the only ones who have laxed oversight. Grow up you don\'t see it in your state until something happens, and then its a "NATURAL" disaster. Your so full of it its coming out your eyes. Before you start pointing fingers remember that everytime you point 1 finger 3 more are facing you.

We can use bull chit. We got lots of that.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  MrEthiopian says: Why not build the fertilizer or chemical in a deep whole so that if it does blow up the blast radius is contained? Would it cost that much more to build in some cheep containment??? you get what you deserve when you cut corners or OSHA and the state government does not force potential catastrophic industry\'s to protect the public from mistakes. mrEthiopian     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  TeamClinton says: Trying to bring some semblance of ration to this dialogue, accidents do NOT just happen! Companies seek states with lax oversight for a very good reason, They do not want to be inspected or cited for things that they consider minor but kills employees.Texas and Louisiana attracts them and you hear news of major accidents year in and year out and it all goes on like there was nothing that happened. People are losing their lives because of lax safety standards and regular inspections with the power to shut it down when necessary, that is the bottom line.     reply        7lucky_seven- replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Texas and Louisiana are the most industrialized states in the union. Especially Texas. They are under the same federal regulations as every other state and the states also have their own standards.Where do you people come up with these fairy tales?            jmilbrat replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  ever heard of a place called 3 mile island, the big earthquake in san fransisco in which the bridge that collapsed on itself (why wasn\'t the bridge tested for collapse), buffalo creek flood in virginia(why wasn\'t the dam tested), natural gas explosion in indiana(where were their regulations). Yes TEXAS and LOUISIANA are the only ones who have laxed oversight. Grow up you don\'t see it in your state until something happens, and then its a "NATURAL" disaster. Your so full of it its coming out your eyes. Before you start pointing fingers remember that everytime you point 1 finger 3 more are facing you.
