['              Mangled debris of a fertilizer plant are seen Thursday, April 18, 2013, a day after an explosion leveled the plant in West, Texas. The massive explosion at the West Fertilizer Co. Wednesday night killed as many as 15 people and injured more than 160. (AP Photo/The Times, Henrietta Wildsmith)', 'WEST, Texas (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Buck Uptmor didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to West Fertilizer Co. when the fire started. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a firefighter like his brother and cousin, who raced toward the plant. But a ranch of horses next to the flames needed to be moved to safety.', '\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98He went to help a friend,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 said Joyce Marek, Uptmor\xe2\x80\x99s aunt. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98And then it blew.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99', 'Two days after the fertilizer facility exploded in a blinding fireball, authorities announced Friday that they had recovered 14 bodies, confirming for the first time an exact number of people killed. Grieving relatives filed into a church offering comfort for families, as volunteers nearby handed out food to those still unable to return to homes damaged by the massive blast.', 'Ten of the dead were first-responders \xe2\x80\x94 including five from the West Volunteer Fire Department and four emergency medics, West Mayor Tommy Muska said.', 'The dead included Uptmor and Joey Pustejovsky, the city secretary who doubled as a member of the West Volunteer Fire Department. A captain of the Dallas Fire Department who was off-duty at the time but responded to the fire to help also died.', 'The explosion was strong enough to register as a small earthquake and could be heard for many miles across the Texas prairie. It demolished nearly everything for several blocks around the plant. More than 200 people were hurt, and Muska said five first-responders were among those who remained hospitalized Friday.', 'The first-responders \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98knew it was dangerous. They knew that thing could go up at any time,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 said Ronnie Sykora, who was Pustejovsky\xe2\x80\x99s deacon at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98But they also knew that if they could extinguish that fire before it went up, that they could save tens of lives, hundreds of lives. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they were in there.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99', 'Following a tour of the rubble Friday, Gov. Rick Perry told reporters the search-and-rescue phase for anyone still trapped was largely finished. He said the state would offer help to the 29-member local fire department that had been \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98basically wiped out.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99', 'Earlier in the day, Edward Smith, a volunteer chaplain for the Dallas Police Department, counseled firefighters at West\xe2\x80\x99s fire station.', "\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Right now, the general public might be saying, \xe2\x80\x98Well, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they talking about this?'\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Smith said of the firefighters. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98They don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily even want to talk about it. They\xe2\x80\x99re holding out hope.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99", 'In a town of just 2,800 people, everyone here knew someone affected by the explosion.', 'Officials offered reassurances Friday about the 60 or so people listed as unaccounted for after the blast. McLennan County Judge Scott Felton said many people on the list probably lost their homes and have simply been difficult to locate since the Wednesday evening accident.', '\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to eliminate 99 percent\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 of those listed, he said.', 'The fertilizer facility stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer that can be injected into soil. It also mixes other fertilizers.', 'Plant owner Donald Adair released a statement saying he never would forget the \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98selfless sacrifice of first-responders who died trying to protect all of us.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99', 'Federal investigators and the state fire marshal\xe2\x80\x99s office began inspecting the blast site Friday to collect evidence that may point to a cause.', 'Franceska Perot, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Friday evening that investigators still were combing through debris and would continue Saturday.', 'Residents cannot return to their homes until investigators are finished, Perot said. She did not have a timetable on when that might be.', '\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re moving as fast as we can,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Perot said. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t want them working at night because things can be missed.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99', 'Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, who toured the town Friday, said they would wait for more information about the explosion before considering whether there should be more regulation of anhydrous ammonia.', 'The accident forever changed the community\xe2\x80\x99s landscape. An apartment complex was badly shattered, a school set ablaze and a nursing home left in ruins. At West Intermediate School, which was close to the blast site, all the building\xe2\x80\x99s windows were blown out, as well as the cafeteria.', 'Marek was teaching a high school youth group when the blast shook the room. The lights went out, and a student\xe2\x80\x99s phone lit up with a text message that there was an explosion at the fertilizer plant. He told Marek his brother\xe2\x80\x99s truck had been picked up and hurled into his family\xe2\x80\x99s house.Continued...']
