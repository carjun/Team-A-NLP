[' A dad shooting video within 300 yards of the West, Texas fertilizer explosion late Wednesday night described a frightening aftermath of the deadly blast. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a pretty horrific scene, some of the injuries we saw,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Derrick Hurtt told Matt Lauer on TODAY Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was probably double-digit people standing in front of me videoing that were closer than I was, and after the blast, they were nowhere to be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d At least 15 people were killed and more than 160 wounded in the explosion, according to local police.  West Mayor Tommy Muska told NBC News that he feared as many as 40 could have died.

"I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure it lifted the truck off the ground,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Hurtt said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just blew me over on top of her. It all happened so quick that things just kind of went black for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d Hurtt said his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s inner ear is sore but she has her full hearing back. He estimated they were 250 to 300 yards away from the plant when they started filming.Story: \'The whole street is gone\': Bloodied eyewitnesses describe Texas explosion\xe2\x80\x9cWe drove over to check it out and saw that it was a fertilizer plant burning,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were going to shoot a little video of it and get out of there, and we just didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out in time.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Crystal Jerigan, who lives 15 blocks away from the plant, rushed outside when she heard the emergency trucks drive by.

Jill Jenkins, a triage nurse at a nearby nursing home, rushed to the scene and arrived minutes after the explosion to find a horrific scene.\xe2\x80\x9cIt actually looked like 9-11, what you saw on TV with 9-11. There were people laying in their yards that had been blown out of their homes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe nursing home looked like it had just been blown kind of out.\xe2\x80\x9d She said a nearby apartment structure remained standing but the interior had been destroyed.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople were coming out bloody and injured,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
