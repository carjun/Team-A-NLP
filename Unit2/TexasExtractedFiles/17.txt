Congressional leaders said Tuesday a proposed federal ban on assault weapons is all but dead, crushed by the powerful gun lobby.', '\tAlthough anticipated, the move let down still-grieving loved ones of those massacred in Newtown, Conn., and more than 140,000 Daily News readers who petitioned for the legislation.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreaking that this tragic incident can\xe2\x80\x99t get some common sense laws passed, such as the assault weapons ban,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim Wiltsie, whose cousin, Victoria Soto, a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School, died trying to protect her students on Dec. 14.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a weapon designed for the battlefield and the battlefield only,\xe2\x80\x9d Wiltsie said. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently the gun lobbyists and gun companies have a lot of power still.\xe2\x80\x9d', "The horrific crimes of Newtown gunman Adam Lanza are still fresh in the minds of victims, who feel shunned by Tuesday's decision. ", '\tSupport for reinstating the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines seemed to mount in the weeks after 20-year-old Adam Lanza mowed down 20 kids and six adults with an AR-15 assault rifle at Sandy Hook.', '\tPresident Obama, who vowed to push for the ban, delivered a powerful speech Feb. 10 that invoked Newtown and the July 2012 Colorado movie theater massacre that left 12 people dead and 58 injured.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe type of assault rifle used in Aurora, for example, when paired with high-capacity magazines, has one purpose: to pump out as many bullets as possible as quickly as possible to do as much damage using bullets often designed to inflict maximum damage,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said.', '\tBut the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s top Democrat said Tuesday that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough support in the Senate to pass the ban on the manufacture and sale of 157 types of semi-automatic assault weapons.', '\tThough the ban was approved by a Senate committee, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he stripped it from the gun control bill that\xe2\x80\x99s going to the full Senate because it would have likely caused Republicans to block the entire gun-control package, including measures that have bipartisan support.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t have votes on everything unless I get something on the floor,\xe2\x80\x9d Reid said, of various gun control proposals. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a legislative impossibility.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Connecticut State Police and brave teachers lead a line of children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School to safety. ', '\tSenior Senate aides have said for months that Reid would leave the ban out of the legislation but the news remained a bitter disappointment to gun control advocates and relatives of those whose lives have been lost in mass shootings.', '\tReid\xe2\x80\x99s decision came just 20 days after heartbroken father Neal Heslin, whose 7-year-old son, Jesse, was killed at Sandy Hook, tearfully pleaded for an assault weapons ban at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cSome guns just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any place in the hands of civilians,\xe2\x80\x9d Heslin told the panel. \xe2\x80\x9cThe assault weapons we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about today, their sole purpose is to put a lot of lead out in a battlefield quickly. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they do. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they did at Sandy Hook Elementary. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a killing \xe2\x80\x94 it was a massacre.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tThe ban\xe2\x80\x99s chief proponent, Sen.

They get sold in gun shops and they fall into the hands of grievance killers, young people, gangs. To have these massive killings is such a blight on everything that America stands for.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tFeinstein, referencing the National Rifle Association in particular, said her bill was dropped because \xe2\x80\x9cthe gun lobby is inordinately powerful.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tThe main pieces of Reid\xe2\x80\x99s legislation will focus on broadening background checks on gun buyers and making gun trafficking a federal crime \xe2\x80\x94 a step to fight \xe2\x80\x9cstraw purchases\xe2\x80\x9d of firearms, Democratic aides said.', 'The cover of the March 20 edition of the Daily News. The News has received more than 140,000 signatures from readers who supported an assault-weapons ban. ', '\tThose bills are backed by New York Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, both Democrats. Schumer, who is effectively Reid\xe2\x80\x99s top policy and political advisor, supports an assault weapons ban, but did not support including the ban in the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d gun control package out of concern it would cause defeat of provisions that can pass.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cThis is critically important to make our communities safer,\xe2\x80\x9d Schumer said in a statement Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to keep fighting until we get it.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tGillibrand\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman Glen Caplin said that while the senator had strongly supported the assault weapons ban, she believes Reid\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstrategy will provide an opportunity for the American people to get the vote they deserve on this and other common sense gun safety proposals.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tFeinstein plans to still offer her assault weapons ban bill, which also outlaws ammunition magazines with more than 10 rounds, as an amendment to the gun package on the Senate floor. But she acknowledged it will likely be defeated because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the 60 votes to keep it alive.', 'RELATED: GOING SOFT: VULNERABLE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS FEEL HEAT FROM PRO-GUN VOTERS AHEAD OF 2014', '\tReid said he understood Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s frustration, but said her proposal has too little support.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cRight now her amendment, using the most optimistic numbers, has less than 40 votes,\xe2\x80\x9d Reid said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not 60.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tLenny Pozner, whose 6-year-old son, Noah, was killed in the Newtown shooting, said that if Sandy Hook couldn\xe2\x80\x99t change minds on assault weapons, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what will.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this event, however painful it is, will be strong enough to make people decide that society is better off without assault weapons,\xe2\x80\x9d Pozner said.', '\tMark Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, also died at Sandy Hook, took solace in the fact that some progress is being made on gun control, despite the weapons ban getting axed.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe not this time, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give up,\xe2\x80\x9d Barden said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make some vast changes in a lot of areas.
