['West Texas fertilizer explosion damages could exceed $100M - Dallas Business Journal', 'Lawyer Larry Wilson said the costs resulting from the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, could be immense.', 'Even if the privately owned West Fertilizer Co., which erupted in a massive fireball explosion this week, has $100 million in insurance coverage, it likely still won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough to cover the litigation in the wake of perhaps more than two dozen deaths, according to a Houston lawyer.', 'The death toll from the blast is still unclear, according to reports. Authorities have said there is no sign of foul play, but the facility hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been inspected since 2006, Reuters is reporting.', 'Larry Wilson, an attorney at The Lanier Law Firm in Houston, previously worked on the BP Plc refinery explosion in Texas City, which he said may now pale in comparison to the inferno in West, Texas, that left much of the tourist stop along Interstate 35 in smoldering ruins.', '\xe2\x80\x9cThe explosion sounds like it was bigger than anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard of in any plant in Texas,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson said.', 'For now, the focus is to meet the medical needs of those injured \xe2\x80\x94 estimated to be at least 150 people, Wilson said. But those who are left behind would be wise to seek legal counsel, he said.', '\xe2\x80\x9cLitigation is sometimes the best way to get answers on what happened,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The first order of business would be to send over \xe2\x80\x9cpreservation of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d letters to authorities, Wilson said. However, he added, it is unlikely evidence will get destroyed with federal authorities investigating and safeguarding that material over the coming months.', 'Still, there are limitations on what particular victims can recover. In Texas, the volunteer firefighters who are feared to be among the dead cannot sue the owners of the fertilizer plant under the \xe2\x80\x9cFireman\xe2\x80\x99s Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson said. Employees of the fertilizer plant cannot sue their employer for regular negligence, only gross negligence, which means a court would have to find that the employer was reckless in its negligence.', 'Deon Daugherty covers energy and law for the Houston Business Journal.
