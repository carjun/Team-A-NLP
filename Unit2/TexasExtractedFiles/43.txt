"They touch all over. I feel that\'s very uncomfortable, very, very uncomfortable."Imagine if a TSA worker addressed a traveler the way Green says a cop spoke to him three weeks ago. The cop stopped him for being at a park off Sutter Ave. at nightfall."He\'s looking at me and I\'m looking in his eyes," Green recalled. "He says, \'Don\'t f---ing look at me. Don\'t eyeball me, mother------.\'"Others in the park were allowed to keep playing basketball, but Green got a summons for being there after hours, an incidental blemish on an otherwise clean record."I have never been in jail," he reported.He actually hopes to work in one as a correction officer. He is studying criminal justice at LaGuardia Community College and he works at Duane Reade, where he was headed when he paused to speak with me. He has none of the thug in his dress or deportment."I don\'t walk like that," he rightly said.Nevertheless, he lives in a neighborhood whose 1,500 young black males average roughly five officially recorded patdowns a year. He has been patted down so many times he has lost count."They say, \'We just want to pat you down,\'" Green said. "I say, \'Pat me down for what? I didn\'t do anything wrong.\'"Civil libertarians have asked similar questions, pointing to the patdown statistics that originally appeared in The New York Times.They note that only 1% of those stopped were arrested and that the 50,000 patdowns resulted in the recovery of only 25 illegal guns.To be fair to the police, those numbers could also be used to make a case for the strategy\'s effectiveness in keeping guns off the street.A punk who has paid $500 for a 9-mm. is going to be less likely to carry it if he thinks he is liable to lose it by being patted down. The ultimate result is deterrence, just as it is with the airport screening.In Brownsville anyway, many of those who are repeatedly patted down say the problem is not so much the strategy as the attitude of some cops. A cop approaching a member of the public who is doing no wrong should be at least as polite as your average TSA screener.At the same time, a member of the public who is patted down, be it at an airport or on the streets of Brooklyn, should remember that the ultimate purpose is public safety.Who knows, a patdown may have prevented the shooting of two young men in East Flatbush yesterday afternoon. One died in a minivan. The other was sprawled facedown in a sun-splashed alley."No turkey for them," observed a man from the paint store on the corner.There is no telling how many people would not be sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner were it not for our guardians in the street and at the airports.We owe them our thanks every day, just as they owe us respect.mdaly@nydailynews.com   ', '   Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in \xc2\xbb .
