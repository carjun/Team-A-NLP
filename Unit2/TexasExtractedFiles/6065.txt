Republicans and democrats, as the two most well known parties will ALWAYS take up the majority of votes when you have two strong parties, one will get 46% and the other will get 44%. In the meantime, that 3rd party will get 10%.

But many of us also see many of those 3rd parties as even worse than the current two. I'll take a democrat over a libertarian any day. While I am a green party member, I recognize that the strength of the green party is in its influence, not in it's ability to get elected.

The park and monuments would be just left unattended with doors, if any, locked. What the federal agencies who pull this kind of maneuver are doing is trying to say "Hey!
