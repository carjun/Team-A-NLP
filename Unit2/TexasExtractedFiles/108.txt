Jillian Lewis may seem like the most subdued "Project Runway" finalist, but to Heidi Klum, she\'s nothing but "ballsy."The Long Island native\'s bold designs earned her a spot at New York Fashion Week. Not bad for someone who didn\'t dream of becoming a designer until high school. As a girl growing up in Selden, Lewis studied ballet before heading to Manhattan\'s Parsons School of Design. The switch was a wise one. In one episode of the hit Bravo series, designer and "Runway" judge Michael Kors called her garments "impeccable," while Klum labeled her "ballsy." "She\'s all quiet, but her pieces are not," Klum added. Whether or not Lewis wins in tonight\'s finale, her friends and family are sure she\'ll go far. "For our prom, Jillian\'s mother bought her a dress that was very cutting edge at the time," recalls Lewis\' close friend Courtney Thaler. "It was a shorter dress under a sheer long dress. We were just about to walk out the door and get into our limo and Jillian was like, \'I just don\'t like where this underdress is falling on me.\' "She took it off and took a pair of scissors to it," Thaler adds. "I started to cry. I was like, \'Jillian, you\'re going to ruin your dress and your mom paid all that money.\' She re-sewed her dress in about 10 minutes and put it back on. It was great." Lewis didn\'t realize she had a passion for making clothes until her teens. "My fellow contestants like Christian [Siriano] and Rami [Kashou] always say, \'I\'ve been doing this since I\'m 7.\' Everybody was dreaming about it since they were young or they have some family member that they inherited the gift from." For Lewis, now 26, neither applied. She was training to be a professional ballet dancer. But then her mom bought her a cheap sewing machine when she was 14."It was during the late \'90s when that trend of really big, wide-leg pants was coming in," Lewis says. "I would see them in magazines, but on Long Island the trendy things that were happening in Manhattan weren\'t available in stores. "I wanted to wear that kind of stuff, so I started making all sorts of things and got so much attention from people at school," she adds. "Everywhere I went, people would say, \'Oh my God. Where\'d you get that?\' And I started to feed off of that response. I was like, \'Wait until you see what I\'m going to do next.\'" Before long, Lewis was selling pants to her dance school with the studio\'s logo on them. "She sold everything," recalls her mom, Karen. "She took orders and made a whole business for herself." But pal Thaler got to wear her designs for free. "She made these drawstring, wide-leg pants out of jersey because it was a very affordable material," says Thaler. "People were going crazy over them. They were superwide bell bottoms, and they looked good on everyone." When they were 16, Lewis styled Thaler in the clothes she designed. "They set up a whole little studio down in the basement," Karen shares. "And Jillian would take pictures of Courtney wearing all these designs that she made. That\'s when she really decided to go into fashion." The choice led her to Parsons, where "Project Runway" contestants now prepare their projects. "I worked in the room that I remember working in as a student," Lewis says. "It was a little bit weird at first." But she relaxed when she got reacquainted with "Runway" mentor Tim Gunn, the former head of fashion design at Parsons. "I knew him in the past pretty well," she says. "And he conducts the workroom as though it\'s a classroom. So that tricked me into feeling like this is just school again." But it was in that same room that fellow designer Christian got under her skin. In the last challenge, Lewis was having trouble with an iron. "Jillian\'s been pressing for the past three hours," Christian cattily announced. She shot back that he was arrogant and the two got into a tiff. "He\'s not hesitant to make fun of me when he feels like it and I\'m not hesitant to say back off," Lewis admits. "We have this adorable brother and sister relationship where we can snap at each other and then we can hug and be best friends again five minutes later." While she\'s happy with the pieces she created on the show, there is one thing she might have changed. "I regret, if anything, when I watch, \'Could I have been a little bit more pleasant?\' Lewis wonders. "\'Could I have smiled more during the Tim visits? Could I have been a little bit more personable?\'" But with the help of her daring designs, she charmed the judges enough to make it to Bryant Park.
