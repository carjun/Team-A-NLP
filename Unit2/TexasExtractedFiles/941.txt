Three to five firefighters remained unaccounted for more than 14 hours after Adair Grain Inc.s fertilizer mill erupted in flames and exploded.The last time a U.S. industrial catastrophe killed so many people was April 2010, when 29 coal miners perished in Massey Energy Co.s Upper Big Branch mine. With the demolished fertilizer facility and some of the surrounding rubble yet to be searched, Swanton said the number of deceased may climb, which would make it the deadliest such incident in Texas since the 1947 explosion aboard the SS Grandcamp freighter that killed more than 570.A lot of lives have been lost and some of them are firefighters, Lisa Muska, the wife of Mayor Tommy Muska, said in an interview today. We all know each other and care about each other deeply.Storing TonsAdair Grains West Fertilizer Co. produced anhydrous ammonia, a volatile combination of nitrogen and hydrogen that North American farmers inject in liquid form into the soil as a crop nutrient. State environmental records showed that as of Dec. 31, the plant also held in storage as much as 270 tons of an ammonia derivative known as ammonium nitrate, a solid fertilizer used by Timothy McVeigh to destroy the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City in 1995. It was also used in the Irish Republican Armys 1996 Canary Wharf attack in London.The Environmental Protection Agency inspected the West plants risk management plan in March 2006 and found a number of deficiencies. The EPA fined the facility $2,300 in August that year and directed Adair Grain to correct the shortcomings, Alisha Johnson, an agency spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.Adair stored as much as 110,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, according to the Texas State Department of Health Services.Complete DevastationFirefighters in West were battling a blaze at the plant and evacuating nearby residents when it exploded at about 7:53 p.m. local time yesterday. A nursing home, hospital and two schools sit less than a mile from the facility on the northeast edge of town. Waco, the seat of McClennan County, is about 20 miles south of West.I never thought of anything like that happening, Jenene Picha, manager of the Czech-American Restaurant, said in an interview. Firefighters showed great courage in battling the blaze and they knew it was very dangerous out there.Swanton said the damage to houses ranged from broken windows to complete devastation. A house-to-house search was in progress, though Swanton didnt have an estimate for how many civilians were missing. A 50-unit apartment complex suffered severe damage, with the interiors of some apartments visible from the street.There are homes that are no longer homes, Swanton said today. There are homes that have been completely flattened.Investigation TeamWhile the site is being treated as a crime scene, there are no indications that the fire was intentionally set, Swanton said. A pair of urban search-and-rescue experts known as Texas Task Forces 1 and 2 have been deployed, as has a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives team of forensic chemists and explosive specialists. The federal agents will be responsible for determining whether the explosion was accidental or criminal, according to a federal official.The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which investigates industrial chemical accidents, said on its website that a large investigation team should arrive in West today. Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist at the U.S Geological Survey, said a magnitude 2.1-degree seismic event had been registered as the explosion occurred. The impact would have generated a shock wave, she said by phone from Golden, Colorado.The worst-hit areas appeared to be the nursing home and apartment building, Swanton said at an earlier briefing. Local television station KWTX showed fires in the ruined plant and in surrounding buildings, and people being treated on a flood-lit sports field.Elderly VictimsTrooper D.L. Wilson, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, likened the scene at West to the Iraq war and said the apartment complex now resembled a skeleton. A nearby school also was badly damaged, and 133 residents of the West Rest Haven Nursing Home were evacuated, some in wheelchairs.Wesley Adcock, 29, was delivering a load of concrete to a construction site when he saw a mushroom cloud in his rear-view mirror. He volunteered to ferry victims to hospitals in Waco. The three people he helped were all residents of the nursing home.The last lady was 95, Adcock said. She said she was buried in the bathroom when the ceiling collapsed on her.In Waco, 28 people were admitted to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center, Chief Executive Officer Glenn Robinson said. Five were in the intensive care unit, two of them in critical condition, he said.Gas SmellWere seeing a lot of lacerations, some puncture wounds, Robinson said. Some patients had broken legs and hips and a handful had head injuries. Nine people with burns were transferred to Parkland hospital in Dallas.The Texas Secretary of State listed Donald R. Adair and Wanda L. Adair as owners and co-directors of Adair Grain, with Donald serving as president and Wanda as vice president. A man who answered a reporters telephone call to the company declined to identify himself or comment.Elizabeth Marquez-Perea, who lives a mile north of the plant, said about 50 families lived at Tucker Apartments, the damaged block close to the facility. She and her three daughters fled after the blast shattered windows of their apartment. It smelled like gas, a real terrible smell, she said.About a month ago, the school close to the plant had sent parents a note explaining that children had been moved for the day to a different location because of smells coming from the fertilizer plant, Marquez-Perea said.French BlastCrystal Webb said she was preparing to drive her 7-year-old son from her home near the plant to her mothers home in another part of town when the explosion hit.Its an indescribable sound and feeling, Webb said. Every window in my home, every door in my home is completely busted.The blast tore bricks off the outside of her house, Webb said. She and her son were uninjured.Im anxious to get home, she said. She didnt know if her house survived the fire.The disaster was reminiscent of a 2001 fertilizer-factory explosion in Toulouse, France, that killed 31, injured more than 2,000 and caused over $3 billion in property damage. The plant, owned by a subsidiary of oil producer Total SA, wasnt rebuilt. Two years after the incident, French authorities imposed stricter regulations for ammonia production.Federal ResponseThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary flight restriction over West, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said today before the House Committee on Homeland Security. She said local utilities have turned off service in the area and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been activated.We will continue to monitor events over the course of this day, Napolitano said.President Barack Obama called Texas Governor Rick Perry from Air Force One while on his way to Boston to offer federal resources that may be needed, said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman. Obama also told Perry that his prayers are with the people of West, Earnest said in an e-mail.Texas Republican Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz said in a statement they were deeply saddened to learn of the horrific explosion in West, Texas.--With assistance from David Wethe and Jack Kaskey in Houston, Thomas Biesheuvel and Amanda Jordan in London, David Stringer in Melbourne, Darrell Preston in Dallas, Danielle Ivory, Phil Mattingly, Roger Runningen, Hans Nichols and Mark Drajem in Washington, Carol Matlack in Paris and Joe Carroll in Chicago.
