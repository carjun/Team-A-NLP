I wouldn't really say it's worth watching but I'll link it here anyways. The signifigant part of this talk to me was when he asked if a game were stripped down to its fundamentals - so all story, graphics, music, etc. were removed, would it still be fun? I would definately answer no to this for Bioshock, Last of Us and Mass Effect. The actual gameplay, which is the majority of the game, isn't interesting or engaging at all. I think it's stuff like this that has been pushing me more towards indie games for the past couple years since good indie games don't draw out the game to make consumers feel like they got their $60 worth.

In Dota 2, there are multiple points of contention almost constantly whereas StarCraft usually has one, maybe two if there's a drop going on. Because there are many points of interest at once in Dota 2, which I imagine would result is that the camera would often be desynchronized between the spectator and the casters. In many ways it would be like using the autocam while listening to a caster. The visuals wouldn't match the commentary and it would probably end up feeling like a lower quality production, even if you are capturing all of the action or it moves a bit more smoothly.", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (382)The New American Economy: 90% of new jobs since 2009 are part-time  by  charlesthenorrisin  news[+]Decateron 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago \xc2\xa0(0 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]Decateron 2 points3 points4 points 2 months agoOr are being hidden under the label of disabled.', "permalinksavecontextfull comments (1094)view more: next \xe2\x80\xbaaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelpwikiFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. \xc2\xa9 2013 reddit inc.

It's gotten to the point where I avoid AAA singleplayer games because I can't be bothered to sit there for 10 hours just to get a few hours of story that's less interesting than a movie.", "There was a talk by Jonathan Blow where he talked about the human condition in relation to video games. I wouldn't really say it's worth watching but I'll link it here anyways. The signifigant part of this talk to me was when he asked if a game were stripped down to its fundamentals - so all story, graphics, music, etc. were removed, would it still be fun? I would definately answer no to this for Bioshock, Last of Us and Mass Effect. The actual gameplay, which is the majority of the game, isn't interesting or engaging at all. I think it's stuff like this that has been pushing me more towards indie games for the past couple years since good indie games don't draw out the game to make consumers feel like they got their $60 worth. Once they've finished exploring whatever mechanic they've created, they're fine to just let the game be done, so you don't feel like you're retreading ground.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (261)Games you bought and played once or twice  by  darguskelenin  boardgames[+]Decateron 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Decateron 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoWe used the advanced rules. Maybe we got a bit lucky, but I don't really find the game to be all that strategically deep, especially when you have multiple people working together.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (552)Games you bought and played once or twice  by  darguskelenin  boardgames[+]Decateron 18 points19 points20 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Decateron 18 points19 points20 points 2 months agoFlash Point. I'd be happy to pull it out, but my gaming group isn't interested in cooperative board games. My biggest gripe with the genre is that the challenge comes from randomness and so when you lose it feels like you just got unlucky rather than getting outplayed.", "It also probably doesn't help that we beat Flash Point on our first and only playthrough. Since it's cooperative and there isn't any evolving metagame, everyone thinks that we've essentially beaten the game.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (552)Quest for the Greatest Soundtrack in Gaming.  by  RandomHer0in  truegaming[+]Decateron 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Decateron 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago102 comments and only one mention of Machinarium?

In Dota 2, there are multiple points of contention almost constantly whereas StarCraft usually has one, maybe two if there's a drop going on. Because there are many points of interest at once in Dota 2, which I imagine would result is that the camera would often be desynchronized between the spectator and the casters. In many ways it would be like using the autocam while listening to a caster. The visuals wouldn't match the commentary and it would probably end up feeling like a lower quality production, even if you are capturing all of the action or it moves a bit more smoothly.", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (382)The New American Economy: 90% of new jobs since 2009 are part-time  by  charlesthenorrisin  news[+]Decateron 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Decateron 2 points3 points4 points 2 months agoOr are being hidden under the label of disabled.', "permalinksavecontextfull comments (1094)view more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelpwikiFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2013 reddit inc.
