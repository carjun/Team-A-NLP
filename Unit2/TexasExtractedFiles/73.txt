The school is housed in a church building on Hooper St. that it rents for $649,000 a year.', 'To receive annual sex ed lessons, Edmonds and his classmates must trek across the neighborhood to El Puentes offices at 211 S.

And when it comes time for required sex ed instruction, kids at those schools go off site to facilities owned by the city or to local nonprofits.', 'Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott said the churchs prohibition on sex education and HIV/AIDS instruction has never caused problems. We have dozens and dozens of sites with the diocese and archdiocese, and thats predicated on being responsible and following the tenets of the church, said Walcott.', 'State law enacted in 1987 requires city schools to administer lessons on HIV/AIDS to every student in each grade at least once a year. In 2011, city officials mandated sex ed lessons, as well, for all students in either sixth or seventh grade, and again in either ninth or 10th grade.', 'City parochial schools require sex ed lessons starting in the seventh grade that are aligned with church teachings that favor abstinence.', 'Church officials say they are within their rights to banish the citys sex ed and HIV/AIDS instruction from their buildings  and they have no plans to change.', 'It is an arrangement that has been working well for both sides for years, and one we intend to continue, said Diocese of Brooklyn spokeswoman Stefanie Gutierrez.', 'But the policy is unpopular with parents, who argue the church oversteps its bounds by forcing tenant schools to take students off the premises for mandated lessons.', 'I cant see how a church is going to tell you about what to teach, said Lisa Smith, 45, of Harlem, whose daughter attends Thurgood Marshall Academy Lower School, which rents a church building in Washington Heights.', 'Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in  .
