So to reduce the number of moaners in comments as since such are simply ridiculous. First of all, I\'m really happy, how it turned out, however, won\'t say how little time it took me because I\'m shocked myself. Was highly inspired, I guess, drove into some masking frenzy and yeah :).I\'m falling in love with this pairing once again. I mean, I doubt, it will happen (because Sasuke\'s gay, proved, it\'s not normal to push off so many sexy chicks, no matter how emo you are) but still it\'s more probable than SasuSaku. There\'s also a possibility, Sasuke DID have some fun with Karin but Kishi just didn\'t perpetuate it on manga panels :P.Just take notice of the fact, what was Sauce\'s attitude towards Karin. It was rather a partnership, he respected and treated her in a serious way (whereas Sakura was just an useless burden, to say truth). What\'s more, they had some nice moments in manga, we might have seen Sasuke speaking to her, like they were having an usual conversation (what\'s pretty rare of him lol), while he was mealy-mouthed with Sakura. In addition to that, it was noticable, they comfortable with each other :3.WHAT IS MORE SASUKARIN IS SEXY. Karin\'s pretty and yeah, I\'d give her some bigger (preferably porno) boobs, tho.Now SasuSaku lovers are to announce that, Sasuke wanted to kill Karin. Sure, he pierced her with a lightning, though hesitated, whether to finish her off or not. Such thing did not take place when it comes to Sakura, he wanted to kill her just as soon as she appeared FOR NO REASON XD. He wanted to sacrifice Karin for revenge, not just because it was fun.I\'m gonna quote Kanae\'s post from narutoforums becaue it clearly describes my feelings about it:picture: http://imageftw.com/uploads/20120420/..."Never did she fathom that Sasuke would ever do such a thing to her. Because the Sasuke she knows wouldn\'t have. (...) I also think that Karin\'s words here can be food for thought. She is clearly implying that she felt she was worth more to Sasuke than just this; and this is Karin we\'re talking about, perception-master and sensor-ultimate who can even tell when someone is lying due to their chakra, for god\'s sake. If Sasuke did not genuinely care about her, rest assured she would be the first one to know "Kanae\'s youtube: http://www.youtube.com/user/TsukiKanae8Don\'t get me wrong though, it\'s not like I despise or what SasuSaku, just getting bored with it.I hope that Karin will meet with Sasuke one day and will capture his heart for good or AT LEAST kick his ass XD.AND NOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE VIDEO, not pairings... :)I\'m sure, the lyrics tells pretty much the story of their relationship, I wanted to present. The video\'s about a mad love, which is driving Sasuke crazy and he can\'t reconcile with it. He\'s unable to show his affection to Karin, even though she has some feelings for him as well. He\'s acting cold and ruthless, which confirms her in opinion, that he doesn\'t like her at all. Therefore she\'s starting to meet with other guys and as a consequence she undeliberately hurts Sasuke, who\'s still unable to show his feelings. As since, he\'s a psycho, he decides to kill her (you know: if I can\'t have her, nobody will ;_;).The last scene: it up to you, if she kills her or stops his chidori (I tried to make it seem not obvious). I\'d opt for the second choice, though.
