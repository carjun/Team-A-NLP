It's easier to see the screen since the UI doesn't get in the way, you can see the entire wave without having to unlock your screen (though I bet most pros play with unlocked screens), and blue, until recently, would get roughly 2 minions more xp by ten minutes due to a bug.", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (5241)[Spoiler] League of Legends World Championships Season 3 - Quarterfinals - Day 1  by  TournamentThreadsin  leagueoflegends[+]DBZMerciter2005 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]DBZMerciter2005 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoAnd GG.

Now that's interesting.", "I feel C9's team comp isn't quite as strong as Fnatic due to Fnatic's sheer mobility. Combine teleport with Kass and it's going to be a very hard game. This will be a fun game to watch.", "Edit: I bet that Fnatic is going to camp Vlad.

For example, I\'m an Ohio State fan. We hate Michigan. If Michigan is beating Ohio State at the horseshoe/Ohio State\'s stadium the crowd is deadly silent. If Ohio State is beating the crap out of Michigan the crowd is loud as sin. It\'s how "home field advantage" is.
