Straight swinger couples, for instance, typically try to conceal their lifestyles because it\'s pretty heavily judged. The point is not that gay people have particularly valuable lifestyles that must be preserved - the point is that a greater acceptance of gays should lead to a breaking down of the norm for everyone instead of an incorporation of gays into the existing norm. That\'s not to say most people getting married and having kids is bad - it\'s just to say that treating that as a norm and judging people outside of that norm, gay or straight or whatever, is not a great thing. Hence strengthening the norm of marriage by incorporating what was once a large group that existed outside of it is going to lead to stronger pressures on those who go against the norm (gay or straight).', "Personally I think the concept of a norm is a bit unavoidable, and since we're not going to be breaking down marriage laws anytime soon, we might as well go ahead and provide that as an option for gay couples. But I do see the logic, having met many happy people in non-normal relationships and having met many childless (by choice) married couples who get tax breaks for doing jack shit.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (142)Ivy Leaguers of Reddit, what did it take you to get in?  by  omarQamarin  AskReddit[+]hforlife 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago \xc2\xa0(0 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]hforlife 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoWell intellect is about more than genes, too. Just think about the advantages associated with early childhood education or mom/pop reading to you at home. That's circumstance that actually builds intellect. So sometimes if you're smart as hell, at least in the way that school/tests currently rate intelligence, it's in large part due to a lot of circumstantial help you got long before you were aware of the existence of the SATs.

I'd like to provide another answer that comes from a much more liberal side. ", 'Many in the gay community oppose the current rhetoric on gay marriage because is focuses on normalizing gays (i.e. "We\'re normal just like you - we get married and have kids!"). It will end up putting a lot of social pressure on gays to get married and "be like Mitch and Cam", when that\'s not what all gay men and women want. They spent decades in the 20th century building their own communities with their own ways of negotiating romance, friendship, and sex, and many find it offensive that now they want to throw that behind them and just get married like everyone else. They had a lot to teach the non-gay world about their lifestyle, but instead they chose to embrace the "norm" wholeheartedly. ', 'A good book that goes over this is "The Trouble with Normal" by Michael Warner. He advocates redefining marriage such that the government can incentivize what it needs to incentivize without getting mixed up in a very culturally loaded word. For example, two friends or siblings living together for a long time would be subject to taxation appropriate for shared property, and adultery laws would be annulled to allow for adult couples to have a relationship in the way that they wish.

This is for the younger people. Many of the teams are top-level (things like squash), but a larger number are pretty average. Yet the coaches are still given a few spots they can fill - basically where they ratchet the standards down a notch when assessing your application. It's a pretty significant notch as long as you're not like a B student with a crap SAT. So if the Brown football or swimming or whatever coach wants you on his/her team and you're fairly smart, you're golden baby.

A few slip through the cracks, and plenty have athletics or legacies on their side (I never once met a black or Hispanic student that I felt was in any way less qualified than anyone else - more likely to run into boring white legacies), but overall it's about way more than working really hard to get great grades and test scores. The interviewers can just TELL. And when you actually get there, the really hard working people are usually the least intelligent - the genuinely smart ones find ways to get shit done quickly and easily, and then they move on to the next thing.
