People who go to college to pursue hobbies waste their time and money.  Music of the type that is taught at a university pays zero in life.  If you want to perform in an orchestra in your free time, I don't think you need to study music at a college.  You want to transfer as soon as possible since whatever new school will try to make you repeat all the courses you completed at UNT.  Waiting two years is going to cost thousands of dollars and months of time.  If you really want a BA in music and don't care about money then finish the CS completely first, then do the music program.
