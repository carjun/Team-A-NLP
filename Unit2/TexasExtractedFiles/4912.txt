President Obama offered disaster relief on Friday.', 'Media reports have characterized the explosion site \xe2\x80\x94 11 buildings on 10 acres \xe2\x80\x94 as a \xe2\x80\x9cfertilizer plant.\xe2\x80\x9d The Dallas Morning News has clarified that West Fertilizer Co. and Adair Grain is a farm supply company that sold fertilizer as well as grain, feed and tools. \xe2\x80\x9cThe company mixed fertilizers tailored to farmers\xe2\x80\x99 specific needs,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a common practice throughout rural America. It did not manufacture fertilizer.', 'When the facility was built in 1962, it was about a mile north of town. But the town grew \xe2\x80\x93 like many towns across the country \xe2\x80\x93 and so today it was less than 3,000 feet from a school and within blocks of a nursing home and apartment complex. Who makes those zoning decisions? Usually a local zoning board.', 'The Texas Feed and Fertilizer Control Service inspects feed and fertilizer distributors like West Fertilizer. There are \xe2\x80\x9c5,92 such establishments\xe2\x80\x9d in the state, according to USA Today.', 'Initial news reports focused on two tanks capable of storing 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer and poisonous gas.', 'However, in 2012, the facility also stored a minimum of 540,000 pounds (270 tons) of ammonium nitrate. According to NBC, facilities are supposed to report to the Department of Homeland Security if they store more than 400 pounds of ammonium nitrate. The reason? The material can be used as a component of a bomb and was part of the Oklahoma City bomb that killed 168.', 'News reports have cited West Fertilizer filings with EPA that its anhydrous ammonia presented no risk of explosion, almost with a tone of incredulity. But here\xe2\x80\x99s what that material safety data sheet (MSDS) says: anhydrous ammonia is a Non-Flammable Gas.', 'News reports have also characterized ammonium nitrate as a \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous explosive.\xe2\x80\x9d In contrast, the MSDS for ammonium nitrate describes it as \xe2\x80\x9c[s]lightly flammable to flammable in presence of heat, of combustible materials, of organic materials\xe2\x80\x9d and says that it \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ay be combustible at high temperature.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'According to Jimmie Oxley, a researcher at the University of Rhode Island, it is \xe2\x80\x9cvery difficult\xe2\x80\x9d to get ammonium nitrate \xe2\x80\x9cto detonate at a reasonable scale.\xe2\x80\x9d However, as it burns, ammonium nitrate produces oxygen, which exacerbates danger and helps explain the 1947 industrial accident involving ammonium nitrate in Texas City, TX. This was largest industrial accident in the US; it killed 600. ', 'The photos and names of the three people who died in Boston have been on national news, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hard-pressed to identify the 14 who have died in Texas. Reportedly, 11 were first responders.', 'I will update this list of those killed in the West TX explosion as names become public. ', ' Cody Dragoo, 50 served the fire department for about 15 years after moving to West from Montana; he was the only employee who died; he had returned to the site as a volunteer firefighter.', 'The National Fallen Firefighters Foundation is accepting donations to help the survivors of the personnel who died in the line of duty in the West TX explosion.', 'Okinawans will \xe2\x80\x98Spew Magma\xe2\x80\x99 Over Crimes of U.S. Forces (Okinawa Times, Japan)', 'Thank you, too, Kathy, especially for the names of those killed in the explosion.', ' Sponsored by Pass4Sure Leading the way in studying IT certifications.
