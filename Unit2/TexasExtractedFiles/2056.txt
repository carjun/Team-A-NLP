I was verbally bullied on and off throughout middle and high school, but it stopped altogether when I graduated and started college. I've found the experience is the same for other people who've been bullied. I know it's incredibly cliche, but it's true that it will get better. You said you're now a senior  dude, you're almost done. Don't let these asshats get the best of you by quitting when you're that close.", "In the meantime, consider wearing a hidden camera so you have undeniable proof of what's happening. Take that footage to the police, superintendent and school board. Do you trust any of the adults at your school? A counselor, a librarian, an aide, even a lunch lady or a janitor? The more adults you can get on your side, the better. If you are having a hard time getting school administrators and police to believe you, they may take you more seriously if another adult gets involved.", 'No matter what happens, please keep your parents  or another trusted family member(s)  in the loop.', "permalinksavecontextfull comments (16)Went to WalMart.

I was walking around the store and the prices on things like milk, eggs, and frozen goods didn't seem all that different than, say, target or publix.
