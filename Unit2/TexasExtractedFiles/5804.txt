Most people who were in the scouts 20-30 years ago would not have seen it at that level, but a far larger proportion of the scouting groups are religiously-oriented than they were before.

The consistency of the results provides, despite some discussed shortcomings of this study, evidence that in patients with chronic spinal pain, manipulation, if not contraindicated, results in greater short-term improvement than acupuncture or medication. However, the data do not strongly support the use of only manipulation, only acupuncture, or only nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for the treatment of chronic spinal pain.', 'It certainly does something, they simply say it could be part of, and provide a benefit to, a general therapy regimen.', 'Some say there are possible benefits when used with painkillers, but none state it is a pain reliever by itself.', 'Is directly contradicted by the statement: "manipulation, if not contraindicated, results in greater short-term improvement than acupuncture or medication."', 'That is not a statement that it is only effective "when used with painkillers," that is a statement saying that it is independently more effective than NSAIDs as an isolated therapy, at least for the time period they studied. I can\'t think of any other way of reading "greater short-term improvement."', 'The fact that it would be more efficacious as a combinational therapy does not somehow negate the rest of their conclusion.', 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (1519)More tales from behind enemy lines at a Christian College  by  hammy3000in  TrueAtheism[+]Accidental_Ouroboros 10 points11 points12 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Accidental_Ouroboros 10 points11 points12 points 7 days agoI agree.', 'From an evolutionary standpoint that is tremendous pressure to value the self (obviously), closely related members of the same species (that is, family) and the species as a whole before any other species.

If another person wishes to take the moral high ground and claim all life is equal, that is their wish, though I would question why they would still probably take mebendazole to treat a helminth infection. If they feel there are, in fact, gradations of moral consideration - is an ant worth more than a lion? - then the question I would pose is: If a lion is worth more than an ant, then why not a human more than a lion?', "If all life is equal, I literally can't live without causing an atrocity with every step I take.", 'If only life that can feel pain should have moral consideration: I should note that even plants have a very specific response to injury that in any normal consideration would be considered a pain response.
