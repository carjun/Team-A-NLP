WASHINGTON - Another day, another multibillion-dollar bailout plan for President Obama - this one aimed at up to 9 million distressed homeowners.Obama wheeled out his latest rescue package in foreclosure-battered suburban Phoenix on Wednesday, offering a $75 billion plan to help up to 4 million "at-risk" homeowners and putting another $200 billion behind the government-owned mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.RELATED: ANALYSIS: RESCUE FINALLY COMIN\' HOMEHe\'s also rewriting the rules so another 4 million to 5 million people with federally backed loans can refinance homes that have plummeted in value."All of us are paying a price for this home mortgage crisis," Obama said, noting seized homes hurt nearby property values, cost jobs and spread pain through the finance system.RELATED: HOMEOWNER PLEADS: I NEED YOUR HELP, MR. PRESIDENTMany economists believe the broader economy won\'t recover until housing rebounds."All of us will pay an even steeper price if we allow this crisis to continue to deepen - a crisis which is unraveling homeownership, the middle class and the American Dream itself," Obama said. "This plan will not save every home, but it will give millions of families resigned to financial ruin a chance to rebuild."RELATED: CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HOMES PLUNGES TO RECORD LOWSThe $75 billion will be used to help homeowners flirting with foreclosure reduce their monthly payments by lowering interest rates. The goal is to get mortgage costs down to 31% of a homeowner\'s income.The Treasury Department will go as far as splitting costs with lenders to reduce a loan\'s principal too to reach that figure.RELATED: U.S. FORECLOSURE FILINGS JUMP A RECORD 81% IN 2008To get borrowers and lenders to go along, Obama wants to pay a $1,000 incentive for each modified loan, among other payouts to lenders and servicers.He\'s offering to pay off $5,000 of the principal for homeowners who make all their payments for five years.RELATED: RED FLAG ON RE-DEFAULTSFor people who simply can\'t refinance out of a bad mortgage now, Obama is rewriting Freddie and Fannie\'s rules to make it possible. Administration officials expect that part of the plan will actually raise money.Freddie and Fannie need the extra $200 billion - on top of $200 billion put up by the Bush administration - as a "backup insurance fund" that they should only have to tap in an extreme emergency, officials said.Democrats and good-lending advocates haled the plan, but many Republicans ripped it as another handout to banks who made bad loans and a reward for irresponsible behavior."The biggest outrage is that the President\'s plan actually will use taxpayer money to pay people to do what they are already supposed to do - pay their mortgage," said Sen.
