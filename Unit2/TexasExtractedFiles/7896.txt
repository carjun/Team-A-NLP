This means original paintings, questions about works in progress, questions about paper or brushes, other artists etc. Anything related. Mixed media is welcome, as long as watercolor is also used.', '2) You must differentiate what is not original content. Most submissions are OC, so if it is NOT original content, please put Artist: (the artists name) in the title. It is not okay to ambiguously present other peoples work as your own.

If someone asks if a piece is for sale in the comments, thats fantastic. Just dont post for the sake of advertising that its for sale.', '4) Try to keep blogs, tumblrs, deviantart accounts and personal websites to a minimum, and only post them if you are looking for feedback or critique.
