As one who owns a Hobie Adventure to fish offshore, it's a sweet kayak. Recently I just finished making a rocket launcher (set of 5 different rod holders) on the back out of PVC pipe for cheap. It fits into my back two rod holders on the kayak and really frees up space. If you google them, you can get great ideas. If you're looking for a good starter, paddle kayak look into the Malibu kayaks either the Xfactor or Extreme.
