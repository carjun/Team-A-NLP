As one who owns a Hobie Adventure to fish offshore, it's a sweet kayak. Recently I just finished making a rocket launcher (set of 5 different rod holders) on the back out of PVC pipe for cheap. It fits into my back two rod holders on the kayak and really frees up space. If you google them, you can get great ideas. If you're looking for a good starter, paddle kayak look into the Malibu kayaks either the Xfactor or Extreme. Also, Jackson makes GREAT paddle kayaks but they can be pricey as well.", 'tl;dr Hobie is the best on the market, followed by Jackson.

Every trout down there has been 18"+ they\'re massive right now. The reds didn\'t bite this time though so we caught our limits of trout each day and then chased the schools of black drum that usually appear.

Went down to Freeport, Tx this morning trolling lures about 2.5 miles out. He actually had just bought a new Hobie so he wanted to test it out today, so it was a perfect time to test it. The fish its self we measured right at 50in, but didn't get a weight sadly. The three of us guesstimated it to be around 40-50lbs, it was definitely the biggest we've caught. I'm pretty sure he was using a rattle trap and sadly it was the only fish we caught today, we're going to try to head to Corpus Christi sometime this week to see if we can get into some snapper and ling.", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (4794)What the actual fuck is going on...  by  gravypoptartsin  periwinkle[+]TrentTrentTrent 11 points12 points13 points 6 months ago (0 children)[]TrentTrentTrent 11 points12 points13 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onAll I want is for my hat to show up and it won't work..
