She was from a different group from me and we did some occasional flirting but chances for actual interaction were rare. While we were standing around waiting for the busses to arrive one day, I noticed that she was wearing jeans shorts cut very short on top of her very long legs. For some reason, I thought it would be hilarious to light the fringe of her jeans shorts on fire with my lighter (keep in mind...I was guided only by hormones). I thought it would be like a sockfire or something. Like "woosh!" and then out. So when her back was turned I lit the lighter right under her butt, and of course immediately the frayed cotton of the shorts went right up and showed no indication of going right out. Immediately I recognized that I had made a major error and I commenced slapping at her upper thigh/ass area in an attempt to get it out. It did go out, but of course I had run up behind her and apparently begun roughly grabbing at her ass, from her perspective. Attempting to smooth it over with "I was trying to put out the fire that I had set upon you" didn\'t go over any better, and needless to say I could have gone to jail. She just decided to avoid me (and rightly so) from then on out.', "permalinksavecontextfull comments (69)Now Playing App has been removed from the Play Store after takedown requests from Sony.  by  vinodisin  Android[+]Correctness 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Correctness 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoSorry that this isn't that relevant but is it a common bug for Shuttle to crash when the equalizer is selected?
