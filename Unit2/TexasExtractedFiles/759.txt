All known catastrophes with the stuff involved extremely large amounts and a lot of bad luck/stupidity.', "What Timothy McVeigh used to blow up that building was a mixture of three mol Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) with two mol Nitromethane (CH3NO2) called ANNM. The NM reacts strongly exothermal with the oxygen provided by the burning AN, 4CH3NO2 + 3O2 \xe2\x86\x92 4CO2 + 6H2O + 2N2.

The shockwave itself isn't nearly as damaging as most high explosives (but there is one! ) but the extreme pressure caused by the gases can cause extreme damage in confined spaces.

My main research is in nitrogen biogeochemistry.", 'My (very probable) guess for the reason these explosions occurred with fertilizers is due to the presence of ammonium nitrate.  Ammonium ions (which may be converted to nitrate through nitrification) and nitrate ions are both extremely useful for plants (e.g. formation of proteins), so ammonium nitrate is abundant in fertilizers.  Industrial fertilizer production, thanks to the Haber-Bosch process, is now a major way atmospheric nitrogen is fixed for agricultural use.  The ammonia from industrial fixation can then be reacted with nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate.', 'Normally, these would decompose slowly, releasing nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a potent greenhouse gas, but not an immediate threat.  However, under quick change, like through detonation, the reaction favors a higher production of oxygen, which forms extremely rapidly.
