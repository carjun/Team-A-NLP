He was absolutely brilliant for 58 minutes of the game and was on the cusp of one of the best games in NFL history, and that one pick is going to change the entire outlook on the game.", "But, I think at this point, that's just the player he is. He'll be great for 90% of the game, but if the game is close near the end, he'll find some way to be the laughing stock all over again.
