How conservative are people in Waco and at BU? And are people in Waco from upper, middle or lower class mainly?', "permalinksaveparent[+]Bandefaca 5 points6 points7 points 5 months ago \xc2\xa0(5 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]Bandefaca 5 points6 points7 points 5 months agoBaylor's pretty conservative, generally speaking, lots of upper/middle class white kids.", 'Waco is very different, however. There\'s a lot of poorer minorities within Waco. In fact, on campus we call campus the "Baylor bubble"; they have a perimeter of lights all around the campus, as well as a pretty active police force. There\'s more upper-class areas south and west of Waco, in the same manner as suburbs, but the area isn\'t big enough to call them suburbs, and they aren\'t as sprawling as suburbs. ', 'permalinksaveparent[+]Hfino 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago \xc2\xa0(4 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]Hfino 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoThank you very much for the answer. I am always really curious about these towns in the US and their lifestyle, and the contrasts they have. I saw on google street view and it didn\'t seem really rich so it does make sense for Baylor to be called the "Baylor bubble", although there are some areas that look richer than others, if you follow hillcrest drive in the direction of Waco Lake there is a really big house there. Is it well known that house? lol, sorry for the random question. Do you like studying in BU?', "permalinksaveparent[+]Bandefaca 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago \xc2\xa0(0 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]Bandefaca 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoYeah, definitely, it's my pleasure. I don't know the house you're talking about in particular; I've only been studying here for 2 semesters, but I know that Waco's had a long history of booms and busts. I want to say the space industry was big here several decades ago, but I might be wrong. There are definitely images of that in some of the buildings downtown though, it's really neat.", "As for Baylor, I really enjoy it here. It's a private Christian university,  but they don't shove it down peoples' throats. While there are a couple of required classes on the Bible and the history of Christianity, they're from an academic perspective, and dissent isn't quickly hidden away. As a Biology major, I'm especially glad they don't waste any time even mentioning creationism; the science classes here are about science. I'd have to say a great draw has been the people here. It's not so big that you become a number and it's not so small that everyone seems to be the same. While upper/middle class white kids are the majority, there's still a decent amount of diversity. Overall, I'm very glad I ended up picking Baylor to study at.", 'permalinksaveparent[+]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago \xc2\xa0(2 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAlmost chose BU, visited it for two or three days a few years back, but chose another uni in TX.

I was offered a really nice scholarship, but got a better offer. Otherwise BU wouldn't have been on the radar. BU has a mix of hard-working students who got the grades to be there, financially, and those of more affluent backgrounds. I liked that though, overall, while visiting I got the impression most students liked their school and worked hard, and still had fun, seemed to be a great culture not weighed down by affluence.", "permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelpwikiFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. \xc2\xa9 2013 reddit inc.
