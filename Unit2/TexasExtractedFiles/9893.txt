It was a full out fight between both parties and special interest groups. The bill was first introduced as a single payer option but was changed to the mandate for the GOP to be ok with voting for it. The bill was passed 3 years ago. If people can\'t be bothered to look up the bill in 3 years then they aren\'t going to do it with another.

Because of that they THEY are the ones that are going to have to "negotiate" by letting go of this nonsense. They need to get off of it and campaign for increased republican seats if they want to get rid of the ACA. Shutting down the government because a small minority of about 30 people can\'t get their way is total nonsense. If you have close to 500 people in a group trying to decide on something and about 30 people are demanding that they get their way or no one gets anything would you consider them reasonable?

The Supreme Court upheld the law citing that the wording had to be changed to a tax. You can\'t say that a Supreme Court ruling which dictates the constitutionality of laws was some how found unconstitutional. You can\'t change definitions of how the Supreme court works because you want to excuse childish behavior.', "Congress does hold the power of the purse, but to shut down the entire government because you want to RENEGOTIATE A LAW THAT THEY'E ALREADY NEGOTIATED!!! is inexcusable.

The Republicans are shutting down the government because they demand a "compromise" on a law that THEY already compromised on when it passed through the house and the senate. If you want to compromise on a law you do it when it is in committee or in either chamber of the house. Hence the reason why we don\'t have a single payer option, because Republicans didn\'t like it.
