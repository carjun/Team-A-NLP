Your ear drum is connected to a chain of three bones in you middle ear.  When your ear drum moves, it moves the bones as well, which act on the cochlea, which is the organ that translates pressure waves into electrical signals to be sent to your brain.', "Some of the bones have muscles attached to them, and when the muscles are engaged it prevents the bones from moving freely.  When this happens, less energy is transferred from the motion of the ear drum to the cochlea, which protects the delicate hair cells in the cochlea.  These muscles are engaged when we hear a very loud sound, especially if it's a loud sound over a period of time.  This is why if you've ever been to a loud concert, after you return home it's hard to hear for a while.  Those muscles are engaged to protect your hearing.", 'However, your brain needs time to react to the level of sound around you and determine if it should engage the muscles or not.  When a very loud, very short sound occurs like what happened in the explosion, your brain does not have enough time to engage the muscles.
