"I can\xe2\x80\x99t fathom what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be like without him.\xe2\x80\x9d She\xe2\x80\x99s close with Holly, who is the secretary of the intermediate school destroyed in the blast. \xe2\x80\x9cMy heart and prayers go with Holly and the boys. We\xe2\x80\x99re all in a state of shock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jernigan. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just immediate family and close friends reeling from the plant explosion. Most everyone knows someone who is, or has been a West volunteer firefighter. Jered Rochester leaned on the bed of his pickup parked on the street. His Dad, a postman, was a volunteer for more than eight years. He says sometimes Dad would have to leave the dinner table in real hurry. \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be willing to put down what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing and drop your life and go do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Rochester said. He says his Dad never talked much about the close calls and dangers.\xc2\xa0 Rochester says today he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about his friends who dropped everything and raced to the fertilizer plant Wednesday night. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting tears back since yesterday. And every time I hear about a confirmed death, it just tears me up,\xe2\x80\x9d Rochester said.\xc2\xa0 Mike Mellgren says it was always the same 12 to 16 guys answering the call. He says he went to school with half a dozen of them.

That\xe2\x80\x99s why they took the job," Mellgren said, his voice tinged with a kind of reverence. "That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of people they were and are. They\xe2\x80\x99re there for you. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what our town is. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s here for each other. They\xe2\x80\x99re the epitome of our town." ']
