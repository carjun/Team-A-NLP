But frankly... this isn't local news. When americans enunciate spanish words just because they look 'spanish'; it sounds terrible. In the real world, spanglish works really well because typically both parties are comaparably educated and they don't teach you the really hard words in 6th grade. Luckily, you can reasonably infer that the person you're talking to knows where you're going with it all, and if that doesn't work... we can switch to alcohol. Historically this works really well. Mexicans even have this really badass shit made of distilled agave, but we don't have a word for it in english...
