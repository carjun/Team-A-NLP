I am a US citizen (by birth) and While living and working in Switzerland, everytime I would come home for a visit and fly through Newark, the customs agent would look at my passport, ask me to follow him, take all of my belongs and put them in a clear plastic bag.  He/She would then walk me to an elevator, ask me to step inside and when the door would close, it would just sit there for several minutes before it started moving.  The opposite doors would then open and two armed gaurds would be waiting there for me.  They would lead you to an open room with many chairs where two guys behind desks would have a que of clear plastic bags and people waiting to collect them when allowed.  The desk dudes would open each clear plastic bag, pull out the passports and call each individual to the front and ask them questions.  This happened to me so many times and I always got the same desk dude each time.  Eventually he would open my passport, call my name, ask why I was there again, I would shrug my shoulders and he would give me the clear bag with my belongings and I would be on my way.  To this day, I do not know why I was flagged.  I am not anymore.................. Point is, this title is mis-leading and people should be careful to assume such things without being told what the real issue is.

She went on to talk about a friend of hers that had just openly come out that she had known for 45 years and had no idea she was a lesbian.  Until that point, I had never once questioned my sexuality.  I played Semi-professional Soccer for crying-out loud.  If I were a lesbian, I would be a lesbian, I had many opportunities and knew/know some very wonderful-beautiful women that are lesbians.   At the time, it added so much weight to my situation, losing a mother, still trying to get through University, etc.', 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (16833)Who is the one celebrity you could trust to be president?  by  imcuriousaboutin  AskReddit[+]bigbertha707 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]bigbertha707 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agoYOu know, i would totally vote for Robert....He is actually quite intelligent and so dapper in any look.', 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (5860)Who is the one celebrity you could trust to be president?  by  imcuriousaboutin  AskReddit[+]bigbertha707 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]bigbertha707 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agoLMAO!', 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (5860)Who is the one celebrity you could trust to be president?  by  imcuriousaboutin  AskReddit[+]bigbertha707 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]bigbertha707 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agoBrad Pitt for sure.

It wasn\'t so much that the pageant itself harmed the child, it is what the parents were doing to get their children "ready" for the pageant.  Playing mind games, Yelling at them for crying, changing the construction of their teeth and squeezing them into corsets, etc.  I mean, this was just weird.  Why can\'t they just be kids?  The opposite was true of Honey Boo Boo, instead she had an overly inflated perception of herself, and it was clear her mother was trying to live vicariously through her.  That is another type of mind game and i question if having a childhood pageant allows an "easier" outlet for a parent to do that (because if a parent is like that, they will find a way to do it pageant or no pageant).  Anyway, that was my opinion, but does not have to be everybodies.
