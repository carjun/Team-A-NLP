["Three members of the Texas congressional delegation, including Sen. John Cornyn, got a firsthand view of the aftermath of this week's massive fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas.", 'WEST, Texas \xe2\x80\x94 About 60 people remained unaccounted for after the explosion at a fertilizer plant here, but authorities remain hopeful that number reflects not a significant loss of life but the difficulty of tracking down people who have been hospitalized or who may have taken shelter with others.', 'Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) revealed the number of missing Friday after visiting the area devastated by the explosion. Cornyn was joined by two congressmen, and the three lawmakers described the damage inflicted by the blast at West Fertilizer Co. on Wednesday night. Twelve firefighters and other first responders are believed to be among the dead. At least 160 people are believed to have been injured.', 'Cornyn said he saw a firetruck crumpled by the blast and a crater where there had once been a cement foundation. Near the plant, he said, there were \xe2\x80\x9cstill smoldering materials there on-site.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'As the lawmakers visited with residents, they noted warmth and a positive spirit, as well as the generosity of others as donations \xe2\x80\x94 food, clothing, shoes, blood drives \xe2\x80\x94 have poured into the community.', "Cornyn, speaking at a news conference, recounted something he said a West native told him earlier in the day: \xe2\x80\x9cSaying you're a Texan doesn't just describe where you're from. It describes who your family is.\xe2\x80\x9d", 'Such sentiments, Cornyn added, \xe2\x80\x9cspeaks to me volumes about how this community came together in the light of this tragedy. One of the things you find in a terrible time like this is that people step forward, they offer their hand to help, and it provides a lot of comfort and reassurance during a difficult time.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), who represents the area, echoed that sentiment. He said he was inspired by the attitudes of those he met and felt a swell of pride for his state. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk to the people around here and you ... see the can-do spirit, which is all about Texas,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said.', 'The state\xe2\x80\x99s other Republican senator, Ted Cruz, continued that theme and alluded to the bombings Monday at the Boston Marathon.', "\xe2\x80\x9cYou are being lifted up in the prayers of millions of Texans, millions of Americans and people around the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said of the people in West. \xe2\x80\x9cThe same is true for the city of Boston, Mass. When we face great adversity, we come together and stand together, and we're doing that today.\xe2\x80\x9d", "                Terrible situation,\xc2\xa0 if they are missing after 2 days it doesn't sound very good.There is a reason for zoning and for inspections of places that have 57,000 tons of explosive fertilizer.", '                As the great and very red state of Texas has reformed its workers compensation system so as to permit employers like West Fertilizer to "opt out" of its workers compensation system and, at the same time "reformed" its tort system so as to make it virtually impossible for working class people to get to court against big business it\'s going to be real interesting to see who foots these bills.At the same time, watching antigovernment Rick Perry beg for federal disaster assistance is indeed something to behold and would be hilarious if it weren\'t so tragic.This is what it really means to "starve the beast/shrink government"', "                So many entrepreneurs are moving to Texas for freedom because its government doesn't hassle businesses with needless regulations. The nit picky libs in CA would never let you store dangerous chemicals unsafely and blow up a whole town. Hooray for Texas!", "Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
