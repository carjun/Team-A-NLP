We\'ve added a filter by "industrial" quality - for all of those rapid prototyping businesses with commercial grade printers. It sets them apart from "high" quality ones like the Makerbot Replicator 2. We\'ve also added a \'Turnaround Time\' section, so you have an idea of how quickly your print can be finished.', "We were able to calculate exact prices right on the list of queried search results. So let's let's say 10 results for Raleigh populate, on Makexyz you would have to upload your STL to each Printer in order to find out the price. Now, regardless of what the Printer sets as his default print price, you can see all 10 printers prices calculated on the same page.", 'And also, with a name like 3D Pinpoint, we are able to expand into a whole spectrum of new ideas/services.

But, desktop 3D printers will also evolve. It'll go from filaments, to powder, to materials, and everything will slowly drop price over time. Which will continue to intrigue customers. I consider 3D modeler's artists in their own way, much like painters or photographers. They are expressing their ideas, and then are able to make physical, tangible objects to express their talents and interests. If you get the chance, check out Whiteclouds. They're 3D printing objects are incredible. https://www.facebook.com/whiteclouds?hc_location=stream This is one company with only a handful of members. And if they can spread their talent with others in their community, I think that's awesome. Which is part of the reason I am starting this now, because I can see the growth curve and interest of 3D printing and similar business models that were successful(you had mentioned Airbnb - but also Craigslist works very similarly)", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (15)3D printing in Boise!  by  [deleted]in  Boise[+]djbr22 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]djbr22 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agookay.
