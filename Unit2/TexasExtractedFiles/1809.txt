Toddlers have the ability to communicate, they just cant do it vocally. My oldest was signing before she was a year and a half, and my middle girl was signing a little after a year. She's 22 months now and talks up a storm.", 'Also how much of a personality they can have at a young age. My middle girl is a ham. She gives the biggest, cheesiest, exaggerated smiles and has been since about 9 months. My little man (7 months) will sit in his play area and just laugh and laugh. He does these super drawn out laughs, like "HAHAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa!" He even gets his little hands clenched and shakes his fists. Then he\'ll inhale, get a big smile, and do it again. My 4 year old is very observant and has almost no fear of bugs or animals of any kind. She\'ll find a bug outside and stare at it for what seems like forever. Our old house had a ton of box elder bugs, and she would play with them for hours. She\'s on track for a career as an entomologist, or at least a biologist. We have a hard time with other parents telling their kids not to explore their world. It pisses me off when they tell their kids "Don\'t touch that, it\'ll bite!" and its a moth or something else harmless. Thats great. Teach your kids that all bugs are dangerous or gross and they\'ll freak out when a moth fly\'s into the house.', 'Actually that reminds me, I found a mantis egg cluster a few days ago.

Under what circumstances? Was there ever any closure?  by  drysmianin  AskReddit[+]kenny_boy019 5 points6 points7 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]kenny_boy019 5 points6 points7 points 1 month agoThere isn't much to the first part of my story. My mothers ex-husband, who was a fairly successful programmer, disappeared on his way home from visiting his girlfriend Martha, in Texas. He was driving home to Bakersfield by himself, and just POOF. Gone. My mom and him had been divorced for a couple of years at this point but they had a son together with joint custody who he saw on a regular basis. When we realized he was actually missing and not just taking his time we filed a missing persons report. The only evidence we had for a long while was a video from a gas station in New Mexico showing him with 4 other guys in his car. A couple of months go by and we get a call that his car was found in Bakersfield, and witnesses remember seeing 4 younger guys getting out and ditching it. No activity on his accounts, cell phone hadn't been used, just dropped of the face of the earth.", 'Another a year goes by, and out of the blue the girlfriend calls us flipping out. He showed up on her doorstep, but he has no idea who he is or who she is. The first thing he remembers was waking up on the side of the road beat to hell. Most people would try to get to a hospital but he just started walking. He was homeless that whole time traveling all over the place. One day he was sitting in a homeless shelter in Idaho watching a news report on Martha Stewarts legal troubles when he suddenly remembered someone named Martha who lived in Texas. He had no idea who she was but it was the first thing he had remembered from before so he took off to find her. My mother decided to fly out there to see him, and sure enough he had no idea who she was. Not only that, but his personality had totally changed. Before, he was an asshole who would scream at a waitress till she cried because he thought she left our food under a heat lamp for too long. The man she met was soft spoken and rather pleasant, two things he was decidedly not before. But with no memory of her, his son, or any of his other kids. After a while he came back out to California, and my mother convinced him to go see a doctor. It took him almost a year from when he was found to see someone. They ran a whole battery of tests and discovered that his frontal lobe was pretty much toast from an old injury, and when he was jumped it was aggravated which explained the memory loss and personality change. When he was a kid he hit his head and was in a coma for three weeks which caused the initial brain damage. Turns out he was an asshole because the empathy section of his brain was dead.', 'To this day he remembers very little of his life before, but now and then little bits float to the surface.', 'Ex-step dad jerk goes missing for over a year.
