But one of the key ingredients could have been chemical called anhydrous ammonia. But here in the Flathead, both firefighters and fertilizer retailers say it is anhydrous ammonia's other side effects that have them more concerned.", "At Cenex Harvest States in Kalispell, many types of fertilizer's are sold, but not anhydrous ammonia. We spoke with General Manager, Mark Lalum", '"You know the products that they are talking about as it relates within this are ammonium nitrate and anhydrous, yeah, we\'ve moved away from it. Anhydrous as it does, fire and that, there\'s just a lot of safety issues, associated with anhydrous," Lalum tells us. Fire issues aside, anhydrous is very dangerous to handle. It literally sucks the water out of anything organic it touches, like your skin, your eyes, etc.', "We spoke with Kalispell assistant Fire Chief John Campbell Friday who told us one of firefighter's biggest concerns is anhydrous being inhaled by people. He tells us most people who inhale the chemical will most likely die.", 'So far the death toll on this explosion is officially at 12, but could be more by the time it is done.', 'Both Lalum and Campbell told us, that very few Montana Farmers use Anhydrous Ammonia anymore.', 'St. Jude Dream Home ticket count update & St. Jude teacher connects healing with learning', 'Participants learn about history and rifle marksmanship in Project Appleseed event']
