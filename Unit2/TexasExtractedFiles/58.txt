W.D. Cleveland bought the East New York building in 1976 and moved his Peoples First Baptist Church into the space.', 'But Cleveland fell ill in the 1980s, long before his death in 2006 at age 67, leaving many of his dreams for the premises unrealized.', 'Now his widow, the Rev. R. Simone Lord, is mounting a $20 million dollar fund-raising drive to restore 484 Liberty to its former glory while also bringing much needed facilities  including housing for war veterans and domestic violence victims  to the neighborhood.', 'My husband was ill, so he was never able to do much with the property, Lord said. But he always had great dreams, especially for using the building to benefit the youths and veterans in the community. He was a Navy veteran, and he wanted to make a better life for people in the area.', 'The building occupies almost every square foot of that block, Lord said. There are three floors, plus a basement, which used to be a jail. The horse stable to the side has three floors.', 'Though Cleveland was never able to restore the building to what he wanted it to be, it was never in this shape, said church board member Burchell Marcus. It was livable, but after pastor started to deteriorate, the funds were just not there.', 'We held services in the building until his death, Lord said. We did what we needed to do to keep the church up.', 'Clevelands death brought another surprise - someone had illegally assumed title to the complex.', 'The largest hurdle the church faced as far as legal issues was it became aware in 2006 that the deed to that property had been illegally transferred to another party, said Paul Acinapura, general counsel in Brooklyn Legal Services East Brooklyn office. The church discovered one day that the official legal records of the city of New York showed that title of the property was no longer in the churchs name but in a persons name. That person had illegally transferred title to the property.', 'Brooklyn Legal Services and attorney David Schwartz of the Manhattan law firm Quinn, Emanuel & Urquhart sued on the churchs behalf, and after several years had the title legally returned to the church.', 'Lord, owner of Zen Media publishing, wrote a self-published book, The Last Castle in Brooklyn about the ownership flap.', 'Now she and the 25 member church have launched a fund raising drive to convert the premises into a castle home for veterans and their families.', 'In addition to the sanctuary, the building would house teenagers aging out of foster care and female victims of domestic violence, Lord said.', 'We want to get to the job at hand, she said. We want to transform lives with real solutions for people. Those teens aging out of foster care really need a place to stay so that they can start to build successful lives. Without a place to stay they go into crime and jail.', 'Lord, Marcus and fellow church board member Martin Marcelle said the building needs a gut renovation, at a cost of about $20 million. Everything has to be replaced, Marcus said.', 'The church also plans to make the building green, or energy efficient, following plans New York University Prof. Jason Safford had designed as a class project.', 'The church is having a family golf outing on June 16 from 4 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Alley Pond Golf Center in Queens.', 'For more information or to make a donation, see the website, www.ladysimone.com', 'Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in  .
