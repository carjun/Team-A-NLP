Cleveland bought the East New York building in 1976 and moved his People\xe2\x80\x99s First Baptist Church into the space.', '\tBut Cleveland fell ill in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, long before his death in 2006 at age 67, leaving many of his dreams for the premises unrealized.', '\tNow his widow, the Rev.
