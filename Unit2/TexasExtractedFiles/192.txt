All of that is likely to be forgotten when he steps onto the Quickens Loans Arena court on Thursday night."The people out in Cleveland ... they will be in a fury," said Walt Frazier, the former Knicks great.This was about an hour after the Knicks had easily dispatched the Nets in the Garden on Tuesday night and Frazier was standing outside on 33rd street, waiting for a ride. He raved about Amar\'e Stoudemire\'s 35-point night, crediting the best Knick since Patrick Ewing with "letting the action come to him."But then Frazier turned his thoughts to the one game that has been circled on all calendars since the schedule was released.Miami at Cleveland, Dec. 2."I would expect that LeBron will be booed every time he touches the ball," Frazier said. "I wouldn\'t expect anything less."The fans get to let him have it good because that\'s their right, but let\'s remember, Cleveland fans once saw Art Modell take their beloved Browns out of town, all the way to Baltimore. That was the ultimate slap in the face.What James did to his hometown team last July, leaving for Miami and doing it in such a classless manner, can\'t compare to what Modell did.But does it rank second? Probably. James was free to go, free to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami on a super team that hasn\'t exactly worked out yet. This early, LeBron seems to have some big issues with his coach, Erik Spoelstra, and why Pat Riley hasn\'t come out and backed his coach publicly, telling his superstars to grow up and get with the program, is a mystery.But long before James\' inner circle started a leak campaign to discredit Spoelstra, he totally botched his move to South Beach. Before "The Decision," he should have told Dan Gilbert, the Cavs owner who did everything to cater to his superstar, his family and his entourage, that he was going to Miami. He owed Gilbert that courtesy. And the whole decision to turn "The Decision" into prime-time TV event, well, if anyone didn\'t pan it by now, it\'s because he\'s a member of LeBron\'s crack advisory team.But here we are almost five months after James went on TV and he gets to go back home for the first time as a visiting player.You know who wants to be in his shoes Thursday night?No one.
