We were doing a fireplace. It was a special relationship. Wherever my dad was, I was right behind him.\xe2\x80\x9d', '\tGirardi has often cited his father as being instrumental in his career, instilling a love of baseball in him at a young age.

Giving his father his 1996 Yankees World Series ring was another.', '\t\xe2\x80\x9cHuge Cubs fan, loved the other sports, loved basketball, played a year at Bradley,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe played in the backyard.
