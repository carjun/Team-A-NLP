Just try again over a week span or so. It is like a rush on the bank so to speak with people trying to get covered. If you still can't figure it out here is the free help line and here is a link that will point you in the direction of a navigator.

There is a lot of help for you, it will just take some time because all of humanity is trying to contact them right now ..... in all reality about 25% of the Texas population is, so it is going to take a hot minute to get through.", 'permalinksaveparent[+]erveek 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]erveek 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago', 'Keep in mind Texas just said that the navigators have to have 40 more hours of training than they were originally supposed to have so some might not be up and running for another week.', "permalinksaveparent[+]sangjmoon 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (3 children)[]sangjmoon 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI found out the plans are great if you are self employed and make over $150,000.
