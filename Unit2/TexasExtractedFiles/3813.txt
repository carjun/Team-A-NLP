Rick Perry on Thursday called for the prayers of all Americans as he described \xe2\x80\x9ca nightmare scenario\xe2\x80\x9d in this small town where a fertilizer plant explosion injured about 160 and killed an unknown number in a blast so powerful houses were knocked from foundations.', 'Earlier Thursday, officials estimated that between five and 15 people had been killed, including first responders. But Perry said he "was not comfortable" releasing the number of dead as search and rescue operations were underway. At least 75 houses, a nursing home and a middle school were damaged or destroyed.', 'The force propelled residents through windows, shattered glass and collapsed roofs within a half-mile radius.', 'In the moments after the Wednesday night explosion at West Fertilizer Co., 911 dispatchers pleaded for help for downed firefighters, summoning assistance from nearby agencies and directing fire trucks and other responders.', '\xe2\x80\x9cY\xe2\x80\x99all have anybody available; I am requesting you.

State and local emergency workers, including the Texas National Guard, converged on the town of 2,800. Perry noted that many West residents had aided neighbors who were displaced or injured in the explosion. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a small town like West, they know that this tragedy has most likely hit every family,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry said at an Austin news conference. \xe2\x80\x9cIt touches practically everyone in that town. So I ask all Texans and Americans to join me and Anita in keeping them in our prayers.\xe2\x80\x9dThe explosion roughly 20 miles north of Waco erupted as firefighters battled a blaze at the plant. The eruption registered as a 2.1 magnitude earthquake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and sent up a massive plume of smoke that could be seen up to 45 miles away.\xc2\xa0 Texas emergency officials are still unsure what caused the blast, and a special response team of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been sent to the site.', 'McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said more than 200 law enforcement officers from throughout Texas were attempting to recover bodies from the debris and rescue possible survivors. McNamara, who has been sheriff for only four months, said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a full count of the dead and missing until later Thursday.', '\xe2\x80\x9cThis is heartbreaking.

Restaurants served meals free of charge, while residents open their doors to those who were displaced. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a tiny town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mimi Montgomery Irwin, a local business owner. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is stretching themselves to the max.\xe2\x80\x9dIrwin\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant, Village Bakery -- a 61-year-old Czech institution in the city\xe2\x80\x99s downtown -- sits half a mile from the blast\xe2\x80\x99s epicenter. From her window, she\xe2\x80\x99s seen a steady procession of trucks carrying plywood, glass and plumbing equipment to help repair damaged structures. Irwin\xe2\x80\x99s overnight employees were baking kolaches, a Czech pastry, when the blast struck. Now they are handing them out for free -- along with everything else they serve-- to rescue crews.Resident Cindy Horn said she felt the windows rattle and the earth shake Wednesday night, and knew people would need a place to stay. Horn drove to Latham Springs Camp and Retreat Center, where she is the director of guest services, and spent the night getting beds and rooms ready. The sprawling, grassy campus of dorms and cabins can house 850 people. More than 12 hours later, Horn said, no one had come looking for a place to stay.\xe2\x80\x9cWe figure many folks are still in the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d Horn said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody else is with friends and family.\xe2\x80\x9d', '                Gov.
