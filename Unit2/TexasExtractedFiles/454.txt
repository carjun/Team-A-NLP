I'm a few years older now, but I was about 30 when I realized I needed to start dating for gasp the first time.  I also spent my 20s with low self esteem, unsure of my physical attractiveness, alone most of the time, but I had a few good friends. ", "The good news: it took a couple years but I found a girl that I love and have a very healthy, normal, succesful relationship on my first try.  We've been going out for well over a year, live together, and still haven't had a fight or ever even been upset with each other. ", 'The bad news:  I had to date over a dozen girls to find any one that I could find that kind of compatibility with.  It was awkward and nerve wracking, and plain sucked.  It took a couple years to weed through the dating nonsense to find someone I really liked.', "So first off.  Valuing your alone time is good. Plenty of partners do.  In my relationship we both value our alone time and it works for us.  Find someone that also wants to maintain their independence.  They're out there and they, like me, will be happy to find someone like you.", 'Secondly.  Don\'t be scared about a lack of relationship experience.  I think that quietly observing and being the sound board for your friend\'s relationships for the last decade puts you in a very wise position. You know how relationships are and how they work.  Perhaps even better than someone that has been stuck in a shitty relationship for too many years.   Sure you may second guess yourself because you have no practical experience, but in my case, it was nothing that I needed to worry about it.  I knew what was right and wrong and what the "proper" dating/relationship order was already just by watching my friends\' failed and successful relationships were over the years.  Sound like you have this experience too.', "Thirdly.  Some guys may be suspicious of your lack of experience.  You however can probably dodge this question until you are getting serious with them.  Tell them it's been a while and leave the answer at that.  Tell them you'd want to take it slow and cautious.  I did.  And although my girl was suspicious why I was still a 30 something virgin when we got to that point, she knew she liked me enough and I was not some weirdo, so she didn't run for the hills.  If that were disclosed on the first date, it would be a different story.", "As many have said, you're going to have to get out there and just start dating.  Try the internet.  It's an easy way to get a ton of dates as a girl and you can go from awkward dating noob to dating pro in a month or two.  Head over to /r/okcupid to learn how to do this correctly.  (Caution, they're a little bitter there, cause internet dating can steal your soul.  And if you're succesful, you don't hang out in that subreddit anymore so it's a bit biased.)  Or just do activities where other single men are.  ", 'Finally, chin up.  I would have loved to meet a girl in your situation a few years ago.

But as far as the NCAA is concerned, they want to be notified of any violations.  So if Gundy knew about violations and didn't report them and instead cleaned house on his own accord, that's a big no-no in the NCAA book as absurd as that may sound.  ", "Now this is beyond the statute of limitations, so you don't have to worry about that.  But it shows Gundy and the program was treading a dangerous line.

ESPN, in order to get just crowd and field noise in the back speakers, has to split the sound broadcast up into channels.   They can\'t put "important" audio on the rear speaker channel because many people like you wouldn\'t hear it.   Your system just needs to pick apart the signal and you need to put your two speakers where the announcer channel is not.
