I\'ve worked at quite a few full service restaurants in north texas, and have seen people queeze out juicy bacon onto sandwiches or burgers of people they assume are Muslim. Ham dipped into sodas or stuff similar. A lot of servers don\'t care at all, and most managers are former servers and don\'t care either. Muslim people aren\'t considered by servers as people who tip we\'ll either, so it\'s like, "Well that\'s what they get for being terrorists and poor tippers." I know a lot of people won\'t want to believe this, but I\'m not surprised by this happening at all.', 'permalinksaveparent[+]Nacho_torpedo 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes ago (0 children)[]Nacho_torpedo 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes agoI have seen a few comments like this and I can only assume these things happen in lower-end establishments. I have worked in restaurants for years and am now part of the management team of one and have never, ever seen a staff member purposely alter a guests food for some sort of retaliation or political rant. Just about the most "evil" thing I have seen done is someone adding the auto-grat to a check...everyone hates auto-grat.', 'Normal human beings who work in the service industry do not behave this way, the world is not a real life version of the movie "Waiting".', 'permalinksaveparent[+]jordannoret 12 points13 points14 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]jordannoret 12 points13 points14 points 1 day agoThis embarrasses me as a Texan, an American, and a human being.', 'permalinksave[+]Vroomfondel36 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]Vroomfondel36 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoBe the change you wish to see in the world.', 'permalinksaveparent[+]DullesGuygot here fast 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]DullesGuygot here fast 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours agoHer first mistake was going to TGIF.', 'permalinksave[+]Bite_My_Butt 4 points5 points6 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]Bite_My_Butt 4 points5 points6 points 17 hours agoIt\'s unfortunate but an alarmingly high percentage of people in this great state are "that way" and no amount of lawsuit or otherwise will fix it...
