Jan Brewer the other day.', 'Key & Peele extract some significant part of their comedy from language, and another winning bit in their early shows has Key in an upscale restaurant, speaking like a polite, mild-mannered, nonthreatening black man.', 'Not all the humor is racial. A parody of Gordon Ramsay is witheringly funny, and a sketch about a clueless stoner trying to qualify for medical marijuana is amusing.', 'Some of it is moderately profane. Some pushes traditional boundaries of taste, though in todays comedy world these guys arent even close to the edge.', "Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in  .
