If Ryan Gosling stripped down and protested in the white house lawn there would be more people drooling over it than tweens a Justin Beiber concert.

When an average person sees this they are going to think "Oh cool, boobs." And then nothing else because their protests so many times aren\'t even protests, but hateful and destructive ragefits.
