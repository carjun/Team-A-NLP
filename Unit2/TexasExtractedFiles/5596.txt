Some of you may have noticed that updates to Reddit News are not as frequent as they once were. It has become increasingly difficult to find time (around a full time job, family and friends) to implement all the features people want to see and have asked for. The purpose of these new permissions is to try and increase ad revenue to a point where i could work on updating Reddit News for a day or two a week.I realize there is (understandable) discontent around these kinds of permissions so i\'m making the old version available ad free and permission free for users who don\'t want to upgrade.

So what exactly is True Card UI? While some other Reddit apps have the Card interface (similar to Google Plus app), only Reddit Illustrated makes sure every card has an accompanying photo. Other apps display Photo Cards only if the post itself points to a photo (from Flickr, Imgur). Reddit Illustrated takes any post, be it a news story from BBC or a status update on Facebook and converts it to a beautiful Photo Card, by identifying the most relevant photo from the post. We call it the True Card UI.Reddit Illustrated comes with a recommended set of topics that include pics, funny, videos, aww, cats, wallpaper, music, movies and more. You can remove any of these topics and add your own.Main Features: Clean user interface based on the latest Holo guidelines from Google Scales beautifully on phones as well as 7 inch tablets like Nexus 7 Add your favorite topics (subreddits) and receive stories based on that Simply long press on any image to download Set the downloaded image as wallpaper from notification bar Share your favorite stories to Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and more Downloads thumbnails (instead of full size images) for preview from imgur.com, flickr.com, minus.com and wikimedia.org Generates thumbnails for Youtube videos and quickmeme.com links Displays the most relevant image for almost any story Hide NSFW photos completely or turn off their previews alone Integrated internal web browser that displays links in a mobile-friendly format Automatic image cache deletion in every 2 days (can be changed in settings)Reddit.com users will notice these features: Vote or comment on stories as well as individual comments  Access to your personalised front page and subscribed subreddits Horizontal swipe gestures to save/hide posts (beta) Edit comments and self posts Sorting option for stories and comments Threaded collapsible comments with color coding to indicate their hierarchyDownload Reddit Illustrated today and indulge in an endless stream of pictures that keep on loading as you scroll.Disclaimer:Reddit Illustrated is an unofficial app that is not affiliated to Reddit.com in any way.
