I shoot for a meat internal temp of about 195F, then I wrap and insulate in a cooler chest for an hour, and the temp peaks around 200-205F.  Perfect.", "If I'm serving barbecued pork in a serve-yourself or buffet type setting, I pull it and serve as-is, and serve sauces on the side.  You can moisten it with some of the pan drippings if you like, but it shouldn't be swimming in the drippings.  Also, pulling pork doesn't mean you need to shred it into threads; people like chunks of meat, not felt.  The only time I'd dress the pork with barbecue sauce would be if I'm serving made sandwiches.", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (8)Simple, delicious 5-minute breakfast: Eggs Panagurishte style  by  martythemaniakin  Cooking[+]Cdresden 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Cdresden 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoPanagyurishte, what a gorgeous town!', "permalinksavecontextfull comments (25)Are the seeds inside dried chilies alive?
