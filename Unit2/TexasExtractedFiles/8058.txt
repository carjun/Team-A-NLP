['A Baptist Minister Speaks Out for Separation of Church and State and Against Private School Vouchers', 'Bill Guts Local Control, Would Give Texas AG Authority to Close Down School Districts by Fiat', 'Earlier this month the House Public Education Committee considered legislation (House Bill 1568) to reduce funding to any school district that makes health insurance or other benefits available to the domestic partners of district employees. The Pflugerville Independent School District just north of Austin has adopted such a policy, although the employee has to cover the full cost of his or her partner\xe2\x80\x99s insurance premiums. Religious-right groups \xe2\x80\x94 predictably \xe2\x80\x94 have pitched a hissy fit and argue that providing access to benefits for domestic partners violates the state\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.', 'The Texas attorney general has not yet issued a formal opinion on whether such policies really do violate that constitutional ban. Even so, the original version of HB 1568 was bad enough \xe2\x80\x94 it would undermine local control, was out of step with growing support among Texans for such common sense policies, and represented yet another effort to denigrate and demean gay and lesbian families. But last week the Public Education Committee passed a completely rewritten version of the bill that\xe2\x80\x99s even worse.

The attorney general \xe2\x80\x94 alone \xe2\x80\x94 would be able to decide whether the state must shut down a school district. The bill offers no route for appeal, although a local school district so targeted by the AG would almost certainly go to court in an attempt to stop such a decision. Just imagine the cost to taxpayers. And what if the courts found that such action by an attorney general was constitutionally permissible? Suddenly, thousands of children would be left without schools because of the arbitrary decision of one state official.', 'And, of course, it would be an arbitrary decision. First, there is hardly agreement that what the Plugerville and Austin school districts have chosen to do violates the Constitution. But consider many other actions \xe2\x80\x94 on issues ranging from free speech to religious freedom and beyond \xe2\x80\x94 that could bring an attorney general to rule a school district in violation of the state Constitution.
