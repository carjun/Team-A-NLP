John Cornyn, who toured the blast site Friday, said it was too early to say whether there would be additional oversight or that it is warranted. But Cornyn said he believed the issue would be looked at as part of the investigation into the explosion. The blast in West was the first deadly explosion at a U.S. fertilizer facility in recent memory.

Terra Industries Inc., the plant's owner and operator, in turn, blamed a defective piece of equipment.In 2001, a blast killed 30 people at a plant in France that stored about 300 tons of ammonium nitrate.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and federal inspectors did not visit the facility again before the blast.\xe2\x80\x9cThe agency calls it a permit, but it is basically a registration,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neil Carman, a former state environmental inspector who now works for the Sierra Club. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no scrutiny at all, and there should be because of the disaster potential.\xe2\x80\x9dWest Fertilizer is required to report its hazardous chemicals to health and emergency officials. Last year, it stored up to 270 tons of ammonium nitrate on the property. That was the first mention of ammonium nitrate at the site in at least six years.The company also reported storing about 100,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a pressurized liquid that becomes a toxic gas when exposed to the atmosphere. The exact amount of fertilizers and other hazardous chemicals at the facility at the time of the blast is not clear.Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used fertilizer, and most experts agree it probably could not have been the cause of the very intense explosions Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9cThe anhydrous ammonia was not likely the source of the explosion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harold Van Es, a fertilizer expert at Cornell University.This liquid ammonia can cause serious breathing hazards, but generally it is a non-flammable compound, scientists say.Such a large explosion was probably due to the presence of a large amount of solid fertilizer, such as ammonium nitrate, Guido Verbeck, a chemist at the University of North Texas.It is in compounds such as these that there is both a fuel, nitrogen, and an oxygen source.Ammonium nitrate is generally safe for use because it requires a very high temperature to detonate, about 3,000 degrees.\xe2\x80\x9cThat's hotter than a house fire,\xe2\x80\x9d Verbeck said.Adding gasoline to ammonium nitrate, however, substantially lowers the detonation temperature such that a spark can set it off.When that happens, the solid fertilizer becomes a gas almost instantaneously.
