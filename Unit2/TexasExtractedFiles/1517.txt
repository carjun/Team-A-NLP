Currently I teach in an alternative model charter school for at-risk kids, and because we require much less class time for our students than a traditional seat-based school, we require more homework to make up for the time not spent in class, to show the state that we're really educating students (because time spent warming a seat in a traditional classroom of course shows how much a student has learned!)", "Anyway, my previous school was a traditional high school in a low-income rural farming community, and I taught honors, college-prep, and remedial English. I was an honors kid in high school, and I hated busywork with a passion, so I always swore I wouldn't assign it to my students. And for honors, I didn't--the  vast majority of students' grades were in-class reading quizzes, tests, essays, and projects. I didn't give study questions or written vocab assignments or make them take notes from the book or any other bullshit time fillers. They were honors students--they were responsible for knowing the content.", "I naively tried this in my college-prep and remedial classes. I had parents go to the principal and complain that their students were failing because I wasn't giving them busywork homework assignments that would allow them to get easy points. What killed me is that I know they all copied that shit from each other. If I assigned reading study questions and then gave an in-class quiz, the majority of the class would turn in the study questions and then bomb the quiz, even if the quiz questions were the exact same ones I gave as study questions. That's how I knew they were cheating.", "I hated wasting time on that, but an English class does by its nature require at least some reading outside of class time, and I just couldn't trust students to do that, or at least do it well enough to pass a reading quiz and just base their grades off of tests, essays, projects, and in-class work.", "It was one of the things that led me to leave the traditional classroom and go into alternative ed, honestly.

Because of my experience with charter schools, WASC sends me to accredit other charters, so I've had a chance to see how a lot of different models have worked (and no two schools that I've been to on an accreditation team have had the same model.) In that time, I've seen only one district that wanted charters because of what they perceived as a financial benefit, and what they specifically wanted was the initial start-up grant the state gives a new charter. In the grand scheme of things, I really don't think it was a whole lot of money, and all of the people on our accreditation committee thought it was a very foolish and short-sighted move on the district's part.", "Additionally, and somewhat ironically, that was the only charter I've ever visited where the working conditions were so bad that the teachers actually were in the process of unionizing. The district kept jerking them around (the year we were there, the school board unilaterally changed the school's schedule to give each teacher one more class and break their prep period up from 1 50-minute block into 2 20-minute blocks.) It was an ugly situation all around, and resulted not from it being a charter, but from a complete breakdown of communication between the district, school administration (which had been replaced several times by the district) and the teachers.", "I know that being a charter school doesn't inherently mean that a school is more innovative than a traditional public school. Charters are not bound by a lot of the state ed code, so that does give them more flexibility to be innovative, but that in and of itself isn't anything especially magic. However, in many districts (especially in low-income areas) starting a new school with an innovative model can be very difficult for a traditional district for many reasons. Funding is an issue, parent support can be problematic, and staff seniority rules may mean that teachers end up at that school that might not be on board with the school's mission/style of innovation. In the area in which my school is, the two districts that feed us the vast majority of our districts (including the one that holds our charter) don't have any other school models that one would consider particularly new or innovative, except in their dependent (district-managed) charters.", "A lot of charter schools are founded by idealists. A lot of charter schools fail and  close because idealists aren't always the best people to run what really is, in many respects, a business. I don't think schools always can or should be run as businesses, but it's undeniable that running a school requires a strong administrative ability. Our superintendent/CEO is the person who founded the organization that runs our school (and six other charter schools) ten years ago, and she has spoken candidly many times about all of the bumps in the road, and how she's had to learn how to delegate because, as the organization grows, she can't control every little thing on her own.", "On the flip side, traditional school districts have a LOT of inertia that can be incredibly difficult to overcome in order to foment change. I saw this with my previous school, which recently celebrated its 100th anniversary. It was the only high school in a small town, and it was very much the town's identity. Quite a few people within the district's administration as well as its teaching staff had been born and raised in that town, attended that school, and now worked there. That's not a bad thing, but it made change very, very difficult to achieve. The union and the district were mired in petty squabbles that had their roots in issues from 30 years ago. It was totally ridiculous, toxic to the school environment and the students, and in my opinion antithetical to what we should have been trying to accomplish as educators. My pentultimate year there, we actually lost our accreditation, and while we got it back my last year there, we were then taken over by the state for fiscal mismanagement. It was a disaster, and I absolutely don't blame parents for wanting another option. Frankly, with the vitriol between the administration, school board, and teachers' union, I wouldn't have wanted to send my kid there. Hell, I got an ulcer my last year there, and that was one of the major factors in why I ultimately left.", "I disagree with you about school choice being a code word for privatization. I am completely against public money being used for vouchers and for-profit charter schools. But I do think that parents and students should have a choice in where they send their kids when at all possible. For my own educational background, I started out at a parochial school from grades K-3. Everything since then was in a traditional public school setting, and I attended a state university. I've raised two foster sons, both of whom went to a traditional public school, and I feel it was the right setting for them. ", "However, as a teacher, I didn't feel that a traditional public school was or is the best setting for me in which to teach, primarily because of the increasing micromanagement when it comes to curriculum and instructional methods. I resent spending more time on meaningless data reports and less time on instruction and lesson-planning. And believe me when I say I LOVE data! it's just that very little data that teachers are required to produce is actually meaningful because very few school and district administrators really understand what meaningful data looks like and how to use it.", "Where I am now, we teachers still have to produce data, and we still have curriculum guidelines established by the school and by our charter organization, but overall, we have a LOT more liberty when it comes to what we teach and how we teach it. We have a fantastic administration who is willing to listen to their teachers and treat them like the professionals we are. Because I love data and I want to make sure it's meaningful and disaggregated and used appropriately, my administrators have allowed me and given me time in my schedule to take a greater role campuswide in that area. It's something I've enjoyed and have been proud of, because we've really been able to use it to not just drive what we teach, but use it for discussions of how best to teach it.", "I don't believe at all that charters harm traditional public education. I'm an absolute believer in a strong public education system, and I'm fundamentally pro-union. I think the traditional public school system is a good choice for at least 90% of students. However, there's a small but significant segment of the student population that isn't well-served by the traditional school system for one reason or another (i.e., the entire student body at my school!) And I feel that that number of students is growing each year, as schools become more and more regulated and regimented and teachers lose more and more control of what they teach and how they teach it, all in the name of raising standards.", "I have many, many friends who are public school teachers at all levels across the nation. I look at how their requirements are changing, and they're given an ever-increasing workload, more requirements, and fewer resources every year in which to do their jobs. I see them burning out and getting frustrated. They don't give up (we're a tenacious bunch) but I hear about the ridiculous requirements their schools are imposing upon them every year, and how change is constantly being pushed from the top down without their input, and I don't know that I'd want to send my kids through a school system that purports to care so much about the final product but yet gives so little consideration to the people directly responsible for producing that product. I don't want my KINDERGARTNER taking a district-mandated benchmark assessment four times a year--I want to be able to trust her teacher to be professional enough to assess my child's needs on an ongoing basis and give her the support she needs, and, above all, recognize that not every child learns at the same rate, AND THAT'S OK.", "I am a better teacher and a happier teacher because I am allowed to be a professional, determine my students' needs on my own, and do what I feel I need to do to remediate those needs and help my students succeed. And frankly, I'm pretty damned good at what I do. I want my children to be able to have teachers that are able to do the same. I see district and site administrations that listen to those above them more than they listen to those below them.

It's a good read. A few key points:", '1) Total general purpose per-pupil funding is somewhat less for charter schools: about 7% less, according to the report.', "2) Until it was eliminated by the state legislature last year, charters weren't eligible for state student transportation funds.", '3) There are several categorical funds which school districts receive at local levels, but which charters receive at a fixed statewide amount. So in districts with higher operating costs, district schools may receive more money than charters in the same area.', "4) The state has 36 mandates imposed on school districts for certain programs, activities, or services. Charter schools must comply with only 17 of these mandates. However, while the state is constitutionally required to pay for these, only school districts can seek reimbursement for them--charter schools aren't eligible for reimbursement.", "Also, I actually had a meeting yesterday morning with our CEO/superintendent and our CBO. It was completely unrelated to anything financial, but I had about a minute afterwards to pick their brains about funding, and here's what I got:", "The primary area in which charters receive less money from the state is in facilities. School districts are required by law to provide facilities for charter schools, but they often give charters facilities that are in major need of repair and that are out of Williams Act compliance. As charters, we aren't required to follow the Williams Act (2000 court case that requires CA public schools to, among other things, provide up-to-date textbooks and safe facilities), so the school districts often basically pawn their out-of-compliance properties off on the charters.", "My school's previous building (we were in there for five years, and moved to our current building almost two years ago) was a property that was owned by the district that holds our charter (we are an independent charter, but our charter still has to be held by someone--either a school district, the county office of ed, or the state.) Our previous building had been an office building instead of a classroom building, and it was 60+ years old and WAY out of compliance. It was two stories, but there was no elevator or ramp to the second floor. There was ONE bathroom for each gender--teachers and students had to share it. The hallways were out of ADA compliance. It was drafty and falling apart and no one wanted it, which is how we ended up there.", 'One of the things I love about the organization that runs our school (non-profit) is that they are EXTREMELY good with fiscal management. Like I said in another comment, CEO/superintendent drives a Honda, and yesterday I noticed that her iPhone is the 3GS. But they kind of have to be, because if we become insolvent (as my previous traditional public school district did), instead of going through FCMAT and being taken over by the state, as my previous district was, we would be shut down completely.', "Anyway, our charter organization saved up and outright bought an old bowling alley. Seems like a weird choice, but it's in a fantastic location in the sense that it's central to our student population but also in neutral gang territory because it's in an office park. They had the bowling alley completely renovated, and it's now our school. It's a great facility, and we're really fortunate to have it.", "Anyway, back to the funding thing... For charters that serve a population of 70%+ free/reduced price lunch students, they are eligible for a 75% reimbursement of their rent/lease costs from the state. Again, that's only if they meet the free/reduced lunch criteria. However, if they choose to own a facility (like our charter organization chose) then they don't get anything. Our charter organization did apply for and receive a Prop 1D grant last year to go toward a different school, but it can only be used for improving existing facilities, not building new ones.", "You're right that we don't have the expense of a union. Our salaries are lower as a result--I took a $20K pay cut coming here from my previous school, and the benefits aren't as great. On the plus side, I don't ever have to buy classroom supplies. As long as we don't go crazy, things like markers, copy paper, and kleenex are ours to order as we need.", "The reason you have to get special permission to change school districts is because TPSs are funded at local levels that are specific to each school district. The district you want to switch to might have a higher local level than the one you're coming from, but they only get the amount for your student that your student's school of residence would have received. So, the school district you want to switch to is taking a financial loss in taking out-of-district students.", 'I was under the impression that the CA state legislature did away with school transportation funding in the 2012 legislative session. I could be wrong. In any case, the whole "failing schools/school choice" thing is a NCLB mandate, not a state mandate. It\'s one of the many "incentives" that NCLB created for school districts to "improve" that I think is total BS.', "I have no idea why charter schools would be exempt from appearing on a failing schools list, and again, I think that's BS. But I also think that parents need to make informed choices and research a school before they send a kid there, whether it's their neighborhood school or another one.", "Charters may indeed fail, or succeed, at the same rate as traditional public schools. But IMO that's not the full picture. It'd be really easy to look at my school and deem it failing just by looking at our test scores. In fact, that happens all the time. The reason we score low compared to the traditional public schools around us is because of our student population. We have a severely at-risk student population. I'm not talking a KIPP school, I'm talking about kids who come to us because they were expelled from other schools. Like I said in another comment, other schools' scores go up because they don't have to educate the kids that were sent to us.", 'Another fallacy in the "charters fail at the same rates as traditional public schools" argument doesn\'t take into account why the parents and students chose to attend a charter instead of their school of residence. It\'s hard to say whether or not those students would have been just as successful (or more or less successful) at their school of residence. Many charter schools have different models than traditional schools, and maybe that works better for those kids who are square pegs, and they\'re able to find more success.', "Finally on this note, I completely agree with you about the myth that public schools are failing, and I've ranted many, many, many times over the past 12 years about this myth. I don't think charters are something magical at all. After teaching for six years in a traditional public high school, I love my job because of the flexibility that I have in doing my job. My school's model is successful because of its ability to be flexible with a population of students that has not been successful in a traditional school setting. And that's the main point of education--to teach students and help them succeed.", "All public schools in CA (including charters!) belong to one of 126 SELPAs, or Special Ed Local Plan Areas. Each SELPA allocates funds for each of its Local Educational Agencies (schools run by charters, districts, or county offices of education) based on local funding plans.) Charter schools can choose if they want to receive services through a local school district or be their own LEA. My school, for example, receives services through the district that holds our charter, but one of the other schools in our charter organization is its own LEA. There are pros and cons to each. The other school in our organization chose to become its own LEA because the district that held its charter (even though we're in the same organization, they have a different district holding their charter) was jerking them around with regards to disbursing special education funds. ", "While my school has had issues in the past with receiving the special education funding it was due, we got those worked out a couple of years ago, and we continue to receive services through our charter district. However, they don't cover the full cost of our special education needs--they pay for our special education coordinator and one paraprofessional, as well as allocating us a school pyschologist and speech therapist on an as-needed basis, and we pay for our special education teachers and another paraprofessional. So we actually lose money on our special ed students, but we continue to take them because for whatever reason their families feel they aren't well-served in the traditional schools. This absolutely isn't a slam on the traditional schools--we have much smaller classes and a more flexible schedule, so I absolutely understand how it would work better for some students/families.", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (434)/u/blissfully_happy explains the broken process of purchasing supplies for schools: submitting a purchase order at her former school district involved 8 steps and cost $130.  by  MackieMousein  bestof[+]wildly_curious_1 5 points6 points7 points 7 days ago \xc2\xa0(0 children)[\xe2\x80\x93]wildly_curious_1 5 points6 points7 points 7 days agoIn his memoir "Surely You\'re Joking, Mr. Feynman!", Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman tells a story of how he\'ll agree to speak at a local community college only under the condition that they not make him sign his name more than 12 times for all of the various pieces of paperwork to get him approved and paid.

I'm not talking about a KIPP, I'm talking about kids who are 16 and show up with 4th grade reading levels and probation officers. Because of the nature of our school, we enroll kids all year. I do a lot of data for annual reports, our charter renewal, and our two school accreditations, so I've had a lot of opportunities to work with our data, including enrollment. After the first month of the school year, the single biggest period of new enrollments is the six weeks preceding state testing every spring. In those six weeks, our enrollment jumps an average of 10%, or roughly 60-70 students. ", 'Of those newly enrolled students, roughly 1/3 are either special education students or language learners that have been dumped by the traditional schools. They show up because an administrator or counselor "strongly recommended" they come here, but the kids and their families often really don\'t understand why, and they show up angry and confused. ', 'This is my sixth year at this school, and the pattern has been exactly the same each of the past five years.

I am, however, a strong proponent of school choice. Not every student is well-served by the traditional public school system. Not every student will learn best in a classroom with 34 of his/her peers for 55 or 75 minutes at a time, 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week. If traditional schools don't want to lose students to charters, they need to start providing some of the choices that charters provide. ", "I taught in the traditional school system for 6 years before switching to a charter because I was frustrated at just how many students I saw falling through the cracks every single year. No matter what I did, I was powerless to help those kids because the system just wasn't designed that way. I took a $20K pay cut to come to my current school, and it was worth every penny. Not only am I helping the kids that no one else wants, but, unlike my highly-regulated previous school, at my current school I'm given the tools I need to do my job (unlimited copy paper! Kleenex!) and I'm given the leeway to teach my students in the way I think they will best learn. As long as I can demonstrate that my methods are successful (and they are, with my students) then my admin backs me up and doesn't get in my way.
