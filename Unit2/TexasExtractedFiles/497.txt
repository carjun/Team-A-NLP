You can look for an English teaching center if you're in a big city to find locals who have some mastery of English, and would be more than happy to spend time with you. Most Kurds, from my experiences, seemed to be very welcoming of foreigners, particularly Americans, and obviously even more so if they understand some English.", "I'd also look into figuring out basic Kurdish before going over; being able to greet people, order tea, ask for a bus driver to stop, etc. can help a ton.

He was sentenced to 1000 years in prison, and will obviously die there, under maximum protection. I can hardly imagine the crushing apathy, knowing that all the remaining years of my life will hold nothing but the bleak concrete walls surrounding me. Being told day-in and day-out when to eat, where to walk, how to act... I think the reality that the rest of his life will be nothing but that is what led to his suicide. His victims, tortured as they were, still had hope. They sought a light at the end of the tunnel, and what do you know, they found it.', "The morbid reality I see here is that, despite his heinous, unforgivable, disgusting crimes, I can still sympathize with his action to commit suicide.

Earmarks are slightly different from pork-barreling in laws.
