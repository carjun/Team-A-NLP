Smith and this backcourt and injuries and all the AARP All-Stars he runs out there. And how he has gotten the very best out of Carmelo Anthony, at least so far.

Or that Woodson will take his place with other Knick coaches who either won the NBA Finals or coached in one. But you better appreciate the job hes done and the job he is doing, whatever happens against the Celtics in the kind of first-round series that the Knicks have not won since 2000.', 'Listen to what Jeff Van Gundy, the last coach to make the Knicks really matter, said to me about Woodson a week or so ago:', 'Theyre not a really talented team. Theyre a moderately talented team that has completely overachieved. Tyson Chandler is a good to very good center obviously. I think Woodsons decision to play Carmelo Anthony at the four was the biggest reason that the Knicks have been able to ascend. Hes gotten J.R. Smith to play at the highest level hes ever played. Hes taken Raymond Felton as a reclamation project from Portland and gotten him to play effectively.', 'I frankly cant believe there hasnt been a larger chorus out of New York for him being Coach of the Year. Now I think you can make a case for a lot of coaches, George Karl, Erik Spoelstra, you can go on and on. But Mike Woodson was the right hire at the right time and people also forget what he took over in Atlanta and how he brought them from like 13 wins into a 50-win team and consistently and somehow thats gotten lost in the narrative as well.', 'We are going to find out, starting right now, which Knicks team is the real one from their compelling three-act regular season: The one that started and finished the way it did, or the one that was 20-21, half an NBA season in the middle. There will be a postseason reckoning on that, and on Carmelo, who tries to make this basketball spring into what October was like for Alex Rodriguez in 2009.', 'None of what is happening now happens without No. 7. But it also doesnt happen if not for the work of two men, one who works in Indianapolis now and one who came out of there to really begin his basketball life:', '1.) Donnie Walsh, who saved the business after the wreckage of the Isiah Thomas years.', 'An awful lot of people have done an awful lot of good things for us this season, that is what Woodson keeps saying, to anybody who will listen to him.', 'Of course it starts with Carmelo, the season of his life, especially the ball hes played after 20-21, when he either got some much-needed rest or got his knee drained or whatever happened at the time.', 'But as the playoffs begin for this season, go back to where another dead-end season seemed to be ending when Woodson got the job from Mike DAntoni. They were 18-24 in a shortened season and it was going to be the ninth season out of the last 11 when the Garden  still being called the mecca of basketball out of habit, because of two championships won 40 years ago  was dark in April and May.
