Better looking than a Porsche Boxter and more athletic than the Mercedes-Benz SLK, this sports car is ready to compete in the convertible market.

Mainly because they have spent decades rolling out one posh sedan after another, with only the rare stab at something offering even the pretense of a car more potent than a "grand tourer," Jaguar developed an image problem for itself among sports car enthusiasts.', "The company's new F-Type Roadster is the latest, and most obvious attempt to remind the buying public of Jaguar's actual history of racing and production of fast automobiles. When you allow a half century to elapse between the 1960's E-Type and the next letter in the alphabet, the newest Jaguar has quite the tall order to accomplish. It is reported that the drop top will soon be assisted in that task with a hard topped version.", "The good news for Jaguar is that the F-Type is off to a promising start. It's definitely a head turner, and depending on your taste in such things, looks better than the Porsche Boxster or Cayman, and more lithe and athletic than the Mercedes-Benz SLK series cars the F-Type is intended to tackle.", 'The F-Type Roadster is more than just a looker. Inside, the car feels as much like a race car as its exterior looks.', "But looks aren't enough in this segment, the performance has to live up to the sheet metal. Jaguar is offering the F-Type with two supercharged engines. The base F-type will be offered with a V6 offering 340 BHP and 322 ft.lbs. of torque. The S model gets a tweak of the V6 to return 380 BHP and 339 ft.lbs of torque. The top of the line will be the V8S shoehorning 495 BHP and 460 ft.lbs of torque into the little cat. All versions are slated to feature an eight speed automatic transmission run through either paddle shifters or the more traditionally styled shift lever. A rumored manual transmission is also to be offered for the driving purists. All of the first F-Types will be rear wheel driven, with limited slip differentials and launch control to keep the car going straight if you mash the accelerator to the floor. The more powerful V8's differential control will be electronic.", 'With any sports car, speed is only part of the equation, handling and braking are equally important to its ultimate composure when driven hard. To those ends, Jaguar is equipping the F-Type with the brakes and computer brains to help you keep the car where you want it to go. In addition to a normal mode that tames the cat, there is a "Dynamic" mode that increases the throttle response, reduces the power assist to the steering, cuts down the nannying of the stability control, and makes more efficient upshifts and throttle blipping downshifts.', "During the golden age of European convertible cars in the postwar period, most of them were British. Hopefully, with the F-Type, Jaguar is joining the silver age of today's Germanic convertibles, and proves itself worthy of its rich heritage.", 'Comments   See All Comments  [Discussion Guidelines ]  To post your comments, please, Sign in  .
