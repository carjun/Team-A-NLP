On April 16, an out-of-control fire at a fertilizer plant in the town of West, Texas, led to a massive explosion that would eventually kill 14 people \xe2\x80\x94 many of them firefighters responding to the blaze \xe2\x80\x94 and injure more than 200 people. And then early on April 20, just as the second suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings was captured half a world away, news broke of a 6.6-magnitude earthquake that hit the western Chinese province of Sichuan. The death toll there has risen to nearly 200 people, with more than 11,000 injured. Though neither disaster earned the attention they deserved, the number of dead and injured in both was actually higher than the toll of the Boston bombings \xe2\x80\x94 though it should be clear by now that we don\xe2\x80\x99t dole out attention based on the death toll alone.', 'It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to see why. Both the Texas fertilizer explosion and the Sichuan quake were accidents, while the Boston bombings were a deliberate attack, done to achieve maximum carnage and attention. But before we shift our focus entirely to the fathomless motivations of the Tsarnaev brothers, we should pause for a moment. The catastrophes in Texas and Sichuan may have been accidents \xe2\x80\x94 but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that human action, or lack of it, could have made both worse than they needed to be.', 'That much is already becoming clear as investigators sift through the wreckage of the West, Texas, fertilizer plant. The Associated Press reported that the West Chemical and Fertilizer Co., as the plant was called at the time, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been inspected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) since 1985 \xe2\x80\x94 when it was issued a $30 fine for a \xe2\x80\x9cserious violation\xe2\x80\x9d for storage of anhydrous ammonia. It\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for businesses to go years between inspections \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s all but inevitable given the OSHA\xe2\x80\x99s scarce resources and the size of its brief \xe2\x80\x94 but clearly something went very wrong at this plant. The Dallas Morning News reported that the West fertilizer company had earlier told the Environmental Protection Agency that there was no fire or explosive risks:', 'The report, reviewed Wednesday night by The Dallas Morning News, stated \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 under fire or explosive risks. The worst possible scenario, the report said, would be a 10-minute release of ammonia gas that would kill or injure no one. The second worst possibility projected was a leak from a broken hose used to transfer the product, again causing no injuries. The plan says the facility did not have any other dangerous chemicals on hand. It says that the plan was on file with the local fire department and that the company had implemented proper safety rules.', 'It\xe2\x80\x99s also notable that the accident occurred in Texas, a state that tends to be less than friendly toward workplace regulations. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet whether better safety regulations might have prevented the fertilizer explosion \xe2\x80\x94 and the deaths of brave medics and firefighters. Hopefully investigators will be able to answer that question soon. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been a way to at least keep the death toll down.', 'The good news in China is that the Sichuan quake wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too powerful, and the death toll wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too high \xe2\x80\x94 at least by China\xe2\x80\x99s standards. This is the same province that suffered through an 8.0-magnitude quake in 2008 that killed more than 80,000 people. To put that in perspective, the deadliest quake in American history was the 1906 San Francisco temblor, which killed some 3,000 people.', 'Of course, China\xe2\x80\x99s far greater and denser population means that it will always be at greater risk from any kind of natural disaster. But the sheer number of dead in the 2008 Sichuan quake wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just due to population density or the strength of the temblor \xe2\x80\x94 it was due to bad government policy that allowed schools and other buildings to be constructed without earthquake defenses, as the Andrew Revkin pointed out on Dot Earth back in 2008:', 'Many of the buildings, upon examination of wreckage, proved to be shoddily built, which some might find unsurprising given the pace of growth and lack of significant government oversight in a country of a billion-plus people.

This time around Beijing has been much quicker to extend visible aid to Sichuan, with the new Premier Li Keqiang making a trip the affected area the day the quake struck.
