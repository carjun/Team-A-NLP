Cruz continues hours-long attack on Obamacare  by  TheFerretmanin  politics[+]Singlemalt_28 [score hidden] 39 minutes ago (0 children)[]Singlemalt_28 [score hidden] 39 minutes agoWhere do you get the affordable part?  Even the Obama administration is releasing data showing that there will be a massive jump in premiums for people who don't qualify for subsidies.  Young people especially will be getting screwed over with this law.  A healthy 27 year old will pay a whole lot more in premiums than they previously had.  The law will increase average individual-market insurance premiums by 99% for men, 62% for women.  This law is a trainwreck and is full of glitches.  One glitch will leave 500,000 children uninsured.  Even internal Senate emails warn lawmakers not to sign up for Obamacare yet as the rules are not even finalized 5 days before the exchanges go into effect.  Even with all this bureaucracy and unprecedented government reach into the healthcare market (which is 17% of the American economy) there will still be 31 million people who will remain uninsured.  We need to start over and pass a real bill which will be successful in fixing the healthcare market in America", 'permalinksavecontextfull comments (13)Ted Cruz seizes Senate floor "speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand.  by  AlphaWookiein  inthenews[+]Singlemalt_28 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes ago (0 children)[]Singlemalt_28 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes agoIf you haven\'t been presented with the information in the 3 years since this bill was passed then your heads up your ass', "permalinksavecontextfull comments (10)Times have changed  by  IpMediain  funny[+]Singlemalt_28 24 points25 points26 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Singlemalt_28 24 points25 points26 points 1 day agoDemocrats aren't capitalists?", "permalinksavecontextfull comments (573)6567Ted Turner: Men Should Be Barred From Political Office For 100 Years (newsbusters.org)submitted 1 day ago by Singlemalt_28 to nottheonioncommentsharecancelloading...7000NY Times: Lower Health Insurance Premiums to Come at Cost of Fewer Choices (nytimes.com)submitted 1 day ago by Singlemalt_28 to politics1 commentsharecancelloading...8567NY Times: Lower Health Insurance Premiums to Come at Cost of Fewer Choices (nytimes.com)submitted 1 day ago by Singlemalt_28 to newscommentsharecancelloading...Any good wading or pier spots at San Luis pass?  by  SomethingNicerin  texasfishing[+]Singlemalt_28 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Singlemalt_28 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI don't usually make it down to San Louis pass so I can't recommend any specific wading spots but you definitely need to be careful.
