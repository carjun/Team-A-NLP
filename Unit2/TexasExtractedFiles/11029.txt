W. Patrick Swanton said earlier in a news conference.Gov. Rick Perry declared a state of emergency in McLennan County, sending state emergency responders to help, and asked for a federal emergency declaration to help bring assistance to the victims.Perry said President Barack Obama, in a phone conversation Thursday morning, promised a quick turnaround on the states request.Officials have not determined an exact cause of the blast, which registered as a 2.1 magnitude earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey said.Another press conference is scheduled for 4 p.m., officials said.McLennan County Chief Deputy Matt Cawthon said that by the time he arrived, the smell of ammonium nitrate was overwhelming. The destruction wrought by the explosion was absolutely like a war-zone, he said.You cant imagine the devastation outside of a missile attack or something like that, he said. It was sad  surreal at times. People were hurt. People were confused.Crews continued to search for people in West on Thursday morning, but at 10:45 a.m. Swanton did not have a firm number of how many people are missing or dead.At least four volunteer firefighters are thought to be among the fatalities, but that has not been confirmed, said Chris Barron, executive director of State Firemens and Fire Marshals Association.West has an all-volunteer fire department with 29 members, five of whom have advanced firefighter certification, he said. Its a very respected department, Barron said.Crews arrived to the scene of a fire at West Fertilizer about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday and were fighting it when the explosion was reported at 7:53 p.m., Swanton said.Swanton said 50 to 75 homes, numerous businesses, an apartment complex and multiple cars were damaged. He did not have exact details but said its possible homes as far away as five blocks were damaged.Some homes have been leveled, some have windows blown out, he said.He said crews have had to reinforce some homes and buildings before entering them.It is tedious. It is time consuming, Swanton said.The No. 1 priority is to save lives, the second priority is to make sure nobody else gets hurt, Swanton said.Nearby hospitals reported treating more than 150 patients. Officials said many people suffered minor to serious injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to broken bones.As of 3 p.m., Scott & White hospitals in Temple said they have been treating five people injured in the West explosion. Three patients are at Scott & White Hospital in Temple, with two patients in critical condition and one in fair condition, according to an update posted on the systems website. McLane Childrens Scott & White Hospital is treating two patients, one in critical condition and one in serious condition.April Foran, a spokeswoman for Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, said the hospital has received two patients from West.Both are in serious condition, she said.Katherine Voss, a spokeswoman for Scott & White Healthcare, said four patients from West were in Central Texas hospitals, including two in critical condition.St. Davids Medical Center in Austin isnt expecting any patients from West, a spokeswoman said in a statement, but the hospital is coordinating with local, regional and statewide agencies responding to the explosion.Hundreds of emergency responders from Killeen to Dallas have descended on the town.Seven Austin firefighters were deployed to West, department spokeswoman Michelle Tanzola said. The group is part of Texas Task Force 1, the states elite wide-area search team that has worked national disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and the World Trade Center terrorist attacks in New York 10 years ago.Theyre expected to be there for at least a few days, Tanzola said.Austin police officials said no officers have been sent to assist in West.The Central Texas unit for the American Red Cross said it mobilized local volunteers in Austin and Waco. The agency said it was working with West emergency management workers to identify shelters and help manage assistance to victims.The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is leading the investigation, Swanton said.The U.S. Chemical Safety Board has also deployed a large investigation team to the scene of the explosion to search for physical causes as well as any possible inadequacies in regulations, industry standards and safety management systems.An independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents, the safety board does not issue fines or citations but does make recommendations to plants, regulatory agencies, industry organizations and labor groups.The investigators will conduct detailed interviews with witnesses and plant employees, examine company safety records and operating procedures and test chemical samples. It typically takes several months before root cause findings and recommendations are released.Through tears Thursday morning, Elizabeth Perez Marquez, described the horror of the night  how a quiet evening watching television with her two daughters quickly turned into mass destruction.They live about a mile from the epicenter of the explosion and were watching television when their house began to shake dramatically  lifting a bed and other furniture off the floor  and nearly every window in the house shattered.During the next few hours, Marquez said, she tended to patients from the West Rest Haven nursing home, comforting the injured, writing their names on patients who did not have an ID and even bandaging a few of their wounds.We were just helping as much as we could, said Marquez, who suffered a leg injury.Chief Nim Kidd, who heads the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said he would not second-guess the wisdom of applying water to the fire at the plant.A lot of people dont like putting water and ammonium nitrate together and I believe that was one of the chemicals that was there, Kidd said at a press conference at the Department of Public Safety headquarters in North Austin. Usually when you mix those two you have to have something that confines it in order to to make it a dangerous product.But, he said, Ill tell you, a lot of firefighters will use their number one tool, which is water, in a hazardous materials, chemical situation like that to cool the surrounding environments, to cool those other things to keep them from cooking off or exploding. So again, too soon to really speculate was it the right place at the right time. I dont think we should be second-guessing right now the actions of he fist-responders and whether they were applying water at the appropriate place at the appropriate time.12:50 update:Veronica Beyer, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Transportation, said that though traffic could be slow near West as drivers slow down to see whats happening, there are no known closures on Interstate 35.12:37 p.m. update:Gov. Rick Perry said Thursday he has declared a state of emergency in McLennan County and said President Barack Obama, in a phone conversation this morning, promised a quick turnaround on the states request.President Obama called from Air Force One as he was en route to Boston; we greatly appreciate his call and his gracious offer of support, of course, and a very quick turnaround of the emergency declaration that will be forthcoming and he offered his prayers, the governor said in a press conference with public safety officials.Perry said the state had brought all its resources to bear in dealing with the emergency.West is a really small community, just a few thousand people, Perry said. In a small town like this they know that this tragedy has touched practically everyone in that town, and I ask all Texans and all Americans to join me and Anita keeping them in their prayers.11:45 update:At least four volunteer firefighters are thought to be among the fatalities, but that has not been confirmed, said Chris Barron, executive director of State Firemens and Fire Marshals Association.West has an all-volunteer fire department with 29 members, five of whom have advanced firefighter certification, he said. Its a very respected department, Barron said.Barron said that normally when fire breaks out at an industrial facility with high explosive potential, firefighters rely on the plant manager to give direction as to whether firefighters should attempt to extinguish the flames or pull back and let it burn. He did not know what the situation was in West last night.This was a humongous fire, said Barron. I dont know if any fire department would have been able to put it out.11:40 update:The risk of rain and lightning strikes in West has passed, with the closest strikes now about 30 miles away from the town, said Steve Fano, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.They should remain at least that far if not farther away, he said at about 11:30 a.m.Storms that developed over Killeen and Temple earlier Thursday morning were on track to move toward West but only one lightning strike touched ground about 10 miles east of the town, Fano said.All the storms have dissipated or moved on, and no more rainfall is expected today, he said.11:32 update:The Texas Department of Transportation has advised drivers to expect traffic delays because of the explosion in West.11:17 update:Through tears Thursday morning, Elizabeth Perez Marquez, described the horror of the night  how a quiet evening watching television with her two daughters quickly turned into mass destruction.They live about a mile from the epicenter of the explosion and were watching television when their house began to shake dramatically  lifting a bed and other furniture off the floor  and nearly every window in the house shattered.During the next few hours, Marquez said, she tended to patients from the West Rest Haven nursing home, comforting the injured, writing their names on patients who did not have an ID and even bandaging a few of their wounds.We were just helping as much as we could, said Marquez, who suffered a leg injury.Texas A&M Universitys veterinary emergency team went to West on Thursday morning in response to a request from the Texas Division of Emergency Management and an urban search-and-rescue team, according to a statement posted on the emergency vet teams Facebook page.The team provides care to animals in disaster-stricken areas.As we head down the road, we know that we will be very busy as soon as we hit the ground in West, the statement said.Representatives for the team could not immediately be reached for comment.10:45 a.m. update:Crews continue to search for people in West, but Swanton did not have a firm number of how many people are missing or dead.He said crews have had to reinforce some homes and buildings before entering them.It is tedious. It is time consuming, Swanton said.The No. 1 priority is to save lives, the second priority is to make sure nobody else gets hurt, Swanton said.Swanton did not have an updated number on the number of people injured.He said three to five firefighters are still missing, but again, that information is sketchy and limited to me.10:40 a.m. update:Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco said it has treated multiple patients from the West blast.The hospital said of 28 people admitted and who continue to receive care, five are in the intensive care units and two children were transferred to McLanes Childrens Scott & White Hospital in Temple.Additionally, 12 elderly patients, who were reportedly nursing home residents from West, were able to be treated and discharged to alternative nursing home facilities,the hospital said in a statement.

It typically takes several months before root cause findings and recommendations are released.9:58 update:Scattered thunderstorms were developing over Temple and Killeen at about 9:45 a.m. and, if they hold together, are expected to arrive in West in about an hour, said Dennis Cavanaugh, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.The storms should produce only brief to moderate rainfall, Cavanaugh said, and strong winds and hail are not expected.The main concern is cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, particularly with the number of people outside in West, he said.Temperatures mid-morning were in the upper 40s, he said, and are expected to climb to the low 50s this afternoon.Cavanaugh said the weather service has provided updates to authorities in West, but that he doesnt know what the weathers immediate impact will be on responders.Update 9:50 a.m.:At a press conference, Swanton said crews are still searching for missing people, including three to five firefighters.Swanton did not have an exact number of how many people have been rescued or how many people were killed in the blast.He estimated the death toll to be five to 15, though he called that a rough number.Swanton had no information on the cause of the blast. The fire is still burning but has been contained, he said.The missing firefighters were part of a volunteer force that first responded to the blaze before the explosion.Swanton said 50 to 75 homes, numerous businesses, an apartment complex and multiple cars were damaged. He did not have exact details but said its possible homes as far away as five blocks were damaged.Some homes have been leveled, some have windows blown out, he said.April Foran, a spokeswoman for Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, said the hospital has received two patients from West with blast-related injuries.Both are in serious condition, she said.Katherine Voss, a spokeswoman for Scott & White Healthcare, said four patients from West were in Central Texas hospitals, including two in critical condition.St. Davids Medical Center in Austin isnt expecting any patients from West, a spokeswoman said in a statement, but the hospital is coordinating with local, regional and statewide agencies responding to the explosion.Seven Austin firefighters were deployed to West on Thursday morning to help with the aftermath of the explosion, department spokeswoman Michelle Tanzola said.

A tight-knit community has been shaken, and good, hard-working people have lost their lives.  My Administration, through FEMA and other agencies, is in close contact with our state and local partners on the ground to make sure there are no unmet needs as search and rescue and response operations continue.Update 8:15 a.m.:A spokeswoman with the Parkland Health & Hospital System in Dallas said that theyre treating patients from the blast, but the exact number of patients was unknown at about 8:15 a.m. Thursday.An official at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio said it had not received any patients from West.A division of the American Red Cross has opened a shelter in the nearby town of Aquilla but most people displaced from their homes seem to be staying with friends or family, said Marty McKellips, chief executive officer for the nonprofits Central Texas Region.About50 volunteers from Austinand Fort Worth are already trying to help at the scene of the blast and others are coming in from other parts of the state, McKellips said.McKellips said she expects to start distributing supplies Thursday or Friday to help people clean up if theyre returning to homes with damage, such as broken glass.She said she also anticipates a multi-agency center will be established Thursday or Friday to coordinate response efforts so that those affected by the explosion can get the help they need in one place.McKellips said that the Red Cross is ready to increase its response to the incident as necessary, and that she would know more about the scale of destruction as the sun comes up.6:45 a.m. update:A cold front that is moving through the town is expected to shift winds of 25 to 35 mph with gusts of up to 40 mph to the northwest, said forecasters for the National Weather Service.
