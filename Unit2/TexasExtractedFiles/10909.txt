['This subreddit is created to counterbalance the US demographic profile of Reddit and provide a place for the rest of the world politics to be placed in the spotlight. This also means this subreddit has a blanket rule against everything US related even if it is in an international setting.', "Please remember that this is a moderated subreddit. It is moderated by mods that believe in the subject and rules of this subreddit. If you don't agree with what should go in this subreddit you will be free to find an other subreddit that suits you better.", 'Rules might be adjusted in order to prevent one subject from overshadowing other subjects.', '4 When submitting a editorial/opinion piece tag it with [opinion] or use the opinion flair.', "5 Editorialize/Edit the titles of your link submissions or they may be removed. Your headline should match the article's headline as closely as possible, to avoid misrepresenting the gist or facts of the article.", 'Rule of thumb: Only use the original headline and/or a direct quote of the first line(s) of the article.', 'Note, the "no editorializing" rule does only apply to self-posts when the main subject is a video. In other self-posts, standard guidelines of reddiquette apply.', '6 Post self-posts which contain abusive or provocative language with perceived intent to incite hatred. Such posts may be removed.', '7 Manipulate comments and posts via group voting, which is against reddit TOS - such content will be removed, and repeat offenders will be banned.', '- When submitting visual material include it in a self-post describing the relevance of the material in that post.', '- When the main subject of your self post is a video the title of that video should be used,  the "do not editorialize titles" does apply here.', '- When submitting a self-post try to expand on what your message is, one line of text is not enough.', '11 Only submit content about one subject, this subreddit is not the place to push your agenda/political beliefs.', '12 Try to rally people for a cause. This subreddit aims to be a neutral place about international politics.', "13 Report a submission just because you don't like it. The report function is only for spam and inappropriate content.
