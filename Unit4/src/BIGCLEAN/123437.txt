And when you see-- wild spaces like that, you want to preserve them. ', "Segolene Kenney is John Kenney's daughter. Though you can probably tell from her accent that she is not a California girl. Fascinating, isn't it, how fate can dictate the shape of a life. And that is part of our story, too.", "It was serendipity as much as anything that produced the conditions, the distance, the isolation without which none of this would have happened. John Kenney happened to be at a conference in New York years ago.

The neighbors decided if they didn't do something pretty soon, a car would fall through the boards here to the creek bed below and so they set about deciding what to do. And perhaps somebody should have warned them then about the law of unintended consequences. But, as we say, the bridge is where it began.", 'According to Segolene Kenney, her father wanted to hire a company to fix the bridge. But Mel Grimes offered to repair it himself so Kenney agreed to wait.', 'Frustrated, John Kenney took matters into his own hands and hired a company to make the repairs. He assumed the fee would be equally split.', 'Christine and Kim Williams attended the same church as John Kenney, they called him Jack.', "Christine Williams: I think one of the things that kind of was difficult for him was, every time he would come out of his house to go to his car, which was at the other end of this house, and facing the Grimes property, he was-- he would look at their house, which was pretty funky, and a lot of-- you know, things that weren't real neat and tidy and aesthetically beautiful at all.", 'Tom Ellington-Wills: I only got to hear from my mom, like, "Oh, you know, now this neighbor\'s becoming a nightmare."

And she and her husband were friends of the Grimes. But:', "Kenney and the grimes both went to local authorities, tattling on each other's violations of local building ordinances.

Suddenly, the marathon runner encountered serious heart trouble.", "Mel Grimes: The one thing that I do regret more than anything else is the trauma that it has caused my wife over the last two years to go through this.

And the old engineer Mr. Kenney would look out of his window there across the hillside and see what he considered to be the dogpatch development of his neighbor, the lawyer, Mr. Grimes. And the grimes for their part looked back at Kenney's house and saw an inflexible and angry old man. But conflicts like this eventually have to settle on something concrete, something tangible and so the war between the neighbors focused on one little piece of ground right there just at the edge of the pavement. A piece of land no bigger than a surfboard really.

I feel terrible about everything that happened, but I do not feel remorse, because I do not feel guilt.', "And at his trial he was consistent: it wasn't he who started it, said Kenney; it wasn't his fault. And if that were the only story the jury heard. But it wasn't.
