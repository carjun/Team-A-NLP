The reasons for overwhelming debt are as varied as the human experience itself and include job loss, illness and divorce. In addition, credit cards and mortgages had previously been made too easy for people to obtain or refuse. The result is that more and more Americans are financially overwhelmed.', 'The bankruptcy lawyers of Tully Rinckey PLLC focus on Bankruptcy Law and Civil Litigation matters.

By filing for Chapter 13 protection you are entitled to cure your past-due home and car loan defaults over time and pay off a small portion of your credit card and/or medical debts in full satisfaction of those obligations in a Chapter 13 wage earner repayment plan.', 'Chapter 11 is primarily designed to allow a business to continue to operate (with management controlling the day-to-day operations) without the burden of their pre-existing debt obligations, giving them an opportunity to develop a business plan to restructure their debt as well as to possibly relieve them of burdensome leases and contracts. In some circumstances, it may be possible to modify the equity structure of a business as well.', 'If you live in the greater Albany area and have been sued by a creditor, debtor-in-possession, or trustee in bankruptcy court, federal court, or state court, the bankruptcy lawyers of Tully Rinckey PLLC can help you defend the lawsuit.
