The new marketplaces, which are open for enrollment this October, will have the feel of an online travel site where individuals and families can compare different private insurance plans.', 'Health insurers will spend millions on ads pushing their plans and the federal government is also launching a multi-million dollar campaign, targeting libraries, gyms and concerts. Health clinics and non-profits will also be joining the advertising mix.', "That means Florida residents are about to get hit with a ton of information designed to walk them through the enrollment process, but the feds and insurers must also find a way to package the information so it doesn't end up confusing residents even more.", "The federal government's marketing strategy includes everything from door-to-door walks, working with churches, partnering with local mayors and a massive social media presence, including phone apps, Facebook, Twitter and Flickr campaigns.", "Recently, Murray was wrapping up a presentation for students at Florida International University in Miami, one of nearly a dozen presentations he'd done over three days, along with a half dozen media interviews.", 'In Broward County, state Rep. Richard Stark is working with several other lawmakers on a campaign to help educate and enroll residents.

Anyone making below the poverty line, $11,490 for an individual or $23,550 for a family of four, won't be eligible to buy insurance through the online marketplace because they should be eligible for Medicaid.", "Adding to the confusion, the federal government still hasn't released which insurers are offering plans and how much premiums, co-pays and deductibles will cost under those plans. The rates will likely come out in September.", 'The Republican-led Florida Legislature, which has been reluctant to implement the new health law, decided to let the federal government run the state\'s online marketplace and isn\'t spending any additional money on marketing and outreach.
