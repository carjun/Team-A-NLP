['The Taliban poisoned and captured at least 12 policemen as they broke their fast during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan in an attack in southern Afghanistan, officials said Thursday.The attack took place in Zabul province, where the insurgent militia is believed to have a strong presence despite numerous operations by Afghanistan\'s Western-backed government security forces."Tragically, 12 policemen were poisoned and then taken away in a mini-van after breaking their fast yesterday evening in Shahjoy district of Zabul," Shah Nazanin, the district police chief, told AFP."The incident happened at a police check post. It was the work of Taliban insurgents and probably one of their infiltrators was behind this attack," Nazanin added.The militia, which ruled in Kabul from 1996 to the 2001 US-led invasion, has frequently claimed to have infiltrated the ranks of the Afghan army and police, being trained by US-led NATO troops.Zabul provincial police chief, Ghulam Sakhi Roghliwani, confirmed th...', 'Crisis-weary Kuwait limps toward parliamentary elections with implications for nation, region', 'From boycotting ballots to storming parliament, each time Kuwait heads into parliamentary elections the backstory seems to overshadow the vote.Yet the revolving-door...', 'Star midfielders Mohamed Abou Trika of Al-Ahly and Mahmoud Abdel Razak of Zamalek return Wednesday for a potentially explosive CAF Champions League Egyptian derby.Ab...', "A bomb blast outside the security headquarters in one of Egypt's Nile Delta cities wounded 19 people, security officials said early Wednesday, raising fears of deter...", '(Updates throughout)HASH(0x8bfee68)New violence erupted in Egypt on Tuesday, leaving a total of 12 people dead and dozens injured, according to the latest tally, ami...', 'Wave of attacks make first week of Ramadan  deadliest since insurgency raged in 2007', 'Ramadan this year is shaping up to be the deadliest in Iraq since a bloody insurgency and rampant sectarian killings pushed the country to the edge of civil war in t...', "As Syria's Muslims observe the fasting month of Ramadan at a time of war for a third year running, many people are turning to black humour to help them cope.Jokes ar...", 'Iran said Tuesday it would welcome ceasefire between rebel forces and the Syrian government during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, reiterating that a national dial...', 'Marium Mohiuddin from the Muslim Public Affairs Council explains the meaning behind  Ramadan  and her thoughts on the situation in Egypt', "Some 155,000 Muslims attended prayers at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound on the second Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, Israeli police said.Police ...", 'Syrians struggle to find festive mood this Ramadan  as prices soar and war drags on', 'As the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began Wednesday, many Syrians who observe the daily dawn-to-dusk fast that is broken with lavish family meals are struggling to f...', 'Muslims across Indonesia began celebrating the holy month of Ramadan, with hardliners vowing to raid "sinful" bars and police steamrolling a mountain of alcohol and ...', 'Pakistanis began celebrating the holy month of Ramadan on Thursday with police on alert in Lahore and shopkeepers braced for a slump in trade after the worst bombing...', 'Young Iraqis often spend evenings in cafes after fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, but a string of bombings against the popular hangouts means doing s...', "2 teachers killed, 1 injured in bomb attack in Thailand's insurgency-plagued south", "Police say two teachers were killed and one was injured in a bomb attack believed to have targeted security forces in Thailand's insurgency-plagued south.Police Col....", 'Bombs targeting worshippers gathered for evening prayers at three Sunni mosques in Iraq killed nine people on Tuesday, officials said.A bomb exploded in the Omar bin...', "Pakistan's Supreme Court on Wednesday revised the date for the presidential election, asking the election commission to hold it on July 30 instead of August 6.The co...", 'Pakistan\'s media regulator pulled the plug on a condom commercial starring one of the country\'s biggest female stars Tuesday, calling it "immoral", after public comp...', 'Fears of an outbreak of the deadly MERS virus in Saudi Arabia and construction in the holy city of Mecca have forced cuts in the numbers of pilgrims permitted to per...', "The death toll has risen to nine from a suicide car bomb attack on Pakistan's top intelligence agency and police living quarters in the southern town of Sukkur, offi..."]
