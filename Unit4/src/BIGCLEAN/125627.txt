Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, speaks to supporters at her recall election results party in Thiensville on Tuesday.', '        Democrats failed late Tuesday in their effort to gain control of the Wisconsin state senate as Republican incumbents won four of six recall elections.

Scott Walker, who earlier this year enacted a labor law overhaul that ended collective bargaining rights for many public sector workers. ", 'The recall elections attracted millions of dollars of investment from both liberals and conservatives across the nation.', 'Most at risk as voting started Tuesday appeared to be three Republicans, Alberta Darling, Randy Hopper and Dan Kapanke, all of whom had barely won their races in 2008. ', 'Kapanke and Hopper lost, but Darling won with 54 percent with most of the precincts counted, partly due to her outperforming her 2008 majority in heavily Republican Waukesha County. ', 'In 2008, Darling had won her district by a mere 1,007 out of more than 99,000 votes cast. Her district went narrowly for Barack Obama in 2008.', 'Three other Republican lawmakers also survived the Democratic recall effort: Sen. Robert Cowles, Sen. Sheila Harsdorf and Sen. Luther Olsen.

Republicans need a net gain of four to win control of the U.S. Senate.', 'Republicans saw the race as a big win for Walker and a confirmation of his conservative agenda.', 'Walker attempted to strike a bipartisan tone in victory, saying that he reached out to leaders in both parties. ', '"In the days ahead, I look forward to working with legislators of all parties to grow jobs for Wisconsin and move our state forward," Walker said in a prepared statement. ', 'Democrats and union leaders tried to make the best of the historic GOP wins. There had been only 13 other successful recalls of state-level office holders nationwide since 1913.
