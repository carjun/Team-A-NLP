If you want to see this extreme consumerism simply look at how our choices shape the behaviors of the leading retailers across our country. The WalMart mantra of EDLP (Every Day Low Prices) and "We Sell for Less" has delivered to consumers our most important priority as spoken by our wallets and evidenced by placing Wal Mart as the longtime king of retailers across North America.', "In a challenging economy it seems the strongest message most of us can send is through those purchases we don't make. But this conscientious boycott of sorts or a re-prioritization of spending to help important causes, completely bends under the enormous pressure in which we pride ourselves to find the best deal for the most possible value to us.", '"Made in America" is dying to "We sell for less" and so to are many other purchasing choices we know to be worth the extra money spent for better long term results. Never is the shopping sacrifice for bargains more evident than in tough economic times, with tight budgets, and uncertain employment conditions.', 'Let\'s look at how we got here and some of the ways that "Made in America" doesn\'t mean what it used to mean.', 'According to the US Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics, international workers from hundreds of different countries make substantially less than our US laborers. In US Dollar comparisons, workers in Korea make 10% of the average US worker and the data indicates as low as 2% for the average worker in Sri Lanka.', 'Some call the disparity in compensation a form of "economic internationalization" that provides great benefit in every direction. Others call it exploitation and level law suits against retailers who leverage enormous material sourcing advantages in ways that look most troubling. While most of us just keep bargain hunting for the best possible price completely insensitive to the high cost of doing whatever it takes to satisfy our demand.', 'I\'m not speaking of US immigration problems though we do in various forms import tremendous foreign labor in an effort to keep jobs and manufacturing domestic under the huge pressure of "selling for less." ', 'But even more clever and unique is how the US has been carving out many Foreign Trade Zones across the country that essentially serve as foreign territories with all the benefit of avoiding higher customs taxes, duties, and allowing more US workers to be much more involved in the local supply chain of our "Every Day Low Prices." In the attached link you can see the high level of corporate involvement of businesses that discovered the advantage to having their own subzones, while most businesses generally operate within a zone already created to avoid the administrative burden that goes along with leveraging an FTZ.', 'I could go into much more detail having personally set up and administered an FTZ subzone, but suffice it to say the zone works like this and gives us many import benefits like these:', 'When you do the math these are some amazing benefits, so how does this relate to "Made in America?"', 'The FTZ scheme ultimately allows foreign parts to be "produced" or assembled with added value from US workers into different products with much less duty and taxes than if the end product was simply imported from abroad. Many car manufacturers employ FTZs and often multiple zones to benefit from inexpensive foreign parts while keeping many US workers employed at our inflated wage rates on an international comparison of compensation.', 'You\'ve no doubt seen the car with a window sticker of 42% foreign content sitting next to the truck with a 67% foreign content label. Much of this has come about not by the patriotic consumer, but by the required FTZ tracking and excellent duty savings that each of those percentages represents to the manufacturer as they strain to find ways to "sell for less."', 'Where is our purchasing power taking us next? It all depends on the choice you make every time you open your wallet to buy in way that you value most.', "It's not just a caution, it is a reality that our incredible US Supply Chain is watching every penny you spend and with unparalleled efficiency is adapting, accommodating, and adjusting to every preference you so much as breathe."]
