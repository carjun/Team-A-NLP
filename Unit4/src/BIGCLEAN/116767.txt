['The difference between financial drugs and medical drugs is that most financial drugs are legal, no matter how harmful they might be.  In 1979, Congress got rid of usury laws, allowing credit card companies to charge darn near any interest rate they wanted, any fee they felt applicable and any penalty they felt you deserved.  In other words, the legalized financial drug dealers were allowed to run rampant and sell as much of their product as the addicts could consume.', 'The new legislation says that banks must give you full disclosure:  they are required to tell you how many months it will take for you to repay the balance you owe, if you were to make the minimum payment. ', 'The most significant part of the bill is that the financial drug dealers are not allowed to prey on the young.  Anyone under the age of 21 who applies for a credit card must prove that they have the financial resources to repay the loan, or they must get a parent or guardian to co-sign.  This keeps the vultures from swooning in on college campuses, where the average student has over $3,000 in credit card debt. ']
