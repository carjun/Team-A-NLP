["        From every direction, you can see them: jagged cliffs, rising up out of the desert landscape. The wind has carved their names: Kissing Rock, Castle Rock, Giant's Thumb.

', "Roger Brauburger: Yeah, people have referred to it like that. It's pretty simple life.", "Before all that, it was just fine to grow up here. Roger Brauburger and his pal Bob Duke. Funny how kids can be so different and yet get so close. They hung out at a mutual friend's house - a cop's kid named Mecham - whose dad watched Roger fall into bad behavior, while Bob stayed squeaky clean.", "Roger Brauburger: it makes you feel ten feet tall and bulletproof. Usually someone would show me I wasn't ten foot tall and bulletproof.", 'Roger Brauburger: We would watch movies about hit men. There was easy money involved in-- in just a few seconds of work.', 'They imagined becoming hit men themselves. Just a joke, of course. And then, quite suddenly, life got serious for Bob. His girlfriend got pregnant. ', 'Yes, but she was intelligent, a straight A student. She was going somewhere, just like Bob. But now there were issues.', 'Liana, now carrying their child, had apparently adjusted to the new circumstances rather well.', 'She was a doting wife from the beginning, says Roger, filled up the house with craft-y things: needlepoint, stenciling.', 'Karen Yoak: Bob had a trick bike and there were a lot of kids in the complex and he would go out in the parking lot and do tricks for the kids and his son Erik would love to watch his dad.', "Bob had given up on college; he had a family to support. But he was smart, people liked him. And he soon built a solid business as one of Green River's premiere carpet installers. ", 'Roger, meanwhile, spiraled into drug addiction, and all of its attendant failures, disappointments, and remorse.', 'Roger Brauburger: I did envy the fact that he had-- that he was successful. Looked like he had no worries, you know?', 'But the friendship survived, Bob and Roger - and now little Erik. By the time Erik turned five, liana was pushing for another baby; but Bob?', 'Roger Brauburger: I think he had given up on her long before that and felt trapped.', 'Kevin Alvesteffer: I was advised by dispatch that a subject had called up, a male subject stating that his wife and child had fallen off a cliff.', 'They call it Lost Dog Road, this dusty trail that winds up through the open desert, up here to the head of the cliff. The road Lieutenant Kevin Alvesteffer sped up in response to the 911 call.', 'Avlesteffer worked his way gingerly across the ragged loose shale, braced himself against the wind, and approached the precipice.', 'Why, the lieutenant wondered, had Bob Duke parked his Jeep on this particular cliff, such a dangerous place? ', 'Kevin Alvesteffer: To-- to think that anybody would let-- their five-year-old son run around on this cliff-- it was beyond comprehension.', 'Still, they were so young. And if they were foolish enough to let their child play on the cliff top, surely it was reasonable that she would have reached out to save him, and then slipped off herself.', 'Kevin Alvesteffer: Nothing else in the autopsy would support anything else other than death by falling.', "Which brings us back to Bob's friend Roger Brauburger, who heard the same news everyone did.", 'Roger Brauburger: I was torn up too cause I knew Liana and Erik. I really truly hurt for the wife and kid.', 'There was something else, too, that only he and Bob knew. So right away he arranged to see his grieving friend.', 'Now, why would Bob have said a thing like that? Roger began to get a sickening feeling. He found himself brooding over memories of Bob and the lack of warmth he showed towards his son.', "Liana and Erik Duke were buried side-by-side on a hill overlooking the town. Bob took great care in choosing the headstones. Roger was a pallbearer, and he carried Erik's small coffin with a heavy heart...and a worried mind.", 'Reporter Steve Core also attended the funeral in support of his old acquaintance, Bob Duke.', 'But even as grief swept through the small desert town, support for Bob was accompanied by whispered questions: Why had he taken his little family up to that remote, forbidding place? Why did he let Erik play up there on the lip of a deadly cliff?', "But Roger could. Roger had a reason to be very suspicious indeed. The same reason - must have been - for Bob's urgent request during that strange post-accident conversation.", 'But could Roger go to the police with the wild story of what happened a month before the accident? After all, who would believe such a tale from a known drug addict like him?', 'Roger Brauburger: A lot of the town was mourning, you know, the death of two beautiful people that died on a tragic cliff.', 'Everyone in Green River, Wyoming, seemed to take it hard, the death of Liana Duke and her little boy Erik. So young. And the way they were killed, falling from that cliff...awful.', 'Mont Mecham: They were really "poor---" you know "poor Bob" you know.

You know, I mean, the guy taught tae kwon doe to children for Christ's sake. My parents absolutely loved him.

And then, as Roger discovered, he had a very big problem indeed.', 'Two years had passed since Liana Duke and her little boy Erik fell off the cliff at the end of Lost Dog Road.

I know way too much...', 'And it was right then that Roger decided that for once in his life, he was going to do the right thing.', 'Roger Brauburger: Well, I went to school with a kid named Mark Mecham.

', "Only one thing to do now, said Detective Mecham. Roger would have to do the one thing he thought he'd never do: Cooperate with the police. He would have to catch his old friend in the act of plotting to kill. The FBI was called in; they put a tap on Roger's phone. Agent Todd Scott gave him directions..", 'Todd Scott: We needed them to discuss the plot because up until that point, we only had Roger, whose credibility was undetermined by the FBI.', 'Agent: This is expected to be a call from Roger Brauburger to Bob Duke, reference: conspiracy to commit murder. ', 'Roger Brauburger: Hey, uh, remember when we talked before about the twenty-thousand for killing your parents?', 'Roger Brauburger: They had to see if there was any, you know, validity, behind what I was saying. ', "It was like a conversation out of the hit man movies Roger and Bob had so often watched together. This time it was Bob and his brother who wanted to turn Roger into a real life hit man. They discussed how they'd carry out the hits, and set a timeline for the murder. ", "Bob Duke: And our whole thing relies upon us being able to say we are where we are. You know what I'm saying?", 'Todd Scott, FBI: A good time would be over the Martin Luther King Holiday weekend. If they could kill them on Friday they would have three days to-- to be totally out of there, alibi themselves, and no one would even begin to look for their parents until Tuesday.', "Roger Brauburger: You can get me in? So it's just walk in and uh, do it and walk out just like it was, like I lived there basically, then?", "Bob Duke: Yeah, the best thing to do would be when - be there when no one's there.", "Roger Brauburger: I couldn't just bust him and give him a chance to get the gun and shoot me. I had to be there to surprise him.", 'Roger Brauburger: Hey, uh, as far as like afterwards, like getting paid? Like is there insurance on them or something?', "Bob had collected $60,000 in life insurance money after Liana and Erik's deaths. And now, it seemed, he was planning to collect money on his parents.", "Roger Brauburger: Okay, well, let me kick around the twenty thousand for a couple days and I'll get back to you.", 'Todd Scott, FBI: They were in a hurry; they just wanted to be done with this. So they solicited Roger to actually conduct the murders.', 'Keith Morrison: Were you nervous that he would realize somebody was overhearing this thing?', "Roger Brauburger: Oh god yes. I don't know how he didn't figure it out. I was damn near hyperventilating.", 'Agent: Today is January 8, 1999 at 11:59 a.m. This is in reference to conspiracy to commit murder.', "Still, they needed more from Roger. Though he'd extracted evidence of the murder plot against Bob's parents, Roger hadn't asked Bob to admit he killed his wife and son. He'd have to make one more phone call.", 'Roger Brauburger: Okay. Hey, uh, is there any way we can make it look like an accident like, like you did with your wife and kid?', 'Local reporter: Twenty five year old Robert Duke was arrested in his home in southwest Houston, his brother 31-year-old Patrick Duke was arrested at a business office near downtown.', 'Bob Duke was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, his brother with failure to report the plot.', 'Roger Brauburger: The only way I can guarantee the protection of my family is to meet Bob when he gets off that bus and kill him.', 'Roger Brauburger: They all thought I made it up. So half the town hated me, and the other half patted me on the back and bought me a beer.', "Roger Brauburger, drug addict, had accomplished something quite remarkable: He'd foiled a murder plot. Imagine: His own childhood friend, Bob Duke, wanted to kill his own parents. Both of them well-known and respected Wyoming school teachers.", 'Roger Brauburger: He came to me. He put me in this position. And he has turned my life upside down with this.', "And yet those very parents, who refused to listen to the telephone recordings, also refused to believe their son wanted them dead. And more than a few people made it clear to Roger they agreed with Bob's parents. ", 'And then it got worse. Bob Duke was charged with conspiracy to commit the murder of his parents, but not the murder of his wife and son. He took a plea bargain. The sentence: ten years in federal prison. By 2009, Bob Duke would be a free man. Roger was now married, with a baby, and another on the way. And he was certain bob would seek revenge, just as soon as he could. ', 'Roger Brauburger: For every day he is sitting in prison he is gonna be thinking of 100 different ways to kill me. ', "He asked the FBI for protection of his family. They told him he wasn't a candidate.", "Roger Brauburger: My life was turned upside down and I've been through hell for this. For what? To do the right thing?", 'Reporter Steve Core: I think the majority of people in town were thinking they need to reopen that case. ', 'And then finally prosecutor Harold Moneyhun and investigator Mike Dayton agreed to take a fresh look at that accident on the cliff. ', 'Investigator Mike Dayton went out to the cliff at the end of Lost Dog Road. He was taken aback by the harsh wind, the pigmy rattlesnakes, the severe drop-- no place for adults, let alone a child.', 'But they needed forensic evidence, physical evidence. They examined the autopsy photos.', "HaroldMoneyhun: There was a linear-- mark, a-- bluish, reddish bruise on-- Liana's throat, and there was a suspicion that there may be evidence of-- strangulation-- prior to her being pushed off the cliff.", 'If Bob had strangled her, they were sure the hyoid bone, a small U-shaped bone of the neck, would be fractured. They were granted a court order to exhume the bodies.', 'They waited, hoping this was the evidence they needed. And? The injuries were horrific, but the hyoid was intact. She had not been strangled.', "But in the end, it didn't matter if the dummies were hurled off or gently dropped off the face of the cliff, because they were funneled to the same landing place each time.", "HaroldMoneyhun: Roger-- wasn't a choir boy. You know, he had-- he had some past. ", 'Steve Core: I think the general feeling among people in Green River was, "It\'s about time."', 'Roger told the jury specific details of how Bob had offered him $20,000 to kill his wife and child and how three years later, offered him a similar amount to kill his own parents. But had it been enough? ', 'And then one day toward the end of the trial, Moneyhun went back to his office to have lunch and fret about his case.', 'HaroldMoneyhun: I was trying to eat my sandwich and i got a message that there was someone that needed to talk to me about this case.', 'It was with some reluctance that he relented and had his secretary bring in a young, attractive, woman.', 'HaroldMoneyhun: Just kind of-- danced in and-- and-- sat down and told me she had some stuff, some information that I really should hear.', 'But, inside the Sweetwater County courthouse, the prosecutor was preparing to rest an iffy case: No real forensic evidence, no real physical evidence, and his main witness was a known addict. And then, over lunch, there she was.', 'Crystal told the prosecutor she met Bob Duke at the Green River mini-mart. Crystal was just 13 years old. And Bob, she said, came on to her.', 'Crystal Robinson: It was just so flattering that an older man- that he would have any kind of interest in, you know, a girl that was so young.', 'They started hanging out together, well, actually drinking and making out together, she says, even though Bob had already been married for 3 years. And she was just entering her teens. He took her for rides on his 4-wheeler. Lots of times, they went out to the country.', "So she knew exactly where they were when Bob drove up Lost Dog Road, to the very cliff he told police he'd never once been to before Liana and Erik fell to their deaths. ", "Harold Moneyhun: Bob had always claimed that he had arrived at this point on the cliff by accident. he'd taken a wrong turn.", 'But he lied. And while they were up there, said Crystal, he told her stories about his wife and son.', 'Crystal Robinson: He was very miserable. And that was the only part of the conversation that ever went bad. It was whenever he talked about his family. He felt like he was trapped. I asked him a few times, if you are that miserable, why stay? You know, "Get a divorce." He wanted to find a way out of getting a divorce without having to pay child support. ', 'The prosecutor put Crystal on the stand, of course... And then he told the jury that Bob Duke\'s "way" out of his dissatisfaction was to shove his wife and child off that deadly cliff, claim it was an accident, and collect $60,000 on a life insurance policy. And then, when that money ran out, he and his brother concocted a new plan-- to kill their parents for more insurance money.', "But the jury, apparently, had a lot to talk about. An hour went by, then five, then ten. It was late when Roger Brauburger got a call. He'd just put his children to bed. He rushed down to the courthouse to hear the verdict.", 'Roger Brauburger: I did the only thing I could do. I still look myself in the mirror and say, "Look you know, I like this guy." You know.', 'Roger Brauburger: That is a big step. And it and it took a long time to get there.', 'But get there he finally did, because, perhaps for the first time in his life, Roger Brauburger stepped up to do the right thing.']
