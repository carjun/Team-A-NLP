But when you have a spoiled rich kid who doesn't get his way, I mean you do things like that.", 'To help prove motive, prosecutors played an interview Darren did with a group advocating family court reforms, videotaped just one week after the divorce ruling and two weeks before the murder and shooting. In it, Mack likens the family court system to the English tyranny that started the American Revolution.', 'Darren Mack (Videotape): It\'s time to take a stand. It\'s time to not let this tyranny go under the wraps, keep it quiet. If our forefathers in 1776 stood by, "Just keep quiet, maybe England\'ll go away," we would be sipping tea right now. At what point do we become and stand up to this absolute unconstitutionality and state, "We\'re not going to take this anymore"? Where do we draw the line?', 'Robert Daskas: He was essentially calling on people to start a revolution, to do something to fix the family court system. In his mind, he was justified.

When the Explorer was later recovered, a forensic expert testified that she found gunshot residue in the rear cargo area.', 'Robert Daskas: What conclusions can we draw from the presence of those elements?', 'Patricia Eddings: One, someone fired a gun or a weapon of some type in this vehicle. The second conclusion is that if you had a weapon that had a lot of residue because it had recently been fired and laid it in there, that would also deposit those kind of materials.', 'Prosecutors said all of this proved that Darren Mack was in fact the sniper who shot Judge Weller around 11 a.m. on June 12, 2006.', 'Next, prosecutors set out to show that Darren Mack attacked and stabbed Charla in his garage just hours before shooting the judge.', 'This empty sheath was found in his bedroom, and it belonged to an especially lethal knife.', 'Ron Chalmers: Approximately four-inch blade, double-edge dagger, fixed-bladed dagger.', "Ron Chalmers: I think it's used for killing. I mean, I-- I suppose there are hunters out there that use a knife like that. But its purpose is-- is inflict injury.", 'Prosecutors called to the stand a medical expert who testified that Charla had been stabbed multiple times all over her body.', 'Finally, prosecutors unveiled evidence they believed would prove to the jury that Darren Mack carefully and willfully planned the death of his ex-wife and the shooting of judge Weller.

And then he talked about the parking garage if yes. He shot Judge Weller from a parking garage.', 'Prosecutors said there should be no doubt these were cold-blooded, pre-planned attacks and Darren Mack should be found guilty.

Charla had threatened Darren Mack with physical violence as well. ", 'Scott Freeman: "I will cut your penis off and put it in a freezer." "I will kill you. I watch Court TV every day and I know how to do it.', 'Freeman said Darren started to believe that Charla would carry out those threats...especially after a psychic told him to beware of her.', 'Scott Freeman: She said, "There\'s blood everywhere. You can\'t turn your back on Charla. She will stab you with knife."', 'Scott Freeman:It would be a knife verses knife. That would qualify for legal self-defense.', 'On the day of the murder, the defense said, Charla got into a fight with Darren in his garage when she learned he was going to appeal the divorce court ruling.', 'Scott Freeman: That enraged Charla. The name calling from Charla began. The terrorist split personality reared its evil head. She transferred into pure hatred. ', 'Scott Freeman: Unbeknownst to Darren, Charla follows and bashes him in the right side of his face from behind. She knocked him over onto his left knee. He never saw it coming. ', 'He says they began struggling and a gun Darren had always carried around for protection fell from his pocket. Charla grabbed it.', 'Scott Freeman: Charla looks at the gun, pulls the hammer back, smiles, and fires. ', 'Scott Freeman: Charla starts to cock the hammer again. Darren lunges at her. All he gets was a handful of hair. Darren knew he was going to die. Charla rolled to her left. They both fell to the ground. The terror for Darren is overwhelming.', 'Scott Freeman: Charla is kicking and he is trying to pull the knife out. They are both struggling on the ground. Darren plunges the knife into her neck once.', 'Freeman then attempted to explain away the so-called "to-do" list. He said after the fight with Charla, Darren was out of his mind and simply scribbled the list as a way to help him organize his thoughts.', 'But if this was truly self-defense, why then, would Darren drive to the parking garage and shoot Judge Weller?', 'The opening statement continued, as attorney David Chesnoff picked up the story, telling the jury that the fight in the garage caused Mack to snap. It triggered a long simmering delusional state in Darren. Charla had finally pushed him over the edge with her hatred, and the drug fueled party life they had shared during their marriage had damaged his reason. ', 'Darren Mack: (videotape) "It\'s time to not let this tyranny go under the wraps..."', "David Chesnoff: If that's not delusional, I don't know what is. He was basically comparing himself to Benjamin Franklin.", 'Darren Mack: (videotape) If our forefathers in 1776 stood by, "Just keep quiet, maybe England\'ll go away," we would be sipping tea right now.', 'David Chesnoff: Darren acted upon his delusions in shooting Judge Weller and the disease he suffers from caused the delusions to control his actions.', 'The defense attorneys said they would put on experts and witnesses to back-up these remarkable claims. But the jury never got to hear from them. Instead of calling its first witness, the defense announced news that left everyone stunned: Darren Mack had agreed to a deal -- and would plead guilty.', "He pleaded guilty to shooting the judge as well. Mack's lawyers said they convinced Darren to take the deal so he could avoid a potential life sentence in prison. Under terms of the plea, Mack could be paroled in 20 years. Also, Darren Mack was assured that he'd finally be able to tell the world his story at sentencing.", 'Darren Mack: Because there are some very important things I would like to share because I have remained quiet through his whole thing. I would like to come forward and speak, and it was represented that I would have that with your honor?', "Darren's family, which had shelled out more than a million dollars for a defense, was in shock.", 'But a little more than a month before the sentencing date came a bombshell from Darren Mack. He had fired his attorneys and told the court he wanted out of the deal.', 'This case was far from over. Mack hired a new lawyer named William Routsis, a former semi-pro boxer, who immediately jumped into this case swinging.', "William Routsis: What happened to Darren was a manifest injustice. They destroyed the man's character. ", 'Routsis filed motion after motion with the court, making incredible allegations and demanding that Mack be given a new trial.', 'William Routsis: Everybody\'s going to look back and say, "My god. They made a monster of a man."', 'The judge scheduled a hearing. Could Darren Mack get out of his plea deal and win a new trial? At least one thing seemed certain --Darren Mack finally would tell his story.', 'Judge: "We will be on the record with State of Nevada versus Darren Roy Mack..."', 'With a new attorney by his side, Darren Mack came to court ready to unleash a series of incredible allegations in an effort to convince the judge to let him take back his guilty plea and get a new trial.', 'Mack told the court he never got the chance to tell his truth before a jury because his former attorneys abandoned him in the middle of the trial and coerced him into taking the plea deal.', "Darren Mack: It was like a psychological rape. I mean, I have a whole new relationship to compassion for women who are raped. It's not just the sex that's taken from them. It's their will. And that is like one of the most horrifying things to have your will taken from you.", 'Mack said once the prosecution rested its case, his former attorneys, David Chesnoff and Scott Freeman, launched an all out assault on his psyche.', 'Darren Mack: Scott just turned and put the full court pressure on me. Saying, "This is a good deal. You have to take this, Darren. I\'m trying to save your life. Don\'t you see? Tru-- you\'ve got to trust us." ', 'Mack said they berated him during mock cross-examination, told him his witnesses were dropping out. That his case was hopeless. ', 'Mack said his attorneys broke his will easily because he was dehydrated, suffering from paralyzing back pain, and was sleep deprived -- all caused by poor jail conditions.', 'Attorney William Routsis: How many hours would you say you were sleeping during the 27-day period?', "Darren Mack: On an average I would assume it was two to three. It wasn't good sleep.", 'Additionally, Mack says he told his lawyers that he ditched the gun that he claims misfired when Charla allegedly tried to shoot him. But when he urged them to look for it, he says, they refused.', "Darren Mack: I said, but we've got to get the gun. Because that corroborates my self-defense claim of what happened in the garage. We can figure out what caused the misfire. And it will corroborate everything I said. And he refused.", 'Alecia Biddison: What he was arguing was not temporary insanity. He was arguing that Darren was insane prior to the death of Charla. He, in my opinion, completely undermined the self-defense.', "Mack's new lawyer, William Routsis, told the judge that not only was the plea coerced, but Darren Mack had never signed the agreement in the first place. His signature, he said, was forged.", "Scott Freeman: To me, throwing the gun out is inconsistent with self-defense. It is consistent with premeditation. So, I didn't want to go there.", 'Christopher Lalli: Did you ever coerce him in any way to enter the plea that he did? ', "Attorney Christopher Lalli: And you were responsible-- you're the person who shot Judge Weller, correct?", 'Judge Herndon: There is just no way in my mind that I can conceptualize somebody thinks that they can plead guilty to the-- to first-degree murder and somehow say, "I didn\'t commit a murder." It\'s belied by the record, and it belies and defies logic.', 'At his sentencing, instead of asking the judge for mercy, Mack spent hours, once again trying to convince him that he stabbed Charla in self-defense and that his plea was coerced.', 'Darren Mack: It\'s like-- it\'s-- sorry I\'m so frustrated. I\'m just like this is like I\'m waiting for somebody to go, "Hey, you\'re on Candid Camera." This is all completely a joke. ', 'He lashed out at Christopher Lalli when the prosecutor challenged his version of events that led to stabbing of his wife and shooting of the judge.', "Darren Mack: Were you in the garage and were you in those rooms with-- as Chuck Weller, when he was extorting me? You weren't. And you talk like you know what you're talking about. You really don't. You have no clue.", "He then proceeded to tell everyone in the courtroom that he was a victim too. That Charla's mother and brother were not the only ones who suffered a loss on that tragic June day.", "Darren Mack: But the thing you don't-- A lot of people don't recognize-- I lost a wife, too. And even, though that this happened, I still loved Charla. I just couldn't live with her, and I was afraid of her.", 'Victoria Corderi, Dateline NBC: You looked like you were going to jump off the seat.', "Soorya Townley: No. I knew he was so locked in at that point, I knew I wasn't going to get anything. ", 'The judge sentenced Darren Mack to life in prison with the possibility for parole after 36 years.', 'In a jailhouse interview with "In Session," on cable TV, Mack painted himself the victim and added the prosecutor and the judge to his list of those who are out wrong him. He\'s now forging ahead with an appeal, trying to get another trial. ', "Darren Mack: I just want to get up on a stand, in front of 12 people, and tell the truth. And if that gets me a conviction, because they don't believe it, so be it.", "Robert Daskas: The evidence hasn't changed. The motive doesn't change. None of that ever changes. Darren Mack should be careful what he wishes for.", "It's been two years since this tragedy and the one involving the Nevada State Controller made their ugly marks on the Reno community.
