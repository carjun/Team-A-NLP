Egypt's public prosecutor later ordered the arrest of Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and eight other senior members of the movement in a probe over accusations of inciting violence.", 'Badie and other Brotherhood figures have been detained before and subsequently released since July 3.

A government spokesman condemned it as a terrorist attack.", 'Two soldiers were also killed in attacks by militants in the lawless North Sinai region shortly after Sisi spoke and four militants died in a car bomb near a police training center in the area, security sources said.

It was the latest in a line of assaults targeting Islamists.', '"We think that after what Sisi has said, there will be violence on Friday.

If you have real weight and public opinion supports your movement, then that will be reflected in the coming vote," he said, wearing full military uniform.', "Many ordinary Egyptians say they are tired of the constant tensions, which have kept tourists away, and some people openly welcomed Sisi's announcement on Wednesday.", '"Thank God! We were wondering when the army would make its move and release us from this chaos and horror the Brotherhood is causing," said Ahmed Mohamed, a 76-year-old pensioner, in central Cairo.', 'State news agency Mena said the interior ministry planned "unprecedented security" to protect the Friday rallies.', 'The Tamarud (Rebel) youth group, which earlier this year launched the campaign to unseat Mursi, accusing him of partisanship and mismanagement, said on Facebook that it was throwing its weight behind a fresh round of demonstrations.', 'Yasser El-Shimy, an Egypt expert at the International Crisis Group, said escalating tensions jeopardized the prospects for establishing political stability.', '"Both the authorities and the Muslim Brotherhood should recognize the urgency of negotiating a compromise out of this ever-escalating impasse," he said.', '(Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla, Yasmine Saleh and Noah Browning; Writing by Crispian Balmer and Matt Robinson; Editing by Peter Graff)', ' (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2013.
