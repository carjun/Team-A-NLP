But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring.

During a colonoscopy, a tiny camera is guided through the colon, along with a device that can remove any suspicious-looking growths then and there.', 'The rules also make it clear a patient getting a test for the BRCA gene, which raises the likelihood of breast and ovarian cancer, gets both the test and counseling about it for free.', 'HHS also issued a report detailing how the new rules will greatly broaden coverage of mental health and substance abuse services.', 'HHS says 47.5 million Americans have no health insurance, and a quarter have a mental health condition or substance use disorder -- or both. About 27 million of them will get health insurance by 2017 thanks to the health reform law, the Congressional Budget Office projects.']
