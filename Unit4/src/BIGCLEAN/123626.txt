['            When a radiant mother disappeared in Colorado, secrets began to tumble out about her hidden life. Where is Paige Birgfeld?', "The setting, and perhaps in some way the reason, for the story you're about to hear, the secret that lay behind it", 'If not for its wide, sweeping driveway, its swimming pool, its glorious views across the valley, to the river, to the town, to the mountains beyond -- and its hefty monthly payment -- would any of this have happened?', "Paige's Parents/ Frank and Suzie Birgfeld: The house with Paige just-- the kids were running and screaming sometimes. And people were coming and going.", 'Paige is the woman who lived here with her three children. These are her parents, Frank and Suzie Birgfeld.', "Paige's Parents/ Frank and Suzie Birgfeld: And that's the life that Paige wanted. To be a mom and to have her kids around her. ", 'The Birgfelds brought Paige here to Colorado when they were young and she was small.', "Paige's Parents/ Frank and Suzie Birgfeld: My word that I use to describe her succinctly is effervescent. A person who has a big smile, a person who when she meets you, you are the center of the moment. ", "Paige's Parents/ Frank and Suzie Birgfeld: You know, during high school, she certainly always had a date for the prom. ", 'She tried college away in Florida, but how could she leave Colorado? And, perhaps more to the point, there was a young man, and she was in love.', 'So she returned and married. And life began to pile up its layer cake of unintended change.', 'These things do happen. What can you say, besides keep what you can and move on.', "In Paige's case, it meant moving on here, in the sprawling house on the hill, with its swimming pool, its magnificent canyon views, its bewitching sunsets.", "Which might certainly have eaten away at anyone's easy good humor, God knows, she wouldn't have been alone these days.", "Andrea Land: She's got such a bubbly personality and every time she shows up it's you know all the kids in tow and just really excited to see you and hear how things have been going in your life.", 'Amazing, really. And rather than stew and worry about that mortgage, Paige launched businesses to pay it.', 'She sold cooking products for a company called "The Pampered Chef," and slings for carrying babies. She taught dancing classes for little kids.', 'And she became, on top of everything else, a charter member of the Grand Junction chapter of "Mom\'s Club International," a support group for working mothers. ', "Andrea Land: You know, you throw a pebble in a pond and watch the ripples. And Paige with her impact on her world, she's (laughs) She's like a boulder. (Laughter)", 'After all, she should have been very house poor. But here she was, busy, productive, apparently unworried.', 'Life for Paige seemed to be, as far as anybody knew -- parents and children included, pretty good.', "Paige's Parents/ Frank and Suzie Birgfeld: She has a girl, 8, a boy who just turned 7, and another little guy who's 3. And that's her life, and her family, and then her friends.", 'Her parents lived a four-hour drive away, in Denver, so they marveled at her life, her energy, from a distance.', 'And of course, when the call came, that moment that upended everything, it was long distance.', 'Barbara: I was instantly terrified for her, something bad had to have happened. It just seemed that maybe she was driving home from a pampered chef show one night and her car broke down. She got out to fix the tire and somebody kidnapped her. It was scenarios like that were in my head. ', 'But no friend, no parent, could have begun to imagine what one of those scenarios could very well have been.', "At 34, Paige Birgfeld was a charter member of the Grand Junction chapter of Mom's Club International.", 'Andrea Land: We were in the kitchen and I looked at her and I said, "Don\'t you ever just want to--" and she finished my sentence and said, "Run away?" And I said, "Yeah. Sometimes I just want to run away." And she said, "Yeah, but I\'d want to take my kids with me." (Laughter) That\'s the thing is we all knew she would never leave her kids intentionally. But something bad must have happened.', "Stanley Hilkey: You know, you've got to really look at those relationships first.", 'As far as police could determine, unless something else came up, the last person to have seen Paige was the first of her two ex-husbands: Ron Beigler.', 'Ron Beigler: It was a typical late teenage romance that turned into love and marriage ', 'So, just what could she be doing 10 years later in the company of Ron Beigler in the hours that led right up to her disappearance?', 'Ron Beigler: We were going to meet for the day in Eagle together. We were going to have a picnic and hang out together, all day.', "Here's the story Beigler told, to police and to us, and it sounded, frankly, a little more romantic a tale than we'd expected to hear.", "Ron Beigler: We went to Subway and brought it back to where we were sitting outside, down by the river. It was very familiar and I brought some pictures, you know. We just sat there and relaxed and enjoyed the day and the weather. I mean, it was a special wonderful day but I can't see it that well now at all.", 'If that sounds like a date, well, actually, in a way it was, said Beigler. He, after the breakup of their marriage, stayed single. And when her second marriage collapsed? His chance, it seemed perhaps, had come again.', 'Ron Beigler: She called me before I got home to see if I made it back into Denver and then we had a brief conversation, you know not too brief but, and, I expected to hear from her later that night, after she got home.', 'But he never did hear from her after that, he told the police, though repeatedly he tried calling her the next day.', "So when Ron Beigler talked to the Mesa county sheriff's department, it was actually he who called them.", "Stanley Hilkey: He reached out and was providing information to our investigators about what they did on that day. And where they were. And so he's been cooperative as well.", "Stanley Hilkey: From the time she left her first ex-husband up in Eagle County on that Thursday to the time that she drove back down here, a lot of what we used in the very first part of the case were telephone records. Who she's calling. Who's calling her. Who's leaving her messages.", 'And then, it was the day after Paige was reported missing, just about the time they were calling up those phone records.', "It was bizarre. And for Paige Birgfeld's family and friends, terrifying. This was three days after she disappeared. Her car. On fire, right in town, just a few miles from her house.", "Stanley Hilkey: No, it's badly damaged. You know, what was doesn't damaged in the fire was probably damaged in the suppression of the fire, too. We haven't gotten all of that evidence back yet, probably. It certainly appears to be an arson and probably done in a way to try to destroy evidence.", 'And now, any chance that Paige had had some bizarre accident, or was lost somewhere, was gone.', 'The sheriff brought in search dogs in hopes of tracking her scent, and now, suddenly, it seemed as if half the city had joined was looking Paige.', 'Her parents were amazed to see not just friends, and neighbors, but volunteers from all over the state flock to Grand Junction to look for their missing daughter.', "Frank Birgfeld: So here is the command center ... This is a park. It is fairly close to Paige's house and we have a group that is coming in. It looks like one of the smaller groups.", 'This is difficult, dispiriting work. It is dry and hot in the way the high country sun can scorch in the summertime.', "Paige's children, occupied with god knows what terrors, had their grandparents at least -- for now.", "Paige's 8-year-old daughter even joined the search, decorating search poles for rescuers to use.", 'Even though, by then, searchers were not at all confident that they were looking for a person who was still alive.', "Friends: Suddenly this small quiet town has a tragedy. And you know, it's a mom with three kids that's missing. And so, they want to come help cause they want to get this mom back with her kids or at least give the family closure.", 'Alongside a wind-blown highway outside of town, volunteers spotted bits of paper in among the gravel and the weeds.', 'Had Paige thrown them out of the car? Or was it someone else? Someone trying to get rid of evidence?', 'A search that by now covered hundreds of square miles of high desert around Grand Junction.', "Paige's Parents: You can stand on the front doorstep here, and I believe you can see five miles. And I believe everything happened in that area. ", 'As the weeks passed, search and rescue teams scoured the countryside around Grand Junction looking for the young, beloved mother of three who had suddenly vanished.', 'Paige\'s Parents: And you stand here and you look, and you say, "I know you\'re there. But where?" ', 'They searched on horses, ATVS and on foot, combing through brush land, deserted lots, and the murky Gunnison River running through the canyon floor.', "Frank Birgfield: We've looked in very vast, open areas. We've looked on top of the river, and we've looked under the river. And we have not found her.", "Paige's Parents: I've seen where in a deposition he's admitted he lost over $10 million.", "Paige's Parents: The first big gift was a camera that fits onto helmets. And he gave away -- the paper reported $2.8 million of those cameras. ", "Paige's Parents: And so he was in the paper with frequency because of these fire department matters. He was actually made the News Person of the year.", 'Stanley Hilkey: Yeah, he did have a reputation in Grand Junction, in Mesa County. Colorful character. And certainly was a person that-- she-- one of the nature of anybody being an ex-husband or having that kind of relationship is a person that is included in any kind of investigation like that.', "Besides, as the sheriff soon discovered, Dixon's legal troubles had not been confined to financial issues.", 'To outsiders, Paige and Rob seemed happy. And very successful, living in that spacious new home.', "Paige's Parents: They had a troubled marriage from almost the beginning. I mean Rob is the guy who I think of as kind of a Jekyll and Hyde. ", 'Paige Birgfield: My husband and I were in a fight, and he was supposed to watch my children while I went to work...', "Paige Birgfield: And as I was leaving, he didn't seem to be OK so I said I was just going to take the children with me so he didn't have to deal with it. But he wanted the children to stay with him, and he said that I'd come home and find them all murdered.", 'Dixon was fine, they decided. No threat to the children, or himself or anyone else.', 'Andrea Land: Incidents where her ex-husband was very-- had a very angry temper, easily inflamed by the kids doing normal kid stuff. He would break furniture and break doors.', 'When they finally divorced, Dixon moved clear across the country and Paige got the children, but worried a lot, said her parents, about retaining full custody.', 'Scott Robinson: It was not surprising that she would say bad things about Rob Dixon on her Web site, because she lived in fear that he would come and get custody of the children if the truth about her was made known.', "Scott Robinson: Nothing Paige Dixon said about Rob Dixon was true. In as much as it related to allegations of domestic violence, he didn't do anything to her.", 'Still, why would she tell her parents and friends she worried about keeping him away, and retaining custody of her children?', "Parents Interview: But, certainly, to the degree we didn't know about it, am I surprised I didn't know about it? No. I don't think it's the sort of thing you'd relate.", 'From "soccer mom" to "scarlet letter," the news of Paige Birgfeld\'s secret side hit Grand Junction like a bombshell and created a whole new set of potential suspects.', "Flip through the phone book of any city in America, and you'll find pages of advertisements promising varying degrees of sexual companionship. ", 'But the idea that Paige Birgfeld -- well, she seemed like the least likely candidate for a career in adult entertainment. ', 'But of course there was that big mortgage: the million-dollar house. It must have taken real money to keep that going.', 'But her parents and friends, or, most of her friends say, they had no idea she was financing it with a secret business in topless massages and escort services. Though Jamie Silvernail, who once stayed with Paige, was clearly aware something was going on.', "Jamie Silvernail: This is something that I know she did out of necessity. Paige is a very fun person to be around. Then you're with her you feel like you're the only person in the room. She makes you feel like you've been her best friend and that kind of personality works really well in this industry.", 'Paige\'s Parents: When I get up in the morning I think, "Paige, we\'re coming." And she needs my protection. And I can\'t give it. But we\'re coming as best we can.', "Andrea Land: There was a small judgmental faction of people in town that I would say that just didn't approve, it seemed like the turnout slowed down for a while.", 'Her online ads boasted that "Models Inc." was "The best that Junction had to offer. Dancers, erotic massage, or companionship." ', 'The ad linked to a second adult website, showing her as an escort in Grand Junction named "Carrie."', '"Tired of chopped meat showing up when you ordered filet mignon?" she wrote. "Affluent clients are lavishing in delightful sessions."', 'As "Carrie," Paige made herself available on an "in-call and out-call" basis, anytime, all hours of the day or night.', 'Which of course meant the search for Paige had suddenly gotten much more complicated.', "Stanley Hilkey: We knew that it would add complexity because a lot of escort type businesses or whatever are going to be activities that are kept secret. People don't want other people to know that they're either patrons of a business like that or they're involved in a business like that so, and, that's exactly how it panned out.", 'Just three days before she vanished, a client named "Steve" posted this rave review.', '"Carrie is simply a very gorgeous woman. A little bit pricey... if you have the money, she\'s worth every dime."', "Obviously, said her parents, the adult business came as a shock, but they're trying to understand it from her point of view.", "Paige's Parents: Look, I don't condone that side of things. I don't celebrate that side of things. But just because someone has a need to make ends meet, do I think you can do things just for that reason. But, at the same time, I realize this is a single parent who is trying to do the parent thing, and had a lot of balls in the air, trying to meet those ends. ", 'And her friends? Some say they had a vague idea about the double life Paige was leading, though they insist her activities would have been legal. And careful.', "But to police, the details of what Paige did or didn't do with her clients wasn't so much the issue...", 'The crucial question was this: Did her work, in a business known to be dangerous, lead to foul play and her disappearance?', 'One client? Maybe two? Who were those people? And did they have something to do with the disappearance of Paige Birgfeld?', 'When the news broke that the beautiful young missing mother the whole town had been looking for was a secret escort and erotic masseuse, it put a rather different complexion on things.', "Paige Birgfeld's family and friends felt certain she wasn't selling actual sex, and maybe, they thought, that's what led to whatever happened: a pushy customer wanted more, wouldn't take no for an answer.", "Paige's Parents: If you have a situation where Paige won't cross the line, and you have somebody that's unsatisfied with that, then things can get out of hand.", "In fact, that she'd been freelancing as an exotic dancer since about the time they got married back in the '90s. ", "Sadly, investigators were beginning to believe that Beigler's concerns were valid. ", 'Keith Morrison, Dateline NBC: Is that what lead to the break-up of the marriage?', 'The list of potential suspects was quickly being narrowed to clients. And moving to the top was a 57-year-old R.V. mechanic named Jones.', 'Stanley Hilkey: Lester Ralph Jones. Is the only person that really remains on our radar screen right now.', "Stanley Hilkey: Well, I don't know that we've ever completely disclosed the nature of the relationship. But, that's not hard to connect those dots with regard to her business. And--", "Stanley Hilkey: --where that relationship was going, we don't know exactly the extent of that. ", 'But another local official confirmed that Jones was a client. And that evidence exists to suggest that he may have made one of the last phone calls to Paige before she disappeared. ', "Warrants were obtained. Investigators searched Jones' home. Twice, actually. And...", 'Stanley Hilkey: Well, certainly nothing that gets us where we need to be at this point. There are enormous amounts of evidence, though, that have been submitted to our state crime lab and have yet to come back.', "Keith Morrison: I assume he's denied any responsibility. That would be a fair assumption.", 'Including a five-year sentence for assault and kidnapping involving his ex-wife, and shooting, but missing, her male friend.', 'Dave Duncan: He was a friendly person to be around. When he was at work on my car, he was professional. He fixed what he needed to fix. ', "But then this was years ago. Det. Duncan was called in to investigate those allegations by Jones' ex-wife, a woman named Lisa.", "Dave Duncan: The reports allude to the fact that in the home, Ralph physically restrained Lisa. Lisa, in her statement, calls it kidnapping. They're not minor things. There's firearms involved. The evidence is there, and it's clear.", "Frank Birgfeld: I said I'm aware that you knew my daughter, Paige, who's been missing. Purpose of the letter is to ask you to meet me somewhere, and tell me whatever it is within your knowledge that will help me find her. And never heard from him.", "Stanley Hilkey: Well, Paige Birgfeld's still missing and there's pieces of the puzzle yet that we have yet to find.", "Both of Birgfeld's ex-husbands have alibis that police have checked out. But many in Grand Junction remain suspicious. ", 'After all, Paige had supposedly been afraid of her second ex-husband, Rob Dixon. Remember what she wrote just months before she vanished? ', 'She told us Paige was also afraid of Jones, worried because, as a client, he had taken too deep an interest in her.', 'Carol Linderholm: Lester Jones told me that he had been good friends with Rob Dixon. He stressed that.', 'Scott Robinson: Rob Dixon does not know, did not know and probably will never know Lester Jones.', 'Scott Robinson: Never met him, never knew him. Knew nothing about him, except from the media once Lester Jones emerged as a suspect.', "Stanley Hilkey: We have one person that we just really can't eliminate at this point.", 'That person, Lester Ralph Jones, has hired an attorney who told Dateline that her client is not guilty and not responsible for the disappearance of Paige Birgfeld.', "Keith Morrison: But if you don't find a body, if you don't find Paige, it seems reasonable to think that the person of interest can go on living his life without fear of being prosecuted.", "Stanley Hilkey: I don't think he should go on living his life without fear of being prosecuted.", "Paige's Parents: Look, some of these searchers went to Salt Lake City and searched for Elizabeth Smart. Who in the world would have scripted that, that she ended up with some sort of a knucklehead religious zealot? And yet she walked in perfectly healthy, to the best I can see. Do I think the odds favor that? No. But as long as the odds are there, that's one reason we have always been here at the house waiting for the phone to ring. Waiting for the door to open. On the long-shot odds that somehow that's her story and she'll walk through the door.", "Paige's father is renting an apartment in Grand Junction, where every day -- he continues his search."]
