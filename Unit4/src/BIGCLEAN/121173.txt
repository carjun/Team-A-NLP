['Whether you shop online or at a retail store, you need to do your homework. You want to be sure you are buying a reliable product at a good price.', 'These seven tips should save you time and money and prevent needless aggravation.', 'Check what people are saying on shopping message boards, such as Epinions.com and avsforum.com (for audio & video equipment), plus read reviews posted on online retail sites.', 'Use a few of the many shopping bots to see how much various stores are charging for the item on your list.', 'Some of the better-known bots include: Shopping.com, PriceGrabber, BizRate, DealTime, Shopzilla, Yahoo! Shopping, and mySimon. Remember: The best price is not always listed first. Some retailers pay bots to put them at the top of the results page. If possible, sort the list by price.', 'To download coupons visit: FatWallet, DealTaker, CouponCabin, MyCoupons, Ebates, and Wow-Coupons.', 'Most retailers extend their return and exchange periods for things purchased in November and December. Even then, the time frame differs from store to store, and it also may be different from item to item.', 'In general, return policies are getting more restrictive, especially when it comes to receipts. So keep those receipts. They will prevent headaches.', 'This is important as retailers crack down on fraudulent returns. The person you give the gift to will probably need that receipt to return or exchange it. Without a receipt, the store may only give a credit for the lowest price the item sold for, not the price you paid for it. That could be a substantial difference. A receipt is also needed for warranty service.']
