['            Two friends were an odd couple: one was a man of the cloth, the other never went to church. One died and the other was charged with his murder', 'He took them down to the river, the one that ran past their farms and orchards, that kept the valley alive. And there, as the cleansing waters flowed round them, he baptized them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. This fine, simple man, this charismatic preacher: Pastor Doug.', "Stacey Carlson watched those small Sunday gatherings swell. After a few years, people were driving in from towns miles away to hear Doug's unique preaching, to feel his common touch.", 'And we could leave Doug now, as we could leave the rest of them, confident that God would smile on the little town, its pastor and its remarkably successful community church.', "Doug brought it on himself, of course: It was his boundless enthusiasm that attracted old Frank Craig. It certainly wouldn't have been the preaching. Frank was no fan of religion and didn't care who knew it, either. Ask his relatives...", "Bud Whitney, who's married to Frank's niece Marilyn, was a pastor himself once, but he liked old Frank and had no trouble making room for his disbelief. The two of them often stopped in to visit at the old man's little farm in Hickman.", "And every year that pile grew. That old stuff filled up Frank's living room, and his kitchen and bedroom. There were gadgets, and clocks, and china cabinets and antique furniture. And tractors and trucks spilled out into the backyard, and spread, and grew and rusted all through the 17 acres of frank's farm.", "Roy? That would be one of Frank's brothers, who died in 1998 and left everything he had to Frank. So now, he had a cool $2.5 million.", 'How rich was he? Bud Whitney says Frank boasted once that he was worth $5 million. Enough, surely, to make good on that dream and build his museum.', "And that's how Doug Porter got mixed up with the one man whose soul he couldn't save... He didn't have a clue how to plan or build a museum, either, which is why he called Stacey Carlson, local real estate whiz.", 'So Stacey set up a meeting, at which Frank told her all about his dream of an idea.', 'STACEY CARLSON: And he had envisioned a place where families could come, where the schools could bring young children on a field trip. Basically, he says, "I don\'t want kids to think that milk comes from a milk carton." ', 'STACEY CARLSON: "Now, are you gonna have a problem if we set up, say, a dining room, and, you know, an area that would\'ve been how a family would\'ve been in the late 1800s, with a Bible on the table?" He said, "No, I don\'t have a problem with that." And that\'s when I knew, "Okay, we\'ve got something."', "Seemed like a win-win, as they say: The church could get more space to grow, Frank would get his museum. And that's how a dyed-in-the-wool atheist and a born-again salvation preacher set out on the project of their lives.", "Around Hickman, California, everybody knew their preacher, Doug Porter, could talk the birds out of the trees. Pretty soon, he got the Hickman Community Church Board to sign off on Frank Craig's museum idea. Farm and Christian heritage all there in one building? Why not? So Stacey Carlson found the perfect spot for it, a 14-acre empty lot out behind the old church building.", 'Ah, but you know what they say about best laid plans. As they prepared to enter the construction phase, a little hiccup: Before the county would issue a building permit, certain conditions would have to be met.', 'STACEY CARLSON: One of the conditions was that we had to put in a paved parking lot.', 'It was the fifth of March, 2002. Doug and Frank had set out on yet another research mission, a visit to a tiny museum about 20 miles away. Doug drove, of course, he always did. And maybe it was the weather, or the narrow winding road, but just outside of Hickman... [Sounds of accident]', "Later, Doug told responding officers an oncoming car crossed into his lane, he swerved to avoid it, left the road, and crashed into a tree. Frank wasn't wearing his seat belt. He survived, but only just. His right arm and shoulder were mangled; bones were broken in just about every part of his body. ", 'MICHELLE PITTMAN: Everything was being taken care of, all the trees in his orchard were being taken care of and the irrigation in the fields were being taken care of.', "Frank was laid up for months. You don't heal so fast when you're past 80, and, even when they finally allowed him to go home, he just wasn't the same old independent cuss anymore. In fact, he was so crippled up, he needed help just to get from one room to another in his treasure-cluttered house.", 'As he got stronger, Frank tried, without apparent success, to get progress reports from his partner, the pastor. But instead of hard answers...', 'MICHELLE PITTMAN: Anything that I felt that was negative with what Doug was doing or not doing, he did not want me to confront Doug on anything because he was afraid he would pull out from the program, or the project. ', "But now, Doug was driving Frank's pickup truck. In fact, he drove it all the time now, since the old man couldn't drive anymore. Frank had learned his lesson after that first accident: He wore his seat belt, because a man can never know what might be coming to meet him. And indeed, something was.", "And Doug sure felt awful about what happened to Frank, judging by the letter he wrote to Frank's family: The accident, and the loss of Frank, has been horrific for me, and I know it has been for you, as well. I truly wish that I would have been able to save frank, but that was not to be.", "On the very day of the crash, asFrank's body was still cooling on a slab somewhere, a few of his friends went out and poked around at the spot where the truck went in the water. They didn't like what they saw. Was this really an accident? They shared their sentiments with the sheriff's officers who came to investigate. And detectives, just as a matter of routine, of course, asked the pastor for an interview.", "Doug told the detectives he made his way to the passenger door but couldn't open it. The water was too strong. The truck cab was filling up fast. ", "Doug said he went back to the driver's side window, but had to surface for air twice before he finally pulled Frank out of the truck. ", 'But, by the time he got Frank to dry land and ran to call for help, and then performed CPR, it was too late.', 'So, somewhere in the middle of little Hickman, a wedge came down. Suspicious minds on one side, true believers on the other. ', 'And before long, the gossip leaked out and skipped across the valley to nearby Modesto, specifically to Modesto Bee columnist Jeff Jardine.', "JEFF JARDINE: We had a couple calls, I think, from people who were, you know, had their suspicions about what was going on out there. They knew Frank. They knew Porter. They just didn't like what had had happened. ", 'MARILYN WHITELY: "But I don\'t want you to tell anything because Doug Porter\'s my man. You know, he\'s gonna get this museum done."', 'So now, to their grief and suspicion, they added guilt for not having said something before it was too late...and then, before very long, they were angry, too. ', "The Modesto Bee's Jeff Jardine attended that funeral, too, but, while the Whitneys were furious, Jardine was simply...puzzled.", "These views were not confined only to Frank's family and one curious news columnist.", "So that's why those sheriff's deputies seemed so interested in the accident. It was about the money.", 'DETECTIVE: So I have to ask you directly, did you in any way cause the death of Frank Craig?', "DOUG PORTER: You know, I don't know what they think, but Frank was pretty special to me. I'd just been around me for so long. I changed more diapers. I fed him more. I took him not only all over the country but all over the world.", 'It was a year and a half after the accident in the canal, November, 2005, when church elders placed an ad in the Modesto Bee. Doug Porter has resigned, said the ad, to "protect the church from further negative focus." They asked the community for prayers. Oh, they would need them.', 'JEFF JARDINE: They had come to realize that there was some funny stuff going on with the money.', 'In fact, wondered the D.A., had Frank found out before the second crash here at the canal that Doug was cheating him? That he threatened to expose the pastor? Well, that would ruin his ministry, could even send him to jail...so, as Doug Porter was driving along beside this canal, Frank as his passenger, was he a man loaded with a motive for murder?', "So D.A. Mayne sent investigator Mike Hermosa out to the scene of the accident, the canal near Hickman, and told him to snoop around. Why? To check out Pastor Doug's description of the crash.", 'MIKE HERMOSA: You can see, coming around this turn, he said, he hit the rocks over there, started fish-tailing, went out of control, went into the canal.', 'And to compare it with what he saw out here and the official accident report ... ', "MIKE HERMOSA: The ditch tender for this canal had been by just a short time before and didn't see these rocks.", "MIKE HERMOSA: You don't drive in a canal bank with your window rolled down because the dust from the loose soil just envelops into your car.", 'MIKE HERMOSA: I think that was for two reasons. He knew that water would come into the truck, sink it faster. And also, it was an escape route.', 'Bank accounts that seemed to multiply like the loaves and fishes: Why so many? What was going on?', "But, of course, Frank had given Pastor Doug power of attorney, and thus, the right to set up the accounts and receive the monthly checks from Frank's retirement accounts. Still, what was he doing with that money?", 'MIKE HERMOSA: What he would always do is he would deposit it less cash. So here, he makes a deposit of a check and he takes out $1,000 cash. This was on June 2. June 4, he deposits a check, takes out $200 cash. June 6th, he deposits a check, takes out $1,000 cash. June 24, he makes a deposit and takes $3,000 cash.', 'So imagine the surprise: It was November 2006, and Doug Porter was returning to Hickman from his new church in Mexico. He reached a border checkpoint near San Diego, California, and was met by a welcoming committee with a warrant for his arrest. The charge? First degree murder.', "Around Hickman, California, were more than a few who believed that this time, D.A. John R. Mayne had bitten off more than he could chew. Mayne had charged their popular former pastor with first degree murder, claimed Doug Porter took Frank's money, and then staged an accident to kill the old atheist.", "But surely not the Doug Porter Hickman knew so well: After all, Doug had been a star athlete, a popular coach, a loved pastor. He'd simply tried to help an old man realize a lifelong dream to build a museum. And now, here he was, hauled into court like a con man and a murderer.", "KEITH MORRISON: Couldn't there have been some other explanation than design to hide?", "And that's why the D.A. gave a forensic accountant center stage at the trial of Pastor Doug.", "Frank's fate was sealed when he threatened to expose the pastor's scam, or so said the D.A. to the jury. And how could jurors know that happened? The D.A. called a witness named Paul Harvey, a local phone technician and friend to both men. This, said Harvey, was his conversation with Frank, not long after the old man learned the truth:", 'PAUL HARVEY: He said, "No. Doug\'s still my friend and I don\'t want him to go to jail." He says, "I got myself into this mess and I\'ll get myself out of it." ', 'PAUL HARVEY: He said he was going to confront Porter, and he said that it was called a revocable trust and he was going to revoke it.', 'PAUL HARVEY: I said, "Well, Frank, whatever you do, don\'t get in a car with him." And he laughed and he said okay. He says, "Okay, I won\'t get in a car with him," and he says, "And if anything happens to me," he says, "Then you, Mr. Harvey will have to see to justice."', 'The jury, made up of the good, regular folk of Stanislaus County, was given four charges to contemplate, from theft from an elder by a caretaker, to first degree murder. They were back in less than a day: Guilty on all counts. The sentence: life, without parole.', "JOHN MAYNE: Evil is not that sophisticated. Evil is not that smart. And Doug Porter was an evil man. He took the man's money. He took the man's health. He took the man's life.", "Around Hickman, Doug Porter has supporters still, though Stacey Carlson is one of the few who'll talk now about the town's opinion divide...Pastor Doug, a murderer? Not a chance, she says.", 'KEITH MORRISON: I was gonna say, this has not exactly welded the community together?', "And if he's right about eternal judgments? Maybe he'll meet old Frank again one day.", 'Somewhere in the middle of little Hickman, a wedge came down: Suspicious minds on one side, true believers on the other. ', 'Frank Craig had been dreaming about building a museum his whole life: a place where kids could learn what farm life was like back when he was a boy.

Whitney says Craig boasted once that he was worth $5 million. Enough, surely, to make good on his dream and build his museum.', "Doug Porter and Frank Craig were in a car accident on March 5, 2002.

Craig had the money for it, of course, thanks to that big inheritance from his brother. He was also, apparently, having the time of his life. And his partnership with Pastor Doug not only survived his salty language and his unshakable atheism, it strengthened. It evolved. It bloomed.', 'Paul Harvey is a local phone technician and a friend to both Craig and the pastor: "I said, \'Well, Frank, whatever you do, don\'t get in a car with him.\' And he laughed and he said okay.
