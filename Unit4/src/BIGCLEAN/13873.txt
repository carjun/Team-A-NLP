['        Deborah Banigan of Pleasanton, Calif., considers herself a relatively experienced consumer, having bought, sold and refinanced several homes over the past 18 years. Two years ago, she signed up for an adjustable-rate mortgage that gave her the option for a lower payment, which she expected to carry for a year or so before converting back to a fixed rate. ', '"Many mortgage advertisers are making potentially deceptive claims about incredibly low rates and payments, without telling consumers the whole story," said Lydia Parnes, director of the FTC\'s Bureau of Consumer Protection. ', 'Those claims are central to an ongoing debate on Capitol Hill about whether the federal government should step in to help some borrowers now facing foreclosures who were the victims of predatory lending practices. On Monday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed allowing two government-sponsored mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to take a bigger share of the home loan market to help stabilize the troubled mortgage industry. ', 'Some marketing pitches rely heavily on the financial benefits of these products. But emphasizing only the advantages of a loan is unacceptable, according to Lucy Morris, an FTC attorney working on the deceptive ads investigation. ', 'The FTC would not identify the companies under review. So far, the probe into deceptive mortgage advertising has produced only warning letters, said Morris. As a result of the review, the FTC could decide to bring civil actions, she said. ', 'As a result of the reports of subprime lending abuses, the record pace of foreclosures and the recent panic that swept the credit markets, funding for these unconventional loans has all but dried up. While that may reduce the risk of new borrowers getting stuck with them, some mortgage brokers and lenders continue to advertise terms that appear to good to be true.']
