["If Woods does win he may have the third round to thank for it. He's blown up on the weekend in recent majors, including a 76 in the third round that knocked him from contention in the U.S. Open. But he was steady on a brutal course for the most part on Saturday, even taking the lead with a birdie on the second hole, before finishing with a 1-over 72 that left him tied for second with Mahan, two shots back.", "It helps that he seldom has to pull his often erratic driver out of the bag on the fast links course. A lot of the success he has had over three days has come using irons off the tee and then hitting shots into safe parts of the green. It's a formula that works under tough conditions, and its put Woods into his best position going into the final round since he came back from the scandal.", "Whether it will work on Sunday depends a lot on how the man playing behind him is doing. Westwood says he feels no pressure and he's playing like it. When he did make mistakes in the third round he simply smiled and went about his business, and with 38 wins around the world he's not likely to be intimidated by the thought of Woods chasing him.", 'Woods insists he enjoys it too, his outburst on No. 7 notwithstanding. Being in the hunt on Sunday is what he lives for as a golfer, and being able to deliver under pressure is something he prides himself on.', "Still, he's badly in need of a major win to jumpstart his chase of the record of 18 held by Jack Nicklaus. If he doesn't win here or at the PGA Championship next month, his drought in the majors would be nearing six years.", 'Tim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.
