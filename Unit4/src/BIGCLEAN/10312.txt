['        Auto industry executives came to Capitol Hill recently asking for a bailout, only to leave empty-handed. ', 'General Motors says that without federal assistance, it could be out of cash by the summer of 2009. If that happens, the company faces bankruptcy: either Chapter 11, which would allow reorganization and a chance at survival, or Chapter 7, meaning complete liquidation. Execs from Ford and Chrysler joined GM CEO Richard Wagoner in his appeal to Congress for help, saying they also face possible insolvency.', 'Greg Chaney, Manager, Chacon Autos, Dallas-based owners of eight automotive dealerships: I believe that the U.S. auto industry needs some sort of help. There are quite a few things that have come together to create a perfect storm that could put them out of business. If there is to be a bailout, I think there should certainly be strings attached, as the status quo is not working. They must present some sort of business plan to a board created by the government prior to any money being lent. We should limit what the money could be used for. It should not be used for increased dividends, executive bonuses, stock buy-backs, and only used to acquire another company if approved by the board. I think a heavy emphasis should be put on new alternate fuel vehicles or high fuel efficiency vehicles. And they should improve the quality of their fleet of passenger cars.', "Roger Layne, CEO, East Tech Company, a Chattanooga, Tenn.-based maker of high-tech machinery for the automotive and construction industries: I agree with the bailout. I don't think there is another option.", 'Jeff Probst, CEO, Blue Sun Energy, a Golden, Colo.-based integrated agricultural-energy company that makes biodiesel: It is important that the automakers are not given a bailout, but rather a loan that needs to be repaid. When the banking system is not there with credit, the government may have to be the lender. Tough loan terms will motivate the Big Three to do what they must to repay the loan.', 'What impact would the collapse or bankruptcy of one of the Big Three have on your business?', 'Greg Chaney: We would most likely see much less of a demand for their vehicles. We would be wary of selling or buying any vehicles from that manufacturer, and we would most likely shift much of our inventory to the more stable companies and to the imports.', 'Ken Murer: A total collapse would be catastrophic for all the dealers that have invested all their time and energy in building a nice business. And they are powerless to make changes at the factory.', "Andre Gist: It would have an effect on me because a lot of my suppliers will be tied up, if not shut down if they cannot be paid. The banks may also decide to cut out of current financing if they're concerned about getting their money back. The banks could shut us all down if they get nervous.", 'Roger Layne: The impact would not directly affect East Tech. Indirectly, it creates a larger work force unemployed and that may spread further panic among Americans already afraid to spend money. We are cutting back on everything we can.', 'Jeff Probst: A collapse would negatively impact the economy, and indirectly via a weaker economy, our business. Since our biodiesel fuel can run in any diesel, however, having a particular brand or model of vehicle is not required.', 'There are a wide variety of theories about how the Big Three reached this point: expensive union benefits, stagnation and a lack of innovation, foreign competition. What do you think?', "Greg Chaney: I think there is plenty of blame to go around: the management, the unions, and bad timing of this economic mess. For years the Big Three have relied heavily on and became complacent with the sale of trucks and SUV's, because that's where the money was. Consequently, their innovation, quality, and development of passenger cars suffered. Now that people want passenger cars because of lower prices and better fuel economy, the Big Three are caught off guard. Additionally, their cost structures are terrible. With so many expenses under the previous union contracts, retirement health care, and other labor costs I think it is a miracle they have been able to make it this far. If we had that type of labor relationship and costs at our business we would have been forced to shut down long ago.", 'Andre Gist: All of the Big Three have small vehicles today. The problem is, not enough of us want them. Americans seem to love larger cars and trucks. They have not tried hard enough to make SUVs and trucks get over 30 miles per gallon, or 40 to 50.', 'Roger Layne: I think the unions are a big part of the problem. If production slows down at a Big Three plant, unemployed workers still receive full pay and benefits. No one in the private sector can afford this. I think retiree benefits are draining the companies of cash. Unions pick one of the Big Three at contract time to consider striking, to finalize their demands. If the unions joined together, they could shut down the Big Three. All foreign automakers manufacturing in the United States are profitable. None of these plants have unions.', 'Jeff Probst: The Big Three need to innovate. Consumers are demanding more fuel efficient and environmentally responsible cars while maintaining performance. This includes more energy efficient solutions.']
