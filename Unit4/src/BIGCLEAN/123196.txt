It was she who took the call reporting that Michele was missing first thing Sept. 12.', 'Sue Mulvey: I sent two investigators over to talk to Calvin Harris. And I sent a uniformed trooper up to the house.', 'Cal Harris met the investigators at his car dealership, took them back to his house opened it up to them.', 'Sue Mulvey: We kept hoping as everyone did that Michele would call her attorney or call her house or call one of her friends and show up.

All right --now it\'s time for me to pick them up. If this is the routine that is normal for them, we\'re gonna keep them in that routine.', "Sue Mulvey: That area was homesteaded heavily in the 1800's. So there's a lot of laid-up wells and old foundations and things like that. ", 'Investigator Steve Andersen: I-- entered the residence through the open garage door.

Minute amounts, under paint chips and lodged in scratches. ', "Investigator Steve Andersen: Everything on the floor, on the inside walls, and on the carpet came back to being Michele's blood.", "Instead of a missing person case, investigators knew they were now looking at a possible homicide. But usually in homicides there's a body. Or a murder weapon, or at least a motive. Who in the world would want to kill Michele Harris?", 'Sue Mulvey: He had made statements to her that he would kill her, he would never be prosecuted and her body would never be found.', 'Sue Mulvey: The clear picture that we developed is that Michele would never leave her children ever. Ever.', 'Sue Mulvey: They have what would appear to be an idyllic life and a beautiful home and beautiful children.', 'Gary Taylor: She was bubbly. She was my best audience. I could say anything. And her and my niece would laugh and --', 'Gary Taylor: He won some dealership thing and they went to Switzerland, I think.', "Gary Taylor: Yeah.

Once, back in 1996, she called her sister-in law from a closet, terrified.', 'Gary Taylor: He was out there with a pump gun. I guess. And he was racking the pump action up and down. And telling her to come out. ', "Still, she began to take notes about what she said was his abusive behavior -- when he called her names, when he got physical. She removed his guns from the house, took them to her brother's place. She won a temporary order of protection against him. And despite the unpleasantness, negotiated for a settlement. Made plans to buy a house in town . Move with the kids.

He told her that he would put her body in a place where it would never be found.

Didn't ask her to describe what she'd seen. ", "Gerald Keene: Doesn't ask her any questions about the keys like he knows that the keys are in the van already.", "Gerald Keene: Yeah, you're right. But it's all these hundreds of little things that convinced me that he's just not acting like someone would act if they didn't know what had happened to their wife.", "Sue Mulvey: He seemed kind of unconcerned. He was more concerned about getting Michele's van cleaned up and putting it back on the lot. ", "One more note about Cal's behavior that struck the prosecutor as passing strange. Something for the jury to ponder.", 'Gerald Keene: He never contacted a single person at any time to either advise them that Michelle was missing or to ask if they had heard anything from Michelle, other than his attorney.', 'Steve Andersen: I think it could very well have been the most important part of the case as far as placing Michele -- bleeding in the house, with some force having been applied to that blood and no explanation for it.', "Maybe so. Or maybe not. Remember, it wasn't discovered for several days after Michele disappeared.", 'Keith Morrison: I can see a good defense attorney having a field day with the fact that your guys, the cops, were walking all over the blood in the garage for days.', 'Gerald Keene: They walked through the garage, but there was no testimony from anyone in the case that the scene was altered in any way.', 'Gerald Keene: She got home that night at about 11:30 and as soon as she got inside the house, she was struck with something by the defendant.

The date Michele Harris disappeared -- and the date he says he saw her.", "Gary Taylor: Everybody knew he was lying. You know, I mean, It was the most bizarre story that you could've ever told.", 'Bill Easton: Our theory was that Michele ran into someone and the crime that occurred far away from Hadadorn Hill.', 'Now all the defense attorneys had to do was convince twelve jurors that they were right. ', "Cal Harris devoted himself to his kids -- and his game, lacrosse. He coached a local team, the ten and under crowd. Jackie Casella's son was a member.", 'Jackie Casella: He was always encouraging to those kids even when they were struggling. He was like, "Good try."

The defense theory was that she was killed at the end of the driveway or abducted there and killed later. ', "BillEaston: We gotta understand that he was immediately under suspicion. He really couldn't have participated in the search. ", 'Merry Harris: There were dozens, maybe hundreds of experts scouring the area looking for her. And there was one person taking care of these four kids.', "Which explains why he wasn't notifying friends about Michele's disappearance. Merry says she didn't even get a call from him.", 'Merry Harris: Just because I think he was taking care of the kids. And taking it like one breath at a time.

Wouldn't have known where to call.", 'Keith Morrison: Did he make an assumption that she was away somewhere with her boyfriend?', 'BillEaston: She had indicated to numerous people she was happy with the settlement.', 'Merry Harris: There was plenty of money to go around. And no amount of money would have made Cal say, "Aha, for 2 million I\'m just gonna wipe her out."', "But Cal's side does concede there were money issues between husband and wife in the final months. Issues of a different kind.", 'Merry Harris: I think, frankly, that Cal may have had some real concerns about where the money was going. ', "Merry Harris: He was afraid that she was getting into you know drinking too much, possibly using drugs. That you know money was kind of flying out the door. What's going on here? ", "BillEaston: Her lifestyle did change over the last year. She intersected with a variety of people that she had never intersected with before. And it's our position that one of these people committed this crime. ", 'Keith Morrison: Are you satisfied with the amount of forensic work that was done on those gentlemen she was drinking with at the bar or her boyfriend or those kinda people? Was there any particular concern you had about that? ', 'BillEaston: Oh yes. I mean, they focused immediately on Cal Harris. And their investigative focus diverted them from doing any type of thorough forensic investigation.', "And then there was Kevin Tubbs. The star witness. Remember, he said he'd seen a woman he believed to be Michele Harris with a young man hours after the prosecutor said she was already dead. ", 'BillEaston: He has no motive to fabricate this. He saw a pickup truck and he saw a man and a woman on that road. ', 'Keith Morrison: Okay, but an inconvenient bit here is that the blood spatter was this medium velocity spatter, The sorta thing that happens when somebody whacks you beside the head.', "BillEaston: No one can say it was definitively wiped up. That's a theory. There's a small amount of diluted blood which was found days after. The New York state police had walked through this particular area of the house while they were conducting the search.", "Keith Morrison: Yeah, but walking on it's not gonna destroy the blood cells. They can --", "Al Umber, juror: I mean, it's hard not having a body and not having a murder weapon.", 'Merry Harris: the second trial I really decided I\'m not gonna be optimi--you know until I hear "Not guilty." I\'m not making any judgments about anything. ', 'Inside the jury room, 12 men and women were methodically going through key points.

You know, this is either going to make or break the case.', "Al Umber: I mean, they didn't offer any explanation whatsoever, where that blood came from. And it was only her blood.

Cal did not commit this crime. Let me repeat that a third time, Cal did not commit this crime.

One, a jury says, has only himself to blame for his broken family.', "Merry Harris: He's always felt that it was extremely important for him to be strong for the kids.
