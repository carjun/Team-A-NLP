['        Car buyers always consider price. But these days fuel economy is also high up on the list. High gas prices are driving sales of more fuel-efficient models. ', 'Caldwell says we may see fewer small car sales reported for May and June because of the limited supply of some small cars coming from Japan. That drop in production has resulted in higher prices and fewer incentives. For example, a new Honda Civic has gone up more than $1,600 since March. But Caldwell strongly believes the demand for fuel-efficient vehicles will continue as long as gas prices are high. ', 'Automakers have seen the shift in demand and are responding. The New York Times reported this week that Ford recently converted a former SUV plant to build small hybrids and electric vehicles. General Motors will soon build its first subcompact model in the U.S. ', 'Americans have already made various lifestyle changes because of higher gas prices. Some are going out to eat less often. Others have scaled back on vacation plans. The pain at the pump has also changed driving habits. A new report by AAAshows 15 percent of the adults surveyed use public transportation more often, 21 percent have carpooled and 27 percent have walked or ridden a bike instead of driving. ', 'Two thirds of the vehicle owners (65 percent) surveyed said they drive less than 40 miles a day. That makes them candidates for a plug-in hybrid or electric car. But most of those responding (75 percent) said if they bought a new vehicle they would be looking for a conventional gasoline engine.', '* Overall, 67 percent of consumers plan to use the Internet to help with their next car purchase. ', '* Half of consumers currently log the same number of miles per day as they did one year ago, while one third drive less and 15% said they drive more.', 'When Consumer Reports tests a new vehicle, it also measures fuel economy. The number of recommended models that also deliver great gas mileage continues to grow. Here are a few of the top-rated models in various categories.', 'Hyundai Elantra: This compact gets an impressive 29 miles per gallon. And with a sticker price at around $18,000, the magazine calls it a bargain compared to most vehicles.', 'Nissan Altima: This sedan gets 26 miles per gallon and is roomy enough to fit five comfortably. The hybrid version gets 32 mpg.', 'Toyota Highlander Hybrid: This SUV stands out from the crowd, getting 27 miles per gallon. But its sticker price is almost $50,000.', "Subaru Outback: It's more of station wagon than an SUV, but it gets 24 miles per gallon, has all-wheel drive and a really roomy back seat.", '   Want to keep up with the latest on consumer news, follow the  ConsumerMan on Facebook . ', "Buick Regal? Isn't that the official car of Florida's early bird specials? Are the seats made so the driver isn't visible from the car behind? This may have been true enough for the old Regal, but no more. The sleek, racy new Regal looks like nothing that would have graced Buick showroom just a few years ago. But two things have changed that. First was Buick's rise in China, where the brand is a top seller and the Regal is seen as a crucial ingredient to General Motors' ongoing success in the market. The other thing that happened was that the Saturn brand was shuttered in the GM bankruptcy, leaving GM with a model that had been planned for the Saturn division that was all dressed up with no place to go. So it became a Buick.", 'OK, there was not an old Chevy Cruze for the new one to improve upon. But the Cruze replaced the Cobalt, which had some sound fundamentals, but was poorly executed and detailed. The new car enjoys a much bigger budget, as GM splurged on some nice cabin appointments so that the interior approaches within shouting distance of luxurious rather than living directly in downtown heinous. The Cruze is also sturdily constructed using large amounts of high-strength steel to eliminate the kinds of wobbles and rattles that have long plagued domestic economy models. And Chevy spared no expense outfitting the Cruz with safety equipment, making it a vastly superior option for young drivers.', "This one-time darling of suburbia had fallen on hard times, as consumers turned their backs on truck-derived SUVs in favor of jacked-up station wagons. Still, the name held some equity, so while the crossover SUV Ford Freestyle and Taurus X flopped in the showroom, the thinking was that the Explorer name could attract buyers if it were a crossover. That guess has proved correct, as Ford is selling Explorers as fast as it can build them. The Explorer isn't just an improvement on the old trucky model, it is also an improvement on the Taurus X, the vehicle from which the new Explorer was derived. In an instance of less being more, a new Explorer based on the old Taurus X replaces both of those models and is more popular than they were combined.", 'The new Kia Sorento is a sleek, stylish crossover SUV that has been winning plaudits from reviewers and now for 2012 it gains the super-efficient corporate 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine which boosts its fuel economy and performance. ', 'Sporty turbocharged and thrifty hybrid models are also available, helping Kia press its assault on a market where it has been largely overlooked for years.', 'The Jeep Grand Cherokee suffered during the years when the Jeep brand was controlled by then-DaimlerChrysler. Now that the company has split from the Germans and aligned itself with Fiat, the result has been, incredible as it may seem, a gigantic improvement. The old Grand Cherokee was as capable off-road as ever, but budget pressures robbed its once-luxurious cabin of premium materials, leaving it awash in hard, shiny plastics worthy of, well, Kias of the past.
