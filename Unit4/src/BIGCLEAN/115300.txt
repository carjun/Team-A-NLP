Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the committee, said Pillard's nomination wasn't necessary because the D.C. circuit doesn't have enough work to justify filling its three vacancies.", '"An objective review of the caseloads reveals that the D.C. circuit is very low," Grassley said. "And it raises serious doubts regarding whether we need more than eight active judges on that court.  There is no question in my mind that the statistics make clear that the D.C. circuit does not need any additional judges."', '        President Barack Obama used the Port of Jacksonville as a backdrop for his latest economic policy speech, using an infrastructure project there to illustrate his call for greater investment in similar projects.', "    Boehner whacks King again, says comments make immigration progress 'more difficult'", 'Grassley said he recently sent letters to members of the D.C. circuit asking about their workload and was surprised when one judge told him if there were more appointments, "there wouldn\'t be enough work to go around."', "Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Republican objections are misleading and politically motivated. He said GOP senators were coming with arguments for denying confirmation for Obama's appeals court nominees that they didn't raise when former Republican President George W. Bush's appellate nominations were at stake.", '"I would hope that President Obama is not going to be held to a different standard as if, somehow, he\'s different than President Bush," Leahy said.', 'Obama announced Pillard\'s nomination in a Rose Garden ceremony last month along with nominations for Patricia Millett and U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins to the D.C. Circuit appeal court. "There\'s no reason, aside from politics, for Republicans to block these individuals from getting an up-or-down vote," he said at the time.', "The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet again on Thursday morning and may vote on whether to send the nomination of Millet for a full Senate vote. At a hearing earlier this month, Republicans voiced similar concerns about the court's workload.", 'The D.C. circuit has 11 judgeships authorized by Congress. Republicans have proposed moving two of the vacant seats to other circuits with larger caseloads and eliminating the third seat altogether.', ' Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
