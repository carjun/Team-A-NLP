['        Overseas con artists are sending billions of dollars worth of counterfeit checks and money orders to the United States. They are using these high-quality forgeries to steal a staggering amount of money from unsuspecting victims.', 'These bogus checks are used to buy things, from furniture to used cars, advertised in newspaper and online classified ads. They are also used to rent apartments. Fake checks are now part of work-at-home schemes and contest scams.', 'U.S. postal inspectors are working with law enforcement agencies in other countries to break up the international crime rings that run these check scams. Between January and August of this year, they seized more than a half-million counterfeit checks worth $2.1 billion dollars headed to the U.S. from Nigeria, the Netherlands, England, and Canada. As part of this global crackdown 77 people have been arrested. But the counterfeit checks keep coming.', 'Parker waited a few days after depositing the check before she wired back the bulk of the check, $21,000, as instructed. She called the bank and was told the check had cleared.', 'About 10 days later, Parker got a call from the bank telling her the $25,000 check was bad and the deposit was being reversed. She had to replace the missing funds.', 'A few days after depositing the check, they get a call or e-mail saying they have won another prize. But this time they must send some money to cover shipping or taxes. It is easy to assume this is legitimate, since the money from the prize check is already in their account.', 'When the check or money order bounces, the bank comes after the victim to replace those missing funds. For some people that means taking out a loan to pay back the bank. I spoke to a woman who had her car repossessed to cover the bad money orders she cashed. In some cases, customers are being sued by their bank.', 'There are also cases where victims of this scam are arrested and prosecuted for check fraud because it looks like they are trying to pass bad checks.', 'No matter what story accompanies the check, the con artist is usually overseas and always wants some money wired to him or one of his associates right away.', 'The bottom line: Avoid any transaction that involves a check or money order where you are required to wire back any money. There is no legitimate reason for that. ']
