Edward snowden left hong kong. What went wrong. We\'ll talk to the four-star general who runs the world\'s biggest intelligence service. They provided critical leads torevent 50 terrorist events. At the heart of the domestic surveillance controversy -- they told us they weren\'t collecting data on american citizens. It was a lie. And alexander, his first ever and only sunday interview. A this week exclusive. The round table on the politics, from the president overseas -- complacency is not the character of great nations. To that trench warfare in congress. Fundamental disagreements on so many things. Turned a bipartisan bill into a partisan bill. America\'s youngest congresswoman is a combat veteran. She\'s in the spotlight. And we begin with the breaking news. Edward snowden, the 30-year-old government contractor who escaped to hong kong with a treasure-trove of america\'s top secrets is on the move. Landing in moscow on his way to venezuela seeking asylum. And the question for u.S. Officials, how did this fugitive slip away ag let\'s get to the latest with pierre tho the u.S. Is working with hong kong to bring snowden to the united states, but the hong kong government said today that the u.S. Request did not fully comply with hong kong law. What went wrong? Reporter: It\'s a game of cat and mouse, and the u.S. Lost this round. A senior u.S. Official said the u.S. Government was expecting a lengthy process. They were anticipating a lot of back and forth with hong kong authorities before nay got this resolved. Clearly he took full advantage of the fact that the wheels turn slow, he got out of there because there was nothing to hold him. That was not a faulty request from the u.S. Government? He\'s claiming that the processes take a long time, there\'s back and forth. And again, while they\'re trying to resolve this, there was nothing to hold snowden. Is there anything they can do to stop snowden now while he\'s in moscow waiting for the flight to venezuela? George, it does not look like there\'s much the u.S. Govent can do at this point. Snowden appears to be bound for countries that have a combative relationship with the u.S. How did this happen? What do u.S. Officials say? How get out of hawaii and into hong kong and away again? A big issue here is the fact that when thrmation was taken, allegedly taken by snowden, there was no blinking flag to let the u.S. Government know that the information was taken. He was able to move freely before they knew what happened. He is being accompanied by a representative of wikileaks. They are trying to get him to safety. Well, based on statements from officials today, they helped him leave hong kong and may be traveling with him. At some point, the u.S. Is going to have to resolve if wikileaks are journalists or an enemy of the state. Officials say they are aiding and abetting someone who may ', '\t\t\t\t\t    This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.', '\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGuests: Joaquin Castro, Mike Kelly, Rebecca Jarvis, Steven Rattner, Amity Shlaes', '\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe National Security Agency director on Edward Snowden and NSA surveillance programs.', '\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe National Security Agency director on Edward Snowden and NSA surveillance programs.', '\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe youngest woman in Congress and Iraq War veteran on the role of women in combat.']
