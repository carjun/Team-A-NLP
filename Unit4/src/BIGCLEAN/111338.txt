['Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, center, joined by Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., left, opens the first meeting of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, often called the "supercommittee", on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Sept. 8, 2011. ', 'Tax reform as well as cuts to benefit programs such as Social Security and Medicare will be among the options considered, members of the so-called supercommittee emphasized, although no specific proposals were debated at an opening session than ran scarcely an hour. ', 'While they readily acknowledged numerous obstacles to a deal, committee members said it was essential to try at a time the economy is weak, joblessness is high and the country gives every sign of intense frustration with its elected leaders. ', 'Compromise "is the difference between a divided government that works for the country and a dysfunctional government that doesn\'t," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the last of a dozen members to speak.', '        President Barack Obama used the Port of Jacksonville as a backdrop for his latest economic policy speech, using an infrastructure project there to illustrate his call for greater investment in similar projects.', "    Boehner whacks King again, says comments make immigration progress 'more difficult'", 'The committee, three members from each party in each house, faces a deadline of Nov. 23. Its most consequential sessions are expected to take place in closed door sessions that will give President Barack Obama and congressional leaders from both parties the opportunity to influence the outcome. ', 'Ironically, the committee owes its existence to earlier failed attempts at sweeping deficit-cutting compromises, most recently an abortive negotiation between Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ', 'Their talks collapsed over the summer, at a time Republicans were demanding deficit cuts in exchange for passage of legislation to raise the debt limit and prevent a first-ever government default. ', 'In the end, the two sides agreed to increase the debt limit by enough to let the Treasury pay its bills through 2012 while also cutting $1 trillion over a decade from one category of government programs.', "It was a significant sum, but far less than the White House and some Republicans had been hoping for. Nor did it change the tax code or significantly affect Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, farm programs and other costly benefit programs than many lawmakers say must be part of any attempt to slow and ultimately reduce the nation's debt. ", 'That is particularly true of Republicans, although Democrats are largely unwilling to go along unless their GOP counterparts will agree to higher revenues at the same time. ', '"I approach our task with a profound sense of urgency, high hopes, and realistic expectations," Hensarling said as he gaveled the session to order. He said the task "will not be easy, but it is essential," and said the panel "must be primarily about saving and reforming social safety net programs that are not only failing many beneficiaries but going broke at the same time." ', 'A fellow Republican, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, added another item to the agenda moments later, speaking of "wasteful tax subsidies" that should be eliminated and calling for changes that can turn the tax code into an engine for more economic growth. ', '"When huge, iconic American corporations can pay little or no income tax, well that\'s indefensible," he said. "So I think we ought to wipe out those special interest favors, have commensurately lower rates, encourage the economic growth that will generate more revenues, generate more jobs." ', 'Among Democrats, Murray stressed the importance of compromise, saying that in meetings with constituents last month, they "asked why it was that every time they turn on their televisions, they hear about more political battling, more partisan rancor_but nothing more being done for people like them."', 'She added pointedly that she was pleased that other members of the panel "have refrained from drawing in the sand or carving out areas that can\'t be touched" as part of any deal. ', 'The committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing next week at which Douglas Elmendorf, head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office, is expected to explain the forces that have driven the annual deficits into the $1 trillion-plus range, and left the country with a debt of $14 trillion. ', 'The legislation that created the committee also approved a $400 billion debt limit increase, and permitted Obama to request yet another another $500 billion increase, with an option for Congress to block it. An attempt to do so was expected in the Senate Thursday evening. ', 'If the committee fails to produce a 10-year package of cuts of at least $1.2 trillion, across-the-board spending cuts would take place that would and simultaneously allow the president to seek another increase in the federal debt limit of the same size. ', 'On the other hand, any agreement on cuts totaling up to $1.5 trillion that are approved by both houses of Congress would permit Obama to request a dollar-for-dollar rise in the debt limit. There is no upper limit to the amount of deficit reductions the panel can recommend. ', 'The committee proceedings were briefly interrupted by demonstrators who shouted "Jobs Now!" in a hallway outside the room. The group dispersed after police threatened them with arrest.', 'This 12-member panel is tasked with finding $1.5 trillion more in debt savings. It has until Nov. 23 to propose ways to reduce deficits. Those proposals must be voted on by Dec. 23. ', 'Toomey worked on Wall Street in the 1980s and as a restaurateur in Allentown, Pa., then served in the House for three terms. In 2004, he challenged Sen. Arlen Specter, who was then a Republican, in a primary, losing by less than 2 percentage points. ', 'After heading the anti-tax group Club for Growth, Toomey returned to Pennsylvania in 2010 and won the Senate nomination, Specter having left the Republican Party. Toomey won the general election by 2 percentage points over Democrat Joe Sestak, partly by attacking him for voting for the 2008 Wall Street bailout. ', 'Although a first-term senator, Portman has worked in Washington, on and off, since his days as a lawyer for an influential Washington lobbying firm in the 1980s and then as associate White House counsel and congressional liaison for President George H. W. Bush, starting in 1989. He served seven terms in the House, beginning in 1993, and then did stints under President George W. Bush as U.S. Trade Representative and as budget director. ', 'Although rarely seen on television and not given to flamboyant speechmaking, Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is one of the most powerful people in Washington. His first job in Washington was in 1967 as an attorney for a now-defunct federal agency, the Civil Aeronautics Board. Baucus won a House seat in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal and was elected to the Senate in 1978. ', 'Neither flashy, nor particularly charismatic, Camp is a wonkish, detail-oriented legislator. He voted for the 2008 financial sector bailout and the auto industry bailout, but is staunchly conservative on most issues. President Barack Obama carried his Michigan district with 50 percent of the vote in the 2008 election.', 'Elected in 1992, Becerra represents a district in Los Angeles which President Obama won in 2008 with 80 percent of the vote. He serves on the House Ways & Means Committee, and also served on the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission, but voted against its recommendations, complaining that the deficit and debt had been created mostly by President Bush and Republicans in Congress.
