['  Pichi Chuang / Reuters People visit the Microsoft booth at the 2013 Computex exhibition at the TWTC Nangang exhibition hall in Taipei on June 4.  SEATTLE - Microsoft said it would open 500 special  stores within existing Best Buy stores in the United States selling  exclusively Windows-based tablets and computers and other Microsoft products in  an effort to revitalize sales of its flagship operating system.The world\'s largest software company, which already has a chain of 70 or so  of its own Microsoft Stores and kiosks within shopping malls, said on Thursday  the initiative would add more than 1,200 Best Buy Microsoft-trained sales  associates to help customers.Microsoft\'s new Windows 8 operating system has sold more than 100 million  copies since launch in October, but sales of new tablets and PCs running the  software, and its own Surface tablet, have not been as strong as it hoped. An  updated version called Windows 8.1 is scheduled for release later this year.Part of the problem has been that Microsoft has struggled to get the  attention of shoppers at large retailers such as Best Buy due to the profusion  and popularity of Apple\'s iPad and tablets running Google\'s Android  system.The new store-within-a-store approach "offers a large-scale, hands-on  customer experience" of Microsoft products, said Tami Reller, head of marketing  at Microsoft\'s Windows unit.Microsoft\'s plan comes just two months after Samsung Electronics also  unveiled plans to install its brand shops in more than 1,400 Best Buy stores  this year.The store-within-a-store effort is a key plank of Best Buy\'s turnaround plan,  which includes dedicating more space to more-profitable products like tablets  and mobile phones.Best Buy, the world\'s largest consumer electronics chain, has also been  trying to use its clout with suppliers to fight online and discount rivals and  boost in-store traffic, sales and profitability.']
