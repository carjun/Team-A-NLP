['        Here are eyewitness accounts from msnbc.com readers who report feeling the 5.4 magnitude earthquake in Southern California:', "Hello my name is Caroline and I'm 16 yrs old and I live in La Habra, CA which is not that far from Chino Hills. We were effected very much. Our whole house shook and pictures fell down. All the cell phones in La Habra are down and landlines are working. The Internet is working too. I have heard that a brick building has fallen down in Whittier.", 'I was washing bottles and it felt like something under my feet and that is when my 4yr old Abby and Josh, 2, ran to me as I grabbed the 5-month-old and stood under a doorway. After like 5 minutes I still felt my body shaking. But the crazy thing is looking out of the window at people running out of their apartments.', "At work in Irvine- Orange County, right next to John Wayne Airport. It was very strong and long. Didn't seem to come from any one direction- more like shaking jell. Haven't felt any aftershocks yet.", 'We are in a 1-story cement office building located in Oxnard, CA (93030). The earthquake felt pretty strong here. There was no damage to property or injuries to anyone that we know of. It was a rolling feeling and it lasted for quite a few seconds. The light posts outside on the curb were swaying. I was on the phone with someone in Santa Clarita, CA and they felt it pretty strong as well. No damage or injuries were reported by them. Phone lines (land lines and cell phones) were down immediately following the quake but were restored within a few minutes.', 'I work in East Brea and there was no rolling only a big drop and it sounded and felt like a semi truck ran into the building. We had stuff fall off shelves and ceiling tiles fall out of the ceiling but no major damage or injury.', 'I was driving on a city street when I thought someone hit my car, because I was shaking back and forth. Then I saw the street lights swaying back and forth so I knew what was up. Everyone stopped their cars and just rode it out. Then everything went right back to normal. Pft. What earthquake!', 'I live in Chino, south of the 60 freeway and felt it BIG TIME. All my cupboards opened, all my closet doors and dresser drawers opened, pictures feel off the wall and cupboard contents spilled out. After the big jolt then rolling like a ship.', 'We are in Pasadena at Villa Gardens, a retirement resort, we felt the earth quake as soon as it heppened. We suffered minor damage on the fifth floor of our establishment. No human damages to report, Thank God. It was a thrill for some of our residents and not so much of a thrill for most of our staff.', 'We live in Bakersfield, Calif., about 112 miles north of LA and we felt it here and saw the ceiling fan swaying.', 'I have lived through many quakes in Southern California but this one this morning was a real rocker. The strongest I have ever felt. My poor cat Hunter is still roaming around the floor trying to figure out what has happened (Seal Beach).', "We live very near the perimeter of the Chino Hills State Park. About a 1 1/2 - 2 miles from the epicenter. We were definitely Rocked and Rolled. Amazingly, nothing fell off shelves. Just a few things fell over. Our shepard and lab went nuts for a few minutes. Neighbors all went outside to stay safe. We all thought it was bigger than 5.4 because we didn't know we were the epicenter. We really thought there might be a real disaster at hand. We were all relieved to hear that there was not much damage. Praise God.", 'I am a San Diego native, and I have felt many earthquakes (goes with the territory), however; this was the scariest thing I have ever experienced! We recently moved downtown to a high rise (28th story) in Little Italy, and when it started, I felt uneasy, but then it continued to shake and the entire building was swaying (feet, not inches). I felt as if I was on a boat. I was paralyzed...I didn\'t know what to do. I called my husband (San Diego P.D.) hysterically crying (normally, I\'m calm in "emergency" situations. It is now 3:15, and I have finally stopped shaking! I think this "experience" constitutes a workout for today!']
