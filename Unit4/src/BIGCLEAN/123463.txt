I said, "You\'re kidding." And she goes, "nah." And I said, "Really? What are you talking about?"', "But of course, on that 911 call, authorities heard the word 'crossbow,' and so down here at the hospital, Kenny found himself in the company of Virginia Beach's finest.", "They'd bought the crossbow together, for recreation, Anna told them. And they'd both tried it out, but after that close call, they were getting rid of it. ", 'Robert Katz: He was giving it to his wife to give to another one of the other teachers she worked with. And, you know, get rid of it.', "But of course, the Katz's couldn't have any idea back then what would soon happen to that crossbow... and their good friends, the Creamers. Especially, said their friends, when they thought about what lovely people the Creamers were, what a loving couple.", "The Creamers were quite a bit younger than the Katz's, but, as transplanted New Yorkers, had a lot to share.", 'Robert Katz: They were there, you know, Christmastime, you know, for dinner. They were there, Thanksgiving, they were at our house.', "Kenny and his son were virtually inseparable. Kenny even turned up most days at his son's school to have lunch with the boy. Just because the child seemed to need it.", "That's how Kim heard the story - from Anna herself - that the first incident was purely an accident, involving not her husband, but her son. That it was the boy who handed the crossbow to her.", "Kim Choate: No, no, no, absolutely not. You know, I can't even imagine, you know, a child even thinking that they almost hurt their mom- and they did.", "Kim Choate: She never had anything negative to say about kenny. I've always thought that they had a perfect marriage.", 'Right next door to the Creamers, no more than a couple of tract house walls and a strip of grass apart, lived a man who saw the Creamers through a less rosy lens.', "So there was tension across that strip of grass. And then Howes got the idea that maybe Ken had some trouble with Anna's temper, too. Since Ken gave Howes the cold shoulder when Anna was around, but was friendly to him when she wasn't.", 'But the Creamers did seem to get along, said Howes. Except for that one time, when he overheard all that yelling.', 'Still, everybody has fights sometimes. So, it hardly seemed likely that this neighbor - and what he saw - were about to move centerstage in our strange drama. Because of what happened on another fine morning, a Sunday it was, about three months after that bizarre crossbow accident.', 'There is a surreal quality to events so carved in memory when lives unalterably change. Odd, then, how completely those memories can and do diverge. It was - no disagreement about this - a Sunday morning when it happened.', "Here's what the next door neighbor, the retired navy commander Randell Howes, remembers.", "Howes asked the boy, what are you saying? And that's when he heard the unforgettable phrase:", "Randall Howes: And ... And there's Anna laying at the end of the treadmill, with her hands up under her head and with an arrow stuck straight into her back.", "Creamer had wrapped a white towel, now reddened with blood, around the fatal wound in his wife's back.", 'Before long, the street outside was a parking lot: after the ambulance, the police cars... came the local media.', "....And pretty soon just about everybody knew that this was not the first crossbow shooting in Ken Creamer's house.", '"Officers got a first look at the family\'s crossbow back in October. That time police say it accidently struck Anna Creamer."', 'Officer Ricardo: Resuscitative efforts were attempted, however she was pronounced deceased at the house.', 'Question: So you threw the bag and you heard the sound of the crossbow going off immediately?', 'Question: Can you explain to me why you think she loaded the bow before she put it in the bag?', "Ken: I don't know, I don't know. Sometimes she does, she does, more like, does whatever she wants to do. You can tell her not to do something and she'll do it. ", 'Ken: We were married 13 years. We never had a fight. Never. I buy my wife bags, jewelry, whatever she wants.', "Ken: Well, then I'm gonna - I'd never ever do anything. And my son... I love my son dearly.", 'Of course, Ken Creamer was exactly right; this officer was very suspicious... of him.', 'It was more than a year later when police, still preparing their case, mind you, asked neighbor Randall Howes for another interview.', 'Randall Howes: They had some pictures, crime scene photographs, that I had not seen.', "But now he saw something very disturbing.. And right then and there Randall Howes knew he was about to play another important role in Ken Creamer's life.", "Randall Howes: So I went, 'oh oh. You know, this means probably that my testimony will be key.'", "Ken Creamer killed his wife Anna; of that there was no doubt. Shot her with a crossbow, right here in his garage. And the shock of it was he'd done it before, just didn't kill her that time. So the charge that put him in this place - first degree murder - was no surprise.", 'Look how the arrow went straight into her back and almost right through her, said the medical examiner, as if it was carefully aimed from close range.', 'Dr. Leah Bush: I was able to run my hand over the skin of her chest and I could feel the tip of the arrow under my fingertips.', 'Dr. Leah Bush: It perforated the heart, basically, impaled the heart. As the arrow came from back to front, it went through the aorta completely severing it, just cut it right in half.', "The detective who interrogated Kenneth Creamer right after the shooting testified that when he asked Creamer why the crossbow was loaded and with a hunting arrow, the answer, that his wife must have loaded it, didn't seem believable.", 'Could such a precise memory, two and a half years later, be trusted completely? That would become an issue. Still, two shootings, less than three months apart...', 'J.J. Mason: During the course of my examination of this-- this crossbow, I found no reason why it would fire without a pull of the trigger.', 'In other words, the arrow that went through Anna Creamer must have been fired on purpose.', 'But the true star of the case against Ken Creamer was the next door neighbor, that retired naval commander, Randall Howes.', 'Randall Howes: Ken is just kind of babbling, making noise or whatever, saying, "You know, we need help-- we need help now."', "Well, maybe. For one thing, said the defense, it would demonstrate in court that the firearms expert was wrong. That the Creamer's weapon could fire by accident.", "Greg Turpin: And I think what you'll see is that Mr. Mason in fact cannot say that this couldn't have been an accidental discharge.", 'Besides, there was lots of evidence of innocence, said the defense. Would a guilty man sound this distraught on a 911 call? ', 'Ken Creamer would never kill his wife, said the defense. He adored the woman. And a parade of friends came to the witness stand to confirm it.', "Their son's school librarian, Martha Asire: I thought they were a very happy couple.", 'As for that first crossbow incident, the one that injured Anna, the woman herself said it was an accident, the teacher testified.', "Kristen Hoffman: She laughed about it. Told me what happened and just that's about it. She was very lighthearted about the whole situation.", 'Mr. J.J. Mason: In my examination of the crossbow, I found it to be in excellent, mechanical, operating condition showing very little wear for very little use.', "The crossbow, he testified, simply couldn't have fired without someone pulling the trigger.", 'So how, asked the defense, could anyone rely on this experts opinion? Time for the defense to make its case with some courtroom drama.', 'Mr. Turpin: Judge, I wanna ask the court to one more-- one more physical demonstration.', 'Mr. Turpin: And Mr. Mason, this is how the-- the-- draw would be drawn back to begin with?', 'Defense attorney: Judge, I might ask permission to call my client, Kenneth Kramer, please?', 'Ken Creamer would tell the story himself. Here he showed the jury what happened that Sunday morning in his garage.', 'What is it about the crossbow? So mystically deadly, as if the fear of it has come down through centuries in our genes... And attached itself to a defendant named Ken Creamer.', 'A case that seemed to call for a passionate closing from prosecutor Patrick Connolly.', "Feller: I don't think anybody in the jury really wanted to say that this man, you know, did it. ", 'Of course, for the jury - and these members of the jury who gathered to talk about it - there were a number of questions to consider. And as they talked in that jury room, they struggled to figure out how an accident might have played out.', 'Michael Scott: And how the arrow that-- that killed the woman, it went in straight. ', "And they re-read Ken Creamer's testimony - his memory of the careless toss, the bag hitting the fridge, the loaded crossbow going off.", 'And then there was the neighbor, Randall Howes, whose memory suggested Creamer staged the scene to make it look like an accident...', "So if it couldn't have been an accident the second time, then what about the first?", 'So now, jury members realized they had formed some strong opinions about Mr. Creamer.', 'And once they decided that about Ken Creamer, some of them began to imagine things about his marriage to Anna. Remember, the evidence at trial suggested that the marriage was strong, that Ken and Anna were close. But in the jury room some members said evidence or not, they saw it a different way.', 'Michael Scott: I think she was a woman that was living under terror with great threat upon her.', 'And so the jury returned to the crowded courtroom and told the judge they were ready.', 'And then, as the clock ticked down toward his sentencing, from his jail cell, Ken Creamer jumped at one last chance to explain.', 'He was grizzled a little - the beard, the prison jumpsuit, not at all in keeping with the image Ken Creamer presented at his trial. But perhaps more suitable for a question that had been on the minds of many people here in Virginia Beach.', 'Keith Morrison: What made you think you could actually kill your wife and get away with it?', "Keith Morrison: Trouble is that's what the jury believes, that you planned it, conspired about it, set it up, did the whole thing yourself, thinking you were gonna get away with it and walk away with a million bucks in cash at the same time.", "Kenneth Creamer: I know the investigator went to the school and they said it was-- she wasn't around, she wasn't working there no more, Pierce. --"]
