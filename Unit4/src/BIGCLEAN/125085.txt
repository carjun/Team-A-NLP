', 'Officer Baker: Unfortunately, our only eye witness was Chester Roberts and he was brutally killed simply because he was an eye witness.', 'On the other side of the railroad tracks is the industrial row and New Salem Street. ', "In Massachusetts, homicides are generally investigated by a team of state troopers assigned to the county D.A.'s office.", 'Keith Morrison: My first inclination, if I had heard about such a thing, would be to think, oh my God, you know, concrete company, double murder, weekday morning, this is a mob hit.', 'And if not for the telemarketing call at home that delayed him that morning, it might have been he who greeted the shotgun.', "With rain pouring down, investigators were doing their wet leather shoe work, talking to people on New Salem Street, pulling surveillance video - AllState didn't have any - at companies up and down the street.", "If there was a connection between the concrete pumping business and the double murders of Mike Zammitti Jr. and Chester Roberts, police weren't finding it. ", 'Then, two weeks after the murder, a letter arrived at the Zammitti house that sent police back to square one.', "Even though investigators from the Massachusetts State Police had started to rule out a business related motive, they weren't sure what to make of this.", 'Keith Morrison: Did you ever think when the Zammittis called up and said, "We got this letter," and they\'re distraught about it, that this was some sort of a mob operation or somebody who was still out there threatening them?', 'And as with all murder investigations, they worked the circle of suspicion closer to home.', 'On weekends, neighbor David Spears watched in something like awe as Mike Sr. worked his yard.', 'So, though detectives were still pursuing leads in the Boston area, they were only too happy to talk to a Freedom resident as helpful as Sean Fitzpatrick...along with the rest of the neighborhood of course.', 'Uncle Sean Fitzpatrick?
