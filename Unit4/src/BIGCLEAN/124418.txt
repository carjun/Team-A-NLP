['Consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky of ConsumerWorld.org, who discovered the flaw, says anyone who knows your phone number and has the last four digits of your Chase or BofA credit card number might be able access your account. ', 'At BofA and Chase, if the phone number is a match, the verification process is streamlined. Rather than requiring the entire credit card number to be entered, the caller can usually access the account with only the last four digits. In some cases, a zip code is also required.', 'I contacted Chase and Bank of America and asked them to respond to all of this. Both banks e-mailed me statements that said they take customer security very seriously, but they do not think the scenario Dworsky outlines is a significant security threat to their customers.', 'Read more about the Federal Communications new rule about Caller ID and Spoofing. ', 'Adam Levin, co-founder and chairman of Identity Theft 911, was disappointed to hear how the banks responded.', 'In running various vulnerability tests with his own cards and those of several volunteers, Dworsky found it was simple to gain access to the targeted account in almost every case. ', 'The security protocol is stricter at Capital One, Citi and American Express. They all require the entire card number to be entered every time, no matter where the call is placed from.', '        Has the market volatility got you nervous? These cartoons may give you a little comic relief.', 'ID spoofing has changed the security landscape. A phone number is no longer a reliable means of authentication. If you have a credit card with either of these two banks and you believe security trumps convenience, as I do, I encourage you to contact them and let them know how you feel. Tell them you want this loophole closed. ', '   Want to keep up with the latest on consumer news, follow the  ConsumerMan on Facebook . ']
