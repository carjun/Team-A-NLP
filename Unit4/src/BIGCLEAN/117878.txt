['        With record high gasoline prices, people are looking for ways to reduce the pain at the pump. One way to do that is to get a gas-rebate card; a credit card that gives you cash back every time you fill up.', 'For example: the Marathon Platinum MasterCard from Chase offers a 10 percent rebate on purchases at Marathon gas stations, but only for the first 60 days. Then it drops back to 5 percent. ', 'With some cards the rebates stop or dramatically drop after you charge a certain amount. The Discover Platinum Gas Card gives you 5 percent cash back on gas purchases up to $1,200 each year. After that, you can earn up to 1 percent on all other purchases. ', 'The Chase PerfectCard Platinum MasterCard automatically credits your earnings to your monthly statement. With the BP Visa Rewards card from Chase, a gift card or check (your choice) will be sent to you whenever your rebate balance hits $25.', 'In fact, the terms of two rebate programs are about to change. In October, Citibank cuts the rebate on gasoline purchased with its Citi Dividend MasterCard from 5 to 2 percent. American Express will pay single instead of double Membership Rewards points for gasoline and other "everday purchases. ']
