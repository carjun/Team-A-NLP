['The Federal Reserve Board has proposed rules for how banks should handle their overdraft service for ATM withdrawals and debit card transactions. There are two options on the table: opt-in and opt-out.', 'The survey found many people do not understand how automatic overdraft programs work. Consumer Reports found that 39 percent of the people thought their bank would either deny a debit transaction or allow it to process without charging a fee if it would overdraw the account. Nearly half of those polled (48 percent) thought their ATM card would not work if they tried to withdraw more money than was in their account.', 'Last week Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced the Consumer Overdraft Protection Fair Practices Act. This bill (H.R. 1465) would require banks to give customers a warning that their withdrawal from an ATM or purchase with a debit card is about to trigger an overdraft. The customer would then have the option to stop the transaction or accept the overdraft service and the associated fee.', 'If passed, this bill would also require banks to change the way they process checks, debit card transactions and other withdrawals from a checking account. Many banks automatically process daily debits from largest to smallest. The banks say this is another customer service. Because the bigger amount is more likely to be a mortgage, rent or other important payment, they think customers would want those to go through and have smaller debits bounce.', 'The Maloney bill would prohibit banks from manipulating the sequence in which checks and other debits are posted if it causes more overdrafts and maximizes fees.', 'According to the FDIC, the average overdraft triggered by ATM and debit card transactions is $17. The median fee for each overdraft is $27.', 'The Center for Responsible Lending web site has more information on bank overdraft fees and an easy way to comment to the Fed. ']
