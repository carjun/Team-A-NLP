["'Hitchhiker's Guide' Google Doodle holds answer to life, universe and everything", '  GoogleIt\'s Maurice Sendak\'s 85th birthday, and Google\'s homepage has turned into an animated fantasy world inhabited by Max, the star of Sendak\'s most famous book, "Where The Wild Things Are." Sendak, children\'s book author and illustrator, died in May 2012, but lived to see "Wild Things" turned into a movie in 2009. In today\'s Doodle, a Max in full wolf costume sails away to the island of the Wild Things. He\'s followed by Mickey, carried in by a balloon, who drops into a giant milk bottle as seen in "In the Night Kitchen" (a 1970 Sendak favorite). That melts away into a scene from "Bumble-ardy," featuring a family of pigs.Eventually, all the characters in the Doodle wind up around a dining table, decorated with a cake with extra-large birthday candles.
