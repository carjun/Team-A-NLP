['Mike Tomlin knows he can talk all he wants about progress and the overhauled roster and how much he likes what he\'s seen during the offseason.Yet the Pittsburgh Steelers coach understands it means little if it doesn\'t translate onto the field."The reality is these types of processes are measured based on results," Tomlin said at the end of minicamp in June.And the results were typically un-Steelerlike last fall for one of the NFL\'s most consistent franchises. A late-season swoon dropped Pittsburgh to 8-8 and a spot outside the playoffs looking in. It marked a decidedly ungraceful exit for some of the stars that led the team to three Super Bowl appearances in six years.James Harrison, Casey Hampton, Mike Wallace, Max Starks, Rashard Mendenhall, Willie Colon and Keenan Lewis were either cut, not brought back or lured elsewhere in free agency.
