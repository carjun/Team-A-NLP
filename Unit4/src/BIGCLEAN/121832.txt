['The Houston Texans set out to solve two issues Wednesday, cutting return specialist Trindon Holliday and signing linebacker Barrett Ruud in the wake of Brian Cushing\'s season-ending injury.Cushing was placed on injured reserve after tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament in Monday night\'s 23-17 win over the New York Jets. The 6-foot-2, 242-pound Ruud, a second-round pick by Tampa Bay in 2005, was cut by New Orleans on Monday.The Texans (5-0) play Green Bay (2-3) on Sunday night. While coach Gary Kubiak has started grooming Tim Dobbins to replace Cushing, the team looked to improve its subpar return game by releasing Holliday.The 5-foot-5 Holliday won a roster spot after returning three kicks (two punts and a kickoff) for touchdowns in the preseason. That didn\'t translate to the regular season: Houston ranks last in kickoff return average (17.6 yards) and 16th in punt return average (9.2 yards)."By no means is it a statement or anything about what we thought of Trindon," Kubiak sai...', 'The Houston Texans will not have inside linebacker Tim Dobbins available for the postseason, with the team placing the veteran on injured reserve on Friday due to a ...', 'Cincinnati strong safety Chris Crocker is inactive for the Bengals AFC wild-card playoff game against Houston.Crocker missed practice all week with a thigh injury.
