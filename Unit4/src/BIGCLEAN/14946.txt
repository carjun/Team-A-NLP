Another is still missing. Abc\'s matt gutman has the latest. We\'re right over the raft. Reporter: On that raft, in the middle of the roiling city, with sandy bearing down, members of the crew of "the hms bounty" were swept overboard by a violent wave on sunday. Then, a welcome sight. The outstretched arm of dan todd of the u.S. Coast guard. With two rescuers towing, the crew members one to one to rescue survivors. It\'s like a washing machine. 20-foot to 30-foot waves in that wind. Reporter: Earlier, workers found claudene christian floating. If she goes down with the ship, she was happy. But I know she was happy. Reporter: The ship\'s captain, robin walbridge, is still missing. Why a distress call to the coast guard, at 9:00 p.M. Sunday night, may have been rescinded. The crew had been onboard the ship for seven hours. I told my husband, they were kind of worried that they won\'t want to lose the ship. That resonated with me. Reporter: The ship built for the 1962 "mutiny on the bounty." But her owner, said the main purpose was for a total museum. We saved her from the graveyard once. And to have her go like this is just heart wrenching. Reporter: This morning, the coast guard is investigating why this attempt to save the "hms bounty" from hurricane sandy, turned into a frantic rescue mission. Right now, that search operation is still under way. The coast guard is using ships and planes like the one you see next to one thing that may be keeping the captain of the bounty alive, is one of these suits. It\'s a survival suit. Abc\'s matt gutman, thanks very much.
