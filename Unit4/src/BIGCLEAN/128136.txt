["        A simple medication that leads to weight loss with no dieting or exercise could be a big step toward every dieter's dream. The study is only in monkeys, but tests in people could begin shortly.", "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'The researchers, headed by the husband and wife team Wadih Arap and Renata Pasqualini, have been working on the project for years. In 2004 the research team proved the drug could bring substantial weight loss in mice. Now, after the highly successful results in monkeys, they have applied for FDA approval to begin trials in people, possibly within a year.', '"Within a few weeks of administering the drug it became clear to us that the efficacy we had seen in rodents was being transplanted to monkeys," Barnhart said. "They were getting their waistlines back so we were staring to see the effect. It was such an important milestone for the drug."', 'MRIs confirmed that the weight loss was the result of shedding the so-called "white" body fat that most humans need to lose and is linked to Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It was not water, muscle, or some other essential tissue in the body.', 'Careful examination did reveal a slight, reversible kidney changes that will need to be monitored carefully in the human trials.', 'After 28 days on the drug, the monkeys maintained their weight loss for about two weeks, but once they went back into the colony and resumed their slothful overeating ways, the weight returned.', 'If the drug were to prove successful in humans it would never be permanent solution, experts say. It would be a kick-start used along with future diet and exercise.', 'How great is the desire for the drug? Despite explaining all the limitations of the research, the scientists say they always get the same question: " \'When it is it going to be ready, \'cause I want some,\' says Pasqualini. ', ' either overweight or obese, the search for an effective weight-loss drug has surpassed even the cure for the common cold as the holy grail of drugmakers. Now a new medication has actually killed off ', ', at least in a test of monkeys. Question is, are humans next? The story from our chief science correspondent, ', 'While the study was only conducted on monkeys, the results could be a big step toward a drug that truly helps with that effort. After only 28 days on the drug, overweight monkeys lost an average of 11 percent of their ', ', the scientists showed a drastically reduced weight in mice. With the success of monkeys, the researchers are applying to the ', ' for permission to start a trial in humans, possibly within a year. They know there will be no shortage of volunteers. The researchers say whenever they discuss the project, they always hear the same question.', 'The monkeys in the experiment were not bred to be fat or fed a special diet. They were the ones in the colony who simply ate more and exercised less.', "They get overweight on their own. It's very much like humans. It's the same human behaviors.", ' showed the drug eliminated no muscle, only fat, the red and orange in these pictures. After they stopped taking the drug, the monkeys resumed their couch potato ways and gained the weight back again. So if the drug proves safe and effective in humans, it will likely be a tool to kick-start the familiar diet and exercise program that everyone painfully knows is the true key to ']
