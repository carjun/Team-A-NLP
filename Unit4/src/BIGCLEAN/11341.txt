See More ', '\t\t\t\t\t\tEuropean leaders expressing anger after learning the u.S. Was bugging some of their offices. Part of that sweeping surveillance program revealed. Man who revealed those secr secrets, edward snowden, still in a moscow airport tonight. Will he escape afterall? Abc\'s nick schifrin, reporting in from london. Reporter: Deep inside moscow\'s airport, the world\'s most wanted man is still hiding and apparently still spilling secrets. Today, edward snowden leaked a document, that according to a german magazine, claims the u.S. Bugged its european allies in washington, d.C. And infiltrated their computer networks. The u.S. Is frustrated that snowden\'s data time bomb is still ticking and they can\'t get snowden extradited. I continue to be concerned about the other documents he may have. That\'s part of the reason why we\'d like to have mr. Snowden in custody. Reporter: Snowden has no passport, but he\'s trying to fly to cuba and get political asylum in ecuador. Here in london, ecuador already provides another famous whistleblower safe haven. Wikileaks founder julian assange has been holed up in the embassy for 377 days. But from here, he\'s been helping snowden evade u.S. Justice. Today, assange told george stephanopoulos on "this week" that no matter what, snowden\'s secrets would get out. There is no stopping the publishing process at this stage. Great care has been taken to make sure that mr. Snowden can\'t be pressured by any state to stop the publication process. Reporter: Ecuador says it can\'t consider granting snowden asylum unless he gets to ecuador or one of its embassies. But russia won\'t let him leave the airport. So, snowden may be stuck, but he\'s free to keep revealing u.S. Secrets. Nick schifrin, abc news, london.
