['Dolphins call to each other using distinctive whistles that serve as names, new research suggests.Each dolphin makes its own unique whistle, and close friends or family will reply with the same sound. The findings, published July 22 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest the dolphins use the whistles like names. Past research showed individual dolphins had personal whistles , but it wasn\'t clear that other members of their group learned that whistle."These are learned individual calls animals can sometimes copy to label or address one another," said study co-author Stephanie King, a marine mammal scientist at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom.The findings also reveal parallels between dolphin whistles and human language acquisition.
