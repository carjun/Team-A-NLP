After Morales agreed to a voluntary inspection of his plane, Austrian police walked through the aircraft and confirmed Snowden was not there. (According to Bolivia, the claims that he was on board were "baseless.")', 'Bolivian officials pointed out that Morales was travelling from Moscow from an international summit of gas-exporting countries.  They said that France, Portugal and Spain had no valid excuse under international law treaties to block Morales\' plane from flying over their airspace and claimed that the United States was behind the "hostile" action taken by these European nations.', 'Patrick Domingo/AFP/Getty ImagesBolivian President Evo Morales holds a press...

We are all Bolivia!"', "In South America, presidents called for an emergency meeting of UNASUR, a regional defense organization, to discuss how they will respond to the Morales incident, though few details have emerged on what kind of measures UNASUR could take.
