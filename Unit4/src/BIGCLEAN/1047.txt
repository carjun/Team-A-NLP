Libbi is a very focused woman, haha," Gardiner wrote to GoodMorningAmerica.com on what was going through his mind when Taite was paying him no attention.', 'Poor Gardiner had even broken his back just eight days prior to the June 30 proposal, so the kneeling position was quite painful for him.', '"I broke my back at Libbi\'s daughter\'s 10th birthday party," he explained. "The party was held at a trampoline centre. I bounced on my back, heard two big cracks and knew straight away I was in trouble."', "But the pain didn't deter Gardiner from his plan to ask for Taite's hand in marriage.", 'The pair had just opened a brand new hair salon, Mugshot Hair, where Taite was busy removing the newspaper from the windows. As part of his whole scheme, Gardiner warned Taite he was going to have a friend tape the "unveiling" of the salon, and since she\'s camera shy, she was intentionally not trying to look at the camera.', '"After doing the full renovation of the salon in three days and having such a traumatic experience during the week before, she [Taite] was tired and just wanted to get the newspaper down so we could finish up and go home," said Gardiner.', 'But his patience paid off and made for an excellent viral moment, as the video of his proposal has now garnered more than 136,000 views on YouTube. ', 'The happy couple say they are taking some time to get their salon up and running before picking a wedding date, but are hoping to choose a weekend in either March or April of 2014.', "Tune in for more hilarious viral moments every weekday on 'GMA LIVE!' at 9 a.m. ET  Also Read", "Editors' Picks1 - 4 of 12prevnextTry Spike Mendelsohn's Steak What Does the Royal Baby Name Mean?Dog Bears Ring to Help Master ProposeSign the Royal Baby Guestbook!", "Most Popular NewsFamily Rescued by George Zimmerman Backs Out of News ConferenceStomach Bug Sickens People in 8 StatesMan Uses 42 Bed Sheets to Write 'Will You Marry Me?' on Girlfriend's FarmBring Any Working Cellphone to Best Buy, Get a Free Samsung Galaxy S3Ohio Judge Orders Woman to Spend Next Five Christmases in JailJudge Orders $1 Million Returned to Exotic DancerCliff Collapse Caught on VideoShow More", "Featured GMA Videos1 - 4 of 10prevnext Weiner Mayoral Campaign Sparks 'Is It Cheating' Debate Mother-Daughter Duos Drop Everything, Head to Hollywood Newest Prince Visits Kate's Family in Bucklebury Spain Train Disaster Is Worst in 40 Years", 'On This SiteHomeMoneyHealthLife and StyleEntertainmentRecipesGMA LiveGMA Insider', 'Trending NowCaroline KennedyKim ZolciakStomach bugPowerball numbersRoyal baby nameEldoraSons of AnarchyMenthol cigarettesShirellda TerryForbes college rankings']
