["            Ali was ambitious, hard-working and reliable. So when she disappeared, her family was certain she hadn't just run off", "Lawrvetta McLawrence, Ali's mother: [To her, I would say] I love you so much. I just pray and ask God to bring you to us darling. I just pray, all I want is my Ali.", 'On Thursday, Feb. 2, 2006, Ali Gilmore left her night job at a supermarket in Tallahassee and drove home. When she failed to show up for her day job on Friday, then again on Monday, her friend and co-worker, Karen Freeman, knew that something had to be wrong.', 'That desperate phone call makes Karen wonder if her friend might have done something completely out of character. ', 'Sara James: Do you think that there is any chance that your daughter just got fed up with things, and left?', 'So far, there is little evidence that Ali ran off. No one spotted her anywhere, and police say their constant monitoring of her bank and credit card accounts showed no activity since she disappeared.', 'Lawrvetta McLawrence, mother: If anybody did harm to her, you better believe they had some kind of mark left on them.', 'Police combed for blood, hair, DNA, went door to door, and used a helicopter and bloodhounds to scour local streets and the surrounding woods.', 'Sara James: Right down to the yard signs, this is politics at the grassroots level. But in this case, the politics is Ali - finding Ali.', 'James Gilmore, estranged husband: I want everybody to know and understand how much I love and miss Ali. ', 'James Gilmore: I was happy. I mean, I was ready to see what it was going to be and what we were going to name it.', 'Newland: He voluntarily did that, and there was no deception on his part in that. Of course that, along with some other files did get sent off.', 'If you have any information, contact Big Bend Crime Stoppers at 850-891-HELP or go to', 'http://www.whereisaligilmore.com/.
