['Beverly Hills and its coveted 90210 ZIP code may be the best known of the celebrity neighborhoods, but as high-end agents in Los Angeles will attest, the area is not the only place that celebrities prefer to live. And like any city, L.A.\'s celebrity neighborhoods each have their own vibe and famous residents.Privacy, privacy, privacyThe paparazzi are a real issue for celebs in L.A., and keeping prying eyes at bay is one of the main considerations when stars look for a home and possible neighborhood."It\'s difficult," said Mauricio Umansky, co-founder of luxury brokerage The Agency . "It\'s the paparazzi, it\'s the reality."A home in a gated community -- such as Hidden Hills, Calabasas or Pelican Hill -- will have more value, Umansky says.Real estate agent Gary Gold of Hilton & Hyland makes the same point."Hidden Hills is popular," Gold said. "It\'s a gated area, it\'s away from Los Angeles. You can\'t just drive through it. It\'s a beautiful setting, and people won\'t be bugged out there."Anot...', 'Complete list of 51st Grammy Award winnersSunday, February 08, 2009 By The Associated PressPrintA complete list of winners at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.Album of ...', 'A complete list of winners at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.Album of the Year: "Raising Sand," Robert Plant and Alison Krauss; T Bone Burnett, producer; Mike Piersan...', 'A complete list of winners at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.Album of the Year: "Raising Sand," Robert Plant and Alison Krauss; T Bone Burnett, producer; Mike Piersan...', '" Into the West ( search )," TNT\'s epic series, premieres Friday night, and one of its many actors, Keri Russell ( search ), learned some of the Cheyenne Indian lang...', 'Today in History - Dec. 9Tuesday, December 09, 2008By The Associated PressE-Mail Print Share:Today is Tuesday, Dec. 9, the 344th day of 2008.
