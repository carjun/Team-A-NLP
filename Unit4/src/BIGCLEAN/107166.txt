['THOMAS:  Now the man who has on a crusade to expose what he believes is wrongdoing faces accusations of his own.', "THOMAS:  For more than a year, he's been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he sought refuge to avoid possible criminal charges.", 'And today, WikiLeaks and Assange are standing shoulder to shoulder with the perhaps the most damaging leaker of them all, Edward Snowden, the fugitive former government contractor who went public with top secret information about some of the crown jewels of the intelligence community.', 'THOMAS:  Some U.S. officials say make no mistake, these are -- these leaks have serious consequences that the terrorists are changing the way they communicate, because of these disclosures -- George.', "STEPHANOPOULOS:  OK, Pierre.  Thanks.  Let's talk now to Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.  Joined here in New York by Jesselyn Radack, a former whistle-", 'blower from the Justice Department who disclosed details of post-9/11 interrogation practices, now with the government accountability project.  Welcome to you both.', "What can you tell us about where Edward Snowden is right now and where he's expected to go?", "The situation now with Edward Snowden is very sensitive one.
