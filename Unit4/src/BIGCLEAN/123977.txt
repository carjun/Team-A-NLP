['            Family and friends go to extraordinary lengths to honor a legacy of a young man whose trust led to tragedy', 'This report aired Dateline Friday, July 23. The full hour will not be available online. Discuss the case here.', 'Dr. ANDREW BAGBY: (Wedding videotape) Best man is a little bit of a poor title for these things. I mean, the best man is really the groom.', "Mr. DAVID BAGBY: I threw the phone at the desk, and I jumped up and just screamed, `No!'", "KATE: I thought, `Well, God, this is it.' You know? `You gave me a lovely son, and now it's over.'", "Mr. KURT KUENNE (Director): I decided to go on the road to interview people, because I thought, you know, he's never going to have a wedding.", "MORRISON: It's no easy thing to be a doctor in America. Andrew, despite his obvious abilities, was turned down by every medical school in the country. But he was accepted here, St. John's, Newfoundland, the easternmost point in North America. Memorial University Medical School. And thus the decision from which all else followed. Andrew came to St. John's.", 'HEATHER: I was so excited that he was dating somebody. Thought that maybe he had found somebody that he could really be happy with.', "Corporal GARDNER: (Audio recording) Yeah, Dr. Turner, I'm Corporal Gardner with the Pennsylvania State Police. I have to tell you that Andrew is dead.", "MORRISON: After you found out about Andrew's death, the impulse just ended. You were done.", 'Mr. BAGBY: I think it was a rage at the person who did this. I got to go to the trial. I got to see what happens to the bastard who did this.', "Mr. KUENNE: You know, he said--she said, `Look, I'm not looking for another husband. I'm just looking for somebody to hang out with and have fun here in school.' And he's like, `I'm not looking for anything serious. I just want to get through medical school.'", "Mr. SIMPSON: Andrew, you know you can do a lot better. Said, `Oh, no, I really can't.'", "Mr. BAGBY: What a flake. What a flaky person. The first time we had contact with her was over the phone. She called trying to get Andrew when he was here doing a rotation here in California. Kate answered the phone, and she couldn't get off the phone for an hour.", "Mr. BAGBY: And part of Andrew's problem was, I think, he was just too nice to say, you know, `Get the hell out of my life. I'm tired of this. Go away.' ", 'KATE: On Sunday night I got out of bed and prayed because I thought Andrew was at risk. I had this overwhelming feeling. And I prayed to God to be looking after him.', "Mr. BAGBY: I have a lot of trouble with those things too, and I suspect what really goes on, what's called intuition, is really a very, very complex calculation of lots of little indicators, little things that Andrew said on the phone maybe. Maybe the last time you talked to Shirley there was some very subtle change in tone.", "Mr. SIMPSON: And I told him, I said, `You know, Andrew, when I break up with somebody and put them on a plane and send them 1300 miles away,' I said, `They knock on my front door, I'm going out the back door and I'm calling the police.' He said, `What do you mean?' I said, `Andrew,' I said, `be serious. Nobody drives 16 hours after you've just broken up with them.' I said, `Do not meet her in private.' He said, `What can happen?'", "Ms. TURNER: (Audio recording) His parents don't even know, do they? Oh, my God. You can't tell them this over the phone.", "Cpl. GARDNER: (Audio recording) I'm interested in the gun. And you just bought the gun, right? Not too long ago?", "Cpl. GARDNER: (Audio recording) Yeah. I can understand that. I'm just curious...", 'Cpl. GARDNER: (Audio recording) Would you be willing to turn the gun into your local police department so they could get it to us to let us look at it? ', "Ms. TURNER: (Audio recording) It's either in my closet or my bedroom. Or it's in the car.", "KATE: So this man said to me, `Do you know that Shirley Turner's pregnant with your son's child?'"]
