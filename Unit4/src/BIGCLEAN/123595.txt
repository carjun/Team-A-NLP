Teen marriages too often don't last long. But, in fact, this one did, and they went on to have more children. Teresa was a natural mother. ", 'While Teresa raised the kids, Tony worked at the large BorgWarner plant in Muncie, now shut down, which manufactured parts for the auto industry.

That's where he met Hank Rowe.", 'After Hank and Ginger Engle became a couple, they grew close to Teresa and Tony, going out to dinner, playing cards, boating.

The house went on the market, the divorce would soon be finalized. ', 'And then, one sunny May morning, it happened. Ginger was on the phone with Teresa. There was a stranger at the door. "An inspector," Teresa said, "I\'ll call you back."', 'What happened to Teresa was about to launch a mystery that would haunt her family and friends for 15 years... A puzzle that would be put together with the help of a woman Teresa never met, a woman who had the courage to expose the truth.

In fact, they'd arrested Tony shortly after Teresa's body was found. But Tony had an iron-clad alibi for the time of the killing, as Richard Bradshaw, then a Muncie police detective, discovered.", "RICHARD BRADSHAW: His alibi was he's at work. He was seen by numerous co-workers. All of whom were interviewed, gave statements that they were with him all day long and that he was inside a secure plant, where you were logged in when you came to work and you were logged out when you left.", 'CHRIS HANSEN: So there was no way that he could have committed this murder himself.', "With a firm alibi and no physical evidence tying him to the crime, Tony couldn't be held more than 48 hours. He was released... But the more that police learned from Teresa's friends and family about Tony, the more that they were convinced he was involved in the murder. Teresa's lawyer described their divorce as the most violent one she'd ever handled.

Once located, he said that Tony French had made no threats against his wife the entire time while he lived with him.', "RICHARD BRADSHAW: Well, he was well known to carry guns. I think the biggest problem with Tony is people didn't know what he was capable of. I think they figured he was unpredictable.", "JENNIFER NYE: I was mad. I really didn't understand the way of the law at that time.", 'JENNIFER NYE: Oh yeah, and grin and ride by and wave on his motorcycle with his new girlfriend.

But just the secretive way that they were talking made her suspicious and she demanded to know more as they drove home.", 'MARY DABBS: No. I said it was very much my business and I wanted to know what was going on.', 'MARY DABBS: He got very angry. He was pounding his fist into the dashboard. He was trying desperately to intimidate me to shut up.', 'CHRIS HANSEN: So, this man who was once so kind when you were recovering from breast cancer was now slamming your head into the car window?', "MARY DABBS: Terror. I was in shock. But I wouldn't let it go. We fought all the way home. We fought all the way into the house. We fought all the way into the middle of the night.", 'What exactly had David Woods done?

He had changed clothes into a suit and he went to her house.", 'MARY DABBS: He said someone from the real estate company.

I still can't decide what drove me so hard. Why I needed to know so much. ", "MARY DABBS: And he threw it on my face. He told me that's what was gonna happen to me.

Mary says she discovered illegal drugs in their car and flushed them down the toilet. Woods was enraged.", "It was then that she finally found the courage to go to police and tell them everything. Officers went to their home and found Woods' weapons, including an illegal machine gun. He was arrested, convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison on a weapons charge. But, detailed as Mary's account was, nothing happened in the Teresa French murder case. ", "RICHARD BRADSHAW: Even though it was a huge break, it was another piece of the puzzle. Prior to that, we really hadn't had much. She gave us a lot of information. But it, itself, wasn't enough to actually go to court.

Al Williams, who by now had joined the case, got a call from a local prosecutor that finally blew the case wide open.

He was a hard nut to crack, lemme tell ya.', "AL WILLIAMS: I mean, he's the one that actually introduced them. Everything he's telling us is accurate. You know, we can prove that through other witnesses, corroborating statements. We can prove that through evidence from the scene.", 'ERIC HOFFMAN: We knew he was nervous. You could tell he was scared with what may happen.', "AL WILLIAMS: So we didn't want him to contact Dave Woods. And we didn't know at that time if they talked to each other.", "OREN JOHNSON: I ain't doing nothing to you, man. I'm just telling you what's going on.", "AL WILLIAMS: It was pretty intense watching the recording as it's going on.

No, I don't do wires, man. No, uh-uh.", "It ended up being worth all the acid build-up and chain-smoking. They didn't get a full-out confession... But they caught Tony in a web of lies that they thought was incriminating and put him at the center of his wife's murder.", "TONY FRENCH: I want you to stay the f--- away from me. I don't ever want to see you, hear you again. As far as I know, we ain't never even spoke. I ain't see you since you retired.

If you don't have Oren Johnson, what proof do you have that Tony French killed anybody?", "But to those close to Teresa, there was never any doubt Tony was behind the murder. It took patience, hard work and a lot of courage... Especially from Mary Dabbs, a woman who herself had been in an abusive marriage and risked her life for a woman she'd never met. To this day, she can't go past the French home without being overwhelmed. Teresa's friends and sister say they're just thankful the truth finally came out.
