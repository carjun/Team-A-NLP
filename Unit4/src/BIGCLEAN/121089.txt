['A growing number of companies have made the switch from paper checks to prepaid plastic rebate cards. Verizon Wireless, Sprint, Staples, Nordstrom, Toshiba, Nokia and Home Depot are just some of the big name companies that have made the switch.', 'Staples started using rebate cards in the summer of 2008. The company says customer feedback has been positive.', 'Another problem: Rebate cards can be difficult or impossible to use as partial payment for a purchase. To use the card for a purchase worth more than the card, you have to know the balance on the card. (To find out you must make a call or go online.) If you try to buy something for $10 and you have $9.99 left on the card, the transaction will be rejected. ', 'Some companies have already figured this out. Get a rebate card from Verizon Wireless and you can take it to the bank and have the funds deposited into your account. If a rebate for a product purchased at Staples can be submitted online, the customer can request the money back via Visa prepaid card, check or Staples gift card. Both are great ideas. Customer choice is always good.']
