['            Which of these 3 prominent for-profit education companies has the best value proposition?', "A tough job market, increasingly high cohort default rates, exorbitant tuition, sanctions and accreditation insecurity, low retention, a scathing Congressional report, and questionable cost structures have caused students to lose faith in the value of a college degree. Since revenues are tied so closely to enrollments, revenues have taken a big hit and many for-profits are now losing money. Many investors have been discouraged by the tough environment and questioned the industry's very existence going forward. That's where I draw the line.", 'There is no doubt in my mind that for-profits will continue to play an important role in educating America. I believe this for a few key reasons. For one, there is still substantial value in a college degree.', "The discrepancy between average pay for Americans with a bachelor's degree and those with only a high school diploma has widened substantially in the last few decades and has never been greater. That trend will continue. We no longer sport the unskilled labor jobs we used to. Those jobs have gone overseas and probably won't come back for the foreseeable future.", 'One of the most important metrics for determining education quality is cohort default rates. Schools that the educate best and have the best student outcomes should have the least alumni defaulting on their federal student loans.', "The results are pretty clear. In every year, Strayer was under the national average and had the lowest rates by a substantial margin. Bridgepoint's Ashford University was only below the national average in one year, but outperformed Apollo's University of Phoenix in 2 of the 3 years recorded. University of Phoenix's numbers are the worst of the 3 institutions and exceeded the national average in every year.", 'The investigation demonstrates that, at least during the period examined, the company invested relatively little in students and struggled to retain Associate degree students. While the company has started to take positive steps in the right direction, more remains to be done.', 'While Tom Harkin and the rest of the committee are clearly critical of for-profits in general, they complimented practices at Strayer and were less critical of Apollo than Bridgepoint.', "A school's accreditation status and relationship with its accreditor is a good indicator of the school's value proposition to students.", "Apollo's University of Phoenix has had accreditation issues recently. A peer review team visited the school a while back and in February, recommended that the school's accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, place the school on Probation. Probation would signify that the school is out of compliance with HLC criteria. Last week, Apollo announced that HLC had reviewed the recommendation and decided to instead place the U of Phoenix on Notice, a lesser sanction indicating that the school is on a course of action that could lead it to be out of compliance. It's not as bad as Probation, but accreditation security at the university will still be uncertain for the next 2 years.", "Bridgepoint's Ashford University has also had issues with accreditation, but last week received initial accreditation from WASC for 5 years.", 'Of the 3, Strayer University has the best relationship with its accreditor. In 2007 the university actually requested an accreditation reaffirmation 4 years before it was required to do so, suggesting that the school was confident in the academic quality and outcomes it produced. It received a reaffirmation for 10 years through 2017 without any sanctions being placed. 10 years is the maximum duration an accreditor can reaffirm accreditation for and is rarely given, which Middle States was impressed with in its findings.', 'Recent developments in the for-profit education industry strongly suggest that schools will have to offer students a better value than they have in the past. Financial performance going forward will heavily depend on this value proposition. It appears that Strayer is best positioned to capitalize on this trend of the three companies analyzed. Apollo Group has the most issues of the three, and Bridgepoint is somewhere between the other two. Investors should use this data in conjunction with traditional profitability and financial health metrics to determine the opportunity in investing in these and other education companies.', '        The bully, the narcissist, the know-it-all, even the psychopath. We may not like them, or want our children to be like them.']
