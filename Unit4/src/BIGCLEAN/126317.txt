['I tried contacting all three companies. I could not find a working number for CSTR Solutions in Orlando. My messages to Mutual Consolidated Savings in Tacoma were never returned.', 'Patricia Poole of Mineral City, Ohio, is almost 70 and she does not want to leave her kids saddled with her credit card debt.
