['The Church of England has formally apologised for child abuse by Anglican priests and for its own failure to prevent it.The church\'s governing body, the General Synod, voted unanimously to make the apology at a meeting in the northern English city of York and said it would now tighten its procedures."We failed big time," Paul Butler, the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, said as he opened the meeting on Sunday."We cannot do anything other than own up to our failures. We were wrong. Our failures were sin just as much as the perpetrators sinned," Butler added.The synod also observed a 30-second silence following a statement from support groups for survivors of abuse, an issue which has already rocked the Catholic Church in a number of countries.The Church of England is the mother church of the world\'s 80 million Anglicans.The vote came after a final report was published earlier this year into child abuse scandals in the troubled diocese of Chichester, southern England.Three former Chur...', "Nigeria's Anglican church has deleted all references to the mother church in Britain from its constitution, deepening a rift over homosexuality but stopping short of...", 'Pope breaks own rule to hold up Anglican  convert Newman as model for Catholics today', "The new archbishop of Canterbury was formally enthroned Thursday -- and questions about the Church of England's opposition to same-sex marriage greeted his promotion...", 'New head of Church of England  announces program to end anti-gay bullying in schools', 'The archbishop of Canterbury has announced a campaign to stamp out anti-gay bullying in Church of England schools, acknowledging that attitudes toward sexuality have...', "The leader of the world's Anglicans is to make a five-day visit to Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Territories from Sunday, his office said.Archbishop of C...", 'The Anglican Church has appointed its first female bishop in Africa with the elevation of a priest in the tiny nation of Swaziland.Ellinah Wamukoya will serve as the...', "The world's Anglican leaders piled pressure Thursday on churches in New Hampshire and their openly gay bishop-elect, warning that if he takes office it could shatter...", "Anglicans in many parts of the world reacted angrily Wednesday to U.S. Episcopalians' confirmation of their first openly gay bishop, with some threatening to cut tie...", "New archbishop of Canterbury  formally takes office in ceremony at St. Paul's in London", "The new archbishop of Canterbury has formally taken up his post as the leader of the world's 80-million-strong Anglican Communion.The Most Rev.
