['        Mike Harrison of Norwood, N.J., is a big fan of the Allman Brothers Band. He planned to see the Southern rock icons in August at the amphitheater in Bethel, N.Y., site of the 1969 Woodstock concert. ', 'Harrison bought the tickets for $400 and got a confirmation e-mail with the shipping information. They would be sent about two weeks before the concert. But the shipping date came and went and not a word from the company. So Harrison called. He says no one ever answered and there was no way to leave a message.', 'Schmitz wanted to see her all-time favorite band, The Cure, at Allstate Arena. Her e-mail confirmation said the tickets would ship a few weeks before the event. But they never came. ', 'She disputed the charge with American Express and got the $364 credited to her account. Normally, that would be the end of the story, but not with this company. ', 'This summer Schmitz received what appeared to be legal papers from Event Tickets. They wanted her to pay $364 for the tickets she never received, a $125 termination fee, plus a penalty fee of $72. ', 'I am not aware of any other merchant who has such an outrageous policy. The people I spoke to at the major credit card companies were shocked when I told them about this. The bottom line: I would never shop at a company that has this policy.
