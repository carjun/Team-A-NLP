Glenn Greenwald just last night spoke about the new technology to evolve out of the National Security Agency is going to attempt to intercept 1 billion mobile phone calls a day.", 'No one signed up for this, Obama does not have a mandate for that.  No one has a mandate for that.', "STEPHANOPOULOS:  ...far more than political, including Secretary of State John Kerry.  He spoke out on this earlier this week saying that Snowden's revelations are putting people at risk.  Take a look.", "JOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  People may die as a consequence of what this  man did.  It is possible the United States will be attacked because terrorists may now know how to protect themselves in some way or another that they didn't know before.", 'ASSANGE:  Well, look, we have heard this rhetoric.  I myself was subject to precisely this rhetoric two, three years ago.  And it all proved to be false.  We had this terrible discussion about -- which even exists in some of the tabloid press today -- about WikiLeaks causing harm, but not a single U.S. government official, no one from the Pentagon, no one from any government says that any of our revelations in the past six years has caused anyone to come to physical harm.', 'And the revelations by Snowden, I mean, these are even more abstract than the nature of the war crimes.', 'STEPHANOPOULOS:  Have you spoken to Mr. Snowden -- are you confident he is safe right now.', "Our legal people have been in contact with Mr. Snowden.

How do you respond to Edward Snowden\'s father?', "ASSANGE:  Well, he didn't say that.  He said might be.  Mr. Snowden's father as a parent, of course he is worried in this situation, every father would be worried in this situation.
