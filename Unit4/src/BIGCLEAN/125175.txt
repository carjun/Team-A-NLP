The news broke on a slow Sunday. Boston Herald reporter Jessica Van Sack was heading home when she got an urgent call from her editor ", "Jessica Van Sack: They said there's been a kidnapping and we think it's a big story. This man may be a Rockefeller. A Rockefeller may have kidnapped his daughter. ", "Hard to think of the diminutive Rockefeller - five feet and change - as a kidnapper but his life had taken an ugly turn. He'd lost custody of his seven year old daughter, Snooks to his ex-wife. And after they moved away to London could only see his little girl on court-ordered visits back in Boston a few times a year. It was during one of those that he'd snatched the girl in broad daylight.", 'Boston livery driver, Daryll Hopkins, was a little bit in awe of his spiffy new client, Clark Rockefeller. He paid good money too. ', "July 27, 2008, Hopkins was looking forward to a $3,000 payday. Rockefeller said he and his daughter Snooks needed a ride to Newport, Rhode Island. They had a date with a senator's son. But there was a catch. A friend would be with them and he might try and get in the car too. Rockefeller wanted help getting rid of him.", 'Just past noon, Hopkins parked on this leafy block of old Boston, engine running.', 'In his mirror, Hopkins watched the man run alongside the car, holding onto the door until he lost his grip and fell to his knees with the car speeding away. ', "It was only later that Hopkins learned the man wasn't a friend or acquaintance of his client, but a social worker and that he'd just been tricked into helping Clark Rockefeller abduct his own daughter in broad daylight.", "His next call was to the little girl's mother and Rockefeller's ex-wife, Sandra Boss.", 'Frank Rudewicz, private investigator: This was the equivalent of a 48-year-old man being born in 1993, because there was no record prior to that.', "Sandra Boss's private investigator had been digging through databases trying to find out who exactly the phony Rockefeller was but there was nothing. And that had him worried. ", 'How do you track down a ghost? Could this mystery man, this cypher now take 7-year-old Snooks and erase all trace of her too? ', "Sgt. Thomas Lee Lee: We were looking at this now as a person who may be a homicide/suicide situation. We didn't know what could transpire.", "Sandra Boss: I ask you. Please, please bring Snooks back. There has to be a better way for us to solve our differences. And Reigh, honey, I love you and miss you so much and remember you're always a princess.", "But there was no response. Sandra's heartfelt pleas were met with silence. What was her daughter's name now?", 'FBI Agent Noreen Gleason: It was like every time we had a lead, we would get to a dead end.', "On day five of the investigation police got the break they were looking for. Baltimore realtor, Julie Gochar saw Rockefeller's photo on the Internet. Only his name wasn't Clark Rockefeller she told the cops. ", 'Chip had contacted the realtor by email almost a year before the abduction. He said he was a sea captain looking to settle down in Baltimore with his daughter, Muffy.', "It wasn't until April, a few months before the kidnapping, that Julie Gochar finally met her unusual client in person. He didn't look anything like a professional sailor.", 'Julie Gochar: He came in, his hat pulled completely down with his black glasses, his black plastic frame glasses, bright red dyed hair and extremely pale.', "Video: How Christian Gerhartsreiter became 'Rockefeller', 'Chichester'  (on this page)", 'Gochar showed FBI investigators the carriage house Chip had paid for in full with a $450,000 cashiers check.', 'Agents staked it out overnight, their patience paying off with a sighting of Clark the next afternoon. But where was his daughter, little Reigh?', 'Sure enough, a worried Clark Rockefeller hurried outside, but he was instantly surrounded.Agents raced inside the carriage house looking for Snooks.', 'Despite the indignity of his arrest, the man calling himself Clark Rockefellermet police questions with courtesy.', "FBI spokesperson: The individual's true name is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter. He was born in 1961 in what was then West Germany. ", 'In the days after his arrest for kidnapping his 7-year-old daughter, the true identity of the man known as Clark Rockefeller was confirmed as Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, a German national.', 'Huber remembers Gerhartsreiter as a child always thinking he was better than everyone else. He picked fights with his friends, she said, berating one friend in her own store.', 'Luise Huber: (In German) All of a sudden Christian shouted at him, "Stay out, you dog!"', "That reinvention began in Connecticut in 1978. Gerhartsreiter enrolled at a local high school, moving in with Ed Savio's family. ", 'Ed Savio: He came with these interesting, the white sunglasses, his clothes were much tighter.', 'Ed Savio: He was trying to do his version of what he thought an Americanized accent was', 'He told the Savios he was the son of a wealthy industrialist. Sometimes he hinted he was European royalty, implying that living with the Savios was really kind of slumming it.', "It seemed to the young Savio that Chris was practicing how to lie. And that's not all: Savio says the German student changed his hairstyle and the way he dressed, measuring the effects. In retrospect, Savio thinks he was witnessing a future con-man evolve before his very eyes.", "Mike Taibbi: Whatever he was gonna do in this country, he'd started in your household.", "Ed Savio: Yeah, it's sort of like seeing the caterpillar you know and you see them start to build the cocoon.", 'Gerhartsreiter didn\'t go back to Germany. Instead he moved across country enrolling at the University of Wisconsin. Fellow student Richie Riddle immediately noticed something about the new boy calling himself "Chris," his temper.', 'Richie Riddle, fellow student: It was the sort of outburst that you look at and you think this is a little over the top. And you walk away from it going, steer clear of that guy.', 'When he refused to leave a party she was hosting, a burly resident advisor had to manhandle him back to his room.', 'Richie Riddle: His temper flared. You know, "Who are you? Get your hands off of me? Do you know who I am?"', "She didn't have to worry much longer. A few months later, Gerhartsreiter was gone, a dropout who'd just disappeared.", 'Meredith Brucker says this new man about town had no trouble endearing himself to everyone.', "Meredith Brucker: My first impression of him was here's a young man who's well dressed, well spoken, fun and friendly, and very intelligent. ", 'Of course, Christopher Chichester was nothing more than the latest invention of German student Christian Gerhartsreiter.', "Cori Woods: Every person I've spoken to who has a daughter, he asked the daughters out.", "As the 24-year-old Gerharstreiter looked for friends, allies, victims, he wasn't really choosy. Cori Woods says she was just 12 years old when he asked her to a movie.", 'Cori Woods: And then after that you know it got a little weird. And he started asking other inappropriate girls out.', "And so in time, the town's love affair with baronet Chichester started to sour. He became just another local eccentric who faded into memory...", 'That is, until he resurfaced, decades later in New York, with a new name: Clark Rockefeller.', 'William Quigley: The waiters would refer to him as "Mr. Rockefeller" and "How are you Mr. Rockefeller?" He had this air about him.', 'Christian Gerhartsreiter was living in New York in the early 1990s when he hit upon the name that would stay with him the longest. Clark Rockefeller. ', 'William Quigley, artist: The first painting I see when I walk into the home is a 1969, 1970 Rothko and I was pretty impressed by this.', "Just as impressive was Clark's heady entertaining. There was never a shortage of champagne for his dinner guests. On the town there were nights spent at tony private clubs.", 'But never openly brash. Quigley says Clark hated drawing attention to himself. He walked down the street with his hat pulled down over his face.', 'William Quigley: Clark was a very private person. I recall him not wanting to be noticed and a little bit reclusive.', "Sandra, a woman of substance- Stanford and Harvard-educated and a heavy hitter in the city. Each week she'd commute to her job at McKinseys, a high powered consulting firm a hundred miles away. ", 'Emily Miller, babysitter: She was very into her career, Sandy was. She was in Boston most of the time that Clark and Snooks were up here.', 'Snooks, whose given name was Reigh, was born in May 2001- the newest addition to the Rockefeller dynasty. Emily Miller was her babysitter for two years and she says Clark did most of the care-giving.', 'The 16-year-old found Rockefeller impressive, a loving and attentive dad who brought his daughter to museums and art galleries and had her reading by age two...', 'Emily Miller: They would dress alike. Clark would have his khaki pants, his navy blue polo and brown boat shoes and then she would have you know the little brown sandals and the khakis.', "And Don McLeay, Rockefeller's neighbor and friend, thought Clark was a bit too possessive.", 'In 2006, they left their life of isolation behind. Clark and Sandra bought a $3 million brownstone in Boston and enrolled Snooks in a top notch private school.', "It's one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country. Boston's Beacon Hill. And Clark Rockefeller fit right in. In the summer of 2006, before all the trouble began, you might have seen him in the park with his daughter, Snooks. Or dining at the ritzy Algonquin club, a few blocks away.", 'Not long after, Sandra Boss filed for divorce. Rockefeller confided in his friend, fashion consultant, Amy Patt.', "Video: How Christian Gerhartsreiter became 'Rockefeller', 'Chichester'  (on this page)", "But Rockefeller's apparent torment over his failed marriage was nothing compared to his reaction to what happened next. A family court judge in Boston ruled that Sandra could move to London and take 7-year old Snooks with her. What's more the judge restricted Clark to three supervised visits a year with the daughter to whom he'd been Mr. Mum and Dad all her life.", 'Amy Patt: That period of time was almost an instantaneous character change. He lost all of his bubble, all of his passion for anything. He became secretive and defensive.', 'Amy looks back now and wonders whether she could have stopped what happened next: the abduction.', "Of course unlike his previous incarnations as the German student and the English baronet Rockefeller wasn't planning to disappear alone. He was planning to take his daughter with him. Had he cracked? Had the veteran con-man finally started to believe his own lies?", 'After his arrest for abducting his own daughter, the man who calls himself Clark Rockefeller, swapped his tony post-divorce bachelor pad for a 12 by 12 foot jail cell. ', "While he waited for his trial, Gerhartsreiter sat down for his only television interview with NBC's Natalie Morales, defense attorney at his side.", "Steven Hrones, defense attorney: He doesn't remember anything about that early life.", "Clark Rockefeller: I really couldn't tell you. Perhaps at some point we can do a DNA test to really find out.", "Gerhartsreiter claims Sandra's crazy work schedule also got in the way of her relationship with Snooks. He describes Sandra as an absent mother. When she won full custody, he says it was devastating... and not just for him.", 'ClarkRockefeller: It was brutal. It was absolutely brutal. Worst of all, the separation happened four days before Christmas.', 'Natalie Morales: How did you tell your daughter at the time, what was happening to her?', 'Sandra Boss declined to talk to us on camera but she did say in a written statement that we should be skeptical of anything Gerhartsreiter told us given, what she called, his "history of deceitful behavior."', 'And it should be noted that a judge gave her full custody of little Reigh and only supervised visits to the father three times a year.', 'ClarkRockefeller: She had been taken away from me for eight months. Eight very cruel months.', 'When his trial opened in a Boston courtroom last month, Gerhartsreiter had swapped his prison overalls for a blazer and khakis.', 'He had pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him: two charges of assault and battery against the social worker, one count of giving a false name to the cops. As for the kidnapping itself? He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. ', 'Prosecutor David Deakin argued that the evidence proved something far different than insanity.', 'The abduction had taken a matter of seconds but, according to the prosecutor it was no moment of madness. It had taken months to prepare for a life on the run.', 'The Baltimore realtor testified that the defendant had been looking for a house as far back as November 2007, even before Sandra had moved to London. ', 'Next the prosecutors said, Gerhartsreiter lined up his unwitting accomplices for the big day.', 'And then a sometime sailing pal of Gerhartsreiter testified that she drove him and his daughter to New York-- one leg of the getaway.', 'Prosecutor: Did he give you specific instructions about what you should do in preparation for the trip?', "And the prosecutor's star witness had perhaps been the victim of the biggest of all his cons. After all she'd spent 12 years married to him.", "On day three of the Clark Rockefeller trial, the witness everyone had been waiting for: Sandra Boss, the supposedly sophisticated ex-wife who said she'd been duped too. She had lived alongside a man she thought for years was a Rockefeller.", 'But the cultivated man who wooed her had morphed into a controlling husband with a terrible temper.', 'Sandra Boss: Very intelligent, very polite... could talk about anything. He wanted to walk me to and from work everyday. He began to be less supportive of my seeing my friends.', 'Sandra Boss: The defendant, particularly in the early years was unhappy with the limited amount that I earned at my job and put a lot of pressure on me about it.', 'Though her salary soared past the one million dollar mark, she said that pressure was relentless, her husband insisting she go right back to work after the birth of their daughter Reigh.', 'And years later during the divorce and custody proceedings, she said it was money on his mind, even more than Reigh. ', 'Sandra Boss: The gist of the discussion was that I could have full custody of Reigh. That I could move with her to London or anywhere else. And that in exchange I was to give him a million dollars.', 'Here was the crux of the prosecution case. Rockefeller, far from being a deranged father driven to crime after being separated from his daughter, had been perfectly willing to give her up for money. ', 'The next day defense attorney Jeffrey Denner had a chance to cross-examine Sandra Boss. At times it sounded like she was the one on trial. ', "Sandra Boss: The fact that we're talking to each other right now suggests this was a complicated marriage to get out of.", "Defense: Do you think other people's marriages are not complicated to get out of? ", 'Denner: I think realistically and very candidly speaking, she made it possible for him to be who he was.', "Bottom line, the defense suggested, it just wasn't credible that the whip-smart Sandra Boss hadn't guessed her husband was lying about who he was.", 'Denner: We used our cross-examination of her to illustrate that she would not be a good measuring stick to ascertain and to reflect the craziness of our client.', "SandraBoss: I think consistently you're making a connection between business intelligence and personal intelligence. I came from a place where people don't jay walk, it's a very honest place. It had never in my entire life occurred to me that I could be living with someone who was lying about such basic stuff. I'm not saying I made a good choice in a husband. It's pretty obvious I had a blind spot.", "The defense gained one last admission from Sandra Boss before she was excused - an admission that seemed to support her ex-husband's insanity defense.", "SandraBoss: I saw behavior that made me think that he wasn't all well - definitely. but it's what I would describe as obsessive kind-of behaviors.", 'Rockefeller was a victim of grief, the defense argued, literally driven insane by the loss of his child. ', 'ClarkRockefeller: She was taken from me four days before Christmas which was evil. I just want to be with her. I want to get her up in the morning, send her off to school, walk her to the bus.', 'ClarkRockefeller: Give her something to eat at night, and put her back to bed. And the next day the same thing again.', 'Dr. Howe: It did impair his ability to recognize the wrongfulness of his actions.', "The defense team's second expert, celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow, said that after Rockefeller lost his daughter, his delusions got so bad, he thought he was communicating with her telepathically.", 'And Reigh had an urgent message for her father, Rockefeller claimed. "Rescue me."', 'After six days of testimony peering into the mind of Clark Rockefeller, the jurors were about to get the case. But regardless of the outcome, on the other side of the country far more serious questions were being asked. ', 'For thirty years Clark Rockefeller had created and discarded identites at will - college student, entrepreneur, aristocrat.', 'But for six days in a Boston courtroom, the man who could talk his way out of anything had to sit and listen as a prosecutor and defense attorney battled to define him.', 'Prosecution: The evidence in this case will show that the defendant is a self-centered, controlling, and manipulative man who was angry.', 'A jury of eight women and four men - their foreman a lecturer at Harvard Law school- would now decide once and all - was he a criminal?', 'It took five days for the Boston jurors to reach a verdict. Rockefeller stood tight lipped to receive it.', 'He looked on the verge of tears as the jury found him guilty of kidnapping his daughter. ', 'Jusge at sentencing: The defendant shall be sentenced to four to five years in a state prison.', 'A day after the verdict, nine of the twelve jurors sat down exclusively with Dateline to explain their decision.', "Sarah, juror: I don't think anyone else in the jury, really bought the delusional hypothesis at all. I think he was very smart and cunning and got away with a lot of lies for a very long time. And probably had some kind of personality disorder of some sort, the experts seemed to agree on that. But we don't think that it had anything to do with his crime.", "During their five days of deliberations, the jurors say they went through each of the charges methodically, re-visiting testimony, much of which they'd found gripping.", 'Sarah Funke: I was very troubled by the fact that he seemed to get away with a lot, all the lies he said kind of went unnoticed to the people he told them to. And it kind of strikes me as interesting that our society is so trusting.', "Across the country in California, Meredith Brucker had been watching the trial with a kind of morbid fascination. She'd known him 25 years ago as baronet Chichester, that charming man she'd met at church. ", 'Meredith Brucker: I think I remember a little single bed pushed against the wall. It was horrible.', "Years later that squalid room would be part of a crime scene. Chris Chichester, an earlier phony name for Gerhartsreiter, the phony Clark Rockefeller on trial in Boston, was named as a person of interest in the disappearance and possible murders of his San Marino landlady's son and daughter-in-law, John and Linda Sohus.", "Frank Girardot, newspaper editor: When they first disappeared on February 8th 1985, it wasn't that big a deal.", 'In fact, Linda Sohus had told her best friend Sue Coffman that she was leaving town for a few weeks, her husband had a job interview.', "Sue Coffman, Linda Sohus' friend: That was the last time I talked to her ever. I never heard from Linda again. Just disappears off the face of the earth, forever as far as I could tell.", "She did receive a postcard a few months later with a French postmark, signed Linda. But the handwriting didn't seem quite right.", 'Sue Coffman: And I just knew in my heart some bad stuff had happened to her somehow.', "Linda's sister Kathy filed a missing person's report but police didn't seem too be doing much.", 'In the meantime, Chris Chichester continued to live in the Sohus guest-house, until one day someone noticed that a section of the backyard had been dug up. A plumbing problem, he explained. Shortly thereafter, the 13th baronet disappeared as well.', "A few years later Chichester, using still another name, Christopher Crowe reportedly tried to sell the Sohus' pickup truck in Connecticut. But before the police could question him... he vanished, again.", "And that's where the investigation into the disappearance of John and Linda Sohus stalled until 1994, when a clue surfaced back in San Marino, California. It turned a missing persons case into a possible homicide case.", 'Workers installing a pool in the backyard of the old Sohus home, which had been resold, stumbled on three plastic bags filled with the remains of a man. ', "Frank Girardot: Sheriff's homicide came out. The forensic anthropologist determined at the time that that there was significant head trauma on the skull.", "Police couldn't positively identify the body, but Sue Coffman was certain it was her best friend's husband, John.", 'Their next gruesome discovery made detectives eager to track down the man who had called himself the Baronet Chichester.', "But even though investigators had figured out Chichester was really Christian Gerhartsreiter, they didn't know where to start looking for him. ", 'That is - until his arrest for kidnapping last summer under the name Clark Rockefeller.', 'Last August, investigators in LA County went back to the property where Chris Chichester had lived side by side with the Sohuses, and where that unidentified body had been found. This time they brought cadaver dogs and sonar equipment.', "Steven Whitmore, spokesperson, LA County Sherrif's department: This is a case that has been going on for over a quarter of the century and they're gonna stay with it until they hopefully do solve it, resolve it, and bring whoever it is to justice.", 'Giradot thinks postcards sent from Europe after the Sohuses disappeared could be the biggest clue left.', "Frank Girardot: If they can somehow determine that Linda didn't write the postcards, they know she's dead. And then, perhaps, somehow link those postcards to the travels of Gerhartsreiter-- it may be a slam dunk. ", 'So far the grand jury has examined the reports of three handwriting experts. One of them, Sheila Lowe, showed us how she came to her conclusion that Linda did indeed write the postcards.', "But it's a subjective science. In fact more art than science. The other two handwriting experts disagree with her.", "Kathy Jacoby: I've come to peace with the fact that she's dead. Now I would just like this man who I think has something to do with it, to become accountable.", "Linda's sister wants Gerhartsreiter to talk to L.A. County investigators. So far he's refused.", 'He did, however, tell Dateline that he had nothing to do with their killing, if in fact they were killed - as far as he knew.', 'Gerhartsreiter has never been named a suspect in the case, just a person of interest. ', 'Mike Taibbi: As numerous as all the bits of circumstantial evidence which point to him, how can you link it to him at all?', "Frank Girardot: There's plenty of circumstantial homicide cases made all the time.", "Frank Girardot: They are very frustrated. It's a mystery that everybody wants to solve but nobody has all the puzzle pieces."]
