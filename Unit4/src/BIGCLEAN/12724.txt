The landlord has the right to kick them out, but for $100?  ', 'After this happened the ins co was called to task because they did it because the lady short paid her last bill by $1.', 'My guess is that these people where often very late with the rent. Whether their fault or not. Landlord gets tired of it. They also maybe paying lower rent that the landlord could fetch now. So when the homeowner shorts the landlord $100 over a dispute (valid or not). The landlord uses that as a excuse and evicts. Gets a new renter that pays on time and pays more per month.', "Not saying that's right, not saying it's wrong, but it's the only reason I can see anyone evicting anybody over $100.", 'Finally, lets assume that after months of legal work, during which time you have received no rent, you finally get an eviction approval from the court.  The renters now seeing the "light" pay up past due rent, realizing things are serious, hoping to stay.  They pay all they have, but it is $100 short of what they owe you.', 'As the landlord you can now accept that payment, let them stay... in which case the "clock starts ticking all over again"... meaning that if they come up short on the next payment, or not pay at all, you have to go through months of legal paperwork and hearings all over again.', 'THAT IS WHAT happens for most evictions.   I know, because I have been a cop for 21 years.', 'I am not saying it is right or wrong, but how many missed payments, partial payments, etc. do you feel a landlord should forgo to be compassionate enough for you?... hmm?  Most single family residental landlords are not much better off then the people they rent to.  Many, are victims of the recession who became landlords because they could not sell a house.', 'I truly feel bad for the kids. The parents should never have left the situation come down to this.

', 'The initial lawsuit to eviction was based on failure of not paying any rent, not based on the -$100 due after paying all the rest.', 'The police officers needs to be reprimanded as well for not understanding a court order of eviction.  If the eviction order has been altered in which this case was when the people paid all this back rent to the landlord, the court ordered eviction had to be redone in order to carry out the process has to be reviewed and redone for it to become valid once again.', 'They say a" picture is worth a thousand words " but I don\'t think that we are getting the whole picture!', "Maybe they should have paid their damn rent?

Once the landlord took the back rent money, then his right to evict went out the window.', 'In an eviction case, the people do not have to pay any rent to the landlord and are given a date to be out on their own accord.  This is not what has happened here.  They caught up on the majority of their rent minus the $100, and that voids the eviction court order once the landlord accepted the money.', "You  know you are right and I am wrong, thanks for pointing out my mistake. I  am not even going to make any half-baked excuses, I didn't pay  attention.", "I don't care if you misspelled evlqn.  People aren't perfect, so why even make a fuss over a misspelled world in their posts.  That's the point I'm trying to get across to you.  We don't need the spelling correction police on the Vine.", 'What has happened here is criminal and the people definitely has a right to sue.  When they paid everything minus the 100, the eviction process had been altered and a new eviction papers must be drawn up for it to go through.', "Everyone's gonna wring their hands and moan about how bad things are and how terrible the landlord is, some authoritarians are gonna go all Rand Paul and say they should just die or something, others are going to assume that they were bad renters and should have been evicted a long time ago, and a few people are going to advocate violence against someone.", 'And in the meantime, this family will be sleeping in their car, all of their posessions lost or destroyed, and nobody beating their chest in outrage on this thread will give a damn.', "I don't want one red cent of my tax dollars spent to save these morons.
