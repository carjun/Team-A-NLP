You see the damage to the wing of one of the planes right there. It wasn't the only mishap, by the way, at an airport overnight. Abc's david kerley has much more now on the growing safety concerns this morning. Reporter: They were taxiing for takeoff. Scandinavian just clipped the regional jet. Reporter: At newark airport a big wide body scandinavian airlines flight headed to norway swiped a smaller united jet. Got some serious tail damage. It was a big bang, we all kind of shook in our seats. Reporter: Both jets were headed to the runway, the united express jet going to nashville this front when the bigger saf jet turned right. Its left wing sliced into the smaller jet's tail. Apparently it did affect the tail end of the plane in some way. All of a sudden there were large fire trucks around us. Reporter: Then just hours later, another ground mishap. This time in chicago when a polish jetliner clipped wings with a lufthansa cargo jet. Both were low-speed encounters. Much different than this at jfk when a regional jet was spun around like a top by a much larger aircraft. And here's the worry. These so-called runway incursions are a concern but the number of incidents keep going up. A thousand a year and in the first three months of this year, a 16% increase in incursions.
