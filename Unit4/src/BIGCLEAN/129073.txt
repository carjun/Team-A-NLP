['                    One of the biggest attractions at the Louisville zoo was a floppy-eared baby name...', '        One of the biggest attractions at the Louisville zoo was a floppy-eared baby named Scottie. Cute and kind of cuddly, at least for an elephant.', 'But on this day, he shared the spotlight with another media celebrity: a spunky girl named Erica whose infectious laugh and incredible story captivated a city.', 'Louisville, the home of Churchill Downs, is famous for its big horse race, the Kentucky Derby, so it knows a thing or two about long shots. But in betting parlance, the odds of this story ever finding a happy ending were off the board, virtually impossible.', 'Would a little girl ever gain the strength, not only to recover, but to come back whole? And would a dedicated detective, not only crack his biggest case, but keep the emotional promise he made?', 'A 2-year-old wild about Dora the Explorer, Erica lived here with her mom, Earon Harper.', 'On May 18, 2006, police got a frantic 911 call. When they arrived at the house, the man who made the call flagged them down.', 'Detective Tom Barth and Officer Larry Riley rushed into the house and found a horrifying scene. A woman almost certainly dead on the floor.', 'The officers had to step over the woman to get to the back room, where, on the bed, they saw the little girl. Motionless.', 'There was no time to wait for an ambulance. A sergeant at the scene barked the order for a police car to take her to the hospital. But first, the officers had to get her to the car.', 'When they finally reached the car, they handed her to two EMS-firefighters in the backseat, and another officer, Steve Kelsey, jumped behind the wheel.', 'The NBC station, WAVE-TV, captured the dramatic final moments of the high-speed motorcade, as it made the left turn toward the hospital.', 'Harold, a retired factory worker, and Judith, a homemaker, talked to their daughter nearly every day. So the silence was strange.', 'Ebony: There was a whole bunch of people standing outside. It was taped off. And it was a mess down there.', 'Kotb: When you saw that jewelry, and you knew it was your daughter. What went through you, Judy?', 'Judith: I knew she was hurt by the police rushing her down the street that I saw on TV.', 'Kotb: Now, in your experience, how many times have there been babies who were victims?', 'A video camera rolled as Det. Arnold processed the crime scene, honing in on clues. ', 'Det. Arnold noticed something on the bed that would burn in his memory throughout the investigation.', 'Det. Arnold: The first thing that immediately hit me was a Dora the Explorer pillow. And it had blood on it.', 'Det. Arnold: That was probably a little emotion spilling over. There was a baby that had been shot as well as an adult that was killed. And we were expecting at that point the baby to die.', 'Dr. Moriarty: Now, and on this one, you can see part of the bullets and some broken bone.', 'Dr. Moriarty: What a blessing, as opposed to the bullet going through and damaging and destroying everything.', 'But despite the repair, brain injuries are unpredictable, and Dr. Moriarty urged caution.', 'More leads came into focus: a bloody footprint; three big red soda cans; and two cigarette butts by the bed.', 'Det. Arnold: The second one had an ash about an inch long. Someone had left that cigarette and rushed out of there.', 'The detective was also learning about Earon, and the more he found out, the more he was drawn in.', 'Mostly by herself, Earon was raising four children, including Erica, the only one home the night of the shooting, and Ebony, the oldest at 16.', 'Earon worked at Churchill downs as a hostess, meeting celebrities like actor Jason Priestly. But she had to go on disability because of MS and a painful inflammatory condition known as fibromyalgia.', 'Even so, her parents could not imagine who would have shot her and little Erica or why. And that just ramped up their own fears that the shooter or shooters might come back.', 'At the crime scene, Det. Arnold was searching for answers, combing the house for more clues.', 'Police brought him in to see if he had any information that could help the investigation.', 'Detective: One of the very last people to call her, to talk to her by phone, was you. Which is why we want to talk to you.', 'Quisenberry provided some names for investigators to check out and repeatedly offered to assist police in any way he could.', 'Four days after she was shot, Erica woke up and started talking to her family. In the ICU, Erica was feisty and combative. Her neuro-surgeon, Dr. Moriarty, said that was a positive sign. Her brain was re-booting.', 'But for Jessie Halladay, crime reporter for the Louisville Courier-Journal, what elevated this story was simple: little Erica.', 'Jessie Halladay: The public concern from the very beginning was always that there was a 2-year-old involved.', 'After nearly two weeks in the hospital, Erica was well enough to move to nearby Frazier Rehabilitation Institute. But the hard work was just beginning. The brain injury had damaged her ability to walk and talk.', 'With still no idea why her sister and mother were shot, Ebony and her grandparents remained fearful.', 'Back at the police station, Det. Arnold was trying to figure out his next move when his investigation caught a lucky break.', 'Det. Arnold: Even the cover, the front and the back cover were just soggy, to the point where when I started to look through this, the very first time, and flipped through, and pages are still sticking together.', 'Det. Arnold: --literally licked my thumb and my forefinger and went through it, page by page.', 'Det. Arnold: I was able to find stuck all the way down in the binding of the book an automobile insurance card.', 'Det. Arnold: I ask him if he knew why his manual would have been in a drainage ditch in Louisville, Kentucky.', 'His Cadillac. The break-in happened on the night of May 17, just a few hours before Earon Harper was found dead.', 'And on the security tape, Rick looked closely and saw the man in the baseball cap leaning through the window of the enclosed pharmacy section, seemingly checking out names from pill bottles. ', 'Over and over, Det. Arnold stared at the grainy Walgreens tape. The man in the baseball cap looked familiar.', 'Just 27 days after being shot in the head, Erica was released from rehab and met officer and pastor Steve Kelsey and her other rescuers. It was nothing short of a miracle.', 'Jessie Halladay: To see the looks on those faces and know that she had survived was a pretty powerful moment.', 'Harold Harper: Just great to have her there, you know, to get her home from the hospital.', 'It was a home she already knew. Grandparents Judith and Harold Harper, both 69, were waving good bye to their care-free golden years.', 'Four years before the shootings, Harold had retired from his long-time meat-packing job, expecting to ride his Harley into the sunset.', 'Together, they gave Erica a secure home. Day by day, she was gaining strength but things were not normal.', 'But there was something else that terrified Erica, and it was harder to understand.', 'Rick circulated a freeze frame of the man and hoped someone could identify him. Then he waited.', 'Eight months later, Rick got some promising news. A detective thought he recognized the Walgreens guy from another shooting.', 'His name? Kenneth Williams. Rick compared several Williams mug shots with the Walgreens video.', 'Turner: James and Kenneth Williams, uh, they had supposedly hit a lick on a woman.', 'Five days after interviewing Turner, Det. Arnold was ready to bring in Quisenberry and Williams for some tough questioning.', 'Jessie: With Erica being so young and with her grandparents raising her and there was so much interest to begin with, we wanted to go back and see how she was doing.', 'Jessie: Erica was in it from the very beginning. You know, she was trying to write with my pen. She wanted to color on my notebook. I was just struck by her curiosity.', 'Jessie reported that Erica lost all sight in her right eye. She also had a small scar on her chin, where the bullet in her head had exited.', 'Jessie: I think people still wonder how she survived. I still wonder how she survived.', 'But Judith Harper had faith all along that justice would be done and, most of all, faith in Detective Arnold. After all, the promise he made to solve the case was to her.', 'Fifteen months after the shootings, Quisenberry and Williams voluntarily came down to headquarters. Each knew the other was there. ', 'As a tactic, Det. Arnold even walked Williams past a closed-circuit monitor where he could see Quisenberry in an interview room.', 'Det. Arnold needed both suspects to admit they were in the house when the shootings went down. That would back up murder charges against both of them, no matter who pulled the trigger.', 'Quisenberry was interviewed first. He said he knew nothing about the crime. But as the interrogation wore on, he started blaming the man in the other room.', 'Det. Arnold: And I collected those cigarette butts, and one of those has your DNA on it....', 'Now, Quisenberry was admitting he had visited his friend Earon that day. But he insisted he left before anyone was shot.', 'Rick sensed that Quisenberry and his story were crumbling so he went for the jugular, demanding he come clean.', 'Det. Arnold: Him saying he was in that house was critical. That becomes the most important thing he says in the whole statement.', 'With the interview nearly over, Quisenberry had a request, one of the strangest Rick had ever heard.', 'Quisenberry (during interrogation): I know this is hard to ask police this s - - -. I need to smoke a blunt.', 'Williams kept insisting he was not even in the house. But Rick needed to get him inside, as he had with Quisenberry.', 'Det. Arnold: I wanted him in the house, not outside by a car, not down the street at the stop sign.', 'Det. Arnold: I literally got done going to the bathroom and made the phone call from the bathroom.', 'But through it all, other questions swirled, too. What happened in that house on Wilson avenue and would the men involved in the shootings pay for their crimes?', 'Those answers would come three years later, April, 2009, in a Louisville courtroom, where James Quisenberry and Kenneth Williams stood trial for the murder of Earon Harper and attempted murder of little Erica. ', 'Whatever the verdict, one man would not be there to hear it. For Harold Harper, facing the defendants was simply too much to bear.', 'It was an emotional trial. Co-prosecutor Mark Baker, with two young daughters himself, cried in his opening statement.', 'Once he determined that there was still life in that little body, you can imagine what the officers did there at the scene.', 'She had invited her friend Quisenberry to buy pills before. But this time, the deal deteriorated into robbery and ultimately murder when Williams came along with his gun.', 'The trial took just one week, and there was little doubt that Quisenberry would be convicted of some crime. He got manslaughter and a maximum 45 years in prison.', 'Guilty of murder, and then a life sentence with no possibility of parole, spared the death penalty only because one holdout juror would not vote for it.', 'Last fall, we caught up with the playful 6-year-old at the zoo, where she briefly stopped her fun and games to talk.', 'Their prayers answered, Judith and Harold are raising a happy-go-lucky first-grader who still loves Dora but also now soccer, SpongeBob, and bike-riding.', "To find out more about Kosair Children's Hospital; Dr. Thomas Moriarty, the Norton Neuroscience Institute physician who saved her life; and ways you can help support children like Erica, click on the links below:"]
