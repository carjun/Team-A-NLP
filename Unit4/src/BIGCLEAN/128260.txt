[' Did your child walk and talk early? Does she have a brain like a sponge? Scribble magnificently? Love learning? Ask questions that leave you marveling (and scrambling to Google an answer)? ', "You can't make your child be gifted, but you can help your kid reach his or her potential. ", ' Wow, clearly she\'s a genius! Or, um, maybe not. "Gifted" has become one of the most tossed-about words in the parenting lexicon. Unfortunately -- sorry, but let\'s get this out of the way right up front -- it\'s also one of the most misused.  The vast majority of children are not gifted. Only 2 to 5 percent of kids fit the bill, by various estimates. Of those, only one in 100 is considered highly gifted. Prodigies (those wunderkinds who read at 2 and go to college at 10) are rarer still -- like one to two in a million. And despite the boom in infant-stimulation techniques, educational DVDs, learning toys, and enrichment classes, those numbers haven\'t been increasing. You can\'t build giftedness; it\'s mostly built in.   Still, it\'s hard to resist scrutinizing your child for signs of greatness. (Those "signs" in the first paragraph, by the way? Not one guarantees an intellectual giant.) The growing fascination with giftedness is part natural impulse to see our offspring as special, part wanting to be sure a child\'s needs are met and maybe a bit of hoping for a competitive edge in the increasingly cutthroat school-admission process -- or bragging rights.
