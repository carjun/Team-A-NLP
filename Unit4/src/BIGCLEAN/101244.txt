', "Pentagon officials have declined to comment as did Sikorsky, the helicopter's manufacturer.", "Aviation Week reported that the chopper's tail appears to be highly modified compared to a standard H-60 Black Hawk. The report noted that stealth features on a helicopter usually aim to dampen rotor noise and reduce infrared signals.", "Noise reduction can be accomplished by adding blades to the rotors and changing the way the pilot flies the chopper, such as flying in a manner to reduce the rotor's rpm, the report said.", "As for reducing the likelihood of the aircraft chopper giving off infrared signals, Aviation Week pointed to an earlier helicopter prototype that had a complex exhaust system and fresh air ejectors to lessen the aircraft's heat signals.", "If the modifications did reduce the helicopter's sound, the raid still was noisy enough to attract attention. A computer programmer, ", ', was startled by the noise and posted a note to Twitter: "Helicopter hovering above Abbotabad at 1AM (is a rare event)."', 'Citing a retired special operations aviator, Military Times reported that the helicopter\'s technology appeared similar to a F-117 Stealth Fighter. According to its manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the "startling, unconventional shape" of that aircraft, also known as the F-117 Nighthawk, ushered in the era of stealth technology with its "low-observable technology."', 'The source added that the helicopter\'s windshield might have been specially coated to help evade radar detection, making it "very plausible" that pilots wearing night-vision goggles would have a harder time with visibility. ', "The apparent modifications might have played a role in the chopper's hard landing as well, the retired aviator told the Times, because the additions could have added several hundred pounds to the weight of the craft.", 'Photos of the downed helicopter sparked a flurry of speculation about the design in the days after the raid, as the sections that survived the blast looked unlike anything the military has openly acknowledged, the Times report noted.', 'The downed chopper was one of two Black Hawks that transported the commandos who carried out the raid from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan to the Abbottabad, Pakistan compound. ', 'The original plan to place a rappelling team on the roof with a second team dropping into the courtyard was jettisoned when one of the helicopters, its blades clawing at hot, too-thin air, had to put down hard. Both choppers landed in the courtyard, behind one ring of walls with more to go. ', 'The strong Pakistani military presence in Abbottabad, a garrison city with a military academy near the compound, provided a cover of sorts for the Americans. No one would be particularly surprised to hear choppers flying at night. ', '"We had to blow the helicopter," CIA Director Leon Panetta said, "and that probably woke up a lot of people, including the Pakistanis." ', "About 10 days before the raid, President Obama was briefed on the plan, NBC News reported. It included keeping two backup helicopters just outside Pakistani airspace in case something went wrong. But Obama felt that was risky. If the SEALs needed help, they couldn't afford to wait for backup. ", 'He said the operation needed a plan in case the SEALs had to fight their way out. So two Chinooks were sent into Pakistani airspace, loaded with backup teams, just in case. One of those Chinooks landed in the compound after the Black Hawk became inoperable. ', "The raiders scrambled aboard the remaining Black Hawk and a Chinook, bin Laden's body with them, and flew to the USS Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea. The ground operation had taken about 40 minutes. ", 'Only after the Americans left the area was Pakistan informed of what had happened on its territory. ', 'Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen called Pakistani Army chief Ashfaq Kayani to tell him that an operation he had not known about was complete, a U.S. official told AP.
