They sell earplugs at rock concerts, nightclubs, even rehearsal studios.', '"Many people who are unemployed in Spain," says Torremocha, referring to the six million without jobs, "don\'t have anything to invest."', "Many people who are unemployed in Spain don't have anything to investMarco Torremocha ", "But he did, thanks to severance pay after 11 years on construction sites, following the bust of the real estate boom -- a big part of Spain's financial crisis.", '"You work for a private company and now you think broader," he said, explaining that he risked 2,000 euros [$2,600] -- a small portion of his severance pay -- as seed money for the earplug business.', "Stark didn't have any startup cash. But he seems to have marketing in his DNA -- his family has a clothing store business in his native Ohio -- and he'd previously tried other ventures in Madrid, including a tourism magazine, that flopped.", 'But this time, Stark says, "failure is not an option. I get frustrated with people who say \'can\'t.\' I hate hearing people be negative."', "Both men complain they've been exposed to loud music without hearing protection and sometimes have low-level ringing in their ears long after the concerts are done.", "Their earplugs are called Stark Plugs.

For two euros [$2.60], you get two yellow earplugs, made from a soft, foam-like thermoplastic polymer called Goma EVA. They come in a tiny clear plastic case that fits easily in your pocket.', 'They brought five vending machines to the festival, and Stark wrote in an email on Friday: "Next year we should definitely take fifty machines and put them everywhere."', 'Some of the buyers in Barcelona, Stark added, are concert photographers who must stay long hours exposed to the loud music.', 'Failure is not an option. I get frustrated with people who say \'can\'t.\'"Phillip Stark', "In Madrid, Wurlitzer Ballroom, a small nightclub just off Madrid's Gran Via street, was one of the first places to sell Stark Plugs. Manager Alvaro Villacis said the earplug machine is a novelty -- for his club and many others in Spain.", 'Most of his 15-member staff already use them for protection, including himself. "I don\'t want to go deaf," Villacis said.', "On a night that I visited in May, a band called Trono de Sangre (Blood Throne) was playing at top decibel.
