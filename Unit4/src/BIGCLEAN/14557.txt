['A landlord removes furniture from a home after the tenants were evicted in Lafayette, Colo.', 'The $75 billion plan is intended to slow foreclosures by offering a package of financial incentives to prod lenders and mortgage servicers to modify more loans. Another $200 billion will be spent to provide more capital to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie, and raise by $50 billion the limit on how many loans those agencies can acquire. ', 'Servicers who modify loans say they risk getting sued by investors, who may claim the changes in terms cost them money. The Obama final plan did not include earlier proposals to offer servicers legal protection from those lawsuits.', 'In the meantime, banks and loan servicers like ResCap, which is already making 5 million outbound calls a month to homeowners, are bracing for a heavy volume of incoming calls sparked by the announcement of the foreclosure relief effort. ', 'The plan also only applies to owner-occupied homes. Those who may have rented out their house because they can\'t afford the mortgage will be considered "investors," none of whom will be eligible.', 'Mortgage modifications made under the plan expire in five years. The hope is that the housing market and borrower incomes will have recovered by then. If not, the payment reverts to the higher, unaffordable level. ', 'A second, and growing, group of borrowers now owe more on their mortgage than their house is worth. Roughly one in five homeowners with mortgages are in this category.', 'Homeowners who do convince their lender to forgive part of their principal face another hurdle in a falling real estate market, according to Resler.
