['  Ubisoft South Park: The Stick of Truth will arrive on current-generation consoles and the PC this holiday season, Ubisoft announced Monday at its E3 press conference. "South Park: The Stick of Truth," the upcoming role-playing game being developed by "Fallout: New Vegas" and "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II" maker Obsidian Entertainment, is coming out this holiday season for current-generation consoles and the PC, publisher Ubisoft said Monday at its Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference in Los Angeles.While "The Stick of Truth" has been out in the open ever since December 2011 when the game was first revealed on that month\'s cover of Game Informer Magazine, its ultimate fate was left up in the air after its original publisher THQ made its slow and painful slump toward bankruptcy. In late January, Ubisoft announced that it had managed to salvage the "South Park" game from the wreckage of THQ\'s myriad assets. But given many of the reported layoffs and general disorganization following THQ\'s dissolution, the future of the highly-anticipated RPG remained unclear.Of course, this is a "South Park" video game, so don\'t expect arcane super powers like the ones you see in a fantasy game like "Dragon Age." During the trailer, series favorite and lovably puerile dad Randy Marsh teaches his son how to perform a special fart he calls "The Nagasaki." Given that\'s the one ability they found appropriate enough to trot out at Ubisoft\'s biggest press conference this year, you can only imagine what the final game has in store.Watch the new trailer for "South Park: The Stick of Truth" below.South Park: The Stick of Truth TrailerYannick LeJacq is a contributing writer for NBC News who has also   covered technology and games for Kill Screen, The Wall Street Journal   and The Atlantic.
