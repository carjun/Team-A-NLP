["Page 5: 'This Week' Transcript: George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Mohamed Tawfik  - ABC News", 'KARL:  And then you had this extraordinary moment with first lady, Michelle Obama.', "LAURA BUSH:  I always think it looks really great for our country, for our presidents and first ladies to be together, whatever their parties are.  I think it's a really good example for the world.", "KARL:  There's something that you and President Obama have in common.  And that is that you are both, seems to me, a lot more popular in Africa than you are back home.", "KARL:  What do you make of that?  You're something of a rock star here.  He had these massive crowds, like you have seen.  What's behind that?", 'BUSH:  We both represent a great country.  People admire America.  And Africans are thrilled with the idea that American taxpayers funded programs that save lives.', "KARL (voice-over):  One of those programs, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, which President Bush signed into law 10 years ago is now celebrating a remarkable milestone.  One million African babies born HIV-free, thanks to programs preventing mother-to-child transmission.  Another 7 million with HIV are getting the drugs they need to survive.", "OBAMA:  I think this is one of his crowning commitments.  Because of the commitment of the Bush administration and the American people, millions of people's lives have been saved.", 'KARL:  President Obama said this is one of your crowning achievements.  Do you agree with that?', "BUSH:  That's nice of him.  I view it as an achievement of American generosity.  And it has been an extraordinarily successful program.  And I was honored to be a part of it.", "One reason we're in Africa is because we have found out and discovered that women are dying of cervical cancer.  They have been saved from HIV through antiretroviral drugs, yet they're dying of cervical cancer.  We think it's needless, and we're trying to do something about it.", 'KARL (voice-over):  That mission brought president and Mrs. Bush this week to Livingston, Zambia, a small town near the iconic Victoria Falls, one of the seven Wonders of the World.  Where with a small army of volunteers they rolled up their sleeves to refurbish and reopen a clinic.', "KARL:  As part of the Bush Institute's Cancer Prevention Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon Campaign women can now get screened there for cervical cancer.  Pollah Musonda came here with her niece on opening day after recently losing her mother-in-law to the disease.", "POLLAH MUSONDA:  When you meet them, you feel honored.  And I'm happy today that I've done it, and I'm free.", 'KARL:  Why Africa?  I mean was there a moment where this clicked for you?  You visited earlier.', 'BUSH:  There was a moment because I was the president of the most powerful, rich nation and pandemic was destroying an entire generation.  And I thought it would be morally shameful not to act.', "LAURA BUSH:  I think it's very important.  I think it's really important for people to know that the generosity of the American taxpayer has saved lives here.  And that now seven million people are on anti-retroviral drugs and are living full, productive lives.  They can contribute to their economy.  They are not leaving orphans like what happened earlier in the big pandemic.  I think it's, I think Americans should feel great about it.", "KARL:  President Obama has been criticized by those who say he hasn't done as much for Africa as you did.  That he's neglected Africa.  Is that a bad rap?", "BUSH:  President Obama cares deeply about whether or not people on the continent of Africa.  All I can tell you is that the State Department under his leadership and under Secretary Clinton has been incredibly helpful in our efforts to deal with cervical cancer.  It doesn't surprise me that presidents get criticized.", "KARL:  So what do you make, I know you're not into psychoanalysis.  Some, these are your critics that say that all of this Africa work you're doing, that part of it is, you're trying to make up for mistakes you made in Iraq or --", 'KARL:  I saw a journalist in Zambia asked you about gay marriage and whether it is compatible with Christian values.  And you had an interesting response.', "BUSH:  I shouldn't be taking a speck out of somebody else's eye when I have a log in my own.", "BUSH:  I meant that I'm not going to answer the question then and I'm not going to answer it now in terms of the political question about whether or not, I just don't want to weigh back in the debate.  I'm out of politics.", "But I meant it's very important for people not to be overly critical of someone else until you've examined your own heart.", "BUSH:  Jon, I didn't, you didn't hear my answer.  I'm not going to weigh back into those kinds of issues.  I'm out of politics.  The only way I can really make news is either criticize the president, which I don't want to do, criticize my own party, or weigh in on a controversial issue.  And I'm off the stage.  Unless I'm promoting something I strongly believe in, and I believe that what we're doing in Africa is incredibly important.  And will continue to do so, so long as I'm ambulatory.", 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
