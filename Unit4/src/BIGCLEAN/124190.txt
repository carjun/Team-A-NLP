['        A new report from the Council of Better Business Bureaus shows a large percentage of customers are unhappy with the tax preparer they hired last filing season.', 'The BBB says nearly one-third of the complaints allege the preparer made a mistake, that in many cases resulted in fines or added fees.', 'About 20 percent of the complaints deal with preparers who were unresponsive. They ignored repeated calls or e-mails from the customer to get assistance, a question answered, or copies of their tax information.', 'Robert and Debra Jefferies of Gaffney, S.C., told the BBB their preparation firm dropped the ball when the state audited their back income tax returns.', 'Anyone can make an honest mistake, but there are dishonest preparers who deliberately break the rules to deliver a bigger refund than legally allowed. They overstate deductions or make up bogus write-offs in order to inflate your refund.', 'In January, the U.S. Department of Justice sued a Dallas-area company it accused of claiming bogus fuel tax credits on the returns it prepared. The complaint cites a tax return for one customer that claimed he bought 53,454 gallons of gasoline for work-related purposes. For this deduction to be accurate, the lawsuit says, the taxpayer would have spent more than five times his total income on gasoline.', 'About 350 tax preparers have been sentenced to prison during the past three years. Many more have been barred from preparing returns or promoting fraudulent tax schemes.', 'Two weeks ago, the government filed suit to stop a St. Louis CPA and his son from preparing federal tax returns for others. Prosecutors claim the two men were responsible for thousands of fraudulent tax returns that may have cost the U.S. Treasury as much as $29.5 million since 2004.', 'Avoid any company that promises bigger returns than the competition, asks you to sign a blank return, or bases its fee on the size of your return.']
