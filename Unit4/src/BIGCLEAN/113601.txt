['Standing on first base in the second inning, Gerrit Cole used his right hand to fist bump his first base coach and exchanged a few words behind his black batting glove if only to break up long, emotionless stares with the dirt surrounding the bag.Cole saved his best work, and excitement, for the mound, where he shut down the Washington Nationals and led the Pirates to a 5-1 win in the second of a four-game series.The 22-year-old rookie gave up one run on two hits in seven innings to snap a three-start losing streak. Cole (5-3) struck out four and walked one in addition to two hits and an RBI at the plate.Pedro Alvarez slammed his 25th home run for the Pirates, who have won three in a row and remain 1 1/2 games behind NL Central-leading St. Louis."We don\'t live and die by it, we go out there to win every game," Cole said of the standings.
