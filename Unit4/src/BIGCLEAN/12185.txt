['    March 24: Michael Bloomberg, Wayne LaPierre, David Boies, Richard Engel, Ralph Reed, Hilary Rosen, E.J. Dionne, David Brooks', '        MR. TIM RUSSERT: Our issues this Sunday: the battle over the U.S. attorneys. The Democrats vote to subpoena the White House staff. The president stands by his attorney general.', 'MR. RUSSERT: This morning, exclusive interviews with two of the U.S. attorneys who lost their jobs, David Iglesias of New Mexico and John McKay of Washington state.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Mr. Iglesias, the White House, the counselor Dan Bartlett, was talking about you...', 'MR. IGLESIAS: Well, it was a little bit of a disappointment, but frankly, had he been convicted of 10 out of 23 counts, I doubt he would have done a lot more time.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Had a congressman or a senator ever called you about a case prior to that?', 'MR. RUSSERT: When you receive phone calls like that, do you have an obligation to report to your superiors that you received them?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Why had you not gone forward with indictments? Was the evidence not there?', 'MR. RUSSERT: And did they ask you why you did not go forward with an investigation or with indictments?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Knowing what you know today, do you have confidence in the leadership and the integrity of the attorney general?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Mr. McKay, do you have confidence in the leadership and integrity of the current attorney general?', 'MR. RUSSERT: When all this started coming down, you e-mailed the chief of staff of the attorney general, seeking his help, in effect.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Why were you asking for recommendations for people who you felt had not handled you in a professional way?', 'MR. IGLESIAS: For the simple reason I wanted to know if the true reason was performance, as stated under oath, or if it was politics. And I figured, very simply, that, if it was performance-related, they would not agree to be listed as a reference. That simple.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Mr. McKay, if you were on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the attorney general was before you next week, what would you ask him?', 'MR. RUSSERT: And to this day, do you believe you were removed for political reasons?', 'MR. RUSSERT: David Iglesias, John McKay, we thank you very much for joining us and sharing your story and your views.', 'Coming next, there will be hearings before the United States Judiciary Committee, and two key members of that panel are with us this morning: Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois, Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.', 'MR. RUSSERT: The debate over the dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys continues: two key members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Durbin and Specter. Then, Senator Bill Bradley, after this station break.', 'A meeting on this very subject. And yet, 12 days ago, the attorney general of the United States met with the press and spoke to the nation and said this:', 'MR. RUSSERT: Senator Durbin, reading that memo and hearing those comments, what do you conclude?', 'Listen, they serve at the pleasure of the president, and President Clinton discharged, in one fell swoop, all 93. So that the president can discharge without a reason, but I think they cannot be discharged for a bad reason. There are conflicting stories as to what happened with these eight U.S. attorneys, and I think the Judiciary Committee has to have a very intense investigation to find out what the facts were.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Do you believe that the attorney general has been candid, Senator Specter?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Do you believe, Senator Durbin, that the current attorney general has the independence and integrity to continue in that office?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Do you believe, as of now, he has the independence, the integrity and the candor to continue in his position?', 'MR. RUSSERT: How about a closed session with a transcript which you then can compare and contrast with other comments?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Senator Specter, is there an accommodation that can be reached between your committee and the White House?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Senator Arlen Specter, Senator Dick Durbin, we thank you for joining us and sharing your views.', 'MR. RUSSERT: How about tax dollars? Bill Bradley says consider raising the gasoline tax a dollar. Imagine what the Republicans would do with that.', 'MR. RUSSERT: You talk about closed-minded devotion to the secular. Do you think the Democrats have been reluctant to talk about faith?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Looking at the field of the Democratic Party in the 2008 election, does anyone stand out to you?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Do you think Barack Obama is someone who has tapped into idealism in our country?', "        A Meet the Press roundtable looks back at the president's speech on Friday and how the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case impacts the American people."]
