['Why do Darwin\'s theories on the origin of species, put forth in 1859, hold a status so different from that of Einstein\'s theories on relativity, published between 1905 and 1916? Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of New York\'s Hayden Planetarium and co-author of the book "Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution," reflected on that question during a recent interview at the University of Washington.', "MSNBC: Einstein and Darwin seem to hold two different places in our society. One is virtually a pop culture icon, while some people almost want to take down the other guy's statues. Why is that we have two different approaches to these people, even though they developed theories that are in very similar states of evidence?", 'My read of history is that people wanted to get opinions on everything from someone who was so widely recognized as being so smart.', '\t    Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and co-author of the book "Origins," says it\'s simply a matter of time before the fundamentals of evolutionary biology are as widely accepted as the fundamentals of relativistic physics.', 'Since evolution is an organizing principle of biology that allows you to understand phenomena, there are people who resist it.', 'There are two issues there: Let me unpack them to make them separate. The issue of precision simply distinguishes Einstein from Darwin. I think that alone is not what accounts for the resistance that we see in the various communities.', 'Would you say that the analog for the present age are the discoveries about the accelerating universe?', 'And are those the sorts of things that could spark the sort of inspiration that Einstein had?', 'Einstein was explaining stuff for free. And that power of understanding led to extreme confidence that he was on the right track, and was deeply plugged into how nature worked.']
