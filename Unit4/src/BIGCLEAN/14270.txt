['This is an English translation of a Univision News exclusive, first published July 1.', 'The evidence shed light on contradictions by the Ecuadorian government both regarding the issuing of the document and the participation of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is currently claiming asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.', 'The safe-conduct was processed before Snowden left Hong Kong for Moscow, and was in fact delivered to the former intelligence agent in Hong Kong, as Snowden himself revealed in a thank you letter sent to President Rafael Correa and made public this Monday.', 'A Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafnsson, also stated that their organization had helped   Snowden apply for asylum with the government of Ecuador.', 'The next day, Monday the 24th, Assange announced that Snowden was about to travel to Ecuador on a flight making a stop in a third country, possibly Cuba or Venezuela, and said that the former agent was in a safe location inside the Moscow airport, waiting for his transfer to his final destination.', 'He also proposed that Snowden be legally represented by attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights, a non-governmental organization based in New York which represents Bradley Manning, the soldier responsible for leaking hundreds of thousands of United States secret documents through Wikileaks.', 'The reports generated reaction from the Ecuadorian Minister of Foreign Affairs and revealed the discontent that exists regarding the handling of foreign policy.', 'The next day, Thursday, June 27, Ambassador Cely sent Correa a message from Italy, where she was traveling, to give him other news: she had received a call from the Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs for Latin America, Roberta Jacobson, expressing interest on the part of Vice President Joe Biden in speaking directly with Correa.', 'In response, Correa told Biden that Ecuador could not process the request for political asylum as Snowden was not officially in Ecuadorian territory. Correa added that if he were to contemplate the asylum, the first opinion he would seek would be that of the United States. For some observers, this statement was, in practice, a way of denying political asylum to Snowden in advance.', 'Correa admitted that Snowden received a safe-conduct from Ecuador, although he asserted that it was not authorized by him. The purpose of the document, according to Correa, was to provide him with a travel document in case his U.S. passport was suspended, which finally did happen.', 'The Russians also opposed allowing Ecuador to send an airplane to pick up Snowden and take him from Moscow to Quito, AP stated.', 'The biggest loser in this operation turned out to be the person who until one week ago seemed to be in control of the case: Julian Assange. The Wikileaks founder not only failed to gain asylum for Snowden, but also complicated his relationship with the Ecuadorian government, a government that has protected him for a very long time, according to press reports.']
