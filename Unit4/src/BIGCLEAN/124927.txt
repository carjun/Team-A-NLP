['        DENNIS MURPHY reporting: (Voiceover) So ironic that Rosie Essa was just idling away a few hours that afternoon when she had only a few precious minutes remaining. But we never know, do we? It was February 2005. She was dashing to the movies to meet her sister Deanna at a matinee.', '(Person driving; photo of Rosie Essa; trees; sunlight; telephone lines; driving through woods)', '(Car on road; document; passport; airplane; airplane ticket; photo of Yazeed Essa; photos of Yaz and Rosie; photo of Rocco and Gee Gee DiPuccio; woman on witness stand; bedroom; passport; FBI Cleveland sign; freeway; pills; document; court in session; houses behind trees; Gates Mills welcome sign; photo of Rosie and Yaz; house exterior; photos of Rosie and Yaz; photos of Yaz; Rosie, Yaz, children on videotape)', '(Photos of Rosie and children; photo of DiPuccio family; Gee Gee and Rocco at head of dinner table)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) And of course the sun and moon of her life, two-year-old daughter Lena and four-year-old son Armand.', '(Video of Rosie and children; photo of Rosie, Yaz and children; freeway; Volvo steering column; wheels on road)', '(Person driving, dialing on phone; street lights; photo of Eva McGregor; car driving; Wilson Mills Road exit sign; car driving; Tara Tamsen)', 'Ms. TARA TAMSEN: I saw a black car cross over center and go back into the lane and hit a car.', 'Ms. TAMSEN: When I got into the car, the woman was limp, and next thing you know, she started vomiting.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Meanwhile, patrol officer David Schiciano of the Highland Heights Police Department had happened by. His dashboard camera recorded the accident.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Rosie was rushed to the hospital. When word reached her family, they too raced to the emergency room, worried about her condition.', '(Operating room; surgical gloves; operating equipment; heart rate monitor; emergency room; flatline; photo of Rosie)', 'Ms. DiPUCCIO: He looked at me. He was crying, and he went like this to me (shakes head no) and I just went down.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) What Eva said would nearly rip Dominic and his brother Rocky apart. How could they keep such a monstrous thing a secret?', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) The DiPuccio family turned to their church for strength in dealing with the loss of their Rosie. At just 38, snatched away far too soon in a slow motion car accident no one could comprehend, their beloved daughter and sister, mother of two and wife of Yaz.', '(Open Bible; photo of Rosie and Lena; photo of Rosie; Rosie, Lena and Armand on video)', '(Photos of Yaz; photo of Yaz and Firas Essa; Dish1Up sign; Yaz and Rosie wedding video)', 'Ms. DiPUCCIO: We loved him and we cared about him because there was nothing we could say we disliked.', '(Pill bottle with strewn pills; wheel on road; person dialing on cell phone whilst driving)', '(Dominic, Julie, Rachel and Rocky standing around kitchen counter; car on road at night; parking lot; person dialing cell phone whilst driving; photo of McGregor; opened pill bottle)', 'JULIE: How do you have this information come to you about somebody that is family?', 'DOMINIC: (Voiceover) Let alone a guy that we knew that was in our family that we loved.', 'RACHEL: I remember thinking, feeling suspicious after that phone call, feeling like we need to do something with this information.', '(Photo of Yaz and Rosie; photos of SUV; photo of Yaz and Rosie; Cuyahoga County Coroner sign; surgical instruments; operating room; sink; pill bottles;', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) But how long could the brothers keep their secret from the rest of the family, especially when someone else was also growing suspicious?', '(DiCillo walking; photo of Rosie and Yaz; DiCillo walking; photo of McGregor; wheel on road)', 'Ms. DiCILLO: Well, where could they take it? If I was wrong, there was no harm, no foul, and they could politely tell me that I was wrong and thank you for my help and I would go away.', '(Photo of Yaz; Highland Heights police and fire headquarters; audiotape recorder; interview room)', '(Audio recording) Are the calcium pills and the prescription vitamins still at home?', 'Det. McKEE: (Audio recording) Would you mind if I followed you back to your home and collected those?', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Remember, Rosie and Yaz were trying to have another child, and she was prescribed prenatal vitamins. Detective McKee wanted all the pills Rosie was taking gathered up for testing, including the calcium capsules that Yaz said he bought for his wife. The interview over, the detective followed Yaz home.', 'Det. McKEE: No. We entered the home. There was a female seated at the kitchen counter on a stool. She was Marguerita Montanez.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Marguerita was the daytime nanny. Yaz had hired her to care for his kids after Rosie died. He also hired another woman to be the nighttime nanny. At the time, the detective thought nothing of Marguerita the nanny, though that would eventually change. For now, he was there only to get the pills from Yaz.', '(Photo of Marguerita Montanez; photo of Lena and Armand; photo of Montanez; house exterior)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Coming up, some answers are on their way. The autopsy comes in, along with a stunning revelation about those calcium pills.', '(Yaz and Armand on video; Rosie and Lena on video; photo of Lena and Armand; emergency room entrance; ambulance driving; Highland Heights police and fire building; house exterior)', 'DOMINIC: My entire family spent the week at that house, and we were playing detectives, trying to figure out what happened.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Through credit card transactions, Dominic eventually learned that Yaz had bought a plane ticket, final destination: Cyprus, the island in the Mediterranean.', '(Cyanide; pills falling out of pill bottle; photos of Rosie; capsule cracked open; photos of Yaz and Rosie; photo of Yaz and Lena; FBI badge)', 'Mr. PHIL TORSNEY: Initially he fled from Cleveland to Cyprus, and eventually we also obtained information through various sources that he had traveled to Beirut, Lebanon.', 'MURPHY: Did you ever get the feeling he was thumbing his nose at you and all the other people looking for him?', '(Passport photo of Yaz; Beirut streets; airplane in sky; Larnaca Airport; airplane landing; airport entrance; street with cars; mug shot of Yaz)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Coming up, the one question no one had yet answered: Why would the doctor had wanted his wife dead?', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) For nearly five years the DiPuccio family had been waiting for this day. Dr. Yazeed Essa would finally face a jury for allegedly poisoning his wife, Rosie, with cyanide. Steve Dever and Anna Faraglia would prosecute the aggravated murder case for Ohio.', 'Mr. DEVER: The mission is to define his character and let the jury get another glimpse of who he is as opposed to how he appears there in the courtroom.', '(Court in session; photo of Yaz and Rosie; photo of Yaz, Lena and Armand; photo of Yaz and Rosie; photo of Rosie)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) If the prosecution had an indispensable star witness, it would be this woman taking the stand. Eva McGregor had been the friend on the phone with Rosie just moments before her car accident and death. Only Eva could point to Yaz as the source of that cyanide-laced calcium capsule Rosie had taken.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) And it turned out to be a snap to shake out the calcium in the capsule and replace it with cyanide.', '(Capsule; Yaz in court; photo of Yaz, Lena and Armand; photo of Yaz; bay; people on street; freeway in Beirut)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) This man, Jamal Khalife, a kind of godfather Mr. Fix-it character, testified about how he helped Yaz live on the lam with virtually a new life and identity.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) As he got to know the American doctor better, a stunning story about Rosie spilled out.', 'Mr. KHALIFE: (In court) He told me the whole story, that his wife was leaving the home, going, I think, to a movie. He told me he grounded cyanide, refilled the pills and he give her two pills. Down the street she had a car accident and she died.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) A severe blow for the accused, a secondhand account of a confession from Yaz. And another witness was about to deliver an even more dramatic roundhouse punch.', 'Mr. FIRAS ESSA: (In court) I asked him if he was responsible for her death, and he said yes.', 'Mr. DEVER: (In court) When you found out that information, what did you say to your brother?', 'Mr. DEVER: (In court) Every Wednesday night he would spend with his girlfriend, with his mistress at her apartment.', 'Mr. DEVER: A love shack, that was it. Yeah, that was a place that he would use the apartment over there from time to time to bring his lady friends.', 'Mr. DEVER: (In court) Why did you become involved in a relationship with the defendant while you were married?', 'Ms. MONTANEZ: (In court) Me and my husband were having problems, and I thought I was going to get a divorce.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Marguerita described it as a friends with benefits type of relationship with Yaz, purely sex.', 'MURPHY: But the prosecution asserted Yaz had a deeper, more complicated relationship with another woman, Michelle Madeline. Now, she was the so-called nighttime nanny for his children. Michelle was also someone, prosecutors say, who fell in love with the doctor and he with her.', 'Ms. MADELINE: (In court) He was telling me that he was so unhappy in his marriage, and I was the love of his life and I was his dream come true. And he was going to leave her so that our relationship could continue.', 'Ms. MADELINE: (In court) And that he was in love with me. He would say she was a good person, but she was cold. He would call her Amana.', 'ROCKY: The way he humiliated her, and on top of everything that he had done to her, to belittle her or to make fun or to mock her with his mistress is, you know, sick.', 'Mr. DEVER: (In court) Your honor, at this time the state of Ohio would rest its case.', 'MURPHY: If he has successfully killed his wife with them, why hold on to the stuff?', 'Our mandate is to do the best job that we can and to bring home that W, bring home that not guilty.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) The defense for Yaz Essa came down to this. Sure, he had lots of women on the side and he got away with it. So why did he need to kill his wife? His two defense lawyers, Mark Marein and Steve Bradley, told the jury straight out the defendant was never going to be a husband of the year.', '(Yaz in court; photo of Yaz by photo of Montanez; photo of bed; photo of Yaz and Rosie; court in session)', 'Mr. BRADLEY: (In court) Yazeed Essa regularly always maintained numerous sexual relationships with other women.', 'Mr. BRADLEY: (In court) Yazeed Essa did not commit this crime. He did not intentionally poison the mother of his two young children, the woman with whom he was actively trying to conceive a third child and add to their family, something they both wanted.', 'MURPHY: The marriage, to their friends and to her family, is a loving, good, viable marriage.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Add it up, argued the defense, and you had a respected doctor with no money worries, a nice family and as many girlfriends on the side as he could juggle. Bottom line: He had no reason to kill Rosie.', '(Court in session; house exterior; photo of Rosie, Lena and Armand; photo of Yaz, Montanez on witness stand, camisole; Yaz in court)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) And then there was the way he behaved early on. Would a guilty man have turned over to the police that bottle of calcium capsules if he knew full well the lab would find cyanide in nine of them?', 'Mr. BRADLEY: (In court) The pill bottle itself would have been conducive to leaving ridge detail, correct?', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) And even though the court had learned how easy it was to obtain cyanide, there was no evidence presented that Yaz had actually done that. Still, the stark fact at the epicenter of the case against Yaz Essa was his decision to flee the country. How could that be anything other than the action of a guilty man? The defense spun it this way: Yaz early on had talked to a lawyer who advised him he might be facing the death penalty if charged with a murder.', '(Court in session; cyanide; photo of Yaz and Rosie; people on streets of Beirut; fake passport; cars on freeway; passport photo of Yaz; Steve Bradley in court)', 'Mr. MAREIN: Yaz was led to believe that he could be charged with capital murder, and he just freaked out.', 'Mr. F. ESSA: (In court) I asked him if he was responsible for her death and he said yes.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Both witnesses had lied on the stand, according to the defense, because each had cut a deal with the prosecution for leniency on charges they were facing.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) The brother, for instance, was looking at almost 12 years in prison for helping Yaz on the lam. He took a deal.', 'MURPHY: So was Firas well-advised in terms of his own survival strategy to sing for his supper?', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Jamal the fixer had been a fugitive wanted by the United States.', 'Mr. BRADLEY: (In court) She is one of the women that Yazeed maintained a long-term, ongoing sexual relationship.', 'Mr. BRADLEY: The police themselves did very, very little to eliminate her as a suspect.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) After a seven-week trial and over 60 witnesses, the case was concluded. Now it was up to the jurors. They deliberated for three days and announced they had reached a verdict.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) The lawyers, the families on both sides, were summoned to the courtroom for the reading of the verdict by Judge Deena Calabrese.', 'Judge DEENA CALABRESE: (In court) We the jury in this case being duly impaneled and sworn do find the defendant Yazeed Essa guilty of aggravated murder.']
