Jrolf, 41, says she's more toned and less bored with exercising since incorporating short-burst interval training into her routine.", '        Since shaking up her fitness routine, Moira Jrolf is spending less time exercising yet getting better results.', 'For instance, Gibala and colleagues published a small study last year finding that people who did short-burst training for a total of 1.5 hours a week (including rest periods) achieved the same exercise-induced changes in their muscles over six weeks as people who did more traditional endurance training for upwards of 4.5 hours a week. ', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say.
