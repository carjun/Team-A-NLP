["Page 3: 'This Week' Transcript: Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Rogers  - ABC News", "Clearly, there are all kinds of negotiations taking place and all kinds of agreements that have been reached between these internet companies that store massive amounts of communication data about people around the world, and the government.  We should have this debate out in the open.  Let these companies that collect massive amounts of information about people, and the government, resolve this discrepancy in public.
