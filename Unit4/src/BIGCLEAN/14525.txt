['        More than two years year after the housing market tanked and the foreclosure rate began rising, the ongoing wave of distressed home sales is weighing on house prices and crimping a long-awaited economic recovery. ', "On Wednesday, President Obama signed off on the government's latest response to the crisis, a whittled-down bill aimed at helping millions of struggling borrowers keep their homes. But the latest effort may not be strong enough to reverse the downward spiral that has gripped the housing market and the economy.", 'After months of debate, the final version of the latest bill eliminated a key provision that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage terms. Faced with heavy pressure from the banking industry, Congress again tabled the highly contentious provision after several attempts to introduce it over the past year. That leaves the decision to refinance a mortgage up to lenders and investors holding securities backed by those loans. ', 'Meanwhile, homeowners stuck with unaffordable payments, or who now owe more than their house is worth, must slog through the red tape of negotiating a new loan with their lender.', 'Courtney Scott, 60, a retired nurse living in Atlanta, has been trying for over a year to get her loan modified. ', 'Meanwhile, the rise in foreclosures is tearing a hole in the household budgets of those that lose their homes and those who live next door. As homes are sold off at distressed prices, the value of neighboring homes also drops. ', 'Though home sales have perked up this spring, in some markets as many as half of those are distressed sales to new home buyers and investors looking for bargains. ', 'Since the foreclosure rate began rising in the middle of 2006, the government has made several attempts to slow the ongoing erosion of homeownership. In October 2007, the Bush administration launched the Hope Now Alliance, a public-private partnership designed to encourage lenders to rewrite loan terms to make payments more affordable. ', 'Though the group says nearly a million mortgages were reworked, many of those "workouts" simply added missed payments to the outstanding principal, raised the monthly payment and made the new loan even less afforadble. As a result, more than half of homeowners who got help defaulted on their new loans in less than a year. ', 'The latest foreclosure bill expands on that effort and provides further help for lenders who offer troubled homeowners more affordable loans. One key provision protects servicers from lawsuits by investors holding bonds backed by loans that are modified. In many cases, lower mortgage payments bring lower returns for those investors; servicers say that has stymied past efforts to modify loans. ', 'Another provision overhauls the Hope for Homeowners program. Introduced last summer, the program was intended to help some 400,000 borrowers. But high fees and tight credit left all but a handful of homeowners with new loans and lower monthly payments. ', 'After contacting the bank in March, 2008, she was told there was nothing the bank could do until she was behind in her payments, she said. So she stopped paying. After she recently began working with a HUD-approved credit counselor, she said the bank told her she had to make up two of those missed payments before they would talk to her. Two months ago, the counselor helped Scott apply for a loan modification, but the bank has not yet assigned someone to her case. ']
