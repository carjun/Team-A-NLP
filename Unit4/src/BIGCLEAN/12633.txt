She's claiming it's a case of discrimination against her fuller figure. Linzie janis is here with a -- we could say red-hot story. Reporter: It's interesting. Instead of celebrating american's freedom, she had to celebrate her own. Madeline schaffer says she was kicked out of a water park because of the way she looked in her string bikini. You have the initial embarrassment. But that would followed up quickly with indignation. Reporter: The 42-year-old and her teenage daughter went to adventure oasis, in indianapolis, missouri, to cool off and have fun. As schaffer was swimming in one of the pools, wearing this bikini, she says two employees told her to put on shorts over her bathing suit. Why should I have to put a pair of shorts when I'm wearing the same size of bikini bottoms as the other girls in the pool? Reporter: When she refused, a supervisor at the park told her to cover up or leave. He said because it's a family park. And it's inappropriate attire. You need to put on a shirt, too, because your top is too small. Reporter: Again, she refused. And police were called to escort her out of the park. Schaffer says she was discriminated against because of her age and fuller figure. There were other girls wearing string bikinis, you know, 15, 16, 17, 18 years old. And you know, beautiful, young bodies. And they're not being told to cover up. Am I allowed to have a mature body. Reporter: Adventure oasis has not returned our calls. But the city of independence said that the facility made the call. And we rely on their judgment. Schaffer said she recently lost 100 pounds and was happy to be back into a bikini. I'm very comfortable, from what I once was, to where I am today. Reporter: Madeline schaffer says she's telling her story because she thinks there's too much pressure to look perfect. She says, w should all love the skin that we're in. This interesting territory. To tell some people they can wear a bikini. She had the bikini on. You know? Apparently her 14-year-old daughter who was with her, said she's very proud of her mom for standing up for herself. And the crew. They were all watching this story, attentively, by the way. A lot of interest. Thank you.
