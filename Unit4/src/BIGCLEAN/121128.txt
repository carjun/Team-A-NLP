['Jennifer Allison works as a security guard at the Verizon store in downtown Seattle, so she knows all the plans and prices. When she needed to save money, Allison went prepaid. ', 'And prepaid is not just for infrequent users. In its January issue, Consumer Reports did the math and found that bigger talkers can also score sizable savings.', 'Boost Mobile recently introduced an unlimited prepaid calling plan for $50. If you want to limit your bill but have an endless bucket of minutes, this is the plan to choose. You get unlimited nationwide talk and text, web access and walkie-talkie service. Boost uses the Nextel network.', 'If prepaid makes sense to you, take your time and shop around. Plans vary greatly from company to company. Read the fine print on the brochures. Find out if the minutes expire. Ask about additional charges, such as access fees and taxes. The good thing is there no contract. It you make a mistake and choose the wrong company or the wrong plan, you can change without penalty.']
