Gay conversion therapy practitioners, a national association of Christian mental health counselors and the families of two teenage boys who say their sons benefited from the therapy brought the challenge to the law.', '"The state has determined that the only permissible message [is that] same-sex attractions, behavior or identity are to be accepted, supported and understood, thus suppressing all other viewpoints to the detriment of licensed professionals and their vulnerable minor clients," attorneys for the group of challengers argue.', 'California was the first state to adopt such legislation, and the appeal is being watched closely around the country.

Guay, now 41, said as a 16-year-old he went to weekly conversion therapy sessions for a year with a licensed formerly gay Christian psychologist, and attended several conferences of people who said they were formerly gay.', 'Speaking to ABCNews.com from outside the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today, Guay said that the state had an interest in protecting children from harm that he said could come from sexual orientation change efforts, or SOCE, by state licensed psychotherapists.', '"It\'s psychological abuse that often takes years to recover from," he said. "Clients suffer from PTSD-like symptoms. ...
