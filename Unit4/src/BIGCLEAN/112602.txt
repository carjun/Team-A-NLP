['Chairman Steve Abrams, left, votes to adopt new science standards while Education Commissioner Bob Corkins monitors the vote during a meeting of the Kansas Board of Education on Tuesday.', 'Critics of the new language charged that it was an attempt to inject God and creationism into public schools, in violation of the constitutional ban on state establishment of religion.', 'All six of those who voted for the new standards were Republicans. Two Republicans and two Democrats voted no.', 'Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, said the decision would encourage school districts in Kansas and elsewhere to make similar moves, distracting and confusing teachers and students.', 'The new standards say high school students must understand major evolutionary concepts. But they also declare that the basic Darwinian theory that all life had a common origin and that natural chemical processes created the building blocks of life have been challenged in recent years by fossil evidence and molecular biology.', 'In addition, the board rewrote the definition of science, so that it is no longer limited to the search for natural explanations of phenomena.', 'The new standards will be used to develop student tests measuring how well schools teach science. Decisions about what is taught in classrooms will remain with 300 local school boards, but some educators fear pressure will increase in some communities to teach less about evolution or more about creationism or intelligent design.', 'The vote marked the third time in six years that the Kansas board has rewritten standards with evolution as the central issue.', 'The latest vote likely to bring fresh national criticism to Kansas and cause many scientists to see the state as backward.', 'Many scientists and other critics contend creationists repackaged old ideas in new, scientific-sounding language to get around a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1987 against teaching the biblical story of creation in public schools.']
