It was a good time to be alive. Good time to be in real estate, too; as bright and hot that year as an afternoon on the Florida Gulf.', 'Jeff Beggins and his family have been in real estate for over thirty years, tending the Snowbird Haven here in Tampa. Jeff runs the office now. And on this particular Friday afternoon, he was getting ready for one of his signature beach barbeques, a semi-regular perk which not only he enjoyed, it helped attract and retain his excellent team of agents.', "One of these agents had a particularly interesting background. A diplomat's ex-wife, Rosemary Christiansen. Fellow agent Kathy McKinnon was impressed by Rosemary's slightly more formal style.", 'Her 20 years of diplomatic practice, perhaps? Her worldly experience? Rosemary was born in Australia, but traveled the globe on the arm of her husband, a respected member of the Dutch foreign service. ', 'A white-gloved existence, the sort of life outsiders envy. Even if, inside, it was not so splendid after all.', 'Trapped in a life that felt more like a prison, drawn by independence and the Florida sun, and yes, the promise of a second chance at love, rosemary had a cyber suitor. ', 'He was, for one thing, the opposite of all she had known in that other life of hers.', "Jeff Beggins: I didn't see how those two personalities would kinda come together, but you know, opposites attract sometimes, and that's-- probably was the case here.", 'Her sons occasionally came to visit her here in Florida. But her marriage to their diplomat father was part of her past. Now it was, as we said, that Friday afternoon in August. It was the eve of the company beach party.', 'Jeff Beggins: Rosemary was bringing some of the supplies, and was always there early to set up.', "Rosemary had told co-workers she would drop into the office Friday afternoon to pick up a bowl for the next day's event. ", 'But Saturday morning, as the preparations for the party began, Rosemary again uncharacteristically shirked her duties.', "Jeff Beggins: We knew when she didn't show, that something was-- musta been wrong, 'cause that was definitely out of her character.", "But Jeff Beggins and Rosemary's other friends felt quite suddenly that they already knew: Rosemary Christiansen had left them.", 'Kathy McKinnon: Deep down inside, I knew something had happened to her, that she was gone.', "The police came then. They entered the apartment, had a look around, while Rosemary's anxious friends waited outside.", "Policeman: At this particular point we're concerned about her welfare, her location and her safety.", 'The disappearance of a woman so respected in her community soon attracted local media. Reporter Mark Douglas was put on the story. ', 'Mark Douglas: Her friends are putting out missing person posters, and her husband, whom she lived with, was nowhere in sight for days and days.', 'And then, just as suddenly as he disappeared, Robert Temple returned several days later - mystified and worried about Rosemary.', 'Mark Douglas: He had taken a trip-- just before she disappeared and-- said he was in Indiana visiting relatives, So, the day he returned, clearly, there was a great interest in talking to him. And then, he consented to come speak with us, and sat down-- around the pool-- and proceeded to tell us his story.', "Robert Temple (on a television conference tape): I miss her so bad. Rose and I haven't been apart this long since we've been married.( crying) I love my wife. I just want her back. Please, if anybody's seen Rose, know where she's at..please. Just tell her..just..just call.", 'Temple maintained that while he was sad that his wife had suddenly left as she did, he was sure there was a simple explanation.', "Kathy McKinnon: It pisses me off that anybody would-- say somethin' like that about her.", "But can you ever really know a person? Maybe Rosemary Christiansen's prim exterior had been a sort of disguise, behind which she kept secrets from her friends at work.", "Well, yes, she had left a life before. When she came to Florida. But had she simply walked out again? Rosemarie's friends tried to stay optimistic. ", 'Jeff Beggins: Maybe she had a problem at home, maybe she took off with some friends, maybe she just went to disappear and collect her thoughts, those were all the positive thoughts we were having at the time.', "But just in case, Beggins hired a private investigator - Richard Price -who dug around for a while and then reported that the condo provided some interesting clues. Or, not so much clues really, as questions. Rosemary's cell phone, for example. ", 'Jeff Beggins: Carpet missing-- different-- paint coverings on the wall, something certainly was not right at that point.', 'Why would someone remove carpet over a concrete floor, or paint over part of a wall, and then leave? And leave behind, by the way, a slip of paper on which was written... Well, the detective found the content very troubling.', 'Richard Price: We found a list of ingredients that could be used nothing except to clean up, shall we say, a homicide scene-- different types of cleaning-- materials and-- flowery scents, things like that.', "It seemed a little creepy. And yet it could have been perfectly innocent - somebody stocking up on cleaning supplies. And Rosemary's husband had a perfectly simple reason for those purchases.", "... And bled on the carpet, and they couldn't get the stain out. And now, she'd left him.", "Robert Temple: We're like any other couple. We have our arguments and ups and everything was fine.", 'Despite his profession of innocence, Temple, as Rosemary\'s husband, would traditionally be high on a list of "usual suspects" in her disappearance. Still, police did not have any real physical evidence against him.', 'Mark Douglas: All of his explanations had just enough plausibility to keep him out of handcuffs.', "Weeks went by. Still no word from Rosemary. Her friends handed out more flyers, her boss offered a reward for information, the private investigator canvassed the area. And, nothing tangible. Though one bit of information did come up, and it posed a whole new set of questions. Not about Rosemary... But about the man she'd been married to.", 'Richard Price: We found out that he had actually had been arrested-- years before in a previous marriage in the death of a child. ', 'Keith Morrison: He kinda put it behind him and got married to this real estate woman--', 'Keith Morrison: --who was kind of, well, cleansing in a way, for his reputation, I should think.', "Now, Rosemary's friends found themselves thinking anew about that odd marriage of hers - the warm, sophisticated woman with her mot0rcycle man. ", 'Laurel Zyvoloski: When Rosemary and I were together, her cell phone would ring incessantly, her beeper would go off. ', "Mark Douglas: Before they got married, he'd been arrested for domestic abuse against his girlfriend.", "But around the office, a few old stories that once didn't make sense now, perhaps, did.", 'Laurel Zyvoloski: The only thing that I can even think of that makes any sense is that he always apologized and promised to never do it again.', "But then the police discovered that even Rosemary, for all her sweet demeanor, was pushed to her limit - once. That's when she found out that Robert Temple had a girlfriend who worked alongside him at a telemarketing center. ", 'Which explained why friends had begun to see a new Rosemary emerging: a woman who was getting ready to move on without him.', "Rosemary, it turned out, had been secretly planning an exit strategy. She had even seen a divorce attorney. On that attorney's advice she had decided she was just going to stay with him for another two months. ", 'Those closest to Rosemary Christiansen kept up their desperate search, now thoroughly convinced her husband Robert Temple knew exactly what happened - because he did it, whatever it was. He must have.', 'Laurel Zyvoloski: I was constantly surveying the condo, to see what was going on. ', 'Laurel Zyvoloski: When the truck showed up, and he started emptying out the condo--', 'Mark Douglas: Robert Temple and his girlfriend, Leslie Stewart, left town for parts unknown.', 'When real estate broker Rosemary Christiansen suddenly vanished, it was so out of character that her friends soon began to fear the worst.', 'And now here he was not just leaving but apparently cohabitating with a new and much younger woman. They found out her name: Leslie Stewart. And that she was in her twenties. Had a child. But that was about it.', 'Mark Douglas: Leslie Stewart was and is somewhat of an enigma-- We knew that he had gone on a road trip with her about the same time his wife disappeared. ', 'Mark Douglas: The detectives-- shared with me that before he left town, they spoke with Leslie Stewart and said, "Someday you\'ll be next."', "They hopscotched across the country, taking odd jobs along the way, until finally, all trace of the pair vanished. And back in Tampa, meanwhile, police and Rosemary's loyal friends reached that sad closing chapter of failed searches. They enlisted the paranormal.", 'Even for those most unwilling to give up the search, it was hard to hold out hope anymore.', 'Richard Price: The longer it went-- it was just more evident that she had met-- the ill-fated death.', "So now life went on without Rosemary. Her sons grew to adulthood without their mother. Her widower, if that's what he was, Robert Temple, was somewhere far away with his much younger woman - and his, apparently, swinging lifestyle.", 'And as the years went by, her friends, once in a while, lifted a glass in her memory. ', "Kathy McKinnon: We'd have, like, a little anniversary, you know, drinks for her and stuff just--", 'He said, "I know what happened to Rosemary Christiansen. And I\'ve known this for nine years."', "All these years her body had been lying in a swampy grave on property belonging to Leslie Stewart's own father in northern Florida. Although, according to Leslie, her father never knew what was buried on his land.", 'Everyone wanted justice for Rosemary. But who exactly was to blame, what did they do to her? And why did this woman, Leslie Stewart - - suddenly reappear, talking? Here is the amazing, to some profoundly disturbing answer: A Tampa attorney named Jay Hebert had known - and kept - the secret the whole nine years. The secret he could now reveal to everyone.', 'Leslie Stewart told him the whole story not long before she and Robert Temple skipped town, but Hebert was prevented by attorney client privilege rules from whispering a word to anyone.', 'So Hebert could do precisely nothing with the information. Leslie could have revealed it all herself, of course. But:', "And so, as Rosemary's friends puzzled and fumed, Leslie ran off with Robert, eventually settled out west with him, had a baby with him, a daughter. And kept the awful secret all those years. And then, an opportunity: A trip away from Robert gave her the physical and emotional distance she needed.", 'Jay Hebert: Ultimately, it was when she was able to break away-- go to a family reunion that was set up-- outside of the state of California in Washington state.', 'Temple, she said, insisted it had been a dreadful accident that grew out of some kind of altercation.', "According to Leslie, Temple told her, no one would believe it was an accident. So she helped him clean up, then watched as he hatched a carefully thought out series of lies and cover-ups to explain Rosemary's disappearance.", 'Jay Hebert: He decided that he was going to start covering up this-- homicide by creating this charade of of Rosemary disappearing on the Internet with some swingers.', "Leslie said they packed up Rosemary's things to make it look as if she'd decided quite suddenly to leave of her own accord.", 'Now finally nine years later, Hebert passed the dreadful details on to reporter Douglas.', 'She says that her and Robert Temple buried-- the body while her father stayed inside his house-- presumably unaware of what they were doing. ', 'Whatever bound her to Temple, the ties began to unravel. Living with him in northern California, she became increasingly afraid for her safety. In fact, according to Leslie, temple had just recently threatened to kill both her and her daughter if she ever told the truth.', 'Leslie Stewart was finally ready to tell everything she knew. And she knew plenty. But was it true? Because there were two sides to this story.', "Now in custody, Leslie's lover, Robert Temple, had his own, very different version of events. ", "It's flat and hot and the mini malls stretch for miles in all directions from the county jail that houses the man accused of killing Rosemary Christiansen. Put here courtesy Of Leslie Stewart, the young woman who replaced Rosemary in Robert's bed.", "But Robert claimed he had a surprise of his own in store: he didn't kill Rosemary, he simply helped Leslie cover up the crime she herself committed. And from his cell, he started talking, too.", "And when he went into the condo, he said, imagine his shock when he found his wife's body sprawled on the bedroom floor.", 'Mark Douglas: He wanted to take his wife, he says, to Georgia, to a place in the woods that she always loved because he wanted to do that one last thing for her.', 'He fell asleep as she drove, he said. And when he woke up, they were in north Florida.', "Mark Douglas: They were pulling into her father's property unbeknownst to him because that was not his plan.", 'And then, to keep him in the dark, to make him vulnerable, to protect their own skins, Temple said, Leslie and her father buried the body on the property without telling Temple exactly where they put it.', "Now, in jail, Robert began a sort of private P.R. campaign. He sprinkled his accusations against Leslie, his version of the story, through long, convoluted letters, sent them off to lawyer Hebert, reporter Douglas...even Rosemary's friends."]
