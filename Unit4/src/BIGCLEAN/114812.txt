But those in the industry say it is just the next step in making long-distance communication feel more realistic.', 'Compared to videoconferencing, interacting with a robot has shown to be more similar to face-to-face interaction, according to Cory Kidd, who has a doctorate in human-robot interaction from the MIT Media Lab in the United States. He is also chief executive of Intuitive Automata, a robotics company.', '"If you look at any sort of new communication technology, there is always backlash against it shortly after it comes out," he said.', 'Videoconferencing and even telephones were seen as strange and unusual when they were first introduced, Kidd pointed out, and as with any new technology that may go mainstream, it will take getting used to.', '"The telephone was going to destroy society because it was so intrusive and changes our lives," he said.', 'If you look at any sort of new communication technology, there is always backlash against it shortly after it comes outCory Kidd, Intuitive Automata', 'Researchers are also trying to find ways to make the human-robot interaction seem more like the users are really present. At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, for example, researchers are developing a telepresence robot that can also convey body language through robotic arms.', '"When we communicate, we also observe body motions to understand meaning," said Lam Tin-lun, a research fellow at the university\'s Advanced Robotics Lab who is heading the project.', 'Lam says while the technology might seem strange at first, it does not take much time to adapt to an office with colleagues moving around as robots.', 'When a prototype of his model was tested in an office, he said, after a week or two, the sight of the robot going about its business was no longer a novelty and workers ceased to be surprised by it.', '"They stopped looking at the robot and just did what they always needed to do," he said.', 'As the technology advances over the next few years, prices will also go down, meaning greater accessibility for companies that will not have to sink a huge investment into the systems. RoboDynamics, a robotics maker in Santa Monica, California, has said it will sell telepresence robots for about US$1,000 two years from now.', 'iRobot recently launched a new model, in collaboration with Cisco, that does not need manual driving. When first deployed in a work environment, the model would go all around the office to map the place. Then the user would only have to indicate whose desk or office to go to, using an iPad app, and the robot would drive itself there while avoiding obstacles or people. It also knows how to go back to its charging station when no longer in use.', '"As you start seeing these in offices and other work environments, people have to get used to it, and there are all these social norms in terms of how you fit in," Kidd said.', '"Can a robot walk up and interrupt a conversation you\'re having? Or should the robot wait because the person is remote? Does it matter who it is on the other end and how do you convey that? So there are a lot of social questions that over the long term are really going to determine the success and the failure of this technology."', 'The global financial crisis has made college degrees more important than ever in raising personal income, a new study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has found.', "Take a look inside some of the offices of Silicon Valley's most well-known companies.", 'Over the next few years, offices will start to have robots roaming around on wheel.
