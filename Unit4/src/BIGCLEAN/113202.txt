['The idea goes back more than 2000 years, said John Alford, associate professor of political science at Rice University, who is working with Hibbing.', 'Genetic researchers are trying to prove that social attitudes can be inherited, and have discovered strong correlations between the two.', 'Identical twins, who share their entire genetic code, answered more similarly than fraternal twins, who are no more similar than non-twin siblings.', 'If you assume that both identical and fraternal twins share an environment, then the disparity between the results must be genetic, Hibbing and colleagues conclude.', 'The next step, Hibbing said, includes scans to observe the brain in action as subjects answer questions on political topics. That work is in progress at Baylor Medical Center in Houston, in collaboration with Rice University and Alford.']
