["    May 27: Martin O'Malley, Newt Gingrich, Antonio Villaraigosa, Carly Fiorina, E.J. Dionne, David Brooks, Maria Shriver, Michael Lewis ", '        MR. TIM RUSSERT: Our issues this Sunday: the Senate delays a vote on the troop increase in Iraq as the debate now shifts to the House. With us, the House majority leader, Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland, and the House minority leader, Republican John Boehner of Ohio. The majority and minority leaders square off, only on MEET THE PRESS.', 'Then, a busy weekend in the race for the White House as Barack Obama officially enters the race, Hillary Clinton makes her first campaign trip to New Hampshire, and Rudy Giuliani addresses the California Republican Convention.', 'But first, the majority leader of the House, Congressman Steny Hoyer, and the minority leader of the House, Congressman John Boehner, are both here.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Congressman Hoyer, the debate on the war in Iraq now shifts to the House. Will there be a resolution offered by the Democrats disapproving of the president sending more troops to Iraq?', 'MR. RUSSERT: But on this particular resolution, you are backing off your commitment to allow the Republicans to have an alternative?', 'REP. HOYER: No, our resolution does not say anything about cutting off funds, John.', 'MR. RUSSERT: All right, let me get to that. But before I do, Congressman Hoyer, how many Democrats will vote for this resolution of disapproval?', 'REP. BOEHNER: I think that we have to find a way to help the Iraqis build a safe and secure Iraq.', 'REP. HOYER: John, with all due respect, do you remember in 1995 when you voted for a nonbinding resolution not to send 20,000 troops to Bosnia?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Congressman Boehner, the inspector general report about some of the intelligence that came out of the Pentagon extremely critical of that operation. Do you agree with the inspector general?', 'REP. BOEHNER: Tim, we, we raise political money to run campaigns. Democrats do it, and Republicans do it. When, when we put in the campaign finance laws, the Shays-Meehan bill a number of years ago, I voted against it because I thought it was nonsense. I think what we ought to do is we ought to have full disclosure, full disclosure of all of the money that we raise and how it is spent. And I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant. But there, there are a number of different ways that we go about raising those funds. Some of these are golf events, some of them are, are receptions, some of them are dinners.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Why not a 12-seat plane, which would be a, a, a very small part of the cost of a much larger plane?', 'REP. HOYER: John and his colleagues had the opportunity to come to all 52 hearings. Unlike us...', 'MR. RUSSERT: All right. All right. To be continued. The Democratic leader, the Republican leader, thanks very much for sharing your views.', 'Coming next, the race for the White House full swing. Candidates raising money, talking to supporters all across the country. And journalists, including yours truly, front and center in the Scooter Libby trial. Insights and analysis from David Broder and Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post, Gwen Ifill of PBS, and Roger Simon of The Politico, all coming up right here on MEET THE PRESS.', 'SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL): That is why, in the shadow of the old state Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a house divided to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still live, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States of America.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Gwen Ifill, you are there in Springfield. The senator also talked about it being an improbable quest. What was it like? What is your reporting on this event?', 'SEN. OBAMA: Giving all praise and honor to God for bringing us together here today.', 'It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education that I ever had and where I learned the meaning of my Christian faith.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Gwen Ifill, is there now a second phase of the coverage of Barack Obama where reporters and voters will start demanding from him real specifics on the real challenges confronting our country and world?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Rudy Giuliani went to California, Republican state convention, and came pretty close to officially declaring. This is what he said in Sacramento.', 'Howie Kurtz, I want to ask you about the Scooter Libby trial. William Powers in the National Journal has an interesting column where he thinks that the fact that journalists have to testify is good because it will open up in terms of the public being able to see how reporters cultivate relationships to get information. You have a different view of that?', "        A Meet the Press roundtable looks back at the president's speech on Friday and how the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case impacts the American people."]
