["Page 2: 'This Week' Transcript: Sens. Orrin Hatch and Amy Klobuchar; Eliot Spitzer - ABC News", 'Now his attorney told me that George Zimmerman may be a free man, he may have had the ankle bracelet cut off and taken off of him, but he is still walking around with a bulletproof vest.  And no matter what happens over the next couple of years, that man may still have to live in hiding -- George.', "Let's get more reaction from Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Trayvon Martin's family.  Mr. Crump, thank you so much for joining us this morning.  We know, as you've said, the family is heartbroken.  They are still under heavy security.  Do they accept the verdict?  And what do they want people to know this morning?", "CRUMP:  Well, they are trying to make sense of it all, George.  They want people to know that they're going to continue to fight for the legacy of their son, that he had every right to walk home from the 7-Eleven and not expect to be profiled and followed by a strange man.  They're trying to, like many parents, explain to the young people in their family what just happened, what is this about that a child can't have Skittles and a can of iced tea and walk home and not have a bullet lodged in his heart and his killer not be held accountable for profiling and following him.", "That's what they are dealing with, that's what most parents in America are dealing with this morning.", "STEPHANOPOULOS:  And we know they're -- you know, still grieving right now.  When you say they're going to fight for their legacy, what form is that going to take?  Will you filing a civil lawsuit against George Zimmerman, and do you want the Justice Department to have a civil rights investigation?", "CRUMP:  Well, right now they're concentrating on getting to get through this very trying time, George.  They have a Trayvon Martin Foundation that they have been working tirelessly on, because they know they had no power in the court system.  They had to depend completely on the justice system and pray that it would work for them as it worked for everybody else.", 'And so the one thing they can control is this foundation.  And Tracy and Sybrina have been trying to do that work so they can make sure there are no other children who get killed as a result of senseless gun violence.', "CRUMP:  Well, they are going to certainly look at that as an option.  They deeply want a sense of justice.  They deeply don't want their son's death to be in vain.  I mean, they are still in disbelief about his death and now they're in disbelief about this verdict.  It's just one of the things they have to deal with -- they're in church this morning, praying and turning to god, a higher authority, to make sense of it all.", 'STEPHANOPOULOS:  Are you satisfied with how the prosecutors handled this case?  Any concern that they overreached and they should have pursued lesser charges as well?', "CRUMP:  Well, George, I think that the prosecutors are very seasoned prosecutors.  They in their summations cut right to the heart of the matter, what this case was really about.  When prosecutor John Guy said if the roles were reversed, and Trayvon Martin would have followed and profiled and shot George in the heart, what would the verdict have been?  And that's the question that everybody is asking, that's why the whole world was watching this case to see if everybody can get equal justice, not just certain people.  And so that's troubling, George.", 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
