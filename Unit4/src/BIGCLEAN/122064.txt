[". chuck, thanks. let's drill down a little bit more now about the next steps in all of this. ", ', good morning to you. we just heard republicans could gum up the works. exactly how, as this thing moves to the reconciliation phase?', "reporter: good morning, lester. democrats' enthusiasm will have to be weathered by a couple of different challenges, first in the senate and then possibly even the courts. in the senate, what happens next is that senators must look at the package of fixes that house democrats were able to pass last night. that's the part of the bill that house democrats like the most, including changes like when taxes would take effect and who would be taxed to pay for new programs. the senate must vote on that. they've decided to use a controversial voting method known as reconciliation, meaning they only need a ", ", because there are specific rules that govern how that can be used. if any changes are made, it must go back to the house to be voted on again. now, senate republicans say they'll make those changes. ", " say they're going to hold firm. now, the courts -- this is also a possibility. there are at least three states that have ", ' does not have the authority to call for this individual mandate, requiring individuals to buy ', '        Obama administration officials and wonks call them "early deliverables." They\'re the benefits of the health legislation that would kick in this election year.', "They're designed to counter Republican denunciations that the legislation is a government takeover of the health care system that will drain the federal treasury.", 'But the question for Democrats is whether promoting the early changes will be more persuasive with voters than the Republican arguments. The answer may determine whether the Democrats retain their congressional majority.', 'James Capretta, a top budget official in the George W. Bush administration, is skeptical. He says he assumes the people who would benefit by the changes before November are in the "single-digit millions," not enough to have a big impact. "There aren\'t enough people in those categories to say, \'Yes, the increased taxes are worth it.\'"', "Dependent children could remain on their parents' health insurance plans until age 26.", 'People with health problems that left them uninsurable could qualify for coverage through a federal program.', "These are among the more than a dozen features of the new health care overhaul law that would take effect in 2010 under the measure passed Sunday. (Although the Senate bill approved Sunday by the House would become law with President Barack Obama's signature, Senate action is needed on the separately-passed House measure that would amend that law.) Other first-year items include a ban on lifetime limits on medical coverage, more oversight of premium increases and tax credits for some small businesses.", 'Capretta says that the legislation has big downsides for Democrats, including the sharp cuts to Medicare Advantage. Benefits in this private-plan part of Medicare likely will be pared because the bill includes payment reductions intended to make the program similar to traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage, Capretta says, "is going to get hammered, and it\'s hard to see how they avoid taking the blame."', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'Meanwhile, Republicans are keeping up a steady drumbeat of their concerns, saying the legislation will harm more Americans than it helps by raising government spending in a time of record deficits. Many in the GOP want to build support for repealing the law.', "New help for some uninsured: People with a medical condition that has left them uninsurable may be able to enroll in a new federally subsidized insurance program that is to be established within 90 days. The legislation appropriates $5 billion for this, although that may not be enough to cover all who apply; it's not clear how much consumers would pay as their share of the cost. About 200,000 people are covered in similar state programs currently, at an estimated cost of $1 billion a year, says Karen Pollitz, a research professor at Georgetown University.", 'Coverage of kids: Parents will be allowed to keep their children on their health insurance plan until age 26, unless the child is eligible for coverage through a job. ', 'Insurance plans cannot exclude pre-existing medical conditions from coverage for children under age 19, although insurers could still reject those children outright for coverage in the individual market until 2014.', 'Tax credits for businesses: Businesses with fewer than 25 employees and average wages of less than $50,000 could qualify for a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the cost of their premiums.', 'Changes to insurance: All existing insurance plans will be barred from imposing lifetime caps on coverage. Restrictions will also be placed on annual limits on coverage. Insurers can no longer cancel insurance retroactively for things other than outright fraud.', 'Government oversight: Insurers must report how much they spend on medical care versus administrative costs, a step that later will be followed by tighter government review of premium increases.']
