['German business morale edged up for a third straight month in July in a sign Europe\'s largest economy is picking up steam and should post modest growth in this election year, although the euro zone\'s travails still weigh on the mood.A bastion of strength in the early years of the currency bloc\'s crisis, the German economy narrowly avoided recession at the start of 2013 as a worsening global outlook diminished appetite for its products and willingness to invest.Yet recent data suggests Europe\'s growth locomotive tentatively recovering thanks mainly to domestic demand - good news for Germany\'s trade partners within the euro zone, where private industry bounced back to growth this month.The Ifo think tank said on Thursday its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 106.2 in July from 105.9 in June.
