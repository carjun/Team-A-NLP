['    January 20: Chuck Schumer, Ted Cruz, David Axelrod, Joe Scarborough, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Tom Brokaw, Richard Engel, Chuck Todd ', 'SEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ): These moves will give the Iraqis and America the best chance of success.', 'SEN. TED KENNEDY (D-MA): Escalation would be a policy of desperation built on denial and fantasy.', 'McCain and Kennedy, two key senators with very different views on the war, only on MEET THE PRESS.', 'But first, the decision by the president to send more American troops to Iraq, it sent off a heated debate in the U.S. Senate. Twenty more American troops killed yesterday, one of the bloodiest days of the war. With us now, Senator John McCain.', 'SEN. McCAIN: Well, I understand their frustration and sometimes anger over the lack of success and lack of progress, particularly coupled with optimistic statements made time after time when things were not going well and deteriorating. At the time of the first Gulf War, only 15 percent of the American people thought we ought to go to Kuwait and get rid of Saddam Hussein there. If it was as clear-cut as someone described, Tim, Joe Lieberman would not have been re-elected in the state of Connecticut.', 'We have, we have a military of 1.4 million. It seems to me that we could come up with 20,000 troops without the great difficulty that apparently the Pentagon feels it is.', 'SEN. McCAIN: Because it was clearly a failed policy. From the beginning, many of us knew that it was a failed strategy. It was based on the mistaken belief that the Iraqi army and police would be able to take over the responsibilities far more quickly than they were able to. And after the bombing of the Shia mosque, the, the crisis accelerated, and we saw and are seeing a steady deterioration of the situation. And if we continue it as we are, within months we would see a total breakdown in Iraq. We cannot afford it, in my view, as I said.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Do you have confidence that Mr. Maliki is someone who would truly be an ally on the war on terror? He has refused to describe Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and has refused to denounce Hezbollah for their activities in Lebanon.', 'MR. RUSSERT: As you well know, Democrats are now referring to the increase in American troops, the so-called surge, as the McCain doctrine. Do you accept that?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Let me turn to your 2008 presidential race. Are, are you prepared to formally announce, not just an exploratory committee, but a full announcement of candidacy?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Incurring favor with conservative groups that were very much opposed to your original legislation.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Senator John McCain, as always, we thank you for joining us and sharing your views.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Coming next, a very different view from the leading opponent to more troops in Iraq. Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts is here on MEET THE PRESS, next.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Senator Ted Kennedy, the war in Iraq, the 2008 presidential race, the entrance of Hillary Clinton and more after this station break.', 'MR. RUSSERT: You just heard John McCain say that a Senate resolution against President Bush increasing troops in Iraq, or your legislation to cap the number of troops in Iraq, is, in effect, a vote of no confidence in the American troops.', 'SEN. KENNEDY: If that is going to be the case. I hope that that is not the case. But if that is going to be the case, if the president is going to defy the military leaders, the American public, and a bipartisan is going to be contemptuous of those actions, I think we have a constitutional duty, a constitutional duty to take those steps. Now...', 'MR. RUSSERT: With the lack of security that exists in Iraq and the lack of the capability of the Iraqi army, to withdraw American troops now, in the estimation of the intelligence community, would put Iraq into total chaos and anarchy. Are you for that?', 'MR. RUSSERT: If we pulled out, the Maliki government would collapse and we would create a situation some say analogous to Afghanistan where terrorists would live there as a haven and plot the destruction of the United States and other countries around the world.', 'MR. RUSSERT: If we withdrew over the course of a year, and we saw Iran moving into southern Iraq, you saw the Saudis helping their fellow Sunnis in the Baghdad area of the Sunni triangle, you saw the Kurds and the Turks going at it up north, do we sit back and watch?', 'MR. RUSSERT: George Casey is going to return home, nominated by the president to be the chief of the staff of the Army. You heard Senator McCain come out against his nomination. Are you for or against him?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Senator Ted Kennedy, we thank you as always for joining us and sharing your views.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Check out our MEET THE PRESS Web site. You can now download both audio, video of the entire program of MEET THE PRESS, netcast and new video podcast: mtp.msnbc.com.', "        A Meet the Press roundtable looks back at the president's speech on Friday and how the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case impacts the American people."]
