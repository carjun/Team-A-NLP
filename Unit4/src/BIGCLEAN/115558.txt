Rival camera maker Nikon Corp is up only 26 percent.", 'Canon shares closed 0.3 percent higher on Wednesday before the earnings announcement, while the Nikkei fell 0.3 percent.', "Canon is also a major global manufacturer of printers and copiers, which were hit hard by Europe's debt woes and weak economy, although yen weakness since late last year has buoyed its export earnings.", 'Cameras now account for more than 60 percent of its overall operating profit and it had counted on its strength in high-end interchangeable-lens cameras to offset evaporating demand for compact cameras.', 'But on Wednesday Canon cut its target for interchangeable-lens camera sales to 9 million from 9.2 million, while compact cameras were cut to 14 million from 14.5 million. The previous projections were given at its last earnings report in April.', '"Chinese consumers tend to be very fond of cameras, especially high-end ones such as SLRs, but an economic slowdown has hit just as sales were recovering from last year," Tanaka said, referring to a sharp fall in China sales in late 2012 as consumers shunned Japanese products due to a territorial dispute.', 'Competition for compact cameras from smartphones is also likely to heat up with both Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Nokia Oyj introducing phones placing high-quality cameras at the heart of their designs.', "Canon's 380 billion yen operating profit forecast is also shy of analysts' average full-year operating profit forecast of 448.3 billon yen, based on a survey of 23 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.", "For the April-June quarter, Canon's operating profit rose 6.2 percent to 98.3 billion yen, exceeding the 95.9 billion yen average profit forecast from seven analysts.", '(Additional reporting by Mari Saito and Nobuhiro Kubo; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Matt Driskill)', ' (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2013.
