['            A mother of three disappears, leaving her loved ones to wonder what could have happened to her.

Three kids trying to make sense of a horribly frightening scene.', 'CHELSA HAWK: I think that was the first place my sister ran into. And then, so, she quickly called us in and then we followed her.', 'CHELSA HAWK: It was kinda haphazardly thrown together, you know, not quite smoothed out.', 'CONRAD HAWK: There was some drag marks and kind of smear marks leading out to the garage where they stopped. ', 'CONRAD HAWK: My initial reaction was, oh my God, what has happened? Who could have done this?', "CONRAD HAWK: We went in our mom's room, and her bathroom, and there's blood on the carpet.", "But it wasn't, though there were plenty of misunderstandings to come and questions that stubbornly refused to be answered. Like, where was Debbie Hawk? What happened to her? And what happened to that sacred bond that once held three children together?", "DAREN MATTESON: It appeared that she was drug out of the house, obviously against her will. In my 28 years, I've never seen that before. ", 'DAREN MATTESON: It looked like a staged crime scene. Her jewelry in her bedroom neatly laid out just where she had put it. Nothing was missing but her and her van.', 'DAREN MATTESON: Several neighbors actually heard a loud scream. It was a blood-curdling-type.', 'No, and not the type of person to whom bad things happen. Debbie was an accomplished woman, a sales rep for a pharmaceutical firm and, with a wide circle of friends, immensely popular...', 'TARYN: She was very regal and, to us, royalty. She definitely fits the bill as the princess.', 'Which is why the ribbons that suddenly bloomed everywhere around Hanford were royal purple. ', 'By then, as you can imagine, the whole town knew about the disappearance of Debbie Hawk.', 'AREND LABLUE: It appears that whoever left it there wanted somebody to get in and drive off. ', "AREND LABLUE: At that point, whoever was driving the van would immediately become a suspect in Debbie Hawk's disappearance.", 'Police were pretty sure that was exactly what the killer wanted. It was a ruse, an attempt to plant blame somewhere else. ', 'But, around town, some people had already begun directing blame at one individual. They thought they knew who did it.', 'Before long, in her absence, Debbie was famous, as if everybody in town had known the woman her children so loved.', 'WILLIAM "BUD" TRIANTIS: There was a lot of lives that have been shattered because of her demise.', 'DIANE TRIANTIS: She was very talkative, friendly. Likeable. Always was, kind of, the life of the party.', "They were married within a year. They built a home among his family's almond groves.", "DIANE TRIANTIS: I think they both wanted to have a family. And I think that was, like, the impetus for the acceleration, I guess you'd say, of the relationship.", 'CHELSA HAWK: I think it was easier to be the mediator than to have them yelling at each other on the phone.', 'Debbie did well enough as a pharmaceutical representative that she was able to buy her own home.', "CONRAD HAWK: She could finally start living her life the way that she'd wanted to. ", 'Except there were issues: Once, after they separated, during the squabbles over divorce, she claimed he tried to choke her... ', "Dave said that choking thing just never happened, that he wasn't ever violent with her.", "And the phone call was curious , thought Investigator Matteson, because Dave didn't ask why.", "Dave didn't seem to have much of a reaction at all to learning his ex-wife, the mother of his three kids, was missing. ", "Besides, Dave told them he was at home, asleep, in the early morning hours when police believed Debbie must have been killed. And his kids said they didn't hear him leave the house. They were there, too, at the time", "But then, they'd just begun to uncover the troubling secrets of Dave and Debbie Hawk.", "His own daughter, who spent the day after the abduction with Dave, told the police it couldn't have been him. ", "KIM AGUIRRE: He lived in what I understood to be a very nice home. He drove a late model suburban. That's hard to do on $6,000 a year.", 'KIM AGUIRRE: His response was to ask for half custody. The percentages were something like 65 with Debbie and 35 with Dave, and he wanted to make it an even 50-50.', 'But when investigators ran the numbers on that second fund, administered only by Dave?', 'Something like $300,000 was missing. And though Dave cried poverty, he bought his girlfriend, Mary Royer, a $27,000 Lexus, took her on vacation to Hawaii and used $60,000 to pay off divorce costs and the $1,500 he owed to his kids from the first set of trusts.', "But here, believed the detectives, was the heart of the motive for murder: Debbie, if she hadn't disappeared, was about to expose all that in court.", "Whatever they were on, they couldn't find the evidence to arrest him. Dave remained a free man... Something that made his own son, Conrad, very nervous.", 'Conrad had already told police about the night after he discovered his mom was missing, when he saw his dad sharing a bottle of wine with his girlfriend. ', "Conrad and Dave spent that summer on the outs; it was after quite some time of not getting along terribly well. And, in August 2006, two months after his mother's disappearance, child protective services took 16-year-old Conrad to a foster home.", 'CONRAD HAWKS: There were just a few altercations that we had had, kind of like what my mom had gone through.', 'MARY ROYER: "It\'s not gonna stop until that f---ing b---- is dead." Numerous times. ', 'So it all seemed quite suspicious. In fact, most people in town seemed to have made up their minds about Dave Hawk. But one of them was not the DA.', 'Prosecutor Larry Crouch told his investigators he would not charge Dave Hawk with the murder of his ex-wife Debbie.Even after it was obvious this popular single mother had been murdered, even after months of searching around Hanford, California, turned up no sign of her anywhere, and after police had convinced themselves that Dave was responsible, prosecutor Crouch would not budge. Not yet, anyway.', 'Now, imagine this: The police, not to mention most of the town, believed their father killed their mother, leaving three children caught in the middle. ', 'CONRAD HAWKS: I tried to cut all ties that I had with him as much as I could. He was nothing to me now.', "Chelsa says Dave was acting perfectly normal the day after whatever happened, happened. No odd behavior. Nothing whatsoever to suggest he'd been up all night committing a terrible crime. ", "CHELSA HAWK: So the things that convinced me about his innocence aren't there to convince them. I think they are defending my mom so much so that it's like they're gonna point to the most obvious suspect.", "But Chelsa isn't the only one in this small town who believes dave hawk is innocent... ", 'SANDY BROWN: I believe what he says, that he had nothing to do with her disappearance and presumed death. ', "As their son prepared to face serious financial charges, Dave's parents, Stan and Lois hawk, took over custody of Chelsa and Savannah. Not the way they expected to spend their 80s, any more than they expected to have to defend their son.", "STAN HAWK: Well, he's made some mistakes. But nothing of the scope that is generally accepted in the community. ", 'Stan established those trusts for his grandchildren, and says Dave had the right to use the money how he saw fit to benefit the children. ', 'When the trial finally began more than a year later, Dave faced murder and the earlier embezzlement charges together.', 'But really, there was no body, no DNA, no forensic evidence to show Dave had even been at the murder scene. Everybody in town seemed to have a theory. Apparently the prosecutor did, too. But was that proof?', 'DENNIS PETERSON: The alignment of the stars in this case was just stacked against us, stacked against Dave Hawk.', 'At least in the harsh court of public opinion, it looked bad for Dave Hawk as his murder trial approached in Hanford, California.', 'DENNIS PETERSON: We have this guy allegedly stealing from his kids, saying bad things about this sympathetic victim, and all of these things being widely played in the press', 'If there ever was a case for change of venue, this must be it, said the defense. After all, almost everybody seemed to have heard the accusations about Dave, and every time he had a court appearance, purple-clad "Friends of Debbie" crowded into the public gallery. In fact, during jury selection, said attorney Coleman, he actually heard some jurors tell the judge they had already decided Dave Hawk was guilty. ', 'Still, the defense application for a change of venue was denied, as was the defense request to separate the financial charges from the murder charge. The defense had argued the embezzlement accusations were unfairly prejudicial.', 'MARK COLEMAN: They wanted to make him look like a bad person, a person who would take money from his kids, would be likely to murder his ex-wife.', 'MARK COLEMAN: But the fact of the matter was, that was already exposed. It had already been filed in open declarations in court.', "MARK COLEMAN: The burden is on them to prove it's a duck. In this case, they didn't. ", 'No, the defense argued that the prosecution had absolutely no evidence that Dave even left his house the night Debbie was abducted and presumably murdered. In fact, his daughter Chelsa insisted he could not have left the house without her having heard him.', "And, even though investigators would tell the court that the kids slept so soundly it was hard to wake them up when they went to see them one morning, the defense claimed that the prosecution's theory of what happened just didn't add up.", 'So what did happen to Debbie Hawk? The defense floated this theory: Debbie worked in pharmaceutical sales; perhaps a drug addict had gone after the samples she kept in her van.', 'Though what the jury thought, no one could say. Then there was, inevitably, a conversation about whether or not Dave would testify.', "KEITH MORRISON: So you don't think they had any useful evidence against you at all?", "Dave Hawk, on trial for the murder of his ex-wife Debbie, did not testify, didn't tell the members of the jury what he was thinking. ", 'It was an awful problem, as he saw it, had been from the day his ex-wife Debbie disappeared through a trail of her own blood: The number one suspect...was him.', "And that's apparently what a great many people thought in Hanford, California, even as he sat here as a defendant in a murder case. ", 'You know how it can be, said Dave. Once people get it in their heads that you did something, they will tend to misinterpret everything, to make you look guilty.', "DAVE HAWK: I was home with my children in another town all night. But I'm being accused of being in another place committing a terrible crime based on financial shenanigans that didn't exist in the first place.", 'They also made a huge deal about something he supposedly said to his girlfriend about Debbie.', "DAVE HAWK: I might have, but I don't remember that. And that certainly does not mean that I'm going to go kill somebody.", "KEITH MORRISON: Well, maybe he's angry at his dad because his dad killed his mom.", 'Of course, investigators say they did look into that, and other leads, too, but they all came back to Dave and one primary motive.', "KEITH MORRISON: Weren't you, for example, afraid your father was going to find out what you were doing with that money from the trust fund? The father who lovingly put the money into the trust fund before you kind of siphoned it out?", "KEITH MORRISON: What part did I not understand? What I understand is you bought a $27,000 car using trust fund money. You took a trip to Hawaii with your girlfriend. You paid off your divorce attorney's fees and money you took from the first set of trusts by taking $60,000 out of the kid's second trust fund. ", "KEITH MORRISON: I'm talking about a job that actually paid enough to support your family, which is what a dad does.", 'We the jury find defendant David Martin Hawk guilty of the murder of Debbie Hawk.', "They are divided now. Conrad feels justice was served. Chelsa, devastated, has remained her father's champion. Sometimes, she says, her family has even questioned her unshakeable love for her mom.", "CONRAD HAWK: I personally don't think that she believes that her father is innocent. I think, in her mind, she would rather have one parent who may have done a horrible thing, than have no parent at all. ", "CONRAD HAWK: Well, we do the best we can. We see each other at holidays and whenever we're both in town. But it's the elephant in the room. "]
