Smoke was seen pouring out of one of the engines before the jet landed as abc's nick schifrin reports from heathrow airport with the latest on what's going on, the investigation into what happened on that flight. Good morning, nick. Reporter: Good morning, elizabeth. Passengers describe a harrowing takeoff. Two loud bangs and then the right engine exploded. Just minutes after lifting off the british airways airbus was belching smoke. The right engine on fire after some kind of technical fault. Up in the air david gallagher took this frightening photo, the engine exposed. Maybe five minutes after takeoff there was a loud popping sound. Not really an explosion but definitely not normal takeoff sound and I looked out the left window and I could see the cover had blown off the left engine. Reporter: The plane banked around, the pilot quickly made an emergency landing flying low over london rooftops, the passengers evacuateded and police and firefighters rushed to the plane. Ton seriously injured. The plane had to be towed away. The left engine still exposed and just minutes ago david gallagher tweeted one last photo watching coverage of his own emergency landing. I've been in close calls before but nothing like this. Reporter: And this left behind an absolute travel mess. B.A. Told us dozens of flights delayed or canceled. Lots of flights have been diverted to other airports but the 75 people on that flight this morning, josh, are happy to be back on the ground. As well they should be. Nick, thank you for that.
