['Though marketed as  "rustic," our clean, modern, fully-furnished cabins off the U.S. 19  expressway near Summersville Lake are recently built and include full kitchens,  well-appointed bathrooms, and convenient watercraft-parking areas. Decks,  balconies, and exquisite hardwood construction, however, invite the rusticity  of the woodlands into the cabins.', "Despite the woodland  locality, convenience doesn't take a back-seat. We're located less than one  mile from the U.S. 19 expressway, within a 10 minute drive of a variety of fine  restaurants at Summersville, WV, and within 20 minutes of many more at  Fayetteville, WV -- the largest rock-climbing and whitewater-rafting  destination in the eastern U.S."]
