["2011 SEASON IN REVIEW: Coming off three tumultuous, and disappointing seasons under former Michigan head coach Rich Rodriguez, the stakes were high for his replacement Brady Hoke entering the 2011 campaign. After all, Wolverine fans had endured the worst season in school history in 2008, followed by well- documented major NCAA rules violations, and then late-season collapses in 2009 and 2010.However, Hoke's debut season in 2011 could not have gone much better, as he led Michigan to an 11-2 record and its first BCS bowl game since 2006. Included along the way were key wins over Notre Dame, Nebraska and, finally, arch-rival Ohio State, snapping a seven-game skid against the Buckeyes.In the Sugar Bowl, the Wolverines knocked off Virginia Tech in overtime to finish the season ranked 12th, officially returning to national prominence. Hoke, who had vowed to restore the team's previously shaky defense and attitude, made an immediate impact on the recruiting scene and trusted his newcomers.
