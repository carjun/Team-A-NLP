['  WARNING!!!!!!.....DO NOT USE THE Christmas tree app. on Facebookplease be advised it will crash your computer. Geek squad says its oneof the WORST trojan-viruses there is and it is spreading quickly.Re-post and let your friends know. THANKS PLEASE REPOST!Sophos Security reports Users believe they\'re doing the right thing when they share warnings like this -- but unfortunately they haven\'t checked their facts. Although anyone could at any time create a rogue application with the name "Christmas Tree" of course, we\'re not aware of any malware which uses this disguise. Furthermore, since when was Geek Squad a reliable source for information about new malware? Wouldn\'t it be more sensible to check with an established anti-virus company? A legitimate warning would at the very least have included some links to further information -- such as a statement on Geek Squad\'s website. Ironically, the hoax is probably spreading much faster than any of the genuine commonly encountered Facebook viruses at the moment.review the lessons about forwarding unconfirmed e-mails All Facebook Sophos Facebook fan ']
