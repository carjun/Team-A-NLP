No one wants that to happen. And in fact, your policy may not cover all the charges billed by the rental car company. ', 'So why not skip your own insurance policy and just file a claim with your credit card company?', 'Anna Aurillo is an environmental advocate in Washington, D.C. A number of years ago she rented a car in Utah to drive from the airport to a campsite.', 'The repairs cost $800, but then the rental company told her it took a month to fix the damage, something Aurillo had no way to verify or dispute.

He recently changed his mind.', 'Perkins recommends Diners Club cards because they all have free primary collision damage waiver coverage of up to $75,000 per incident. This is insurance coverage for rentals of 45 consecutive days or less. It will pay for physical damage or theft of the vehicle, towing charges and reasonable loss of use charges.']
