["        Wilmington, N.C., July 30, 2006. It's 2 a.m. Last call at the Junction Pub and Billiards. And for one woman who walked out this door into the shadows, last call very likely marked the last moments of her life.", "Lisa Valentino: I got a phone call from my father saying there's a problem. He said your sister Allison is missing. They can't find her.", 'Suburban New Jersey. Lisa Valentino heard the news from her father, John. He learned that his youngest daughter, 34-year-old Allison Foy, was missing. But how he learned it was just as unsettling.', "John: A message was left on the phone. Please call the police department that your daughter's missing.", "Josh Mankiewicz: Did the two of you find it strange that you had to find out about this from the police department, and not from Allison's husband?", 'Allison was a married mother of two young daughters. An accomplished dancer, and gymnast. The only member of a tightly-knit family to have moved out of the New York area to North Carolina.', "Lisa Valentino: The day that she actually went missing, I was having a birthday party here, and she had called and I said, you know what Allison, everybody's coming here. She said, Okay I'll give you a call when things settle down a bit. And I said okay, and that was it. Unfortunately that's the last time I ever spoke with her.Allison had been reported missing by her husband Michael. Wilmington Police Detective Mike Overton and Captain Marshall Williamson started working on the case and found a marriage very clearly on the rocks.", "MikeOverton: At the time she went missing, she'd been going out late at night to bars, leaving the husband and kids behind.", "As police in Wilmington tried to reconstruct the night Allison Foy vanished, they discovered she'd gone to work at her new job as assistant manager at a Wilmington hotel, then spent those last hours at the Junction Pub in the company of another man. Not a lover, but by all accounts, a confidante who said he thought Allison was too drunk to drive home, and asked the bartender to call a cab for Allison.", 'He saw a cabbie poke his head in the door and watched Allison walk out with him.', "MikeOverton: We've heard she left alone. We heard she left in a taxicab. We heard she left in someone's car. We know she didn't leave in her car. Police found that in the Pub's parking lot. No clues inside it.", "Allison's family simply could not believe the theory that she might just have taken off without telling anyone.", "Josh Mankiewicz: Is it possible, that if Allison had decided to walk away from her life, that she wouldn't have told you?", "Lisa Valentino: No way! No way! There's no way that she would've just picked up, one, and left without telling any of us, but two, not taking her kids? Never!", "Allison's husband's behavior became an issue. He didn't help in the search for her. And just days after she vanished, he cut off service to Allison's cell phone.", "Lisa Valentino: His answer was that he didn't have enough money to pay her bill. ", 'Marc Benson, private eye with more than 20 years in law enforcement. The family hired him to aid in the search.', 'Josh Mankiewicz: Her husband Michael was essentially unconcerned about her well-being at the beginning.', "MarcBenson: He was thinking that she was somewhere alive and well where she shouldn't have been.", "Michael Foy did not want to speak with Dateline. He told police he had nothing to do with his wife's disappearance, and as the weeks began to pass, police came to the same conclusion.", "Mike Overton: He was home with the kids was his alibi. You know, we went through the house, he gave us his computer, came in and wrote statements. He's done everything I've asked him, except for one thing.", "Josh Mankiewicz: Because the question, are you glad she's gone, might have looked incriminating even though he might not have had anything to do with it?", "And that's where things stood a few months after Allison's disappearance. We turn now to our team members for their thoughts: Dwayne Stanton, retired homicide detective from Washington, D.C. Investigated Chandra Levy's murder. Yolanda McClary, crime scene investigator in Las Vegas, and a model for the character on the hit series, CSI. Alan Jackson, prosecutor in Los Angeles who specializes in high profile cases.", "Alan Jackson: There are a couple questions about Michael Foy that have to be answered. Number one, why wouldn't you call the person that your wife is closest to, but number two and much more chilling to me, is he didn't take part in the search! That's a big red flag. I mean, don't you agree?", "Dwayne Stanton: I agree. I agree. And that he immediately cut off her cell phone which makes you think, y'know what? She won't be using this phone again.", "Yolanda McClary: But on the other hand, people handle emotional stress in different ways. He's a very angry, angry man. He thinks his wife ran away with somebody. And anger takes over to do things I don't think that you would normally do.", "Alan Jackson: No. No way. The kids! The kids. My first reaction is, she'll leave the husband. But she's not gonna leave the kids.", "Yolanda McClary: The possibility's getting slimmer. We need to look at all avenues, don't stick on one thing because we need to find her, if she is still alive. And if the facts don't face up to it, then move on.", "Our team focused on two key witnesses: Allison's confidante, who by his account, saw a cabbie poke his head in the door of the pub, and watched Allison walk out with him.", "Dwayne Stanton: You want that cab driver! The person who stuck his head in the door and that she left with. I'm sure that they can track down what cab was at the junction pub that particular night.", 'Where was that cab driver? And where was Allison? The answer? Not far from where she was last seen. But when she was found, police also found more than they were looking for.', 'Wilmington N.C., spring 2008. Allison Foy, married mother of two daughters, had been missing for nearly two years. She had just started a new job in hotel management. And the last time her sister had spoken with her, on the day before Allison disappeared in July 2006, Allison had been celebrating.', 'And then she was gone. Her best friend saw her leaving the Junction Pub and Billiards at closing time with a cab driver. Since then, no trace. Not a word; not a credit card charge, not a phone call.', 'Our team of investigators wanted to find that cab driver. And of course, so did the Wilmington police. Detectives searched, but something strange: There was no record of any cab being dispatched to the pub, no record of any calls made from the pub to any cab company.', "At the same time, Allison's unhappy marriage was pointing police toward her husband, Michael. But then, within a few weeks, investigators moved in new directions.", "Three miles from the pub. April 2008. A man walking through a strip of woods just off the main road found bones bleached white from the North Carolina sun. It's a set of human remains.", "Mike Overton: I had one of those police officer gut feelings. I know this is gonna be Allison. This is gonna be who I've been looking for for basically two years now.", "DNA tests would later prove that the remains were those of Allison. Her skeleton had been covered with growth and debris, and from that, forensic experts estimated that Allison's body had been there just about since her disappearance nearly two years before. ", "Lisa Valentino: There was a little. Because now I know what happened. And I can give answers to her kids. And my dad can have answers about his daughter and maybe we can mourn a little bit and bring her home and, y'know, kind of put her to rest in a way that is deserving of her.", "But that was not the real surprise. What completely shocked everyone - and that's not too strong a word - what made headlines and turned this case in a completely new direction was that just ten feet from Allison's remains, was another skeleton. A second female victim. A second murder.", 'Josh Mankiewicz: Were these remains in the same condition? Had they been there the same amount of time?', "Police concluded Allison's body had been there likely since the night she went missing; the second body, about half as long. Both bodies, simply dumped. No sign of posing or ritual. Discarded, like so much trash. But who was this Jane Doe?", "Months later came an ID: Angela Nobles Rothen, 42 years old. A mother of one. She'd last been seen 9 months earlier. But Angela was much different from Allison Foy. She had drug problems, and had been known to work the streets as a prostitute.", "SoniaWilliams: She had a good heart, she'd give anybody the shirt off her back. She deserved to live, just like anybody else.", 'Josh Mankiewicz: What connects Angela and Allison? That had to be the first question you asked yourself.', "Mike Overton: None at all. They didn't hang out in the same places. Didn't go to the same, y'know, restaurants or bars that we could tell.", 'Two women connected not in life, but in death. Who killed them? How? And where their bodies were found, investigators found little evidence otherwise.', 'Mike Overton: There was some clothing found. But not all the clothing that you would expect to find.', "Josh Mankiewicz: So it's likely to believe that these bodies were naked or nearly naked when they were dumped?", "So perhaps a common motive: sexual assault. And a common manner of death: by knife. Autopsies showed Angela's throat was slit. ", 'Lisa Valentino: It was a terrible way that her life was taken from her. And her two daughters got robbed. Somebody took their mother away. She was a great mom. And her life were her two daughters.', "Alan Jackson: And it tells us some things about the criminal who's committed the crime as well. I'd tend to think it was a bigger person rather than a small person. This is a first-degree intentional homicide. This is somebody who wanted her dead, and wanted her to suffer, and she was never, ever, ever, gonna take another breath on this earth when he was done with her.", "Josh Mankiewicz: Is it too much of a jump to say there's a serial killer in Wilmington?", "Alan Jackson: My answer to that is yeah, a serial killer in my mind is someone who's randomly acting to assuage demons they've got inside them and randomly killing.", "Alan Jackson: I do not. In my mind it's not enough to think yet that these are random killings. ", "Josh Mankiewicz: As soon as you find a second victim, all of a sudden the husband doesn't look so good anymore?", "Josh Mankiewicz: Your first avenue I'm guessing, would be to try to figure what those two women had in common?", "Yolanda McClary: Well, y'know, on the surface it appears they don't have anything in common but in reality they have one thing in common, and that is they both live a little bit of a higher-risk lifestyle. Okay, you've got one who's a prostitute, that's definitely high-risk, being with men that you have no idea who they are.", "Yolanda McClary: And she left quite drunk, which means you've lost all your senses, you've lost your control and you're placing that in the hands of someone you don't know, so they do have something in common.", 'Alan Jackson: What is the connection between the junction bar and this field, where the bones were laid? Is this a well known place? Is this a secluded place?', "Josh Mankiewicz: The area where the bodies were found is near an area in Wilmington where prostitutes are known to take their clients. So prostitutes would've known that area.", 'Dwayne Stanton: Prostitutes as well as johns! The people who solicit prostitution! ', "Alan Jackson: If they've been there, which narrows the focus even more. This was not a random body dump. This place was chosen for its seclusion, it was chosen for its familiarity. The person didn't go back once. They went back twice. Secure the second time with the idea that he'd gotten away with it the first time! ", "Dwayne Stanton: He's comfortable with it at this point. Maybe someone who'd been there before.", "It turns out that private eye hired by Allison's family had made a discovery that will give our investigators - and the case - a whole new direction.", 'A boneyard in Wilmington. Allison Foy, Angela Rothen. Two women, two vastly different lives, sharing, apparently, only a common grave. And as our team of investigators points out, a killer who felt comfortable and safe in the area where their bodies were dumped.', "Then, a break in the case: incredibly, via e-mail to Marc Benson, the private eye hired by Allison's family, an e-mail sent by a woman to the radio station where Benson hosts a Saturday afternoon talk show.", "Marc Benson: She said, there is talk amongst the people in the bar that my husband may have had something to do with Allison's disappearance. ", "The bar? Junction Pub and Billiards. Where in July 2006, Allison spent what is believed to be the last night of her life. The woman's name? Susan Iannone.", 'Marc Benson: She frequents the bar all the time. As a matter of fact, her husband/is a fixture at the bar!', "Marc Benson: I think so, I really do. So when I called her I said, y'know, why would they say that? And she said because he had an altercation with a prostitute a week before.", "A prostitute? Remember, the second body next to Allison's, just down the road from that bar, was that of Angela Rothen. Who at the time of her death was believed to be working as a prostitute. ", "Marc Benson: I immediately went to the Wilmington police department. Found out that there was an actual case involving her husband. That he'd picked up a prostitute and had assaulted her.", "Sonia Williams, Angela Rothen's friend. A now-drug-free-former-prostitute. There's more to her story. She claimed she'd been assaulted by Tim Iannone.", 'SoniaWilliams: He had an open large-sized box cutter knife and he got it and put it to my neck and he said, You will do what I tell you to do. And at that point, he grabbed the back of my hair and made me continually have oral sex with him.', 'SoniaWilliams: He told me I could leave and when I tried to leave, he grabbed me and dragged me down on the seat, he tied me up with duct tape, he beat me in the head.', "SoniaWilliams: I thought that if I didn't get away from him, I was going to die.", 'Sonia did manage to break free, and escape. Within hours, Tim Iannone was under arrest.', 'Iannone was charged with kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon in the attack on Sonia Williams. But rather than be a reliable witness, Williams admits to giving police and prosecutors the slip, preferring not to relive the horrors of the experience, but instead to get high to blot out the memory. The result: without her testimony, Iannone was offered a plea deal, and was sentenced to probation.', 'For private eye Mark Benson, a pattern was emerging. Three more hookers told police that they, too, had had violent sexual encounters with Tim Iannone. Benson knew Iannone had convictions for embezzlement and larceny on his criminal record, but no history of sex crimes. ', "The evidence against him is entirely circumstantial, but there is a lot of it. For example: the spot where Iannone's alleged assault of the prostitute took place? It's located perhaps 100 yards from where Angela's and Allison's bodies would later be found.", "Josh Mankiewicz: Did that make him the number one suspect in Allison's disappearance?", "So the private eye narrowed his focus to the case he was hired to solve: Allison Foy's murder.", 'And two more details jumped out: in July 2006, Tim Iannone lived just around the corner from the pub where Allison was last seen. And finally, there was this:', "Remember, on the night she disappeared from the pub, Allison's best friend said she'd had too much to drink to drive her own car home. So a call was made. And her friend said Allison left that night with a cabbie who stuck his head in the door and said, Did anyone here call a cab?", "And what does Tim Iannone do for a living? At the time of Allison's disappearance, he was a cab driver.", "Josh Mankiewicz: So it's possible that when the bartender that night called a cab for Allison, she was calling Tim Iannone?", "In fact, Iannone - who was a regular at the pub - had his cell phone number on a special list, kept behind the bar as a cabbie to call if anyone needed a ride home. That could explain why police hadn't found any record of a cab being called to the Junction Pub and Billiards that night.", "Dwayne Stanton: And frequents prostitutes! It doesn't get much better than this!", "Josh Mankiewicz: No one has. What do the three of you make of Tim Iannone's wife essentially making him a suspect?", "Dwayne Stanton: That's pretty powerful! My experience has been when women put their husbands on the radar screen in the police department, usually it's because of fear. Or they've done something to irritate them or make them mad. Why is it that she didn't she go to him? To Tim and say, honey, are you involved in this? I heard in the bar that you might be involved in this. Why would they be saying that, honey?", "Yolanda McClary: No, I think somebody would've called in that for ten thousand reward if they really thought it was him.", 'Dwayne Stanton: Find Mr. Iannone, bring him in and spend some quality time with Mr. Iannone.', 'Wilmington, N.C., population 98,000. The question being asked was whether, hidden among the residents, was a killer. Stalking women.', 'A seemingly innocent e-mail to private eye Marc Benson - a message from a woman worrying about her husband - had led to a suspect in the murders of Allison Foy and Angela Rothen. That suspect, cab driver Tim Iannone, had been involved in that incident with a prostitute at a location close to where the bodies had been found. And he was a regular at the pub where Allison had been last seen.', "Wilmington Police Detective Mike Overton took the private eye's information, and soon found more: A witness had spotted someone, a cab driver, he said, acting suspiciously in the area where the bodies were found.", "Despite Iannone denying any part in the murder, and passing the polygraph, in June 2008, police had enough circumstantial evidence against Iannone to make their move. Executing a search warrant that gave them permission to search Iannone's home, his vehicles, his previous residence - and any taxi cabs that Iannone might have driven during the time frame of the murders.", 'Mike Overton: Searched the house he was presently living in. Nothing. Storage shed, vehicles, found absolutely nothing to link him to these crimes.', "Lisa Valentino: I just don't understand how they swear out a search warrant, there's all this circumstantial evidence, and then they turn up, y'know, nothing!", 'Time to talk to the man at the center of the case. Meet the cab driver. Tim Iannone. He and his wife Susan agreed to sit down with us in December 2008, largely in response to what they claim was irresponsible coverage by the local TV stations and newspapers in Wilmington, after details of the search warrant became public.', 'Josh Mankiewicz: Why are you doing this interview today? What do you want people to know?', "Tim Iannone: You're pre-judging and your lip service to details that you know nothing about hurt people. Hurt people that don't need to be hurt.", "Josh Mankiewicz: Do you think people who see you on the street who read about you in the newspaper - do they think you're a guy who got away with murder?", 'At this point, investigators believed Iannone was either a killer, or one of the unluckiest men on earth. A man whose own wife put him on the law-enforcement radar screen in that e-mail to the private eye. That was after after Iannone was charged in that incident with now-former prostitute Sonia Williams.', "Susan Iannone: Truthfully? And this will be the first time that my husband's ever heard this. And if I have tears, you'll understand that. I feel responsible for all this. And he doesn't even know it rumors were going around that my husband had something to do with Allison. Well, that made me mad.", "So what did Susan Iannone do to defend her husband of 24 years, the father of her two children? She essentially turned him in, to private eye Marc Bensen, hoping she says, that the P.I. could help clear her husband's name.", "Josh Mankiewicz: The rumors that your husband was involved with Allison's disappearance?", "SusanIannone: The reason for contacting Marc was, this is crazy! Let's get this out of the way.", "Josh Mankiewicz: You're much more interested in defending his reputation than he is.", "SusanIannone: Tim and I are two very different people, if you haven't seen that already. Of course I'm gonna defend him. I know what the truth is.", 'But is it the truth about the encounter that put Iannone under a microscope for the murders?', "Tim Iannone: I really don't know that I can talk about that to be honest, because I don't know about the civil litigation that supposedly might be pursued on her behalf.", "SusanIannone: You can simply tell 'em that she stole from you! But you don't have to elaborate any more than that.", 'Tim Iannone: She stole from me, more or less. But there was no assault. No beating. The worst thing I ever did was pull her hair to keep her from running. But it was not an attack, a rape. It was nothing like that.', 'Sonia Williams denies stealing from Iannone, sticks by her story, and now wishes she had shown up as a witness to help seal a case that was eventually pleaded down.', 'Tim Iannone: Crime against nature, having oral sex in a public place. More or less.', "Josh Mankiewicz: So other prostitutes who say that you've assaulted them, they're also lying?", 'SusanIannone: Sometimes you have to consider the source, be it right, be it wrong.', "Josh Mankiewicz: Meaning that a prostitute's word is worth less than a guy who works for a living?", "December 2008: Tim and Susan Iannone sat down to answer questions about Tim's possible involvement in the murders of Angela Rothen and Allison Foy.", 'Like the Wilmington police, our team members had specific questions they wanted answered.', "Alan Jackson: If there's something we don't know, if he has an airtight alibi that, y'know, he was on a beach in Jamaica someplace, let's reassess.", 'Josh Mankiewicz: So the question of whether Tim Iannone has an alibi becomes a very big issue?', "TimIannone: I don't have one. I don't know where I was that night. I mean, I was home I would guess.", "SusanIannone: I do! We were home by seven o'clock. And that's where we stayed. That's where he was.", "Josh Mankiewicz: It's hard for me to believe that you don't understand why you would be a suspect. You were accused of assaulting prostitutes!", 'Josh Mankiewicz: You drive a cab. One of the victims was last seen by at least one witness trying to get a cab to leave the bar.', "Josh Mankiewicz: So it's not a leap, I think, for anybody to think the police ought to be looking pretty seriously at you.", 'TimIannone: Correct. I never had a problem with the police investigation, I mean as far as them looking at me. I would have looked at me!', 'Josh Mankiewicz: They asked for DNA evidence, you gave it?

We agreed not to identify her.", "Woman: He picked me up on numerous occasions, at least 10 to 15 times.

One piece of evidence they don't have back yet is DNA that they're gonna get off the sweater and other garments found at the dump site.", 'Alan Jackson: This was a Lizzie Borden bloodbath! It was horrendous, so the killer came in contact with her sweater, came in intimate close contact with her sweater.', "Alan Jackson: That DNA is at the center of this investigation.
