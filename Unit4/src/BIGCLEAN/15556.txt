(Evan Vucci/AP Photo)', 'Mitt Romney will display his foreign policy prowess this week when he embarks on the first foreign trip of his candidacy, making stops in the United Kingdom, Israel and Poland on a six-day trip his staff describes as a learning opportunity, rather than an effort to define his foreign policy.', '"There are a number of challenges the world faces today, and it\'s an opportunity for [Romney] to visit a country that each have a strong and important relationship with the United States," said policy director Lanhee Chen, adding that the trip will serve as a chance for Romney "to demonstrate a clear a resolute stand with nations that share our values and possess the fortitude to defend those values in the name of a more peaceful world."', '"We don\'t anticipate that this is an opportunity for the governor to make any specific policy pronouncements," said Chen, who said specifics on his foreign policy would be outlined in more detail during a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Reno, Nev., on the eve of the trip overseas.', '"He is really abroad to learn and to listen.  There will be other opportunities for the governor to articulate additional policy prescriptions and foreign policy."', 'Evan Vucci/AP PhotoMitt Romney gestures during a campaign stop...

Romney, who ran the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, will also attend other Olympic events while in London with his wife, Ann, who will remain at the games to watch her dressage horse compete.", 'But the couple of days Romney spends in London , the candidate arriving Wednesday, will also be filled with a series of meetings with British officials, including Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor of Exchequer George Osborne and foreign Secretary William Hague.  He will also meet with the leader of the opposition Labor Party, Ed Milliband, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as well as former Prime Minister Tony Blair.', 'Aides to Romney said that while several other heads of state will be in London at the same time for the Olympics, they are still working to see whether "schedules will sync up" and allow for additional meetings with leaders from other countries that Romney won\'t be visiting on this trip. Romney will attend several fundraisers while in London as well.', 'The second leg of Romney\'s trip will begin Saturday, when the candidate arrives in Israel, his fourth trip to the Middle Eastern country. The highlight of this portion of the trip is a major speech in Jerusalem, which aides say will "project Gov. Romney\'s strong view that America needs to stand by its allies, particularly allies that are under siege like Israel, particularly democratic allies who have such a shared history and shared values with America."', "Obama and Romney on Gun Laws, Campaign Takes a Break After Colorado, George W.
