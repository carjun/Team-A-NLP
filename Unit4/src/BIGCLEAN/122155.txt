["But imagine a restaurant with one kitchen, one chef, but two doors and two price lists. That's the model of health care that some doctors are practicing. ", 'In New York City, msnbc.com heard of doctors locating their practices on corners, so they can have one door where they take insurance and another door offering services for patients who pay cash up front for each procedure.', 'We visited one of these clinics with two doors, to see how it works. The result is a glimpse into a two-tiered system of health care, a system that could be coming to a street corner near you.', "On Manhattan's fashionable Upper East Side, the door on 77th Street says Lenox Hill Radiology. It's a busy place, with 20 or 30 people typically waiting in chairs. It takes insurance.", "But if you walk a few steps down the block to Madison Avenue, and one block up to 78th Street, you'll walk through the door of New York Private Medical Imaging. The waiting room has only four chairs, usually empty. It takes cash, checks and credit cards. You can try to recoup some of your money later if you have insurance.", 'Both doors ultimately lead to the same area of changing rooms and scanning equipment. The same technicians perform PET scans and MRIs on the same machines. The employees are warned, in a written policy, not to tell the patients about the other door.', 'But another group of doctors has set up their own segregated system, taking insurance from patients who come through one door, while collecting higher fees from patients who can afford to pay up front. ', 'To see how it works, msnbc.com sent two reporters, Linda Carroll and Helen Popkin, for their routine mammograms on the same afternoon to document their experiences. And later we returned to interview doctors on both sides. ', 'The purpose: to determine if both women received the same care. And if there were any differences, were they meaningful or superficial?', "At the Lenox Hill clinic, on the insurance side, Helen waited 15 days to get an appointment. On the day of her mammogram, she stood in line at the reception desk in a crowded waiting room. An elderly patient wandered the reception area in her hospital gown, pleading for someone to help her. In the changing room, Helen's gown was the usual thin seersucker. The technician was friendly and efficient, though Helen didn't see a doctor. She went home not knowing whether she was healthy or not, and waited nine days for her results. But it was good news, a clean bill of health. Though the list price was $350, Helen's insurance paid the clinic $140 and she paid nothing, because her health insurance covers preventive care such as mammography.", 'Dr. Carmel Donovan used to be on the insurance side of this setup, at Lenox Hill Radiology. Her husband and son still manage both sides. Eight years ago she put in the second door and a separate reception desk, incorporating as New York Private Medical Imaging.', '\t    Two doctors in the same place with different methods: Dr. Carmel Donovan, left, doesn\'t take insurance, and emphasizes taking time with the patient. Dr. Marc Liebeskind, right, works in managed care and sees his patients "digitally," meaning he reviews their scans without meeting them.', "Talking with patients allows her to explain what she found, or to reassure them that she found nothing. And she says that conversation can help her with a diagnosis. Say a child comes in with a possible fracture of an arm, but from the X-ray it's not clear.", 'Although the actual mammogram itself seemed identical for Helen and Linda, there was one subtle difference.', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", "After a quick quality check on Helen's scans, on the insurance side, the technician said the pictures were sharp, and sent her on her way. ", 'The technician did the same with Linda, the boutique patient, and also said the scans were sharp. ', "But when Linda's radiologist examined Linda's X-rays a few minutes later, she said one of them was blurry, and sent the technician back to repeat it. ", "That couldn't have happened on the insurance side. By the time Helen's radiologist looked at her X-ray, days later, Helen would be long gone. If the radiologist thought one of her scans was blurry, the doctor would either have had to rely on the information at hand or call her back for another appointment.", "A few minutes after Linda's mammogram on the boutique side, a radiologist, Dr. Mona Darwish,knocked and walked into the changing room.", 'Linda asked a couple of questions about a previous mammogram, and the doctor reassured her again. The conversation went back and forth. They laughed together, the tension broken. ', 'That personal contact was not available to Helen or the other patients on the insurance side. ', 'As it turned out, while Darwish is on the staff of the insurance side of the clinic, she reads the mammograms for patients on both the insurance and boutique sides.', 'So, although our two patients went through separate doors, they had their scans read by the same radiologist. ', 'But only Linda, the boutique patient, got to meet the doctor and get an immediate result. ', "If Linda's mammogram had shown something unusual, Donovan said, Darwish would have spent a lot more than 35 seconds with her. But first the doctor would have called Linda's primary care physician to discuss who would deliver what information.", "On the insurance side, when Helen's doctor got her results nine days later, it was only a written summary, not copies of the scans. Helen said a previous mammogram had left her with questions, but she didn't get a chance to ask those questions this time around. ", "One of the 20 radiologists on the insurance side at Lenox Hill, Dr. Marc Liebeskind, said he and his colleagues offer equally good health care as the boutique side, although they don't meet most of their patients. ", '\t    Dr. Marc Liebeskind reads 80 to 100 scans a day, without meeting most patients. "You don\'t want to be saying the tumor is getting smaller because I like Bessie. You want to be able to say the tumor is getting smaller because I can objectively measure its volume."', 'Scientific studies back up his view that a doctor who reads more scans can be more accurate. Doctors identify more cancers, and are less likely to think healthy tissue was a cancer, when they have more years of experience and examine more scans per year.', 'But would his work improve if he also took a few minutes to examine the patient, if he had that 35-second or longer conversation?', "A written policy given to employees at the clinic forbids them from discussing the other side. If patients were referred to Lenox Hill because it takes a certain insurance coverage, and then those patients ended up on the other side, paying more for care at Private Imaging, the business would be open to allegations of fraud, the policy says. Steering of patients to a more profitable service would violate the clinic's contracts with insurance companies.", 'Donovan said patients learn of her boutique service from other doctors, often boutique physicians themselves. She said she knows of other doctors in New York City who have two doors, one for managed care and the other for boutique patients.', 'Bioethicist Art Caplan, an msnbc.com contributor, said that even the relatively subtle differences in the experiences of the two patients are unsettling.', "While boutique and concierge care have been sold to patients for their benefits to those who pay extra, Caplan said, they have eroded the care that other patients receive, particularly the ability to get the doctor's ear for a few minutes."]
