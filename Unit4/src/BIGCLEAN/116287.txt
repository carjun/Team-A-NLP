He said he had no details on the equipment that was being sent.', 'He added that proof of continuing Qatari assistance came a few days ago when Qatar gave $5 million to the SNC to purchase humanitarian aid supplies.', 'Moreover the newly-elected leader of the SNC, Ahmad al-Jarba, is planning to visit Qatar within days to coordinate aid supplies, Haraki added.', "Last week, Jarba met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz in the kingdom. No official details were released about that meeting.", 'In recent months, dominant Gulf Arab power Saudi Arabia has prevailed over Qatar to impose itself as the main outside force supporting the Syrian rebels, a move that may curb the influence of Qatari-backed Islamist militants.', "Haraki said in answer to a question that he did not expect Jabra's visit to Qatar to cause diplomatic friction between the SNC and Saudi Arabia.", '"Qatar and Saudi Arabia are both brotherly countries and have good relations and there are no sensitivities about al-Jarba coming to Doha," he said.', ' (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2013.
