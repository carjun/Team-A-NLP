We still got fed and taken care of, and the norm, you know? But it was all about them.', '(Photo of Lloyd by photo of Judy; exterior of house; semi on highway; photo of Lloyd; photo of Judy; beauty salon sign; photo of Lloyd and Judy; photo of Tommy and Lloyd; photo of Pamela; photo of Sandy; house exterior; photo of Judy)', 'Ms. BURKE: (Voiceover) And when I first called, Judy told me he was away on business.', 'Ms. BURKE: It was hard.

But on top of that, to be told that my father purposely left us without a word, did we do something? I mean, are we not lovable enough? Did we do something terrible?', 'KIMBERLY: She tries not to make her mad, you know, do things that I know would make her happy, clean the house. We all worked in the yard. Everything had to be just so. So it looked nice when somebody came over. So it looked normal.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) And if it did, the love could be so good, so warm, enveloping, happy. If only the furies could be kept at bay.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) That, said Kim, was the woman her children knew so intimately, not like the Judy who presented herself one way or another to the outside world.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Watching this, said Kim, she knew very well that love one moment to the next could be given or withdrawn.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) And thus it was abandonment Kim feared when her mother brought men home.', 'MORRISON: Because it was changing all the time, and all these men would come into her lives, your life, and then go again. But you had her.', '(Photo of Judy; photos of Lloyd; photo of Judy; rain on street; pawn shop sign; photo of Judy and Tom Gough; Kimberly at pier; Kimberly and woman;', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Gary had, what would you call it, antennae for these things.', 'Mr. ZIEGLER: Everybody has a secret or two, but this? I deliberated for days before telling anybody.', 'Mr. ZIEGLER: Correct. I knew, the way I was raised, I needed to do the right thing.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) The mystery is about to be answered when DATELINE continues.', 'KIMBERLY: I never really questioned her. I just sit there and let her talk, you know.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) But that was not what Judy had in mind, said Kim, and soon it was much cleaner what she did intend.', 'MORRISON: When you went on that errand, did you have any notion of what they were for?', 'Franklin Elementary School sign; house exterior; coffee with powder; soup with powder; ice cream with powder; light under door)', 'KIMBERLY: And they had their fishing poles behind the door, and he had the hooks in his hands.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Then, Kim says, Judy turned round to her, gave her another errand.', '(Voiceover) I was just living second to second, doing what she was telling me to do.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) But she remembers, she said, clear as if it was this very morning, what happened when she dragged an old trunk back into the house.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Reliving that fateful moment when The Family Secret continues.', '(Photos of Kimberly; photo of Judy; Clark Street sign; house exterior; light under door; crushed pills; photo of Judy)', '(Voiceover) And so I put my hands on either side of her, and I closed my eyes really tight.', '(Voiceover) ...there was this loudest noise I ever heard in my life. And I ran out the backyard into the alley.', 'KIMBERLY: (Voiceover) I was horrified. I just sat there, you know, I was crying and screaming...', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) But she was not finished then, not even close. Her mother, she said, had another job for her.', '(Voiceover) And we got him in there and she just shut the lid, closed the latches.

She made it look normal.', 'MORRISON: Did you ever figure out how she got that trunk from the porch to the hole and got it filled in?', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) There was more to the secret then. Judy, said Kim, devised a cover story. And when she said it, it sounded true.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) What should she do? A perfect daughter could never betray her mother, nor could anyone, apparently, in the circle of deceit that grew and grew. But betrayals were coming, and not just one. Finally, Kim would learn what could happen to a daughter who disobeyed her mother.

LEE: My first reaction was one of disbelief almost. Really? Could this have been kept quiet that long?', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Here, as the call begins, they chatter for a bit about nothing much. And then...', 'KIMBERLY: (Audio recording) I talk about everything. But, anyway, I got to go again today, but, just some things I want to get clear in my head.', 'Ms. GOUGH: (Audio recording) I guess the only thing I can tell you, Kim, is that I love you more than I love life.', 'KIMBERLY: I felt like I was going to die. I betrayed her and I betrayed my whole family.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) It was, of course, burned into her memory. For three days the police dug up the past in the backyard on Clark Street.', 'MORRISON: In your experience, when that many people are aware of such a dark thing, does it stay hidden for very long?', 'MORRISON: It suggests a measure of control over those folks which would be unusual.', '(Lee driving; photo of Judy; Kimberly; trunk; backyard; shovel; courthouse exterior; court in session)', '(Photo of Lloyd; photo of Sandy; graduation and wedding photos of Sandy and Pamela; photos of Pamela and Sandy with children)', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) But, of course, it was all a lie. Their father never left them. And the truth, when police finally called to tell them?', 'Ms. BURKE: It was just almost indescribable, to think that he had been murdered the way he had been murdered, with absolutely no regard for human life, just none. Just treated like a piece of garbage. That was hard.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Sandy watched online as the Boise police dug up all that was left of their father, those seven bone fragments. They tried to understand how Judy got her own children to help murder their father.', 'Ms. BURKE: My dad was the only dad these kids knew, and yet somehow she got these kids to participate in the murder, to bury the body, to dig up the body later that year. How do you get your kids to do something like that? Where is your mind of someone that would do something like that?', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Judy appeared before a judge who determined she was not a risk and granted bail. And six months later her public defender went on the offense with a stunning claim. Lloyd, she said, was an abuser. She killed him, she said, in defense of her life and her children.', 'Mr. ORR: This is a woman who loves her family, who did whatever she can for her family.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Lloyd abusive?

I was sitting on the edge of the bed and I had the gun across my lap. He was sitting on the floor by my dresser, kitty corner from me. The gun went off. It was a terrible smell. And he was dead.', 'Judge: (In court) So had you talked to your daughter about killing your husband?', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) Was she now accusing Kim here in court? Was she blaming her own daughter somehow?', 'PAMELA: And the ending, the judge acknowledged us six kids and Judy as victims. Never once mentioned my father.', 'Mr. BOURNE: We thought that going through a trial where Judy Gough gets to take the stand and vilify their father for hours at a time would not be productive for them and would not be productive for the people. The risk, of course, is that a jury could acquit her; and that, from our standpoint, that would be the worst thing.', 'MORRISON: (Voiceover) The house on Clark Street sits empty, the backyard overgrown. The secret, the deadly secret bound a family almost 30 years. The unraveling tore it apart forever.']
