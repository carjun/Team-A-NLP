If he feared an ambush, as he told his neighbor, why did he leave his pistol behind on the front seat?", "And that's why reporter Lindell Kay's story, strewn on someone's floor, read quite by chance, finally produced a breakthrough.

Now with Gill's statement, along with information uncovered in 1972, investigators were able to piece together a new version of Bill Miller's murder.", "And this one had a very disturbing twist. Authorities are now working on the theory that it was indeed Wendy's mother who placed the call. To set a trap. But, this new story goes, that wasn't all she did.", 'She was also, they say, willingly and deliberately, playing an active role in his murder. She was, authorities believe, the bait by the side of the road. The reason why Miller pulled over when he did.', "Lindell Kay: Authorities say they had an ambush set up on the side of Western Boulevard, where Vickie would act like her car was broken down. And he would stop to help her. When he stopped to help Vickie, that's when authorities say that George was hidin' in the, in the ditch. And that he shot Bill twice with the M-16.

Authorities won't say why he was at the murder scene or what his role may have been. However, said the prosecutor, Gill's eyewitness account, if true, under North Carolina law, could be seen as an admission of guilt, thus his arrest.", "Sharron Aguilar (Foster): From the time that I talked to Lindell, the first time, until they were sittin' in jail was three weeks.", 'Tamara: Aunt Sharon called me and told me.

Thought it was a set-up. Went so far as to bring a pistol. Yet he pulled over along a dark road and got out of the car without his gun. What would have made this combat veteran let his guard down so quickly?', "The answer Wendy fears, if true, is difficult even to think about. Was she in her mother's arms that night beside the road? Is that why Miller got out the of the car without his gun? Was that, finally, the real story of the death of Bill Miller? That Wendy was an unwitting accomplice to her own father's murder.?", 'Wendy Miller-McGee: I think about that all the time.
