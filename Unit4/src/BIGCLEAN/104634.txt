['Brad Mills had trouble with his pitches. The Oakland Athletics had no problem with them.Hideki Matsui had four hits, Conor Jackson drove in three runs and the Athletics beat Mills and the Toronto Blue Jays 10-3 on Thursday.Making his third start of the season, Mills (1-2) allowed six runs and five hits in three innings. The left-hander walked two and struck out five.All six runs against Mills came in the third, when Oakland batted around and collected three extra-bases hits on pitches up in the zone."He just didn\'t have the ability to work ahead in the count and finish the hitter off when he was ahead in the count," Toronto manager John Farrell said. "It was more about location than anything."Mills said his confidence won\'t be shaken by the poor performance."It\'s not the first time I\'ve had a bad inning and it won\'t be the last," he said.
