And that dramatic plea by snowden\'s father for his son to stop what he\'s doing. Abc\'s brian ross is here. He\'s been tracking this for us. Good morning. Reporter: These latest leaks in edward snowden\'s campaign seem to be timed for maximum embarrassment for the u.S. And the president as he remains in hiding at this hour. As world leaders gather in northern ireland for the so-called g-8 summit snowden is revealing how the u.S. And britain have been routinely spying on them. Snowden gave "the guardian" newspaper top secret documents revealing how the british government spied on diplomatic targets from all nations and their smartphones and a similar meeting of world leaders in 2009. Overnight, strong words from president obama. Should he be prosecuted? I\'m not going to comment on prosecution. Okay. He -- the case has been referred to the doj for criminal investigation. And possible extradition. And possible extradition. Reporter: Snowden is still believed to be in hong kong in hiding as even his own father went on fox news to urge him to stop the leaks. But I just ask that you measure what you\'re going to do and not release any more information. Reporter: The fbi continues to develop evidence for criminal charges against snowden. Agents have been at his last known address in hawaii where abc news discovered his car still parked in the garage. Snowden\'s leaks are reverberating around the world with the chinese now calling on the u.S. To explain last week\'s disclosure that the u.S. Was hacking on chinese targets. Is the equivalent of a chinese spy if he gives china details of u.S. Intelligence operations that were run against chinese networks. Reporter: Answering questions online monday on "the guardian" newspaper site, snowden denied he was a spy and said "being called a traitor by former vice president dick cheney over the weekend was the highest honor you can give an american." Snowden also described a kind of dead man switch to make sure his documents are made public no matter what saying, "the u.S. Government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing me or murdering me." Robin and george, that\'s what he said. Strong statement there. Brian, thank you.
