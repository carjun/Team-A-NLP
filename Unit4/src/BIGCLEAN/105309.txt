['        For several years, public health officials have been concerned that gonorrhea, one of the most prevalent STDs in the world, ', ' to the last widely available antibiotics used to treat it, a class of drugs called cephalosporins. ', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'In the space of one week, infectious disease specialists have received a one-two punch of bad news that confirms those fears, including the discovery of a new, cephalosporin-resistant strain of the bacteria. ', "The percentage of U.S. gonorrhea cases that are less susceptible to the two cephalosporins used to treat it, cefixime, taken orally, and ceftriaxone, injected, is on the rise, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report", 'The Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project, a lookout program designed to spot resistance, found that 1.4 percent of patient samples showed growing ability to defeat cefixime in 2010 compared to just .2 percent in 2000. Resistance to ceftiaxone grew from .1 percent to .3 percent during the same period. ', 'Then Sunday, a Japanese-European team presenting data at the International Society for Sexually Transmitted Disease Research meeting in Quebec City, Canada, publicly announced the discovery of a new strain of gonorrhea, H041, that displays a strong resistance to ceftriaxone. ', '"This is both an alarming and a predictable discovery," said one of the project\'s lead researchers, Dr. Magnus Unemo of the Swedish Reference Laboratory for Pathogenic Neisseria. ', 'But, said Dr. Edward Hook, professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, experts face a serious and growing problem that will be debated. ']
