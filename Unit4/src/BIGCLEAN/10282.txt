Though the students won't disclose what their revenue was last year, they say GXStudios is profitable. It has raised more than $1 million in venture capital, employs 12 people, and has opened an office in Manhattan.", '"It\'s one of those things I never would\'ve predicted when I came to Yale," says co-founder Matthew Brimer.

After 10 attempts, the recipe was finalized. Workman and his family put up $200,000 in start-up capital. Today, Punch is sold in Indiana and Illinois and on track to do $1 million in revenue this year.', 'Of course juggling a full-time class schedule and the demands of running a business can be difficult. While some college students schedule classes so they can sleep in as late as possible, Danny Klam, a University of Houston senior, often begins his day at 3 a.m., opening one of the three Simply Splendid Donuts and Ice Cream stores he owns with his cousin Rock. The chain employs a staff of 12. Last year, it grossed $750,000 and, this year, revenue is on track to top $1.2 million. "The hours are crazy," Klam says.
