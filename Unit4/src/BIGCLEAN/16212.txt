["Egypt's new interim Cabinet brings in a number of prominent figures from the country's liberal and secular factions into top positions, particularly from the National Salvation Front, the main coalition of opponents to ousted President Mohammed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood. It has three women, one of them a Christian, and two other Christians, more than any previous government.", 'The government, comprising 33 ministers and the prime minister, also includes several members rooted in the military or police, as well as 10 figures who were ministers under Morsi. None of the ministers come from Islamist parties. The Muslim Brotherhood and its allies refuse any cooperation with the new leadership, demanding Morsi be reinstated.']
