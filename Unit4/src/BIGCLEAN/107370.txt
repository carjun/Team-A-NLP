His death was ruled an accident.", 'Zahau was babysitting Max when he tumbled down the stairs on July 11. Mary Zahau, her sister, said she called her soon after it happened.', '"She said, \'I was in the bathroom and I heard this loud crash,\'" Zahau said.

He told ABC News that the police\'s conclusion Zahau committed suicide is "inescapable."', '"The chances of someone wrapping a rope around her neck, dragging her up and throwing her over the balcony without her fighting back, without a single piece of evidence with no evidence of a struggle is virtually impossible," he said.', "Many, including Zahau's family, have questioned the ruling of the death as a suicide. Zahau was found gagged and there was blood on her body and she suffered hemorrhages.", '"You mean to tell me...somebody who\'s doing really well all 32 years of her life in a matter of two hours is going to do all this elaborate plan," said Mary Zahau.', "Mansion Death: Family Wants Case ReopenedRebecca Zahau's Death a Ritualistic Killing?
