Dana had an inkling that Sarah would really hit it off with her husband Chris' former college roommate, Ryan Widmer.", 'What happened over drinks and nibbles was chemistry.

And soon wedding invitations were in the mail.', "Dana Kist: She's a planner. So she had everything ready to go. She wanted to make sure all the girls wore the same makeup, same eye shadow, same-- bought us our little makeup kits for the wedding so we all looked the same.", 'Congenial guy that he was, Ryan even agreed to work on getting his first dance together for the wedding reception. He took some ballroom lessons.', 'Jill Widmer: Yeah. I think that she could get him to do more things-- than any woman he had ever dated before.', "The wedding that April was a formal affair. The bride was beautiful. Ryan's dance came off without a hitch. And the happy bridesmaids all matched just as their friend Sara wanted.", 'Then it was back to Cincinnati to begin their journey together as Mr. and Mrs. Ryan Widmer.', 'Jill Widmer: They worked really hard. They built a beautiful deck on the back of their house. They were gonna adopt a puppy and were really excited about that. They had a trip planned to Cancun. They had everything to live for.', 'August 11th. Monday night. Ryan downstairs watching the game. Sarah upstairs and in trouble.', 'Jill Widmer: I got a call-- was Ryan. And he said, "Somethin\'s happened to Sarah." ', 'Minutes later Jill Widmer was with her son, waiting anxiously now in a room off Emergency.', "Her husband Ryan told the emergency services people he was pretty sure she'd fallen asleep in the bathtub and drowned.", "But those EMT's intubating her, pounding her chest, didn't understand one crucial observation they made at the home that night, that thing that caused them to tell the arriving police officer: There's something that doesn't look right here.", "That Monday night the Cincinnati Bengals were looking more than decent against Green Bay. Fans across town like Jeff Braley wondered if this could finally be a miracle season for the hapless local team of the NFL. But Braley didn't get to see all of the fourth quarter. He's a cop. A detective and you don't get to pick your down time.", "As he rolled to the house that night. He knew some of what to expect. When you're a cop for more than a decade you become familiar with the signs of a drowning, like the froth about the victim's nose and mouth. ", "The arriving police officer was still inside the house and he gave the detective a fill on what he'd found when he was led to the master bedroom where the 24-year old woman lay on the carpet off the bath.", 'Lieutenant Braley: He felt for a pulse. He assisted on CPR on what he described as a completely dry body with her hair being only damp.', 'Dispatcher: Go ahead and get her out of the bathtub and get her on a flat surface.', "The 911 dispatcher had been quite clear about it. He had instructed the husband to get his wife out of the bathtub and put her on the floor. The husband went away for a moment and came back on the line to say that he'd just moved his wife from the tub to the bedroom.", 'Dispatcher: OK, go ahead and get back to CPR, go and try CPR, they will be there in a little bit, ok?', 'Detective Braley--already wondering along with the EMTs and the arriving officer why a woman who drowned in a bathtub would be 90 percent dry--needed to see the scene. What story would it tell him?', "Now he had not only a drowning victim who didn't appear to be wet--someone who supposedly fell asleep in the tub and pitched face down in the water--but a bathroom itself that was both dry and undisturbed even though presumably the husband had to wrangle her limp body out of the tub as he moved her to the bedroom.", 'The detective, taking in the tub more closely now, making mental notes with his eyes.', 'Even though it was early hours in an incident--and so much would depend on the findings of an autopsy--the detective knew that this was not a case that was going to be closed out that night.', 'Lieutenant Braley: When I left the house at 2 a.m., I knew I had a suspicious death.', 'Still there were questions. How long had Sarah been out of the tub? And had she been out of the tub long enough for her body to air dry?', 'Was it possible for Ryan to lift Sarah out of the tub without knocking over those bottles of soap and shampoo? And that Lysol wipe, perhaps Sarah routinely wiped down the tub before her bath? ', 'And that overriding question: What had happened to the young wife in her master bedroom?', 'Lieutenant Braley: We knew that she had drowned just from the scene itself. It was the manner in which she drowned that had raised all the questions.', 'Sarah Widmer had died of drowning in her home and her body would be examined by the pathologist.', 'There was nothing for Ryan, her husband of four months, to do but leave the hospital and head home. His mother, Jill Widmer, took him back to the house in the wee hours.', "It hadn't occurred to mother or son that the authorities were already looking at Sarah's death as anything but a tragic explainable incident of some sort.", "Dana and Chris, the couple who'd hooked the newlyweds up, could not believe what they were hearing.", 'Dana, a nurse, tried to make some sense out of what had happened to her dear friend. She thought back to her last conversations with Sarah.', 'And then there was that funny trait Sarah had that people used to kid her about. The way she seemed to fall asleep at the drop of a hat. Maybe that was something not so funny at all but an underlying condition of some sort that might explain her sudden death? Her mother-in-law had noticed it when she was first getting to know Sarah. ', 'Had Sarah fallen asleep and drowned in the tub? Was that even possible to do? Ryan seemed to think so. He said as much to the 911 dispatcher.', 'But all the observations about sleepy Sarah--Sarah with her headaches--was just anecdotal information, not the stuff of real scientific and medical investigation.', "The pathologist, the medical examiner, would have the first real results about Sarah's death.", "But the medical examiner had discovered something else: bruising to Sarah's scalp and the nape of her neck. What had caused those injuries? The investigators checked off what they had so far: A young woman supposedly drowned in a bathtub with damp head of hair and a dry body. Didn't figure.", "Lieutenant Braley: If you're pulling somebody directly out of a tub of water, the body has to be wet. There is no other way around it.", "A victim with unexplained bruises. A husband whose story they didn't believe about a ho-hum Monday night watching football then finding his wife dead in the bath.", "Sarah Widmer murdered. And the authorities believed her husband did it. Just days after the bride's death, 27-year old Ryan Widmer was charged with aggravated murder.", "It didn't seem possible at first glance: a clean cut young couple, him without a criminal record of any kind, them with no history of arguments, no problems in their marriage. Where was the motive for murder on a Monday night?", 'Lieutenant Braley: There was no evidence whatsoever to point that are was a-- a girlfriend/boyfriend, anything--', "Even Sarah's family was behind Ryan. The dead woman's brother, Mike Steward, asked the judge to lower Ryan's bond amount so he could attend the funeral for his late wife.", "Bonded out, Ryan Widmer went to live with his mother until he could make his case to a jury months down the road. Couldn't everyone just see that he loved his wife and she just died. death that perhaps even a medical examiner could never satisfactorily explain, but it wasn't murder?", 'Sarah Widmer had been a daughter, a wife, a loyal friend in her brief life, but in death--to those who would never know her--she had become simply The Victim. And the case could be summarized as breezily as the title of a true-crime paperback: The Bathtub Murder.', 'On talk-radio in the greater Cincinnati area, host Bill Cunningham could feel the court of public opinion responding to the story. The Bathtub Murder Case had the phones ringing.', "Eight-months after Sarah Widmer's death, the only jury that mattered was sworn in to hear the case against 28-year old Ryan Widmer, a charge of aggravated murder.", "In the courtroom, Sarah's family sat across the aisle from Ryan's family. During the months of trial preparation her family's support for him seemed to have eroded.", "The prosecution team's story for the jury was uncomplicated. There'd been a violent confrontation in the Widmer house that night for reasons unknown. The prosecutors began with the first moments of the case: Ryan's call to 911.", 'On the stand the emergency dispatcher testified that the voice on the phone that night was giving more details than he usually hears in a call like this.', "Dispatcher: It seemed the caller was rather calm. Usually, I can't get anything out of them.", 'And so much of the prosecution case was built upon the observation of the next witness up, the first arriving officer. ', 'When he began administering CPR, he noticed something was weird about the whole situation:', "And this officer noticed something else: the victim's fingers and toes. We all know what happens to them when they've been soaking in a hot bathtub.", "From simple observations, the murder case had grown. The jury was being told that Ryan Widmer's story didn't jive with what officers on the scene had taken note of: like the bathtub and surrounding tiles that should have been soaking wet if you believed Ryan's account of lifting his 140-pound wife out of the tub and moving her to the bedroom. Should have been dripping wet but weren't. And that implicitly raised a question for the jury: Is it possible that this young woman who drowned had never been in the tub in the first place?", 'Prosecutor Arnold: The bathroom was dry, the floor was dry, the carpet was dry. Sarah was dry. ', "And an expert witness on sleep spoke to the issue of whether a person can actually fall asleep and drown in a bathtub. Her testimony was no. That can't happen.", 'Aniesa Marie Das: It would be virtually impossible for someone without the influence of drugs or alcohol or something external to fall asleep and not wake up.', 'So first the sensation of water on the face would wake you up./ number two would be the gag replex entering your airway and number three if that didnt, the drop in oxygen would wake you up."', "But maybe Sarah hadn't fallen asleep. Perhaps she'd suffered a catastrophic but perfectly natural event. Something to her heart. Her brain. ", "And to him, the bruising to Sarah's neck and scalp revealed in the autopsy looked ominous.", "And that took prosecutors and investigators alike into the realm of speculation. What had happened in that bedroom that night if it hadn't been a bathtub drowning? This forensic pathologist had one scenario explaining a damp head but dry body.", 'CoronerUptegrove: Her head was pushed over the edge of the tub or toilet or sink or forwards or backwards, either in running water or full water.', "The husband holding his wife's head under water until she drowned. But the jury had to wonder: What the motivation would be for such an awful crime?", 'Prosecutor Arnold: Who knows what evil lurks in hearts of men and who knows what lurks behind the doors of a marriage?', "Dennis Murphy: I imagine it's probably not totally satisfying state for you as the investigator that I have a killer who kills without motive?", 'Prosecutor Arnold: I ask you to return a just verdict in this case, find the defendant guilty of aggravated murder. Thank you.', "Was the prosecution's case too thin? Too much observation-lite with not enough persuasive hard evidence?", "The defense would argue passionately that it was. That Ryan had had nothing to do with his wife's sudden death.", "Charlie Rittgers: It didn't add up that this man of 27 years who had never even shown anger in his entire life, would all of a sudden kill his wife.", 'Charlie Rittgers: We had a lovely 24-year old woman who was dead and no one could explain why.', "The defense wasn't going to be able to tell the jury what caused Sarah Widmer to drown that night, but they were going to show that Ryan Widmer had no reason to hurt his wife, had absolutely no motive, and damp hair, dry body? They would explain that. The bottom line for the defense...", "Charlie Rittgers: I know one thing, Ryan Widmer had nothing to do with his wife's death.", "Charlie Rittgers, Ryan Widmer's defense attorney, argued that his client was plagued from the get-go by his unhappy choice of words on that 911 call:", 'Dennis Murphy: But electing to say she fell asleep in the tub sets the alarms going?', 'Charlie Rittgers: Only thing Ryan knows is that she fell asleep in the tub. But they jump on him and say he is a liar.', "The defense attorney argued the coroner had been too quick to rule the death a homicide and had been unaware of Sarah's medical history.", 'Charlie Rittgers: He had no idea that she was suffering from a headache that day. He had no idea she had unusual sleep habits.', "Remember, the prosecution's sleep expert had said it was impossible for Sarah to have fallen asleep and died in the tub. But to some who knew her sleep habits, not only was this scenario possible, but plausible. ", "Sarah fell asleep easily, and just about everywhere in fact, Sarah's boss, the dentist she worked for, testified that Sarah's quirky sleep habits were a well known fact around the office.", "And the dentist recollected that Sarah hadn't been feeling well on that last afternoon of her life.", 'Becker: She had a sore throat that she mentioned towards the end of the day. Her stomach had been bothering her earlier in the day.', "Amy: She had stated she had a headache, and the back of her neck was hurting. I mean, she sounded tired, she didn't sound like she felt very good.", 'Sarah turning off the day and retreating to her tub? That sounded just like the Sarah they knew.', "Chris Kist: She would always leave our house and say she had to get home, 'cause she had to take her bath.", 'And Sarah dozing off in the tub was a trait a friend from childhood days was very familiar with.', 'Katie: I know that she had fallen asleep in the bathtub before. We have talked about that because I had fallen asleep in the bathtub before too.', 'And even with all their scientific art, argued the defense, sometimes pathologists simply cannot say why a person died.', 'A doctor who specializes in emergency medicine testified that unexplained deaths occur far more often than many of us would guess.', 'Dr. Smile: Nationwide, there are approximately 300,000 episodes of sudden death a year, and of those episodes of sudden death, 1 to 2 percent occur in young people under 35. But one-third of those young people that die have normal autopsies, no evidence of any cardiovascular, respiratory or central nervous system injury.', 'In other words, people sometimes just die and their autopsy may never reveal the cause. But the issue that would likely decide the case for guilt or innocence was the observation by the arriving officer and EMTs of damp hair and dry body. ', 'What looked nonsensical and suspicious was easily explainable, said the defense. Hair simply stays wet longer.', "Charlie Rittgers: You get out of a swimming pool, or bathtub, or whatever, isn't that normal that your skin dries before your hair?", "And what about the finger and toes that should have been pruned up but weren't? No one knows what time Sarah got into the tub.", "And as far as the prosecution's speculation about a violent struggle, no one on the scene that night thought there'd been one. Not the cop. Not the EMTs.", "And the supposedly ominous bruising noted to her neck and scalp? To the defense, those abrasions resulted from the EMT's working on Sarah so vigorously up in the bedroom. ", "Charlie Rittgers: We're talking about 45 minutes of resuscitation efforts. Not five, not ten. Forty five minutes.", "Defense: And jurors, the reasons you didn't hear about love affairs, messy finances or insurance issues? That's because none of those things existed.", 'Attorneyclosing: I hope you agree Ryan Widmer is not guilty of any wrongdoing. Thank you very much.', 'About the only fact of the case that was indisputable was that Sarah Widmer had drowned. But was it a natural death, in her bathtub?', 'Lieutenant Braley: I can see the possible doubt run rampant. I can see that. But there are too many contributing factors pointing the other way.', "Inside the Warren County Courthouse, the jury had had the case all day. The couple's friends had long dreaded this moment.", 'Dana Kist: We are scared that the truth may not come out. We know without a doubt that Ryan did not do this. And we pray to God that everyone else sees that too.', "Ryan Widmer would have wished that the listeners to Bill Cunningham's call-in radio show had been on his jury.", 'Bill Cunningham, Radio Host: I would say the calls split 90 to 10 in favor of Ryan Widmer. Because during the trial, there was no smoking gun.', 'They had two counts to decide: Count 1, aggravated murder. Did Ryan premeditate the murder of his wife Sarah? And Count 2: non-premeditated murder. Did it happen suddenly, without prior thought?', 'Finally, after 23 hours of talking it over, the jurors sent a note that they had reached a verdict.', 'The lawyers were summoned. The two families hurried to the courtroom. Ryan Widmer took his place at the defense table. ', 'Less than a year before, Ryan had entered a new phase of his life: marriage. He had been toasted by his brother, the best man, and soon began a life with his new bride, with hopes of a long happy life together. And now that was a thing of the past.', "Judge: Okay, ladies and gentlemen. The - the bailiff has advised me that you've reached a verdict in the case. The defendant will please rise.", 'Bailiff: In the case of the state of Ohio vs. Ryan Widmer on verdict on Count 1, aggravated murder, we the jury find the defendant, Ryan K. Widmer is not guilty of aggravated murder.', 'It was a moment of relief for Ryan Widmer. The jury did not believe that he had premeditated the murder of his wife. But he still faced the second count of murder.', 'Judge: Mr. Widmer, is there anything that you wish to say either in mitigation of your sentence or as to why your sentence should not be imposed at this time?', "The accused - now the convicted - would address the court for the first time. He hadn't taken the stand, as was his right.", "Ryan Widmer: I love my wife, I did not hurt her. I was not given a chance. The day after she passes away, they charge me with murder. I didn't even...If I had the answer, I would give the answer of what happened to her, but I can't. I was not in the bathroom with her. I love my wife, and I did not hurt her.", 'Jill Widmer: He stopped next to me and said can i say goodbye to my mom and they said no keep moving.', "Jill Widmer: Beyond difficult. Anyone who knows my son knows he doesn't have a mean bone in his body.", 'Detective: I think it was a very quick very violent angry episode that just happened. And i dont know that there is a complete reason for it.', 'Dennis Murphy: So there isn\'t a whisper of doubt that says, "My best friend may have been killed by this"--', 'Charlie Rittgers: It was awful. It was on my shoulders. It was my duty to my client to get a proper verdict and I failed.', "But as Ryan Widmer got processed into the Ohio prison system, it wasn't quite the end of the bathtub murder case. The verdict was so unpopular in the court of public opinion, that candlelight vigils were staged to protest the jury vote.", "Bill Cunningham: Judging this case against a hundred other murder trials, this is one of the flimsiest and one of the weakest I've ever seen.", "Then something else: The fax machine in the defense lawyer's office began spitting out pages. It was one of the jurors claiming there'd been forbidden monkey business during the Widmer deliberations, monkey business over nothing less than the biggest issue in the trial: damp head, dry body.", 'Charlie Rittgers: He said that two or three of the female jurors had done home experiments where they had showered and then air-dried.', "If the faxing juror was correct, the panel had directly violated the judge's instructions to consider only what they'd heard in court. The allegation was jury misconduct, a serious matter. The judge began reviewing affidavits from a number of the jurors about what just went on during deliberations.", 'And in one of those sworn statements, a juror said of those taboo home experiments: "The times to air dry...influenced my decision."', "Apparently the judge found enough smoke about the verdict that -four months after Ryan Widmer's conviction-- he ruled that the husband will get another trial. The not guilty verdict on the aggravated murder count remains, the Prosecution can only retry him on the second count of murder.", 'And just two weeks ago, Ryan Widmer walked out of the Warren County jail after his mother, with great difficulty, managed to scrape together enough cash and collateral on family properties, to post bond for him.', "He's staying with his mother at her home. That's where he'll live until his new trial.", "Jill Widmer: I'm prepared to go towards to the day I die. If I have to live on the street in a cardboard box at the end of this, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get my son out of this."]
