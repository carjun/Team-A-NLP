['        Since the housing bubble burst more than three years ago, lenders have been fending off legal challenges from homeowners who say they were duped by bad mortgages. Now the industry faces a potentially more formidable adversary: investors who bought bonds backed by those bad loans. ', 'Citibank became the latest lender to disclose that it faces legal challenges from investors demanding a refund on billions of dollars lost on bonds backed by faulty loans. On Friday, Citibank disclosed in a regulatory filling that Charles Schwab, the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Indianapolis and a hedge fund have filed lawsuits claiming the bank misled them when it sold bonds backed by pools of home mortgages.', 'The key issue: Who will take the losses for billions of dollars worth of failing mortgages written during the height of the housing boom?', '        Has the market volatility got you nervous? These cartoons may give you a little comic relief.', 'Patrick is representing a high-powered investor group that includes Freddie Mac, Pimco Investment Management, Blackrock Financial Management and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which took over mortgage-backed investments held by American International Group.', 'At the height of the housing boom, rising home prices allowed mortgage originators to replace failed loans with freshly-written performing mortgages. Lenders, originators, investors and borrowers all assumed that there was little risk in churning out new mortgages because even if a loan defaulted, the rising value of the home securing it would minimize any potential losses.', 'With home prices still falling and mortgage defaults rising, losses on foreclosed homes are now hitting even those investors holding top-rated bonds. By some estimates, at least as many homeowners are currently at risk of foreclosure as have already lost their homes. ', 'The potential cost of these claims will depend on how many more homes are lost to foreclosure, how much further home prices fall, how far the value of those properties will have to be written down when those foreclosed homes are sold. ', "That could hurt shareholders as fears of future losses weigh on lenders' share prices, which have declined as the pace of claims has quickened. But it would help lenders avoid a sudden hit to their balance sheets.", 'Because mortgage-backed bonds are widely held by insurance companies, endowments, pensions and mutual funds, the impact could be widespread, said Franklin.
