["        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'THE SPARK: Intuitive Surgical said it expects continued pressure on U.S. sales of its da Vinci surgical system for the rest of 2013. The Sunnyvale, Calif., company now said its revenue will grow no more than 7 percent for the year. It had expected growth of 16 to 19 percent.', 'The company also said it recently received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration. Intuitive Surgical said the warning relates to two problems the FDA observed during an inspection performed during the second quarter. It said the FDA has asked it to take additional steps to resolve those concerns, and said it is in the process of taking those steps.', 'THE BIG PICTURE: The da Vinci system uses robotic arms, cameras and a remote control console to help doctors perform surgery with tiny incisions. It is used in gynecological procedures, heart surgeries, prostatectomies, urology procedures, and other operations. Intuitive Surgical makes money by selling the systems and disposable instruments that must be replaced after each procedure.', 'Intuitive Surgical reported $2.18 billion in revenue last year, and it is now forecasting revenue of $2.18 billion to $2.33 billion for 2013. Its previous guidance called for $2.53 billion to $2.59 billion in revenue.', "Earlier this month Intuitive Surgical said da Vinci system sales fell in the second quarter because of a sharp drop in U.S. sales. Sales are being hurt by economic issues and by concerns about the use of da Vinci in gynecology procedures. Some experts are questioning the use of da Vinci systems in routine hysterectomies, saying the procedures are more expensive but don't improve outcomes for patients.", 'In late February the Food and Drug Administration also announced a probe into the da Vinci system.', "THE ANALYSIS: Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rick Wise said the announcement has created additional concerns about the company and it's hard to tell what will happen to the company's sales.", '"The sharply diminished second half growth outlook and new concerns including an FDA warning letter add to the broader uncertainties," he said.', 'Wise said he thinks sales should stabilize in mid-2014 and they may start to grow after that, but not at the 20 percent rate the company has reported in the past. He rates the shares at "Hold," and said the stock may struggle until investors know more about what will happen to Intuitive Surgical\'s sales. He said sales could get a boost if the company launches a new surgical system.', 'SHARE ACTION: Shares of Intuitive Surgical sank $52.27, or 12.4 percent, to $369.20 in afternoon trading. The stock fell as far as $357.02, its lowest price since October 2011. The shares have fallen more than 25 percent since Feb. 27.', ' Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
