["Dayna Kempson's Story: Young Woman's Tragic Crash Yielded Viral Death Video - ABC News", 'After Dayna Kempson died in a car crash, a video of her body at the accident scene spread virally around the web.  (Courtesy of The Kempson Family)', 'It was a video no parents should have to watch, or worse, see spread virally across the Internet -- footage of the body of their beautiful daughter lying crumpled in a crushed car, surrounded by the sounds of callous voices casually discussing the remains.', '"Most people that love someone don\'t get the opportunity to see their loved one in a state of their death," said Jeff Kempson. "You don\'t know what these things look like and how graphic they are."', "At age 23, Kempson's daughter, Dayna, was a single mom with two children. An active young woman, her parents said she was coming to a crossroads in her life. She was making more mature decisions and had planned to go back to school.", '"I would sit back and say, you know, I think Dayna\'s starting to turn the corner," Jeff Kempson said.', 'But before the Kempsons could watch their daughter bloom, tragedy cut her life short. On July 17, 2010, after spending the night out with friends in Griffin, Ga., Dayna Kempson lost control of her red Jeep and careened across four lanes of highway traffic, her car tumbling over itself until it came to a stop against a row of trees.', "Around 3:30 a.m., after wondering why their daughter wasn't picking up her phone, Jeff and Lucretia Kempson heard that knock on the door that every parent dreads.", '"The county coroner and the sheriff came and spoke with us," Jeff Kempson said. "If there is a blessing in this, the coroner told us that she did not suffer, that it was immediate."', "Like others who have lost children, the Kempsons were shattered. But unlike other grieving parents, the couple would soon experience something that made coping with their daughter's death all the more painful: Two months after Dayna Kempson's fatal crash, the Kempsons discovered the moments after Dayna died were filmed and the video had gone viral.", '"I received a phone call from my sister that her ex-husband had received a video via his cell phone," Jeff Kempson said.', "Kempson couldn't believe what he was hearing. He contacted the man with the video and asked where he got it, only to learn it was being passed around town and online for ghouls to enjoy.", '"He was just in that chain reaction of the video being sent from person to person," Jeff Kempson said. "He could have been the 200th person to have got the video. He could have been the 1,000th person who got the video. Unfortunately, we don\'t know."', 'Courtesy of The Kempson FamilyAfter Dayna Kempson died in a car crash, a...

"She was a person, and it\'s like she wasn\'t even there."', "She said that a few weeks later, her daughter's former church youth group leader called her to say that she, too, had been sent the video.", '"[She] told me, \'Lucretia, I\'m very sorry ... I got the video. The video was sent to me," Lucretia Kempson said.', "The Kempsons eventually learned that at the accident scene where their daughter died, one of the emergency responders -- a firefighter -- inexplicably took out his cell phone and filmed Dayna Kempson's badly damaged body. The video was shared, going viral as it was passed around the county Dayna grew up in and eventually posted on the Internet. In the click of a mouse, a young woman's life legacy was wiped out, her name now synonymous with just another gruesome death video for ghouls lurking in the dark corners of the web to seek out for their macabre enjoyment.", "The Kempsons found the video on YouTube and a blog site. After the Kempsons contacted YouTube and the blog, the video was removed from both quickly, but where it traveled from there is anyone's guess, and to this day traces of the video remain online.", '"When you Google Dayna\'s name, there\'s just pages and pages and pages," Lucretia Kempson said. "I\'ll get an e-mail [saying] you can find Dayna\'s video here.  I look because I don\'t want her video anywhere out there. And, it\'s not there, and there will be comments and people saying, \'This was just a hoax.  Where can I find the video?\' Why do they wanna see this stuff?"', "The hunger for Dayna Kempson's video and others like it seem to expose the dark side of human nature festering on the Web. The center of the spread and propagation of these videos are a distinct breed of Internet ghouls known as trolls, according to Michael Fertik, CEO of Reputation.com.", '"The profile of the person who typically is a troll is pretty specific: It\'s usually men, aged, sort of, 14 to 30," Fertik said. "[They\'re] often sexually frustrated people who are living out fantasies and feeling empowered by being behind their keyboard and empowered by being able to visit pain on other people."', "Fertik's company specializes in helping people like the Kempsons find and counteract harmful content on the Web. Although the Dayna Kempson video may now be hard to find, he said, it is most likely very much still out there.", '"Unfortunately, the Internet has no delete button," Feritk said. "Getting things removed from the Web is both difficult and, in some times, impossible, especially if you are faced with somebody who is a dedicated troll or a dedicated enemy of your family, even if they don\'t know you."', 'The fact that it was a video taken of Dayna Kempson, instead of photos, may in some ways be a small blessing for the Kempsons. According to Fertik, there are much fewer websites that host video, compared to the many that host photographs.', "Dayna Kempson's story is eerily similar to another young woman who lost her life at an early age, Nikki Catsouras. Photographs, not video, of Catursouas' corpse went viral after a member of the California Highway Patrol allegedly shared them with friends. Catsouras is, unfortunately, the icon in the ghoulish Internet subculture.", '"The Catsouras case is the worst one we\'ve ever seen," Fertik said. "I heard from their family just a few days after we [started], our website.  We were able to get, I think, the photographs removed from something like 3,000 websites but when the story went national and viral it [was] just impossible," Fertik said.', " PHOTOS:  Parents Fight to Remove Death VideoJustice for Dayna Kempson Facebook pageGet It Off the WebFire Dept.
