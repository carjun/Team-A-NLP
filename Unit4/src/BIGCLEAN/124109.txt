['Four years ago, Rob and Liz Ney of Auburn, Wash. were drowning in debt. Unable to make ends meet on their limited income, the Neys turned to credit cards. Before they knew it they had 16 different cards and owed more than $35,000.', 'The Neys realized they needed help, so they contacted Consumer Counseling Northwest, a non-profit agency located in Seattle. Debt counselor Teresa Seeley negotiated with their creditors and got them to lower the interest rates on all those credit cards.', 'To come up with that much money, the Neys had to cut expenses. And they did. They made a budget and stuck to it. Shopping trips were planned. Impulse purchases were a thing of the past. Because their credit card accounts were now closed, they had to pay with cash.']
