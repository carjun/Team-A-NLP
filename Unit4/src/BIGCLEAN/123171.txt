But the authorities say evidence found among the remains can be linked to Caylee's home. A weekend and more of testing by the FBI lies ahead. The new question is: is it really Caylee?", "Tonight, we'll put the case together starting from the very first hours of this mystery, back weeks ago when we talked to the missing child's grandparents who believed fervently that the child was alive and in danger from unknown kidnappers.", "Casey Anthony: I'm never gonna forgive myself because there's that chance that I might not see Caylee again and I don't want to think about that.", 'CindyAnthony: Casey was always a good student. She was always the mom of the crowd. Always took care of everybody and they still call her Mom -- her friends.', "After high school, Casey got a job working at the Universal Studios theme park, which is, incidentally, owned by this program's parent company NBC Universal. It was there Casey met a young guy named Jesse Grund.", 'Jesse and Casey started dating in January 2005, and their relationship blossomed, though it did come as something of a shock to Jesse when Casey told him six months later that she was pregnant, and that he was the father.

Let\'s give the child up to someone, some family who can\'t have kids, who is ready to be parents." And she said, "No, I\'m not gonna carry this child around for nine months, and give birth to it, and then give it up to somebody else. This is my child."', 'Jesse: She was crying. And it was probably one of the happiest moments of my life.', 'But five months later, Casey -- who was still living with her parents -- broke off the engagement. She told Jesse she was happier on her own. And she did indeed seem happy. She took to motherhood with apparent joy. ', "And her parents couldn't have been more supportive. To them, Caylee's arrival seemed like a gift from heaven.", "All of which makes the events of last Father's Day weekend, when Caylee Anthony suddenly disappeared -- that much more of a mystery.", 'That Sunday, June 15th, grandmother Cindy took Caylee to visit her great grandfather in his nursing home. This home video, taken during that visit -- contains the last confirmed pictures we have of Caylee.', 'Cindy: We spent a wonderful day together, and then Casey came home and we had a great evening that evening.', 'The next morning, Monday, George remembered seeing Casey and Caylee at home before he left for work.', 'George: I was still home in the morning getting ready to go do my job, you know, later that afternoon.

And a reasonable explanation.', 'Orlando Sentinel Reporter Bianca Prieto: That\'s when it\'s like, "Oh my gosh, Casey\'s car\'s been towed. What\'s going on?" And so, they go to pick it up. They get there and they say there\'s this overwhelming stench just coming from the car. You\'re three feet away and you can smell it.

I've got a sick feeling for a second because the car that was all closed up, if you're in, from me to you away from it, you can smell an odor, you don't forget that odor, no matter what it is, you never, ever forget it.", 'After retrieving the car, Cindy Anthony decided to take action -- she was determined to confront Casey face-to-face. But where was she?', 'Cindy: I had found a resume of one of her friends in the front seat. So, I just took her phone number off of there and actually when I called her, was very surprised that she had seen Casey just hours before. ', 'The friend told Cindy she knew where Casey was staying that day, and agreed to take Cindy there.', 'Cindy: When Casey came to the door, you know, I asked her where Caylee was. She said she was with the nanny. I said, "Let\'s go pick up Caylee." And she said, "No, mom, you know, it\'s kinda late in the evening. ', 'Cindy was about to find out how "not right" things were. She took Casey back home, and from there, she dialed 911. ', "Cindy: And I have a possible missing child. I have a three-year-old that's been missing for a month.", 'But shortly after that 911 call, Cindy says she overheard Casey whispering something to her brother, Lee... Something about a babysitter, Zanny, that would set her into full-on panic mode.', 'Cindy: I heard her say the words that Zanny had taken Caylee. And that\'s when I flew into her room. And I said, "What the heck are you talking about?" And she just broke down and she said it had been, 31 days that she had seen her daughter.', "After 30 days with no sign of her grandchild, Cindy Anthony had finally confronted her daughter, Casey, and heard a truly disturbing story.

I need to find her.', "Cindy: That the baby-sitter took her a month ago. The daugh... my daughter's been looking for her. I told you my daughter was missing for a month. I just found her today but I can't find my granddaughter. And she just admitted to me that she's been trying to find her herself. There's something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car.

When she returned to pick Caylee up, no one was home.", 'Dennis Murphy: And she doesn\'t call 911 and say, "My baby\'s gone." She doesn\'t call her parents.', "Bianca Prieto: No, she doesn't call anybody. She says that she sits there for a few hours on the steps waiting, and then decides to do her own investigation.", "That disadvantage was about to get a whole lot worse. Deputies, with Casey, in tow began looking for this baby-sitter, Zenaida. They drove Casey to the apartment where she said she'd left Caylee with the sitter. But the apartment, it turned out, had been vacant for almost five months.", 'Casey then led detectives on what turned out to be a wild goose chase around Orlando-- she pointed out an apartment building where she says Zenaida had lived two years ago. It turned out to be a seniors-only facility.', "Then she brought them to a building where she says Zenaida's mother owned a condo -- but no one in the building knew the babysitter or her mother.", 'The investigators then returned to the first apartment building to go through the residents list. There was no Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez living there, but they did locate a Zenaida Gonzalez who had applied to rent an apartment back in June.', 'Zenaida Gonzalez: They called my cell phone. And then they asked me, they first asked me -- "Are you Zenaida Gonzalez?" Yes.', "To this day, this Zenaida isn't sure how Casey got her name -- whether it was just coincidence, or if Casey may have come across the visitor's log at that apartment building. But Zenaida told investigators she'd never heard of Casey, and was most certainly not a baby-sitter... And the sheriff's office believed her.", "Zenaida Gonzalez: I got six kids of my own, what you think, I want to bring another one into the family? I'm OK. (laughter) I have enough. I have enough.", "Every possible lead that Casey Anthony had given investigators turned out to be a dud. The apartment where she claimed she'd dropped Caylee off -- vacant. The baby-sitter -- a phantom. And there was something else -- there was no evidence that Casey had told anyone about her daughter's disappearance over the last month.", 'By now, detectives were certain that Casey Anthony was spinning a web of lies. They were ready to confront her at the last stop on their Orlando tour -- the Universal Studios theme park.', "With her story unraveling, Casey accompanied investigators to the employee entrance at Universal Studios, telling the security guard she'd lost her ID.", 'Ron Stucker: And we said, "Well, go ahead and let her in. Let\'s just go walk down to her office." She walked with the detectives down a hallway and just walked down looking in offices and --', 'Ron Stucker: She reached the end of the hallway and she turned around. And when she ran out room -- and she said, "I\'m lying to you. I don\'t work here." ', 'She had once... But not for years. During a recorded conversation in a conference room at the theme park, casey broke down and confessed that she had been lying.', 'Police: Okay, so you purposely misled us. This was all an attempt to help find your daughter, right? That makes sense to you, correct?', 'Caught in a lie but still she stuck to her original story -- that a baby-sitter named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez had indeed kidnapped Caylee.', "Casey: I saw my mom's reaction right off the bat and it would've been the same from the get-go.", "Police: So wait a minute. So you're more afraid of your mom's reaction than you are if you ever see your daughter again?", "Casey: No, I'm absolutely petrified. Absolutely petrified. I know my mom will never forgive me. I'm never gonna forgive myself because there's that chance that I might not see Caylee again and I don't want to think about that.", "She forged on with her baffling logic. She'd led investigators on a merry chase to universal studios, she said, in hopes that they'd stumble upon Caylee.", "Casey: I'm coming back to places that are familiar to me that I know are familiar to her. Familiar situations that maybe...", "Police: Okay, hold on a second let's put this together where it makes sense okay. She's with someone else, whose hid her from you for five weeks.", 'Bianca Prieto: Casey and the truth have a problem. You know, everything that she said almost is a complete lie, or it\'s not checking out. Investigators can\'t find anything and they tell her, "We\'re gonna help you, but you need to tell us the truth."', 'After their confrontation at Universal Studios, investigators took Casey to the county jail, and charged her with child neglect, lying to the police, and obstructing an investigation.

Many more charges would follow -- Casey Anthony was about to be accused of doing the worst thing a mother can do to her child.', "Just about everything Casey Anthony told investigators about the disappearance of her daughter, Caylee, had turned out to be a lie. But if investigators thought they would rattle a true confession out of her once she was in jail, they were wrong. From the county jail, Casey made an angry phone call to her parents to ask for her boyfriend's number.", "Cindy: What? No! I don't know what your involvement is, sweetheart. You keep, you're not telling me where she's at. ", "Cindy: Well whose fault is your sitting in jail? Are you blaming me that you're sitting in jail?", "Cindy: Blame yourself for telling lies. What you mean it's not your fault? What do you mean it's not your fault, sweetheart? If you'd have told them the truth and not lied about everything they wouldn't...", "Casey: Do me a favor, just tell me what Tony's number is. I don't want to talk to you right now. Forget it.", "Kristina: If anything happens to Caylee, Casey, I'll die (crying). You understand I'll die if anything happens to...", "RonStucker: She's expressing absolutely no concern for the location of her child.", "That apparent lack of concern was noteworthy because as investigators began to interview Casey's friends and family, they started to piece together a jarring picture of what Casey was up to in those 30 days since Caylee went missing -- the image they got was not one of a concerned mother.", 'Ron Stucker: She goes and gets a new tattoo which says "Bella Vita," which means "beautiful life." She is text messaging and emailing her friends, setting up appointments do to things. And in none of those does she ever express concern about her child that is allegedly missing. ', 'In fact, on that first evening after her daughter had disappeared -- June 16 -- Casey was spotted at a blockbuster video store, browsing for movies with a boyfriend, Anthony Lazzaro. He later told investigators that Casey never once mentioned anything about Caylee going missing.', "Anthony Lazzaro: Nope. Like I said before, every time she'd talk on the phone she was pretty, not secretive about it, but you know.", "Within hours of Casey's arrest on July 16, the story had gone national. And photos began to surface on the web, showing Casey partying and at clubs. These photos were taken the weekend of June 20 -- just four days after Caylee went missing. ", 'To the Orange County sheriff, Kevin Beary... It was what Casey did in the days after her daughter went missing that spoke to him of the suspicion of her guilt.', 'Kevin Beary: The typical person, the legitimate parent, if you turn around in a store and you don\'t see your child, and then 20 seconds later you find them, you\'re huggin \'em and tellin\' em, "Don\'t ever run away like that again." We didn\'t get any of those emotions.', "And among the friends interviewed by police, one woman's story raised a different kind of red flag. The friend, Amy Huizenga, had lent Casey her car for a week in July. She told police that during that time, Casey stole a checkbook out of her glove compartment.", 'BiancaPrieto: One of her best friends. The girl she had been spending all summer with.', "BiancaPrieto: Right. You know, she goes to Target, buys a bunch of stuff. It's interesting. The shirt that she's wearing, with the blue hoodie with the number on the front that she's wearing when she's arrested, bought with Amy's money.", 'Now along with child neglect and lying to investigators, authorities were looking into possible charges of check fraud. But back to their missing child investigation.', "Investigators interviewed the Anthony's next door neighbor, who remembered that sometime between June 17-20 -- just a couple days after Caylee disappeared -- Casey had backed up her car into the Anthony's garage. And she had come over to borrow a shovel. ", "Ron Stucker: We had our cadaver dogs who were alerting on the car that had been abandoned. They were alerting in the parents' backyard. And they're already indicating to us that there's been a dead body in that trunk.", "The search for a missing girl suddenly took on a darker undertone -- police were now looking for a body. They didn't find one yet, but in that car trunk police found something else significant -- hair that resembled Caylee's.", 'But while the evidence against Casey Anthony ratcheted up -- and with it plenty of public hostility -- her parents seemed to have a public about-face.

You know how hot it's been. That smell was terrible...

I wish that, like I said, that none of this would have happened.", 'In those jailhouse visitations with Casey, which were recorded on video cameras, the Anthonys probed for answers on where Caylee could be.', "Casey: I don't know, Mom. I haven't been able to talk to anybody. I don't know. I'm hoping that if there's people involved there's as many people that are dumb enough to open their mouths and say something.", 'Casey: All I want is to see her, to hear her laugh, to see her smile, and just be with her family.

Elevated traces of chloroform found in the spare tire cover and trunk liner. ", "Dennis Murphy: Help us connect the dots. When I think of chloroform, I just think of old movies where someone puts it in a rag, and puts it on the person's face to knock 'em out. Is there any other explanation, in our daily lives, of chloroform occurring, being found?", 'Ron Stucker: When we first got that, one of our investigators began to call chemical companies in the Orlando area and say, "Hey, can I get some chloroform?" Nobody could provide it to them. They were like, "Nobody even asked for this." And so it of course raised our curiosity of what it could be used for.', 'The presence of chloroform was also important because of something else detectives had discovered in the case.', 'They seized Casey\'s home computer, and discovered some disturbing searches. Someone had used the computer before Caylee disappeared to browse missing children\'s websites. Back in march, there were Google searches for "neck breaking" and "household weapons." And even more significantly...', 'Ron Stucker: It was on the computer is where we found that there were searchers for the word chloroform, and trying to find information about chloroform.', 'And there was more on that computer that would cause friends, who had uniformly agreed that the devoted young mother would never speak ill of Caylee -- to pause.', 'Investigators uncovered instant messages Casey had exchanged with a boyfriend, shortly before Caylee vanished.

Ya know, not a very loving term for a child.', 'And still more. On July 7th, Casey made this chilling entry on her MySpace page. It read, "What is given, can be taken away. Everyone lies. Everyone dies. Life will never be easy." There was also this eerie cartoon.', "BiancaPrieto: We don't know who this girl is. One thing that was very interesting, when we were trying to piece together a profile about her, is no one would talk.", 'Her family was still standing by her, even after the flood of forensic evidence.

Are we 100 percent sure it's Caylee?
