['Unemployment rates rose in 28 U.S. states last month, partly because more Americans started looking for work and not all of them found jobs.', 'Unemployment rates fell in 11 states and were unchanged in another 11, the Labor Department said Thursday.', "Nationwide, hiring has picked up this year, but the unemployment rate rose in May to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent in April and stayed the same last month. That's because more people began job searches in May and June but not all of them found work. The government doesn't count people as unemployed unless they are actively searching for work.", 'The same dynamic has occurred at the state level. Two-thirds of states added jobs in June, even as unemployment rose in more than half the states.', 'Here are unemployment rates in June for each state, compared with May and a year earlier:                                        June 2013             May 2013             June 2012                               Alabama             6.5             6.8             7.6                               Alaska             6.1             5.9             7.1                               Arizona             8             7.8             8.4                               Arkansas             7.3             7.3             7.3                               California             8.5             8.6             10.6                               Colorado             7             6.9             8.2                               Connecticut             8.1             8             8.5                               Delaware             7.3             7.2             7.2                               Florida             7.1             7.1             8.8                               Georgia             8.6             8.3             9.1                               Hawaii             4.6             4.7             6                               Idaho             6.4             6.2             7.3                               Illinois             9.2             9.1             9                               Indiana             8.4             8.3             8.4                               Iowa             4.6             4.6             5.3                               Kansas             5.8             5.7             5.8                               Kentucky             8.4             8.1             8.3                               Louisiana             7             6.8             6.7                               Maine             6.8             6.8             7.3                               Maryland             7             6.7             6.9                               Massachusetts             7             6.6             6.7                               Michigan             8.7             8.4             9.3                               Minnesota             5.2             5.3             5.7                               Mississippi             9             9.1             9.2                               Missouri             6.9             6.8             7                               Montana             5.4             5.4             6.1                               Nebraska             4             3.8             4                               Nevada             9.6             9.5             11.4                               New Hampshire             5.2             5.3             5.6                               New Jersey             8.7             8.6             9.6                               New Mexico             6.8             6.7             7                               New York             7.5             7.6             8.7                               North Carolina             8.8             8.8             9.6                               North Dakota             3.1             3.2             3.1                               Ohio             7.2             7             7.3                               Oklahoma             5.2             5.1             5.2                               Oregon             7.9             7.8             8.8                               Pennsylvania             7.5             7.5             8                               Rhode Island             8.9             8.9             10.6                               South Carolina             8.1             8             9.3                               South Dakota             3.9             4             4.4                               Tennessee             8.5             8.3             8.2                               Texas             6.5             6.5             7                               Utah             4.7             4.6             5.8                               Vermont             4.4             4.1             5.1                               Virginia             5.5             5.3             6                               Washington             6.8             6.8             8.4                               Washington, D.C.             8.5             8.5             9.1                               West Virginia             6.1             6.2             7.5                               Wisconsin             6.8             7             7                               Wyoming             4.6             4.6             5.5               MONEY']
