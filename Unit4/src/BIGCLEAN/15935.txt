But officials in health care, agriculture and defense warn the damage done does not stop at lower pay for federal workers.', "READ MORE: Sequester: What Will Happen, What Won't Happen and What We Don't Know", "Government furloughs can't begin until April, as workers must receive 30 days' notice in most cases before losing time on the job, under federal employment guidelines from the Office of Personnel Management. But planned furloughs have cast a shadow of limited government capabilities over the agencies expecting workforce cuts.", "With each EPA worker taking a mandatory, unpaid four days off between April 3 and June 1 -- to be re-evaluated and possibly lengthened to 13 days between now and the end of September, according to a letter from acting administrator Bob Perciasepe to all EPA workers -- that means reduced capabilities for the organization that tests air quality to tell city residents when there's too much smog to let children play outside.", 'As a result of sequestration, the EPA predicts it will cut 1,000 inspections of "toxic air emissions, water discharges, and other sources of pollution that can cause illnesses and even death."', "Robert Nickelsberg/Getty ImagesA jack-hammer operator from New York's...

That has to be followed up ... with oral conferences to take place with any employee who requests an oral confirmation -- that will happen at the local level," Vilsack said.', 'After all employees are notified, Vilsack said, USDA will negotiate with union representatives over how the furloughs will be implemented.', 'But if furloughs do happen, Vilsack warned their impact could be particularly severe.', "That's because furloughs will be concentrated over just a few months this year. Inspectors will miss 11 to 12 days each between now and Sept. 30, Vilsack predicted, and the longer USDA waits, meat and poultry producers could feel a more severe impact over a shorter timeframe.", 'USDA has already projected that food-safety will be particularly hard hit by furloughs, as 87 percent of that account\'s budget goes to food inspectors and "support" for inspectors.', "Sequester May Revive 'Amtrak Joe'Sequester Could Cut Blue Angels, Medicare PaymentsSequester Day 3: Few Flight DelaysObama: Sequester Won't Stifle AgendaSen.
