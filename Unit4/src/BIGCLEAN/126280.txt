These regulations do several important things, including:', 'Prohibit multiple penalty fees for the same reason: For example, you can no longer be charged a late fee and a return payment fee because of a problem with a single payment.', 'Require explanation of a rate increase: Since August of last year credit card companies have been required to give customers 45 days notice before an interest rate hike. Now, you must be told why your rate is going up. ', 'An inactivity fee cannot be charged until the card has not been used for 12 months.', 'No more than one fee (of any kind) can be charged to the cardholder in a single month.', 'Information printed on the card must disclose fees and expiration date and provide a toll-free phone number or website where you can get more information.', '(Note: The new rules do not cover reloadable cards, such as prepaid phone cards or rechargeable debit cards from the big credit card companies. Rebate and loyalty reward cards are also exempt.)', 'Disclosure is an important aspect of the new gift card rules. They require gift cards to list all fees and any expiration date on the card.
