["New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg discusses his initiative to support the city's financial services sector at a news conference in Manhattan, Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2009 in New York.", 'John Haggerty remained expressionless, occasionally blinking, as he was found guilty of second-degree grand larceny and money laundering. Haggery, who was acquitted of first-degree grand larceny, faces up to 15 years in prison at sentencing. ', "The 42-year-old was accused of promising the mayor's 2009 campaign an elaborate poll-watching operation, then spending just $32,000 on the effort and pocketing most of the rest to buy a house. ", "In the end, jurors were unconvinced by defense lawyers who often tried to turn their attention to the mayor, painting a picture of a former mogul who threw his money at problems and surrounded himself with highly paid insiders so desperate to hold onto power that they didn't care how Haggerty spent the money he was given, as long as he got results.", '        President Barack Obama used the Port of Jacksonville as a backdrop for his latest economic policy speech, using an infrastructure project there to illustrate his call for greater investment in similar projects.', "    Boehner whacks King again, says comments make immigration progress 'more difficult'", "Jurors recounted tense deliberations that had begun with the panel evenly split on whether to convict, with some panelists swayed by the defense's depiction of a high-rolling, win-at-all costs campaign. ", '"There was a lot of talk in the jury room just about conspiracy," juror Stephen Conroy said. "Just that everybody was in on it, Haggerty was the fall guy." ', 'Prosecutors maintained the mayor was the victim in a simple but lucrative scam: Haggerty, assigned to handle poll-watching for the campaign, drew up a budget to pay more than 1,300 watchers, hire drivers and rent hotel rooms. Once the mayor had donated money to the state Independence Party to pay for the effort, Haggerty created a company through which to launder the money, and used $750,000 to buy a house. ', "The four-week trial lifted a veil from Bloomberg's private and political dealings. His 2009 campaign manager conceded on the stand that he had worried Haggerty's operation could look bad to the public. A former deputy mayor told jurors that he hadn't enjoyed his first two years at City Hall because he found it more difficult to get things done there than at Bloomberg's eponymous financial information company. Bloomberg's top city deputy and longtime confidante detailed how she was authorized to spend the mayor's vast personal funds. ", "And the mayor himself took the stand, speaking calmly and precisely even as a defense attorney raised his voice, pointed his finger at him and came close to calling him a liar. To the defense's questions, Bloomberg said repeatedly that he could not remember the answers. Among the things he could not recall: $1.2 million in additional donations to the Independence Party the year before Haggerty entered the picture. ", "Defense lawyers had claimed that the arrangement meant that Bloomberg lost control of the money when he made the contribution, so Haggerty couldn't be held responsible for the budget he submitted to the campaign. That budget, Haggerty's lawyers said, was a slipshod effort that their client slapped together in the final days of the campaign, knowing that the decision to fund the project had already been made. ", 'The hours of testimony by politicos and three days of deliberations left jurors saying they had received an education in the realities of politics. ', '"There\'s so much money being thrown around, but it\'s very broad-stroked. No one looks at details or digs down, and I found that fascinating," Conroy said. ', 'Juror Piper Gray said that after starting the trial with no opinions on politics, she left it knowing exactly where she stands. ', '"I don\'t know if it\'s shady," he said. "There\'s a system that\'s set up, and people find a way not to get around the system but they found a way to work within the system that they have." ', '   Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.
