Akbari was photographed crying surrounded by injured and dead relatives after surviving a bomb blast on Dec. 6 near a shrine on the Shiite holy day of Ashura. Afghanistan said the death toll from bombings targeting the Shiite Muslim holy day of Ashura, which raised fears the nation could face an eruption of sectarian violence, has climbed to 80. The twin blasts have prompted fears that Afghanistan could see the sort of sectarian violence that has pitched Shiite against Sunni Muslims in Iraq and Pakistan.Massoud Hossaini / AFP - Getty ImagesTwelve-year-old Tarana Akbari kisses her grandfather's hand as she walks on the yard with the help of her uncle (right) outside her home in Kabul on Dec. 10.By Natalia Jimenez, NBC NewsBy now, you may have already seen the photo of Tarana Akbari reacting as she is surrounded by the bodies of her relatives, victims of a suicide bombing on a Shiite Muslim shrine in Kabul, Afghanistan on Dec. 6.

It appeared the next day on the front pages of The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.We now know her story. Akbari spoke about her experience to Agence France Presse, recounting the horror and fear she felt last Tuesday. That morning, she especially chose her custom-made, bright green dress for the occasion of Ashura; green is a holy color in Islam. She says:", 'Suddenly there was an explosion. It was as if the world had overturned, as if  all the walls had collapsed on me. Little by little, I started to recognize my relatives. I screamed and I was watching as they died.', "Akbari lost seven relatives in the attacks, including her 7 year-old brother, and her two sisters are still in the hospital. She was also injured, according to the Telegraph, and spent three days in the hospital due to shrapnel wounds.

Although in a state of shock, he knew he was witnessing something that needed to be documented:", "I was hoping just to reflect the real pain to everybody else, to everybody who  is watching my photos. Doesn't matter [if] they are Afghans, they are American,  they are Muslim, they are Christian, they are whatever. Just wanted that they  know what my people are feeling now.", 'While still haunted by the visions of that day, he felt some solace knowing his image was widely published and helped bring attention to the suffering in Afghanistan.For more images from Afghanistan, see our slideshow: Afghanistan: Nation at a crossroads.Explore related topics: world-news, religion, afghanistan, terrorism, muslim, attack, kabul, shiite, suicide-bomb, tarana-akbari', 'older13Dec20119:49am, ESTAttacker throws grenades, kills four in Belgiumnewer13Dec201111:21am, ESTSantaCon NYC: full of good cheer?
