['                    People who knew her say Brianna Maitland had a lot of life, happiness and spontan...', 'At 11:20 p.m., Brianna clocked out, and according to detective Brian Miller of the Vermont State Police, had left a note with her roommate, saying she would be home after work.', 'Rob Stafford, Dateline correspondent: Does anyone see her get into her car at the restaurant?', 'Stafford: In talking to the people at the restaurant, how did Brianna seem at work that night?', 'Precious time would pass before anyone realized she was missing. Her roommate assumed Brianna had changed her mind and gone to her parents house. Bruce and Kellie had no idea their daughter was missing until three days later when the roommate called looking for Brianna. ', 'The night Brianna vanished, her car was spotted at an abandoned farmhouse, about a mile from where Brianna worked. Police assumed the car had been ditched, and had it towed to a local garage. Now, as her parents looked at the picture, they panicked. The tail end of the car had been slammed backwards into the side of the building. Did Brianna have an accident, or did something more sinister happen?', "Stafford: One theory you have is that someone spotted your daughter, became obsessed with her, hid in the back seat of her car. She didn't now the person was there. She's driving home, and that person attacks her.", "Stafford: What is going through your mind as you're prying open the trunk of your daughter's car?", 'Stafford: Any sign that she was a victim of some violent confrontation at the scene where her car was found?', "Miller: That she either intended to go back to the car at some point and retrieve her personal belongings, or that, you know, she didn't leave willingly.", 'Although she was familiar with the men who lived there, the raid failed to turn up any sign of Brianna. Still, drug use had become a growing scourge in this rural area in recent years. Had Brianna been involved with drugs?', 'Vermont police received a startling call from a local man, who had been visiting Atlantic City, New Jersey.', 'Stafford: Are you afraid to allow yourself to believe this could be the real thing?', "The Maitlands have offered a $20,000 reward for information about Brianna's whereabouts. This mystery is their nightmare, and more than three years later, they have no idea how or if it will end."]
