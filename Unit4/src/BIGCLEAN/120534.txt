['CNN Johannesburg Bureau Chief Charlayne Hunter-Gault reports that the elections went smoothly', 'CAPE TOWN, South Africa (Reuters) -- South African President Nelson Mandela on Sunday welcomed the election victory of his ruling African National Congress and dismissed opposition reservations about its huge majority.', "In his first public appearance since he voted on Wednesday, Mandela, 80, quoted his deputy and heir, Thabo Mbeki, in response to questions about the ANC's 66 percent win.", '"The president of the ANC and the president-designate of the country put it very well: The people have spoken," he said.', "Mbeki, 56, began his victory speech on Thursday with those words, saying the ANC -- which fought a 30-year guerrilla war against apartheid and won a landslide in the country's first democratic election in 1994 -- had been given a mandate by the people for accelerated change.", 'With more than 90 percent of the vote counted, the ANC appeared on Sunday likely to fall between one and five seats short of a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.', 'Investors and opposition parties have been concerned that a two-thirds majority in parliament would give the ANC the power to change some clauses of the post-apartheid constitution.', '"This concern that a two-thirds majority will be abused by the ANC flies in the face of the facts of history," Mandela told reporters in the garden of his official Cape Town residence.', 'He said the ANC had shown in the government of national unity that has ruled since 1994 that it would not abuse its dominance to impose its will on others.', '"None of them (the ANC\'s coalition partners) can ever say we abused our majority," he said.', 'Changes to the constitution, which guarantees the independence of the central Reserve Bank and several public watchdog bodies, require the support of two-thirds of the 400 National Assembly members.', 'But analysts say complex rules for the allocation of seats mean the ANC probably would need between 67 and 69 percent of the vote to win a two-thirds majority -- 267 seats.', "Mandela and his wife, Graca Machel, entertained Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's wife, Safia Farkash Albarassi, at lunch in Cape Town. He told reporters he expected Gadhafi to pay a state visit before he formally hands power to Mbeki. Mandela retires formally on June 16.", 'With 98 percent of the vote counted, the Independent Electoral Commission said preliminary figures gave the ANC 66.4 percent support -- up from 62.5 percent in 1994 when Mandela, a prisoner in apartheid jails for 27 years, was installed as president.', "Lawyer Tony Leon's Democratic Party was on track to be the main opposition with 9.57 percent of the vote, up from 1.7 percent in the historic election which consigned apartheid to history five years ago.", "Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party was in third place at 8.53 percent, followed by the renamed New National Party, which imposed apartheid for over 40 years and saw its support fall to 6.9 percent from 20 percent in 1994."]
