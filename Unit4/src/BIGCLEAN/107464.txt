See More ', '\t\t\t\t\t\tSpeaking of "oz," so great to have one of its stars here in times square. Michelle williams plays glenda the good witch. We\'re happy to have michelle williams here. Michelle, thanks for being here. Thanks for having me. You have spoken so warmly of your role. Saying you were so happy that your 7-year-old daughter, matilda, can see the movie you\'re in. This is a bit of a different role for you, playing a good witch, a princess. What made you decide to take it? When I first read the script, I really responded to the fact that it had a good heart at its center. And that its sense of humor wasn\'t sarcastic or mean. I thought it was something that my daughter could see. Her friends would enjoy. And matilda was behind the scenes with you in the making of the movie. What was it like for her to watch the magic of moviemaking. Our director, sam reammy, made sure it was a good experience for her. It\'s not magical. It\'s not really magical behind the scenes. He had a chair for her next to him on-set, with her little name. And all of the departments were accommodating and letting her experience it. That\'s great. Were you inspired by glenda the good witch? I know "wizard of oz" is a staple in my house. When you\'re playing an iconic role, you look to the greats who originally did it? I took a lot of inspiration from that early performance. I know were weren\'t supposed to imitate it or reference it. But I took a lot of inspiration from it. Just as in the original, glenda travels in a bubble. We have a clipf the movie. You\'re escorting the man everyone thinks is the great wizard of oz. Let\'s take a look. Is that a wall? Of sorts. It repels our ene it protects us from harm. But we\'re headed straight for it. Yes, we are. And going very fast. How do you -- does this thing have any brakes? I\'m going too fast. I\'m going to die. You needn\'t worry, wizard. It\'s a magic wall. And all good hearted will be able to pass through. I\'m going to die. Watch out. James francthere. You were actually flying how high up in the air? Well, actually flying. With some help from the stage. Yeah. What was it like? We see you being hoisted up. The flying was my favorite part of the job, by far. And what about the wand? Did you get to keep the wand? Everyone wants to know. You had several wands. I had a few wands. I had a rubber wand. A light-up wand. A stunt wand. And a beautifully-carved wand. And now, matilda has a set at home? She was given a wand. We cannot wait to see the movie. Thanks so much for stopping by. "Oz: The great and powerful" OPENS MARCH 8th.
