The Storm Chasers are -- special breed of scientist when everyone else is driving in the other direction they hurl themselves directly into the heart of the storm. -- -- -- They say their mission is to better understand nature's destructive and deadly force.

There's some that doesn't make sense because he knew exactly it is doing and he's always been controlled -- just doesn't make sense something. It's not right. Tim with a two pioneer in the field who -- technology that continues to help -- measure and predict tornadoes. His quest to learn and inform always inspired him to give states. I had the honor of joining him on a recent expedition to study his other love lightning. -- -- -- -- How beautiful. For the price measurements on teased him it's really easy -- your car -- -- go here -- with undergo park up next to a cheering. Well it's not basis sometimes is almost as difficult. Chasing a trail is as good lightning storm. I'm gonna go see -- -- -- always on the cutting edge Tim built this ultra high speed camera in the hopes that he could capture the birth of a lightning strike there's actually 82 campers on his instrument you're taking.

Starting lightning starting tornadoes. Are warranted final frontiers in the urology you know -- of these things there because -- so fleeting they're so very difficult to study. Do you have to get up close and you have to collect imagery you have to collect data. To feed these models and maybe a computer prediction model -- tell you down the road how much lightning in particular thunderstorms can generate. It's that philosophy to get close to storms that drives meteorologist like us to keep chasing despite the obvious risk. But now some say tornado Alley is saturated with an increasing number of untrained un educated Storm Chasers. -- -- blamed for storm chasing traffic jams and unsafe conditions in the past officials say that might have been the case Friday night.
