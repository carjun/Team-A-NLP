['The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety wants bumper rules to apply to all passenger vehicles, including SUVs, pickups, and vans. The Institute recently petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to amend the federal bumper standards. ', 'In its petition to the federal government, IIHS provides the results of a series of SUV-to-car crashes. In each case, a midsize SUV hits the back of a midsize car at 10 miles per hour. ', 'One of the sport utility vehicles, the 2008 Ford Explorer, caused less damage to the passenger car than the Hummer H3, Jeep Grand Cherokee, or Mitsubishi Endeavor. The Explorer also had a lower repair bill than the other three SUVs. ', 'The Insurance Institute says the same thing happens in real world crashes. From 2005 to 2007, the Hummer H3, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Mitsubishi Endeavor had some of the highest insurance claims for collision damage. The Ford Explorer had lower-than-average damage claims during those same years.', 'The Insurance Institute insists the new bumper requirements would not reduce the performance or utility of these vehicles. In its petition IIHS points to the Ford Explorer which has lower bumpers and still performs well on loading ramps and off road.', 'Everyone agrees bumper incompatibility drives up the cost of auto insurance. It also increases business for collision repair shops and makes money for automakers who sell replacement parts. But it hurts the average consumer in the pocketbook.']
