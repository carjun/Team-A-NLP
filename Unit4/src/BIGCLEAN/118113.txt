['        Like many Americans, Judy Orlando, a nurse in LeRoy, N.Y., had racked up a mountain of credit card debt. Divorced and raising five children, she was carrying a total balance of about $30,000 on her five credit cards.', 'In 2006, she was contacted by Nationwide Asset Services, a debt settlement company based in Phoenix.', 'Orlando agreed to pay a $1,300 enrollment fee and send the company $350 a month. They told her to stop paying her credit card bills, cut off all contact with her credit card companies and to change her phone number, which she did.', 'Orlando figures she paid Nationwide Asset Services about $10,000 (plus enrollment fee) during her two-and-a-half years as a client. In that time, she says, the company lowered her $30,000 balance by less than $3,000. "They don\'t tell you the interest and late charges keep compounding,"she says.', 'Nationwide Asset Services released this statement: "Right now our local attorney is currently reviewing a copy of the complaint and at this time we can not comment on the allegations contained in it."', 'Debt settlement companies are a risky way to go because they almost always require a sizeable payment upfront. Most promise a money-back guarantee, but getting a refund can be difficult, if not impossible.', 'Not all debt settlement companies are crooks, but clearly there are many bad apples in this barrel. Washington State Attorney General Rob McKenna has sued several debt relief companies.', 'Cuomo recently subpoenaed information from 15 companies that do this work to find out if they are really helping people.', 'If you pay your bills on time and have a good credit rating, see what you can do on your own. You probably have more bargaining power than you imagine.', 'To find out what the current interest rates are for your credit score, go to cardtrack.com. Right now, the average credit card interest rate for someone in the top credit score bracket (760 and up) is 7.4 percent.', 'Laurie Ferrer, a 42-year old nurse in St. Louis, Mo., remembers what it was like to be drowning in debt.', 'Because of those missed payments, the interest rates on those cards skyrocketed, in some cases as high as 32 percent.']
