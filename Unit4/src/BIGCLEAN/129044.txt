['        To this day, does anyone understand how it happened? They were so young. TOO young, some said back then, even to understand the awful thing they did.', 'Alex King in 2009: I remember very clearly what I went through. I remember very clearly the price I paid for my mistakes.', 'Now, Alex and Derek King give their first interviews ever --about a horrible, baffling crime --- ', "How did it begin? Well, it started with a family. Two boys, barely toddlers, their father, Terry King, a printer by trade and a mother who paid the bills as an exotic dancer. When the boys were six and seven, she abandoned them all. It didn't take long for single-parent-life to overwhelm the father. His older boy, Derek, was a live-wire ---so he sent him away to live with a foster family.", "As for Derek ---he'd been living with that foster family for about six years when he started acting out. So in the fall of 2001, his foster family sent him back to his father. Dad and boys, together again.", "The boys, now 12 and 13, were gone when their father's body was found -- but two days later Rick Chavis turned them over to the police. And that's when they confessed.", 'Derek King: My anger just so overwhelming that i just did what I thought was right.', 'Their friend Rick Chavis said it was more like mental abuse - just the way their father Terry looked at them.', 'Rick Chavis: It was just a real hard stare, it was like one of those type stares.', "But aside from that, said the boys, Terry wasn't a bad father. And yet, here they were, Alex and Derek King, at 12 and 13- two of the youngest children ever to be charged with murder and arson as adults. ", "Rick Chavis: I've never imagined in a million years, children were capable of this. ", 'From the start, investigators were as perplexed as anyone about the motive behind the murder, but that family friend Rick Chavis had caught their interest. Chavis lived in a fenced compound filled with video games and computers, things kids crave. He had a record: in 1984 was convicted of sexually abusing two 13 year old boys. And he seemed especially fond of Alex.', 'All this information clearly troubling, but still, the boys had freely confessed to the murder. So, charged as adults, they spent six months in the county jail awaiting trial. And then, it was the spring of 2002. They suddenly changed their story.', "They didn't kill their father, Alex and Derek told a grand jury; the real killer was Rick Chavis.", "Unusual because the boys would be tried as adults on that same charge as soon as Rick's trial was over.", 'Watching from the sidelines back then -as mystified as everyone else - was a stranger named Kathryn Medico. She was a journalism professor who had heard about the case from a former student, now a reporter.', 'For her research, Kathryn Medico had begun writing the brothers and talking by phone. Her daughters had gone to the same school as the boys -- and were about the same age. They took an interest as well. ', 'Kathy Medico: They felt a connection early on and they began talking on the phone for hours and hours.', "So when Rick Chavis' trial began, Kathryn Medico brought her daughters to court. It was August, 2002. With defendant Rick Chavis sitting there listening, Alex took the witness stand. This would be the first time television audiences would hear from the boys. And what they heard was jaw-dropping. ", 'Prosecutor David Rimmer: Alex, did you have a sexual relationship with Ricky Chavis?', 'Prosecutor David Rimmer: did you at some point believe that you were in love with ricky chavis.', "It was just after midnight, Alex testified. He said he and his brother went out to Chavis' car. They waited. Then Chavis came out of the house and drove them to HIS house. It was there, said Alex, that Chavis told the boys he'd killed their father. ", 'Alex King: He said that he had done it for us and he said that our dad would have killed us before he let us go live with him.', 'Derek King told jurors essentially the same story -- then answered a question about his relationship with his father.', "Derek King: I did like it with him. When ... When i was there with him and around with him. But he ... He said he'd make it better and that he'd -- like he'd, he'd he would help us and like make it better and give us stuff like get a TV and stuff like that. But he didn't have a chance to.... [cries]. I'm sorry could I please take a break? Judge? ", "Then Chavis' attorney presented his defense --- and the key to it all was the boys' description of their father's death in that detailed confession.", 'Alex King: He was still trying to breathe and um made sort of like a sound like the person who has a slightly stopped up nose.', 'So next: The Trial of the King Brothers. The jailhouse scrubs were gone and the brothers were dressed in their Sunday best. Now THEY were the defendants, accused of the pre-meditated murder of their father.', 'Prosecutor David Rimmer: Alex was the one who wanted his father dead, who encouraged his brother Derek to do it.', 'These were extraordinary notes that Alex -- barely 12 years old -- had written about Rick Chavis.', 'The prosecutor suggested these notes showed Alex was so fixated on Chavis that he would kill his own father.', "But when it came time for the boys' defense, their attorneys portrayed Rick Chavis as the pedophile who pulled the strings in this whole ugly mess.", "The boys' defense suggested Chavis had lured them into a private play world and then convinced them to take the fall for him.", "The stakes couldn't have been higher - and yet, Kathy Medico says the boys really didn't seem to grasp it.", "Kathy: when James Stokes, the attorney for Alex, was giving this very impassioned plea before the jury, fighting for this child's life literally, he finally went and-- and he sat down at the defense table and looked over at Alex to see Alex's reaction. And Alex was hiding a laugh. He had no concept. He was oblivious to what was going on.", "Jurors said it was Alex's banal yet horrifying description of the murder scene that told them the boys weren't in Rick Chavis car at all: They were there in the house, present at the killing.", 'Alex King: And he was still trying to breathe and, um, made sort of like a sound like the person who has a slightly stopped up nose.', "And Rick Chavis? His jury didn't like him -- but they didn't think there was enough evidence that he swung the bat, so Chavis was acquitted. The courts weren't through with Chavis. A few months later he was charged with lewd and lascivious battery involving Alex. Again, he was acquitted. ", 'Kathy Medico: As soon as I met him, there was just a connection as though he was a child that needed me in some way. ', "Lisa Drew Alton: It was a gesture of faith and hope for them that we're going to be here for you, the people involved in the trust are going to be here for you and there's some money here to help you get started in your life.", 'Lisa had gotten to know a man named Dan Dailey online. Dailey is a widower and freelance ', 'They wrote frequently -- and if there was any lingering doubt about what really happened, Daily said he was impressed that Derek readily admitted his guilt.', 'Several times he made the drive out to Florida to visit Derek in prison. Another stranger entering the lives of the King Brothers. Random people, waiting on the outside, while the boys grew up in prison -- from children to teenagers to young men. ', 'Two boys famous - infamous - for murdering their own father. Boys who grew up in prison -- where young offenders can harden into full-fledged criminals. So -- what became of Derek and Alex King? Now, for the first time, a chance to find out.', 'Alex King: And who would have thought a moment of utter stupidity would have brought me to my senses? ', 'Alex King: We wound up back in the classroom-- and really there was nothing that we could do.', 'They were caught, of course, taken to county jail and booked on a whole new set of charges. ', 'And then Alex caught a very big break. Instead of giving him more prison time, the judge gave him a second chance, sending him back to the juvenile facility to finish his sentence.', 'And then, perhaps for the first time in his life, Alex began to do some grownup thinking.', 'He read. He prayed. He studied: the boys whose education had been spotty at best was hitting the books -- in prison. His keen mind was finally engaged -- and he earned his high school diploma.', 'And on April 9, 2008, Alex left prison in South Florida to begin a life with the family of Kathryn Medico. ', 'Alex King: It was a wonderful day-- walking out of the gates was just kind of-- I was kind of stunned. ', 'Which brings us to Jacksonville, Fla. and this neatly manicured suburb. It is here where Alex King is settling into that new life of his and from here the chaos and poverty of his childhood, and the crushing monotony of prison life must seems light years away. ', "The adjustment was not instant, but in time Kathryn and Alex learned to talk easily, although Kathryn says they have never discussed Alex's role in the murder of his father. ", "Alex King: And it just kind of left me in that state where I'm confused and not really knowing anything around me.", "And clearly, Alex was also uncomfortable when the questions turned to his father's murder.", 'Instead of talking directly about his role in the murder, Alex talks about making "bad decisions."', "Keith Morrison: Just take ownership of it for one second. What's the worst choice you made?", 'Keith Morrison: I want to know how this could happen to a 12-year-old boy. How you and your brother could wind up doing what you did.', "Keith Morrison: when you see the pictures of that young towheaded boy in court, does that not feel like it's you?", "When Alex talks about family, what he means is the people he lives with here in Jacksonville and they of course are not blood relatives. He seems to have not very much interest in seeing his birth mother. Maybe someday, he says, and then there's his brother - and that's complicated, isn't it?", 'And those who know them will tell you how different they are. Always have been. Alex is reserved, Derek is outgoing. And according to his confession, Derek is also the one who did the killing.', 'So now that Derek is out of prison, he will face the same kind of curiosity and questions that his brother has faced. How will HE answer?', 'We met up with him about two months after his release in a remote part of the Southwest --- living off the grid.', 'Derek King: I like time alone, away from everything away from all buildings, away from people. I like going out hiking. I see a lot of wildlife you know, deer. Saw a bear one time. That was interesting.', 'A quiet retreat to a rough-hewn house owned by that man who sent him those books years ago -- Dan Dailey.', 'Derek was just getting his footing -- - and savoring all this newfound freedom after eight years behind bars', "Alex and Derek's mother didn't visit them too often in prison, but she was with Derek the day he walked out. And he remembers it as just about the happiest moment of his life.", 'And happiness for Derek, has been hard to come by. His early childhood is a blur, but he holds onto a smattering of pleasant images: a little boy with a brother, a mother and father.', "And nothing that lasted. Derek was just seven when he went to that foster home. He still doesn't understand why. But he says it wasn't all bad. He was enrolled in classes for gifted children. He says the family was stable.", "Derek King: I really don't wanna focus on it. And I've tried to put it behind me. And it was-- it was horrible.", 'The trial he says, is hazy. But the verdict; now THAT that he remembers, because it brought his fate into focus.', "Derek, like Alex, wouldn't go into details about the murder itself-- but he did talk about the crime and its impact.", "There is someone who might be able help him figure it out. Someone who knows what he knows. Derek and Alex will be joined forever-- by the childhoods they lost -- and the death they'd like to forget. ", "You could have bet good money back in 2001 that no good would come of the King brothers. So how do you explain Alex King -- and the life he's led since prison? The scrapbook Kathryn Medico put together speaks volumes --- about a lost boy's extraordinary opportunities --- and mother's commitment.", "Ah yes -- Deepak Chopra -- doctor, philosopher, peace activist -- that Deepak Chopra. He too has taken an interest in Alex King. And it all started when Kathryn took Alex to Dr. Chopra's peace conference in Barcelona. They were asked to speak.", "Alex's foray into public service almost makes up for a huge disappointment he's faced since his release. He can't get a job. ", 'He really comes alive with family and friends. Alex has friends -- more than he ever had as a kid. And he dates. Distinctly absent from this happy picture is Derek. He\'s just getting started at life on the outside. And he\'s desperate to shake off his old life on "the inside." ', "He says he'll prove them wrong. This past June, Derek traveled to Springfield, Mo. to meet some of the people who have supported him and Alex all these years. They weren't family. But they cared. Lisa Drew Alton took Derek to the dentist and the eye doctor. Her family dragged him out for some fun.", "Derek King: They accepted me for being who I am. They accepted me, because of what's on their heart, you know.", 'Dan Dailey, Kathryn Medico, and others-- the random people who surfaced in these boys lives have come to agree on at least one point: Children should not be tried as adults. And the King brothers, they say, were the lucky ones. Kathryn Medico believes Alex was saved -- when he was taken out of the adult prison system. ', 'Kathryn Medico: He ended up being in-- a juvenile institution for seven years, which I feel was completely appropriate now, had we just gone ahead and given him 15 or 20 years to think about it, I really think we wou-- he would not be salvageable.', 'But a few months ago, Derek and Alex took charge. They met in Pensacola for a brief and quiet reunion.', 'And then in late July Derek was invited to a weekend-long birthday blowout for Alex -- who was turning 20. ', "Nothing quiet about this visit. Derek was suddenly immersed in a very different kind of life -- Alex's life -- complete with family and friends his own age. It all seems so normal. But given the underpinnings of this extraordinary reunion -- it was anything but. ", 'What do they think about -- talk about -- now? We started with a question about second chances --- and both brothers agree they are deeply grateful to those who made that happen.', "Derek King: I don't say I owe it to them, but I want to show them, I want to show them that all that effort wasn't in vain.", "Alex King: When I go in for that all they see is the record and um a lot of people that I meet, it's the only thing they seem to, the only thing that they seem to see. It's the only thing they recognize about me.", "That hint of bitterness disappears when Alex talks about his friends --and the joy of life's unexpected turns.", 'A spontaneous moment to break the ice -- and start a conversation about the future. They talked about the possibility of being together again.', 'Easy to talk about on a weekend loaded with family love and good intentions. But are they serious about being together after so much time apart? Apparently --- yes.', "Shortly after the party, Derek made a surprising announcement, or maybe it wasn't such a surprise : He's moving to Jacksonville. And true to form, Katharine Medico is stepping in, now for Derek.", 'She has enrolled him in the same community college Alex attends, and will help him rent an apartment walking distance from school.', "Derek's reasoning is clear. They've been through so much together: fractured childhoods, a shocking murder whose intimate details only they really know, a trial in the public eye. Now, Derek wants to share something redemptive. He wants an education, he wants friends and above all, he still wants a brother."]
