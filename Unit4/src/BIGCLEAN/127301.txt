['Commuter rail service will resume Friday following a strike, after the San Francisco Bay Area transit agency and its two largest unions agreed to extend a labor contract for a month while they continue bargaining.A statement released late Thursday by Bay Area Rapid Transit said trains will begin running by 3 p.m. Friday, ending a four-day strike that slowed commutes across the Bay Area. The agreement between the agency and its unions will be extended for 30 days.BART General Manager Grace Crunican said there is a wide gap of disagreements between the two sides."Unfortunately, the issues that brought us to this point remain unresolved," Crunican said.
