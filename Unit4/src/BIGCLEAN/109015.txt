[' "It Gets Better" video archive projectPresident Obama telling isolated kids them "Seriously they want me to wear purple because five queers killed themselves. The only way im wearin it for them is if they all commit suicide. I cant believe the people of this world have gotten this stupid. We are honoring the fact that they sinned and killed thereselves because of their sin. REALLY PEOPLE." "Being a f-g doesn\'t give you the right to ruin the rest of our lives. If you get easily offended by being called a f-g then dont tell anyone you are a f-g. Keep that s--- to yourself. I dont care how people decide to live their lives. They dont bother me if they keep it to thereselves. It pisses me off though that we make a special purple f-g day for them. I like that f-gs cant procreate. I also enjoy the fact that they often give each other aids and die. If you arent against it, you might as well be for it." "I would disown my kids they were gay. They will not be welcome at my home or in my vicinity. I will absolutely run them off. Of course my kids will know better. My kids will have solid christian beliefs. See it infects everyone."Advocate Fire Clint McCancereleased a statement seemed a bit more concerned.  announced that he would resign"I sit on the school board.
