['Beth and Richard traveled across the country to meet a sperm donor.  (Courtesy of Beth and Richard)', 'Like millions of couples, Beth and Richard are on a quest to have a baby. But unlike most, their labor of love is launching them on a cross-country odyssey that has been 10 years in the making. Their destination? A Maryland hotel room and an intimate encounter with a man they met on the Internet.', 'Their saga began when they discovered a vasectomy that Richard underwent years earlier could not be reversed. The news was unfortunate, but it did not deter them. They opened their home and hearts to more than 60 foster children through the years and even adopted two of the neediest. ', 'The couple, who asked their last names be withheld, purchased sperm from sperm banks and tried artificial inseminations but after $14,000 and still no pregnancies, Beth was beginning to lose hope. Then she went on the Internet.', '"After so many tries and spending so much money, I thought there\'s got to be a better way," she told "20/20." "I mean, people go on the Internet for sex, why can\'t I go on the Internet for sperm?"', 'Courtesy of Beth and RichardBeth and Richard traveled across the country... View Full Size', 'Courtesy of Beth and RichardBeth and Richard traveled across the country to meet a sperm donor.', 'She sat down at her computer and Googled "free sperm" and discovered an entire online universe devoted to free sperm donation. One of the sites she came across,FreeSpermDonorRegistry.com, offered profiles for men willing to donate sperm for free to thousands of women desperate to conceive.', 'The website has since changed name to www.knowndonorregistry.com. Beth Gardner, a woman also frustrated with her options, founded the donor website in January 2011. "I think where we come from with the website, is that there is an element of freedom of choice, that people should have a choice."', 'Dokoupil estimates thousands of people use this site and others like it. His research took him to some unexpected places where people donate sperm.', 'After a couple of months of chatting and e-mailing , Beth and her husband, Richard, flew from Wyoming to Maryland, where they would finally meet Drew in their hotel room. They greeted each other with smiles and hugs, shared some stories and photos, and then it was down to business. Drew retreated to the bathroom with a sterile cup while Beth and Richard waited in the hotel lobby until Drew sends Beth a text, simply stating "I\'m done."', 'Then it was time for the couple to do their part of the process. Beth prepared the semen in a syringe, lay down on the hotel bed, and Richard injected her. Beth remained still for about 15 minutes while nature took its course. Or so they hoped.', '"When you look at these babies that we\'ve adopted, and all the struggles that they\'ve gone through -- we love both of our babies so much, and we love their mothers for choosing us, " she said. "That\'s how I feel about Drew at this time, too. He\'s giving me this gift, that, how many other people would, would freely give?"', 'Unlike sperm banks, private sperm donation is not formally monitored by the US Food and Drug Administration and recently one online sperm donor made national headlines for not complying with federal guidelines. The FDA paid a surprise visit to inspect his home and issued a "Cease Manufacture" order to California donor Trent Arsenault. He could potentially face jail time and a $100,000 fine and yet he continues to do as many as three donations a week from his home.', 'Arsenault, a 36-year old computer engineer, has been donating his sperm since 2006 and says he has fathered 14 children, including a set of twins. He posts pictures of himself and his offspring on his website.', 'To insure that Arsenault gives his recipients the healthiest and most potent product, he has a strict physical regimen and a diet that includes organic foods and his homemade "fertility smoothie" twice a day.  (See the recipe here.)', 'Arsenault says the goal is not to create hundreds of copies of himself, instead he is doing this to "help the community."  One woman he is trying to help is Krista (whose asked that her last name be withheld), a finance professional who previously spent $10,000 on unsuccessful frozen sperm inseminations and decided to try a different route.', 'She says she trusts Arsenault, who posts his medical history and STD tests online. Krista and her partner scheduled appointments with him during her ovulation cycle. He hands off a cup of his fresh semen from his front porch and she inseminates lying in the back seat of her car, or at home, because semen start to die in a matter of minutes.', 'Early attempts with Arsenault were successful, but Krista miscarried. Yet, she still believes in this method and does not think the FDA should control private sperm donation.', 'But beyond the legal issues, there are alarming questions about how much the women really know about the online donors. It turns out that over the years Arsenault has posted dozens of graphic videos of himself online. He defends the postings, saying they are "part of his donation process."  But they raise concerns. Fertility experts point out that at traditional sperm banks, semen is not only tested for diseases, but donors are also screened for possible psychological problems.', "Krista said she is aware of Arsenault's postings, but may continue to work with him, in addition to contemplating adoption or in vitro fertilization. For women eager for children who have already spent thousands of dollars, there are few easy choices.", '"I know that I will be a mother someday," said Krista.
