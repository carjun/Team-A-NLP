Back from the brink tonight. The white house is calling the truce tenuous this evening. Israeli and palestinian leaders agreed to a truce after eight days, more than 1300 rockets. 145 people killed. A welcome development for secretary of state hillary clinton, who arrived and helped broker that peace deal. Our team has been reporting across the region from the very start and abc's christiane amanpour, among our team standing by. But we begin with abc's matt gutman in tel aviv tonight. Matt, good evening. Reporter: Good evening, david. An israeli official described the deal with three words, saying it is quiet for quiet. A lot of skepticism on the israeli side, but both sides get the opportunity, tonight, to step back from the brink. For secretary clinton, it's been 24 hours of breakneck talks, racing in from came bode ya, first, to jerusalem, then to the west bank, back to jerusalem and finally cairo, in search of a ceasefire. All day, a truce negotiated by israeli bombardment and hamas rockets. Prospects seemed bleak until the announcement. U.S. Welcomes the agreement today for a cease fire in gaza for it to hold the rocket attacks must end a broader calm return. Reporter: The gunfire in gaza turned to bursts of celebration. But in jerusalem, israel's leaders briefed the nation on the deal, grim faced. A deal which seemed beyond reach this morning. The first bus bombing in israel since 2006, in the heart of tel aviv, across the street from the defense ministry. We found a bus cleaved open -- and anger. This eyewitness told me he thought it was a rocket, saying that israel can't go on like this, that it must invade gaza. More than 20 wounded by what police say was an ied and the suspect, still at large. Even with the ceasefire, all the guns weren't silenced. As many as 20 rockets fired out of gaza hours after the deal was inked. Now, so far, israel has not responded. In the short-term, the cease-fire means that all sides including other factions in gaza stop all fire and if it lasts over the next couple of days, we could see a gradual easing of israel's blo cade on the gaza strip.
