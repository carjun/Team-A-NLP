["        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'And the report also says that policymakers are doing far too little to fight obesity, which underlies a third of cancer cases.', 'Cancer death rates went down every year by 1.8 percent among children and men and by 1.4 percent among women from 2000 through 2009, according to the report from the American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Cancer Institute and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.', 'Many reports suggest that poor diet, a lack of exercise and obesity underlie about a third of U.S. cancers, including breast, colon and pancreatic cancer. Polls show Americans are barely aware of this and are far more worried about chemicals and pollution, which cause fewer than 5 percent of cancer cases, according to Dr. Graham Colditz of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, an expert in the causes of cancer.', 'American families now have multiple cars, and many neighborhoods lack sidewalks, Brawley pointed out. And more people than ever eat at fast-food restaurants daily.', 'The good news is that head and neck cancer caused by HPV is much easier to treat than head and neck cancer caused by smoking and excessive alcohol use. Epstein estimates that 75 percent of head and neck cancers caused by HPV can be cured, as opposed to just 25 percent of those linked to smoking.', 'Current surgery, radiation and chemotherapy treatments for head and neck cancer can be very harsh, leading to lifelong suffering for survivors who can have damage to their tongues, gums, teeth and their ability to taste and even eat food. So any improvement in treatments would benefit thousands of patients.', 'But the vaccine does not appear to protect people who are already infected, and there is a whole generation of Americans who have been infected with HPV, which is passed sexually, and who risk developing the slow-growing forms of cancer it causes. These include not only cervical cancer but 90 percent of anal cancers, 60 percent of many mouth, tonsils and throat cancers and 40 percent of cancers of the vagina, vulva and penis.', 'Only Virginia and Washington D.C. currently require the HPV vaccine for girls to enroll in middle and high school but such requirements could increase vaccination rates, the report says.
