['            USDA move aimed at reducing estimated 113,000 infections, 300 hospitalizations a year', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'Starting next spring, federal food safety inspectors will test for those strains of E. coli and it will be illegal to sell beef contaminated with the pathogens, consumer advocates and meat industry sources told msnbc.com. ', 'US Department of Agriculture officials were expected to confirm the changes at a press conference scheduled Tuesday.', 'The move was hailed as a long-sought victory by food safety advocates, who said they wondered why it took so long to require testing for bacteria that last year collectively caused more infections in the U.S. than E. coli 0157. ', 'The new move was sharply criticized by meat industry officials, who had opposed the change, saying that current measures to detect and eradicate E. coli 0157 were adequate to prevent infection from the other pathogens. ', 'The rules cover six strains of E. coli bacteria that have the ability to produce the same deadly toxins that can lead to bloody diarrheal illness, kidney failure and death as E. coli 0157. Known as Shiga toxin-producing Esherichia coli, or STECs, the group includes the strains 026, 0111, 0103, 0121, 045 and 0145. ', 'In 2010, for the first time, those rarer strains of E. coli were responsible for more infections in the U.S. than E. coli 0157, according to a June study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The non-STECs caused 451 confirmed infections last year, including 69 people who were hospitalized and one death. E. coli 0157 caused 442 infections, 184 hospitalizations and two deaths.', 'However, CDC officials say many infections are never detected. The agency estimates that overall, as many as 265,000 STEC infections occur each year in the United States, with the non-0157 strains causing up to 113,000 illnesses and 300 hospitalizations annually. ', 'E. coli 0157 was first labeled an adulterant in 1994, after a deadly outbreak in Jack in the Box restaurant hamburger patties that sickened more than 700 people in four states and led to 171 hospitalizations and four deaths. The move made it illegal to sell raw meat contaminated with the bacteria.', 'At the time, meat industry officials called the change an overreaction and sued the federal government over the designation. Since then, CDC officials say vigilant testing and industry recalls have helped reduce the rate of E. coli 0157 to less than 1 case per 100,000 people, a decline from 2 cases per 100,000 people in 1997. ', 'Agriculture, industry and consumer groups have fiercely debated the new rules since at least 2007, during a meeting to assess the impact of the non-0157 E. coli strains. ', '"I am more than pleased," Marler said. "It\'s a big recognition that there are other pathogens out there that cause human disease."']
