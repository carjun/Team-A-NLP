['It is true that Einstein was a government functionary in Switzerland, while the intellectual nexus of science in 1905 was Germany. But his work at the patent office in Bern was of much greater importance than he has been popularly given credit for, affording him the opportunity to engage in sophisticated experiments in reviewing advanced ideas.', 'He was also classically trained, having earned his Ph.D. from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School, and by 1909 he was well on his way to the top of the academic world, said Michel Janssen, a science and technology historian at the University of Minnesota and co-editor of the Cambridge Companion to Einstein.', 'The esteem Einstein earned in science meant that when he talked about the larger world, people listened.
