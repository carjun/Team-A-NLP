['            Dream Chaser looks like a small space shuttle, aims to begin full orbital flights in 2016', '        The new spaceship being built by private aerospace firm Sierra Nevada Corp. may look like a miniature space shuttle, but while the design takes cues from the past, company officials are hoping this vehicle shepherds in a new era of commercial human spaceflight. ', "Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser space plane is being developed to take astronauts to and from the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit. The company is aiming to begin full orbital flights in 2016. ", "But the Dream Chaser design, which is reminiscent of NASA's space shuttle, is actually based on a concept vehicle, called HL-20, which was first looked at by the agency in the early 1980s. ", "Using the HL-20 as a foundation, Sierra Nevada crafted a new and modern spacecraft that will launch initially on one of the United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rockets and land on a conventional runway at the end of its mission. Sirangelo said, however, that other rocket options will be considered in the future, as other options become available. [ Photos of the Dream Chaser space plane ] ", "A commercial space company called SpaceDev announced plans to build the Dream Chaser vehicle in 2004. The company was later acquired by Sierra Nevada, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, and the HL-20 concept became the basis of the vehicle's design. ", "Dream Chaser is one of several next generation spacecraft being designed to taxi astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The new vehicles are being built with a combination of private investments and NASA funding, under a program that aims to foster the development of commercial spaceships to take the reins from the agency's recently retired space shuttle fleet. ", 'The Dream Chaser vehicle will be able to seat seven passengers, and will function much like its orbiter predecessors. But, the new space plane is being designed to be a more efficient and cost-effective way of reaching low-Earth orbit (LEO), company officials said. ', '\t    The Dream Chaser structural test article at the University of Colorado at Boulder, FAST Lab.', "Sierra Nevada has already completed a series of crucial milestones in the vehicle's design process, including building an engineering test article, testing the hybrid rocket motors, a round of structural testing, an evaluation of the vehicle's landing gear, and most recently a drop test from a helicopter. ", "The next major drop test is currently scheduled to occur in May, said Jim Voss, Sierra Nevada's vice president of space exploration systems. Voss is a former NASA astronaut and a veteran of five space missions. ", "In September 2011, NASA added four optional milestones to Sierra Nevada's Space Act Agreement, bringing the company's Commercial Crew Development contract up to $105.6 million, pending the successful completion of all the milestones laid out. ", "Sierra Nevada has also submitted a proposal for the next round of NASA's commercial crew program. The agency is expected to award the funds to the selected companies in August.", "\t    An artist's concept of Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser space plane docking with the International Space Station.", "By upgrading existing designs and modernizing prove technology, Sierra Nevada has been able to capitalize on the Dream Chaser vehicle's strong NASA roots. [ How the Dream Chaser Space Plane Works (Infographic) ] ", 'Being a successor to the space shuttle program is also something that Sierra Nevada takes pride in, not just technically, but on a more personal level, Sirangelo added. ', '"In our view, many of the good things in the shuttle are inherent in this design," he said. "And we\'d like to think some of the emotion of the shuttle has been passed on to what we\'re doing, not just in our minds, but in reality."
