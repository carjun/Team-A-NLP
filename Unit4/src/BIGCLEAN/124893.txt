['                    DENNIS MURPHY reporting: (Voiceover) The world of pills, prescription medicines, ...', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Paul Duncsak seemed to go straight from a college intern job behind a druggist counter to the big money lifestyle of a pharmaceutical executive. On the way up he struck so many bosses as a natural at figuring innovative ways to make money out of medicine.', 'Mr. WALTER LESNEVICH: The theory the police developed is that the killer is on the stairs and the first shot is up.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Paul Duncsak had been ambushed and killed in his own home. The shooter had escaped and now friends of Paul were wondering seriously if they might be next.', '(Photo of Paul; crime scene photos; wedding photo; photo of Stacey Duncsak; wedding photo; John Duncsak)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) So both families bit their tongues and crossed their fingers as the two walked down the aisle in May 1999, after meeting only months before. The wedding was a lavish do, held aboard a yacht in New York harbor.', 'Mr. DUNCSAK: She got pregnant right, I believe, at the honeymoon purposely to pretty much lock Paul down.', '(John standing on balcony; photo of Ed Ates and Stacey; Michael Hertz counting pills)', '(Wedding photos; broken wedding photo; photo of Ed; photos of Paul and Stacey; photo of Paul, photo of Stacey)', 'Mr. DOMINIC TOMAIO: Because the pharmaceutical industry is a small, tight-knit industry in the training field, that he felt that he was going to be and was, in fact, blacklisted through the other pharmaceutical companies.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) So Paul Duncsak, the man who once pulled down 500,000 plus a year as a pharmaceutical executive, was now out the door, back to square one, working behind the counter of a local drugstore, where he made less than 100,000 a year. By the beginning of 2004, Paul Duncsak was not only getting divorced, he was also getting depressed. A few saw Paul struggling with dark thoughts, very dark. At one point he called his brother to say he was putting his affairs in order.', '(Pills being made and bottled; photo of Paul; pills being counted; broken wedding photo; photo of Paul; John)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Coming up, sabotage in the suburbs. Was someone out to get Paul Duncsak?', 'Mr. DUNCSAK: His name out there in the medical field was, you know, nobody wanted to hire him.', '(Photo of Stacey; photo of Ed and Dottie Ates; photo of Paul; outside house; door of condo; photo of Stacey)', '(Photo of Paul; photo of Stacey; photo of Stacey, pills tumbling; shelf with toys, books and photos)', 'Mr. DUNCSAK: They were dropping off the kids at Ramsey Police Department. I mean, how horrible is that?', '(Photo of Paul, photo of Stacey; outside house; photo of Paul; pharmacy; outside Medco; photo of Paul and fiancee Lori Adamo; photo of house; photo of Paul; photos of Stacey; outside condo; John; wedding photo)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) And behind that fear of losing his kids was an even darker threat. Paul shared it with his friend Nancy Bagley one afternoon as their kids swam in his backyard. He said that earlier that summer his pool had been sabotaged, its heater cranked up to a piping 100 degrees. He was convinced it was no accident.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Pretty soon word was getting around with his new business associates that Paul Duncsak was a man looking over his shoulder. Co-worker Janie Bennorth, who used the same day care as Paul, could not fathom why he was so hush-hush about anyone learning who his new employer was. Downright weird.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) But three weeks later, she ran into him at that day care and innocently said hello. Back at the office, he went nuts on her.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Even his good friend Michael Hertz thought Paul was starting to lose it. After all, the divorce and custody issue had been settled. He had no reason to fear his ex.', '(Photo of Stacey and children; Hertz in pharmacy; outside house; photo of Paul and Lori; mailbox; hamburger wrapper; thermostat)', '(Photo of Lori and Paul; photo of cell phone; doors; crime scene photos; photo of Paul)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Coming up, gunned down in his own house. Were others in danger?', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Police hear a conspiracy caught on tape and learn of a secret stakeout.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Police arrived at the house that Wednesday evening to find the 40-year-old pharmaceutical executive slumped inside a hallway, dead of multiple gunshot wounds. The killer, whoever he or she was, had left the house unseen and left it behind fairly clean.', '(Emergency vehicles and personnel; photo of Paul; crime scene photos; outside house)', '(Photo of police outside house; photo of Paul; crime scene photo; wedding photo; outside condo)', '(Moon; highway sign; outside house; airplane taking off; photo of Ed; Brenda Ates; town sign)', '(Photo of Ed and Dottie; warning sign; telephone lines and pole; photo of Ed; outside house)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Eventually the New Jersey investigators and prosecutors were convinced they had enough.

The victim, he said, was still wearing a Rolex watch and had $300 in cash on him. Multiple gunshot wounds were testimony to a violent death.', 'Mr. MELLO: I did not then nor do I now believe that that van was involved in this murder.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) Instead, the prosecutor said the evidence gathered in the months after the murder showed that the killer was far from a nameless intruder. It was, in fact, someone who knew Paul Duncsak well and had plotted his death carefully.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) A police forensics expert provided damning testimony against the defendant. He explained how a computer used by Edward Ates and later seized by police yielded the ghosts of past online searches.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) And not only did Edward Ates research guns, the prosecutor said he owned them, too.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) To emphasize that point, he called an extremely reluctant witness for the prosecution: Stacey Duncsak, the daughter of Edward Ates and ex-wife of the victim.', 'Mr. MELLO: (In court) It would be fair to say that your dad has a good knowledge of guns.', 'Mr. MELLO: (In court) OK. In fact, you know that in 2006, he certainly owned a gun.', '(Ed; trees at night; house at night; Christiana in court; cell towers; vehicle at night)', 'Mr. MELLO: It was reconnaissance. Paul Duncsak for the weeks prior followed the same pattern day in and day out.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) The sergeant also testified to those wiretaps, the ones in which Edward Ates reminds his sister about when he arrived in Louisiana, on a Tuesday before the Wednesday murder of Paul Duncsak.', 'Mr. MELLO: He has co-opted his sister and his mother into a conspiratorial agreement to hinder his apprehension, because it is clear that the truth is he was not there on Tuesday.', '(Mello in court; Brenda entering courtroom; Brenda in court; Ed; porch and door)', '(Brenda in court; Ed and lawyers in court; photo of Ed; photo of Paul; house at night; crime scene photos; hamburger wrapper; thermostat; crime scene photo; highway at night; sun in trees; outside house)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) The legal strategy that raised eyebrows from coast to coast.', 'Mr. LESNEVICH: What I had to show the most was scientific fact, that he could not have done it.', '(Stairs at night; photo of Paul; fence; Lori in court; photo of cell phone; Ed entering court)', '(Lesnevich in court; Ed in court; Brenda on porch; photo of Paul; Brenda in court)', 'Mr. LESNEVICH: (In court) If I told you that Detective Christiana sat just right where you are and said that Brenda Ates told me she gets confused, would that be true?', 'Ms. ATES: (In court) Well, occasionally, I do. I have diabetes and I do occasionally get my mind, you know.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) In a novel defense that made headlines across the nation, the lawyer called an expert witness, a doctor, to the stand, to show that Edward Ates could not have committed this particular murder. Why? Because the creaky grandfather was too fat to have pulled it off.', '(Photo of Ed and document; Lesnevich in court; man in court; Ed entering courtroom)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) The defense was telling the jury it had been presented no direct evidence to tie Ed Ates to the murder of his former son-in-law, and medically there was no earthly way he could have done it. And yet there was all that circumstantial evidence still to explain away: that odd trip to Pennsylvania and New Jersey the week before the murder, the damning computer searches. And there was only one person left who could do that. Coming up, Edward Ates takes the stand in his own defense.', '(Empty juror chairs; photo of Ed; photo of Paul; Ed; highway at night; computer searches; police vehicle outside house; Ed in court)', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) And later, in our second hour, Bitter Pill.

Right?', '(Ed and Murphy talking; highway at night; road; outside condo; photo of Stacey and children)', 'Mr. ATES: They live very close together and we got up to see how close we were and we drove by to see if he was really on vacation. He appeared to be on vacation, we drove back to the campground.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) He says the police had misread something else, those online searches.', 'MURPHY: How to commit the perfect murder, looking for books on making your own silencer at home...', 'MURPHY: Mr. Ates, did you lie in wait on your son-in-law and then shoot him with a .22 seven times when he came in the door?', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) And he gambled by telling that story directly to the jury itself.', 'MURPHY: Now why in violation of all the rules of perception, of trial law 101, did you elect to put Ed Ates on the stand?', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) In his closing, the prosecutor theorized for the jury just why Edward Ates had gone to such lengths to kill Paul Duncsak. It was for his daughter Stacey, whose life had been in free fall ever since her divorce from the victim.', 'Mr. MELLO: She really has nowhere to go. The father, her protector, wants her back, and wants those grandchildren in Florida. And so long as Paul Duncsak is alive, that will not be. And I think, in part, Ed Ates viewed this matter as he just needed killing.', '(Ed and Lesnevich in court; photo of Ed; Ed; landscape; outside house; town sign; Matlock in court)', 'Mr. LESNEVICH: (In court) Matlock saw him and his car there Wednesday night, August 23rd.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) But what really sunk Ed Ates for these jurors was his decision to testify directly. It all snapped together.', 'MURPHY: (Voiceover) The judge had little sympathy for Edward Ates. He sentenced him to life without parole, likely a death sentence for the 65-year-old grandfather, who the jury believed lay in wait and then fired at least seven times. Not too old or too sick to hate.', '(Judge in court; court in session; photo of Ed, Dottie and child; house at night; Ed in orange jumpsuit)']
