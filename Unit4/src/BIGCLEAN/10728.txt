[" Pat Roque / AP A fruit vendor arranges bananas for sale Saturday, Sept. 6, 2008, in a public market in Manila, Philippines. Drug traffickers back in Colombia must be going bananas over how their shipment ended up at Danish supermarkets and not on the streets. Police say employees at the supermarket chain Coop got a big surprise when they opened banana boxes from the South American country and found about 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of what police believe is cocaine. The powder was discovered last week in Aarhus, western Denmark, when employees noticed that some of the boxes were heavier than others. Coop spokesman Jens Juul says more bags with white powder were found Wednesday in a separate shipment from Colombia at a central dispatch facility in suburban Copenhagen. Juul told the Danish news agency Ritzau the company has contacted their Colombian supplier. Police are investigating, but haven't made any arrests.More business news:'Kill switch' pushed as  solution to smartphone theftsRoyal baby could give  bounce to British economyFox Searchlight should  have paid interns, judge rulesFollow NBCNews.com business onTwitter and Facebook"]
