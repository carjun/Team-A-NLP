After eight reps, the 54-year-old businessman dressed in camouflage pants rushes to the next excruciating exercise.', "Stumpf is one of a growing number of Americans putting themselves through grueling fitness programs modeled after Navy SEAL workouts as interest in the elite military unit has soared since one of its teams killed Osama bin Laden. Everyone these days seems to be dreaming of what it's like to be a SEAL, know a SEAL or at least look like one.", 'Book publishers say they cannot order the printings of the memoirs of former SEALs fast enough, while people are dialing 1-800-Hooyah! like mad to get their hands on T-shirts emblazoned with the SEAL insignia and sayings like: "When it absolutely, positively must be destroyed overnight! Call in the US Navy SEALs."', 'But nothing short of joining the SEALs offers a more true-to-life taste of their toughness than the workout places run by ex-Navy commandos.', '"Every little boy has got a SEAL in them," Stumpf joked after completing one of the workouts in Southern California.', "Former Navy SEAL Cmdr. Mark Divine said his business has been inundated with inquiries since the raid.
