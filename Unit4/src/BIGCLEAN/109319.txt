The largest one-day drop in history the. Reporter: But two weeks earlier, six floors above the streets of downtown new york it was all foreseeen. I woke up in the morning and I felt like my stocks weren\'t safe, and I wanted to get rid of them. So I called up my broker and I said, "sell everything." Reporter: Everything? Everything. And I sold everything, and a couple weeks later the market crashed. Reporter: This wasn\'t just the panic of your average nervous investor. I\'m seeing the person, someone who has their own authority, a woman, an older woman -- Reporter: Laura day calls herself an intuitive with a gift to see the future. And what I do is I follow my senses, and I just describe -- i often don\'t know what it is I\'m talking about. I just describe what I\'m experiencing. Reporter: So it\'s instantaneous? Yes. I\'m well, how are you doing? Reporter: But unlike theresa caputo and sidney friedman, day is not a performer. She works on a phone. I\'m not sure doing a deal would be the best thing. Reporter: Corporations pay her up to $10,000 a month for her intuitive feelings from everything from hiring decisions to investments and mergers. But for some reason I feel like this could create an opportunity and not a difficulty. Reporter: Do you have these companies ring you up and ask you a question about a stock or a currency, and do you ever say, "i don\'t know?" Yeah, I sure do. Sometimes I\'ll say I don\'t know, and then two minutes into the conversation, I\'ll get a feeling. Reporter: So you\'re not fishing with questions for information? No. No, I don\'t. I actually do all the talking, which works for me. Reporter: Day says anyone can cultivate that sixth sense the same way an athlete builds muscle through exercise. She recommends recording those weird moments when strong thoughts or feelings seem to strike you out of the blue. What you do is you keep track of your questions, you keep track of your answers that you get intuitively, and you learn over time that they\'re correct. And the more you practice, the more correct they are. Reporter: Others claiming to have the gift have their own training techniques. Theresa caputo invokes her special talent with smoke of sage and banging drums. Ryan michaels stares at a map. Sidney friedman does a lot of this. It\'s so important to realize everybody can do this. A 3-year-old is intuitive. Reporter: So you\'re n are not a psychic? No, I\'m not. Reporter: They\'ve been cataloging it for 85 years. Here they\'re tested with mind reading tall lent. Can they guess the shapes on the cards the tester draws at random? Once in a while someone will guess 20 or 25 cards in a row but not today. Now it\'s more parlor game than science but here dr. Dean radon is doing true experiments and find people may actually react to things before they happen and when you\'re ready to begin, you press a button. Reporter: Have you always believed in premonitions? I would say no. As a scientist I tend to base belief on evidence. Reporter: Here\'s how it works. Radin monitors a subject\'s heart, brain and skin, measuring how they react to random visual images like this. So you don\'t know which picture\'s coming up next. I don\'t know. Reporter: And the test subject certainly doesn\'t have any idea. Right. Reporter: Most people react the way you would expect. They become upset after they see images indicating violence. They get aroused by sexual imagery and stay calm when shown a tranquil scene. But remarkably radin claims one in five have those reactions up to nine seconds before they see the pictures, a phenomenon known as "pre-sentiment." How can that be? How do you know this isn\'t just coincidence? There are over 40 studies like this now reported around the world. There\'s no doubt at all that it is not chance. Reporter: Radin\'s results have been replicated in labs at universities such as princeton, northwestern and cornell. But "psychology today" writer matt hutson dismisses all of it. Do you trust your intuition? Sometimes, yeah, and on this, my intuition says that premonitions are not real. Reporter: Ever? Ever. Reporter: There\'s been a lot of time throughout the history of man when we\'ve thought, well, the earth is flat because there\'s no evidence it\'s round. We just didn\'t know yet that it was round. Right. Reporter: Isn\'t it possible we just don\'t know the science yet that might prove that premonition, intuition, the sixth sense really exists? Of course, anything is possible. That doesn\'t make it likely. I believe in skepticism. My favorite quote is a good scientist suspends disbelief and runs experiments anyway. I think you\'re in a position to compete. Reporter: There may not be any explanation for the uncanny stories we\'ve heard tonight but the believers say there\'s no way to disprove them either.
