The "supermoon" is so named because it\'s the biggest, brightest full moon of the year. The supermoon\'s disk is 14 percent wider and 30 percent brighter than the moon\'s minimum appearance. This is the result of the moon going full at roughly the same time that it reaches perigee - the point in its elliptical orbit that is closest to Earth.', "Cosmic butterflyA close-up of the dying star NGC 6302 nebula is seen in this image released by NASA on June 7. The picture was produced from data acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 in 2009. With an estimated surface temperature of about 250,000 degrees C (450,032 degrees F), the dying central star of this particular planetary nebula has become exceptionally hot, shining brightly in ultraviolet light but hidden from direct view by a dense torus of dust.", "Alpine observatoryA long-exposure photo shows star trails whirling around one of the antennas at IRAM's observatory in the French Alps in June.

This test lets engine manufacturers simulate flying through the upper atmosphere, where large amounts of icing particles can be ingested and cause flameouts or a loss of engine power on aircraft.", "Bubble babiesThis infrared image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, released June 5, shows a striking example of what is called a hierarchical bubble structure. One giant bubble, carved into the dust of space by massive stars, has triggered the formation of smaller bubbles. The large bubble takes up the central region of the picture, while the two spawned bubbles are located within its rim.
