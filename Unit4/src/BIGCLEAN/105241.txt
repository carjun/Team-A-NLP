[' World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Sunday it seemed likely a new  coronavirus that has killed at least 18 people in the Middle East and Europe  could be passed between humans, but only after prolonged contact.A  virus from the same family triggered the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome (SARS) that swept the world after emerging in Asia and killed 775  people in 2003.On Sunday French authorities announced that a second man  had been diagnosed with the disease after sharing a hospital room with France\'s  only other sufferer.WHO Assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda told  reporters in Saudi Arabia, the site of the largest cluster of infections, there  was no evidence so far the virus was able to sustain "generalized transmission  in communities" - a scenario that would raise the specter of a pandemic.But he added: "Of most concern ... is the fact that the different  clusters seen in multiple countries ... increasingly support the hypothesis that  when there is close contact, this novel coronavirus can transmit from person to  person."There is a need for countries to ... increase levels of  awareness," he said.A public health expert who declined to be  identified, said "close contact" meant being in the same small, enclosed space  with an infected person for a prolonged period.The virus first emerged  in the Gulf last year, but deaths have also been recorded in Britain and France  of people who had recently been in the Middle East. A total of 34 cases  worldwide have been confirmed by blood tests so far.Saudi Deputy Health Minister for Public Health Ziad Memish told  reporters that, of 15 confirmed cases in the most recent outbreak, in al-Ahsa  district of Eastern Province, nine had died, two more than previously reported.Saudi Arabia\'s Health Ministry said in a statement the country had had  24 confirmed cases since last summer, of whom 15 had died. Fukuda said he was  not sure if the two newly reported Saudi deaths were included in the numbers  confirmed by the WHO.Memish added that three suspected cases in Saudi  Arabia were still under investigation, including previous negative results that  were being re-examined.The first French patient was confirmed as  suffering from the disease on Wednesday after travelling in the Gulf. The second  patient was transferred to intensive care on Sunday after the two men shared a  room in a hospital in Lille.Professor Benoit Guery, head of the Lille  hospital\'s infectious diseases unit, said the first patient had not been  immediately isolated because he presented "quite atypical" symptoms.He  added in comments broadcast by BFMTV channel the case suggested that airborne  transmission of the virus was possible, though still unusual, and that the  public "should not be concerned" as there had been only 34 cases globally in a  year.Fukuda, part of a WHO team visiting Saudi Arabia to investigate  the spread of the disease, said although no specific vaccine or medication was  yet available for novel coronavirus, patients were responding to treatment."The care that is taken in the hospitals, in terms of using respirators  well, in terms of treating pneumonia, in terms of treating complications, in  terms of providing support, these steps can get patients through this very  severe illness," he said.Fukuda said that as far as he knew all cases  in the latest outbreak in al-Ahsa district were directly or indirectly linked to  one hospital.He added that Saudi Arabian authorities had taken novel  coronavirus very seriously and had initiated necessary health measures such as  increased surveillance systems.Related:US safe from two new viruses -- so far']
