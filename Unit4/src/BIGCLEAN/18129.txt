['President Bush could authorize waterboarding for future terrorism suspects if certain criteria are met, a spokesman said.', 'A day earlier, the Bush administration acknowledged publicly for the first time that the tactic was used by U.S. government questioners on three terror suspects. Testifying before Congress, CIA Director Michael Hayden said Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubayda and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri were waterboarded in 2002 and 2003.', 'Waterboarding involves strapping a suspect down and pouring water over his cloth-covered face to create the sensation of drowning. It has been traced back hundreds of years, to the Spanish Inquisition, and is condemned by nations around the world.', 'Hayden banned the technique in 2006 for CIA interrogations, the Pentagon has banned its employees from using it, and FBI Director Robert Mueller said his investigators do not use coercive tactics in interviewing terror suspects.', "Bush personally authorized Hayden's testimony, White House deputy spokesman Tony Fratto said.", 'Fratto said CIA interrogators could use waterboarding again, but would need the president\'s approval to do so. That approval would "depend on the circumstances," with one important factor being "belief that an attack might be imminent," Fratto said. Appopriate members of Congress would be notified in such a case, he said.', '"The president will listen to the considered judgment of the professionals in the intelligence community and the judgment of the attorney general in terms of the legal consequences of employing a particular technique," he said. "The president will listen to his advisers and make a determination."', "Fratto said waterboarding's use in the past was also approved by the attorney general, meaning it was legal and not torture.", 'Officials fear calling waterboarding torture or illegal could expose government employees to criminal or civil charges or even international war crimes charges.', '"Every enhanced technique that has been used by the Central Intelligence Agency for this program was brought to the Department of Justice and they made a determination that its use under specific circumstances and with safeguards was lawful," Fratto said.', 'Critics say waterboarding has been outlawed under the U.N.\'s Convention Against Torture, which prohibits treatment resulting in long-term physical or mental damage. They also say it should be recognized as banned under the U.S. 2006 Military Commissions Act, which prohibits treatment of terror suspects that is described as "cruel, inhuman and degrading." The act, however, does not explicitly prohibit waterboarding by name.', 'Human Rights Watch, which has been calling on the government to outlaw waterboarding as a form of illegal torture, called Hayden\'s testimony "an explicit admission of criminal activity."', '\t  \t\tPolice arrest principal of India school where 23 children died after eating lunch ']
