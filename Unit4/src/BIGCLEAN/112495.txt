['Lehigh University Professor Michael Behe was the first witness called by a school board that is requiring students to hear a statement about the intelligent design concept in biology class. Lawyers for the Dover Area School Board began presenting their case Monday in the landmark federal trial, which could decide whether intelligent design can be mentioned in public school science classes as an alternative to the theory of evolution.', 'Behe, however, argued that evolution cannot fully explain the biological complexities of life, suggesting the work of an intelligent force.', 'The intelligent design concept does not name the designer, although Behe, a Roman Catholic, testified he personally believes it to be God.', 'Mainstream scientists have rejected intelligent design as scientifically untested and contend that its supporters focus on attacking evolutionary theory rather than providing evidence for design.', 'Behe testified that intelligent design specifically questions whether life at the molecular level evolved through natural selection.', 'The plaintiffs are represented by a team put together by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The school district is being represented by the Thomas More Law Center, a public-interest firm based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that says its mission is to defend the religious freedom of Christians.', '   Copyright 2005 The Associated Press.
