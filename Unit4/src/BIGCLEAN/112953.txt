["The 21st-ranked Creighton Bluejays continue Missouri Valley Conference play when they welcome the Bradley Braves to the CenturyLink Center on Saturday.Greg McDermott's Bluejays were cruising along piling out the victories until a couple of weeks ago, when Creighton dropped back-to-back MVC contests to Wichita State and Drake. The Bluejays have righted the ship somewhat with consecutive wins over Southern Illinois (81-55) and Missouri State (91-77) since, moving to 8-2 in conference play, tied with the Shockers atop the league standings.Geno Ford's Braves are sitting four games over .500 on the season at 13-9. However, Bradley has had a tougher time ascending the MVC standings, as the team is just 5-5 in league play. The majority of the team's success has come at Carver Arena (10 wins), but the road has caused problems, with just three wins in eight true road games this year. The Braves were able to bring an end to a two-game skid with Tuesday's 83-77 win over Illinois State at home.Alt...", 'A pair of Missouri Valley Conference squads heading in opposite directions meet at Koch Arena on Wednesday night, as the 23rd-ranked Wichita State Shockers entertain...', 'The 12th-ranked Creighton Bluejays put their undefeated Missouri Valley Conference record on the line as the Northern Iowa Panthers visit the CenturyLink Center Omah...', 'Once Wichita State got rolling, Bradley was no match for the 20th-ranked Shockers.Nick Wiggins scored 12 points and fueled a 16-0 run in the second half with three 3...', 'The 21st-ranked Creighton Bluejays and the Wichita State Shockers will collide this evening in Missouri Valley Conference action.The Bluejays enter this showdown wit...', 'Knocked down a few of pegs in the latest 25 poll, the Creighton Bluejays now head to Evansville ranked as the 17th- best team in the nation as they clash with the Pu...', 'OUTLOOK: Seven Missouri Valley Conference teams reached the postseason in 2011-12, tying the league mark set in 2009.
