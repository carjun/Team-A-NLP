Three-quarters are white. Eighty-six percent have a high school education or less. Together they make up a blind spot in the nation's health care system.", '"They\'ve been shut out. It\'s too expensive and it\'s incredibly confusing," said David Smith of the advertising agency GMMB, pitching the health law\'s benefits in Washington and Vermont.', "Their confusion might only have been magnified by the administration's surprise announcement recently postponing part of the system that affects businesses. But that change should not affect many individuals. A bigger complication is that in about half the states, Republican governors are declining to cooperate, which will limit the marketing.", 'The states that have been more receptive to the health care overhaul and are further ahead in their planning will receive proportionally more federal money for outreach, advertising and marketing than Republican-led states that have been hostile to the law.', 'AP research from all 50 states shows the amount of government spending will range from a low of 46 cents per capita in Wisconsin, which has ceded responsibility for its health insurance exchange to the federal government, to $9.23 per capita in West Virginia, which opted for a state-federal partnership.', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say.

Grassroots organizers are recruiting their pastors, barbers and mothers and arming them with carefully worded messages. In some neighborhoods, volunteers will go door-to-door.', "The pitch: If you don't make much money, the government can pick up some of the cost of your health insurance. If you can afford a policy, by law you have to get one. People will be directed to healthcare.gov, a government site, for more information.", 'The political stakes for the Obama administration in a big response are high.

"I would love to be able to go in and see a doctor and make sure I\'m OK."', 'In Chicago, the Jayne Agency\'s staff talked to more than 50 patients at an emergency room to hone the best message.
