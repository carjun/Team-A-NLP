', "The new foreclosure data, along with ongoing turmoil in the financial markets, renewed debate in Washington over whether the government has responded adequately to the meltdown of the mortgage market. Caught in the middle are borrowers who may qualify for better terms but remain at risk of losing their homes because they can't refinance their existing mortgages. ", 'Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, D-Conn., urged the administration Tuesday to raise limits on the portfolios of mortgages held by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, federally chartered companies that play a huge role in the housing market.', '"The power exists today with regulators to lift those caps," Dodd told a news conference following the meeting following a meeting with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. "That does not require statutory language or new laws."', 'But Dodd, a Democratic presidential candidate, said Paulson indicated the Treasury was "not likely to move in that direction."', '"I\'m still concerned Treasury does not appreciate the importance of this issue," said Dodd.', 'Earlier, Paulson told CNBC that the Treasury is "talking to a wide variety of participants in that market, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and we\'re thinking through options to reduce the strain in the mortgage market." ', 'Paulson said the turmoil in the credit markets would take time to settle, but stressed that the underlying U.S. economy remains in good shape. ', '"This will play out over time, and liquidity will return to normal when the market has a better understanding, when investors have a better understanding, of the risk return trade-off," Paulson said. ', 'The worry is that a slowdown in the availability of new mortgages could deal yet another blow to a housing industry already suffering its worst downturn in more than a decade.', 'Both of those housing pullbacks sent the U.S. economy into recession. But Soss, among others, believe that the current strength in the U.S. job market, strong consumer spending and a rapidly expanding global economy could limit the impact of the current mortgage mayhem on the broader economy. ', 'A key issue under discussion in Congress is whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be given more leeway to expand their reach in the mortgage market. ', 'As the housing market boomed earlier in the decade and subprime lending took off, these quasi-governmental agencies lost market share to more lenient lenders with easier terms like no money down or little or no documentation. (Along the way, they also lost friends in Congress following disclosure of accounting problems and other issues.)', 'In April, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed spending hundreds of millions of dollars of government funds to help troubled borrowers avoid losing their homes. In May, the House passed a bill that would raise current limits on the size of mortgages that can be insured by the Federal Housing Administration.', 'Though the details of any reform package have yet to be worked out, the turmoil in the mortgage markets has provided momentum to legislation that has been stalled for months. Last week, President Bush indicated general support for giving federal housing agencies enough "flexibility" to help try to avert more foreclosures. ', 'It remains to be seen how far Congress and the White House will go to use taxpayer dollars to help bail out homeowners facing foreclosure. But some see a significant shift in the political wind in the past few weeks.', '"I do smell a federal bailout," said Darda. "We have a Democratically controlled Congress and a Republican president with a disastrous international situation and a plummeting approval rating. So this could be irresistible." ']
