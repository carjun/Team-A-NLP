["FILE - In this July 17, 2013, file photo, Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., center, and Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., right, chairman of the House Education Committee, walk to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote to delay the individual and employer mandates of President Barack Obama's signature health care law, at the Capitol in Washington. It's the 38th time the GOP majority has tried to eliminate, defund or scale back the program since Republicans took control of the House in January 2011. House Republicans feel growing pressure to steer firmly right on some big issues, thanks to changes in primary-election politics that are complicating Congress' ability to solve big problems.

Scott Applewhite, File)", "Independent research supports the belief by these lawmakers that they owe their jobs to increasingly conservative activists, and that it's safer than ever to veer right on many subjects rather than seek compromise with Democrats.", 'On the flip side, House Democrats face a more liberal-leaning electorate in their own primary elections. But the trend is less dramatic for Democrats, whose supporters are more open to compromise to help government work, polls show. And Republican control of the House makes the GOP dynamic more consequential.', "In interviews, House Republicans often cite worries about a possible challenge from the right in their next primary. Many of them represent districts so strongly Republican that it's all but impossible for the party's nominee to lose a general election to a Democrat. Also, these lawmakers say, it's highly unlikely that a moderate Republican can wrest the party's nomination from a conservative incumbent.", '"There aren\'t a whole lot of moderate Republicans who participate in the primary in a conservative district," said Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas.', 'That leaves many House Republicans with only one prerequisite to assure their re-election: Never give a hard-charging conservative enough room on the right to mount a viable challenge in the primary.', "In practice, the task doesn't seem so hard. Only six House Republicans lost their re-election primaries last year. Half of them fell to fellow incumbents in redrawn districts that forced two colleagues to oppose each other. The other three lost to challengers with strong tea party support.", "Rep. Jean Schmidt's loss was instructive. A conservative by almost any measure, the three-term Ohioan was attacked nonetheless for voting to raise the federal debt ceiling and for giving President Barack Obama a peck on the cheek as he entered the House for his 2012 State of the Union address.", '"House members are better at reading their districts than anyone else," said Republican lobbyist and pollster Mike McKenna.', '        President Barack Obama used the Port of Jacksonville as a backdrop for his latest economic policy speech, using an infrastructure project there to illustrate his call for greater investment in similar projects.', "    Boehner whacks King again, says comments make immigration progress 'more difficult'", 'McKenna said it\'s not unusual to discuss immigration reform with House Republicans who say, "I\'m getting emails from people who vote in primaries. They say \'I don\'t care what the Farm Bureau says, I hate this stuff.\'"', 'Rep. John Fleming, R-La., tracks such emails and phone calls. He said his office recently received 80 calls about immigration, "and all of them were against the Senate bill."', "Marchant, the Texas congressman, said he's a lifelong conservative who has watched GOP primary voters in his west-Dallas district lean increasingly to the right. Tea partyers who once cast their votes for Libertarian Party candidates, he said, now are full-fledged Republicans.", '"The mainstream Republicans, as a result, have become more conservative," Marchant said. Tea party activists, he said, "found that they could go into the Republican primary and make a real difference."', 'GOP Rep. Howard Coble, elected to 15 terms from central North Carolina, dates the change in primary voters\' behavior to the mid-1990s. Conservative groups, he said, "were challenging Bob Dole for not being pure enough."', '"That has opened the gates to primary races" against Republican incumbents, Coble said.', 'Voter surveys support the view that Republican voters are becoming more conservative.', 'On average, from 1976 through 1990, 47 percent of people who voted Republican in House races considered themselves conservative, according to exit polls. A slightly smaller share called themselves political moderates.', 'And in the most recent House elections, 2008 through 2012, more than 6 in 10 voters who backed a GOP candidate described themselves as conservative. About a third called themselves moderate.', 'Meanwhile, those who vote for House Democrats have become more liberal. But self-described liberals still comprise less than half of that group. In the pre-Clinton years, 25 percent considered themselves liberal; 33 percent on average did so from 1992 to 2006; and it stands at 40 percent across the last three elections.', '"The socially conservative right has adopted that anti-government, small-government principle, and it\'s largely consolidated," Dimock said.', 'House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, put a positive spin Sunday on what many see as congressional gridlock.', '"We should not be judged by how many new laws we create," Boehner told CBS\'s "Face the Nation." "We ought to be judged on how many laws we repeal."', 'Associated Press Director of Polling Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.', ' Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
