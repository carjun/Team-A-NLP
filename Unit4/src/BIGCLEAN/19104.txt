['Every police officer in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez has been ordered to leave home and stay in a hotel after the killing of five officers by a local drug cartel.

The mayor of Juarez says the attacks carried out since then are a response to police action against drug cartels in the city across from El Paso, Texas.
