["        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'They looked at work from colleagues on sequencing the DNA of ovarian and endometrial tumors. All cancer is caused by mutated DNA, but there are many different mutations in different tumors. They narrowed down the 12 most frequent mutations in each type of tumor.', 'And many were at stage 1, when they are most easily cured. Better yet, the test did not get any "false positives" when they tested Pap tests from 14 women who did not have cancer.', 'Endometrial cancer usually causes early symptoms, such as bleeding. More than 90 percent of women diagnosed with early stage endometrial cancer survive to live five years or more. But ovarian cancer is difficult to detect, says Cara Tenenbaum of the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance.', "It will be years before the researchers can even develop a commercial test The next step will be to try it on hundreds of women, not just the dozens tested for the paper, Diaz says. Women with mutations in the BRCA gene, who have an unusually high risk of ovarian as well as breast cancer, would be prime candidates. They'll also try to improve on its ability to detect ovarian cancer.", 'Women with the precancerous changes can be treated before cervical cancer even develops. Modern tests now also look for HPV, which causes the cells to mutate.', 'Diaz says their new tests costs just $100 and if it were mass produced, it could become much cheaper.', "Experts are now starting to recommend less-frequent Pap screening for many women. Diaz says it's too soon to say if the new test would need to be performed more frequently, but noted that ovarian and endometrial cancers both take years to develop.", 'Diaz says the team did its study using money raised by volunteers, including Swim Across America, a charity that raises money for cancer research. The charity, which has been organizing drives since 1987, raised $300,000 for the work, he said. The non-profit Commonwealth Fund also contributed, he said.']
