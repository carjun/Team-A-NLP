['TisBest.org expects to sell more than 30,000 cards this year. The cards can be loaded with any amount of money between $10 and $5,000. ', 'Charity gift cards take this concept to the next level. You make a charitable donation but the recipient chooses which charity receives it.', 'The company sold 15,000 charity gift cards last year and expects to more than double that this year. The cards can be loaded with any amount of money (to the penny) between $10 and $5,000. Customers can print the card on their computer, have it sent by e-mail or physically delivered. For standard shipping there is no charge.', 'TisBest cards never expire, but there is an up front charge. You pay a 3 percent credit card transaction fee (the same as if you made a donation via credit card directly to a charity) and $1.95 to the company. The charity gets all the rest. On a $50 card, the charity receives $46.55.', 'Charitable contributions were down last year. Many organizations are in desperate need of funds. Anything that encourages more donations is good. And gift cards seem to do that.', 'Most importantly, use the card right away before you lose it or forget about it. Unfortunately, that happens way too often with gift cards of any kind.']
