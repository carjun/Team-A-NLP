['        My brother and I think alike about most financial matters. But when it comes to cars, we take very different roads. I always buy. Stan always leases. ', 'For me, the lease transaction is way too complicated. I also dislike the idea of back-end fees if I drive too many miles or have what the dealer considers to be excess wear and tear. ', 'Like my brother, a lot of people find leasing very attractive. Over the last few years, leasing has made a big comeback. According to Edmunds.com about 18 percent of all cars will leave the lot on a lease this year.', 'With money tight, leasing looks very attractive right now. Those lower monthly payments make it possible for some people to drive a more expensive model than they could afford to buy. By leasing they usually pay more in the long run, but they may not know it.', "Negotiate hard on that capitalized cost, just as you would haggle over the sales price if you were buying the vehicle. Walsh believes a fair capitalized cost is no more than the manufacturers' suggested retail price. Then deduct the down payment (or capitalized cost reduction as they call it), your trade-in and any rebate. ", 'The money factor, which is negotiable, should be competitive with market rates for car loans. You can find online calculators that let you compare rates. Keep this in mind: A dealer is not required to tell you what interest rate you will pay to lease that vehicle. Federal law only requires that information be disclosed with a purchase.']
