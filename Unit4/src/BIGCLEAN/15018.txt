It didn't move overnight and crews were concentrating Monday on surrounding it on ridges thousands of feet up in the San Jacinto Mountains, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Lee Beyer said.", '"It\'s pretty much in the smoldering category right now," Beyer said. "There\'s no moving fire."', 'Thousands of evacuees were allowed back home Sunday as a thunderstorm dumped up to 2 inches of rain on portions of the week-old, 43-square-mile fire.', "About 1,900 firefighters were assigned, down from some 3,300 at the fire's height, and more will be removed as the fight winds down, Beyer said.", '"Light rains are good, heavy rains create mud flows," Beyer said. "Thunderstorms obviously have lightning with them. That\'s always a safety concern when you have people up on those exposed ridges."', 'Some 6,000 people fled the idyllic little towns that dot the San Jacinto Mountains between Palm Springs and Hemet after the fire broke out July 15 and quickly raged across the heavily wooded area. Twenty-three structures, including the seven homes, were destroyed.
