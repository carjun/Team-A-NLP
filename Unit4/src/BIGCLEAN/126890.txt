['        One of the most obnoxious and deceptive marketing campaigns I have ever seen is taking place right now. It uses postcards, letters, and phone calls to sell outrageously priced extended warranties.', 'The postcards are annoying enough. Now there are constant phone calls trying to sell her an extended warranty. Wolfe received five calls in one day.', 'Even worse, these sales calls are on her cell phone, a number she considers so private only family and a few friends have it. Federal regulations prohibit sales calls like these to cell phones.', 'These sales calls are going out at all hours of the day and night. I have spoken to a number of people who had their phones ring at 4 a.m., a clear violation of federal regulations that prohibit sales calls before 8:00 a.m. local time.', 'The bulk of the companies doing this are located near St. Louis. The Better Business Bureau of Eastern Missouri and Southern Illinois lists 92 extended warranty companies in that area. They are responsible for a huge number of complaints from across the country.', 'Many of the complaints deal with deceptive advertising and high-pressure sales tactics. Unhappy customers say they could not cancel and get a refund as the salesperson promised on the phone.', 'Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon is now investigating many of the companies selling these warranties in his state. We should know in a few weeks if his office decides to take any legal action.', 'Needless to say, I did not buy anything. Instead, I called back and identified myself as a reporter, but no one would talk to me.', 'Like most consumer advocates, Robert Krughoff, president of checkbook.org, advises car owners to skip extended warranties because they are rarely worth the money. He is appalled at the idea of buying one this way.']
