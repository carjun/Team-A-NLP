['A prolific writer, director and producer in the 1980s and early 1990s, John Hughes was the guiding force behind some of the most popular teen-oriented comedies of the period, including "National Lampoon\'s Vacation" (1983), "Sixteen Candles" (1984), "The Breakfast Club" (1985) and "Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off" (1986). Though his stock in trade was broad, he had a particular gift for the speech and emotions of middle-class suburban youth, who were portrayed in his films with a complexity and respect rarely afforded to them in major Hollywood features. Hughes\' popularity appeared to fall off after the blockbuster holiday hit "Home Alone" (1990), though he remained active as a screenwriter, often under his pen name of Edmond Dantes. His films were frequently cited as a major influence on writers and directors who toiled in the teen movie field.Born John Hughes, Jr. in Lansing, MI on January 18, 1950, Hughes was raised in the suburbs of Detroit but moved to Chicago, IL in his early teens.
