['Mike Dillon, who has been fighting in court to save his Manchester, N.H., home since 2002.', 'After the company servicing his mortgage failed to properly credit monthly payments to his account, it placed the loan in default. As he worked to straighten out the bookkeeping, with canceled checks in hand, the servicer began adding additional fees for property inspections, insurance and other charges.', '        Has the market volatility got you nervous? These cartoons may give you a little comic relief.', 'Five years later, Dillon is still in court trying to resolve the dispute. While he is no longer under threat of foreclosure, he is still fighting to get clear title to his home.', 'Three years after the housing bubble collapsed under the weight of lax mortgage underwriting, some 5.5 million families have lost their homes or are in the process of losing their homes to foreclosure. Estimates vary, but analysts say there are at least that many more foreclosures likely before the wave subsides.', 'Almost everyone involved agrees the the foreclosure mess will likely take years more to resolve, potentially postponing any meaningful economic recovery.', 'Federal, state and local governments have launched multiple programs to help head off foreclosures, but most have fallen far short of their goals. The largest, by far, has been the federal Home Affordable Modification Program that was created as part of the $700 billion banking industry bailout. When the HAMP program was launched in March, 2009, some $50 billion set aside from the bailout fund to help homeowners. ', "Since then just $600 million - or 1 percent - has been spent, according to a report released Monday by the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. That report sharply criticized both the HAMP program and the Treasury Department's implementation of it: ", 'The housing finance food chain, which during the boom created more than $1 trillion worth of bonds backed by mortgages, is also under strain as investors challenge the paper trail that leads back to losses on defaulted loans. One critical link in that chain is a system set up to speed the process of securitizing mortgages known as the MERS, or Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems. Lawyers in several states have challenged the legal validity of mortgage transfers made by that system, which bypassed the traditional system of records in local government land offices. MERS manages some 65 million mortgages.', 'Now, foreclosures are sweeping up a broad swath of homeowners. many of whom have simply fallen victim to the tough economy. About 30 percent of homeowners with mortgages have less than 5 percent equity, including many who are underwater, or owe more than their house is worth. If home prices continue falling, that puts roughly $650 billion worth of outstanding mortgages at risk, according to Brian Maillian, founder and CEO of Whitestone Capital.']
