['"This new type is resulting in a greater number of hurricanes with greater frequency and more potential to make landfall," says study co-author Peter Webster of Georgia Tech\'s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.', 'Scientists aren\'t sure whether the cycle is natural or man-made: "It\'s difficult to differentiate between natural signals and global warming," Webster says. The frequency of the central Pacific warming does appear to be increasing, especially since 1990. ', '"This opens up a whole new area of research," says Greg Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who was not part of the study but did write an accompanying commentary in Science. "Separating these two warm modes may thus lead to a useful improvement in seasonal Atlantic tropical cyclone prediction," he wrote.', 'As for this year, "it looks like it might be a hybrid," Webster told the Associated Press, with warming starting in the east and then moving west, possibly meaning more hurricanes late in the season. ', 'In May, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be nine to 14 named storms in the Atlantic this year, of which four to seven could become hurricanes, including one to three major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5).', 'The study was led by Webster, Hye-Mi Kim and Judith Curry, all of Georgia Tech. The team used satellite data along with historical tropical storm records and climate models in their research.']
