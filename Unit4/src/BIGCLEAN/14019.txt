Abc's clayton sandell shows us what the weather and climate are doing and what it's costing us. Reporter: This tornado spotted near dix, nebraska. Just part of a weather juggernaut today pounding the plains and midwest. In minnesota, 60-mile-an-hour winds flipped big rigs. And were powerful enough to destroy a trailer in south dakota, killing a woman inside. In boscobell, wisconsin, eight inches of rain flooded half the town. Today, as fires continue ravaging the west, there's not enough rain. Thousands of firefighters plus a fleet of aircraft are growiadding to the growing cost of weather disasters. In 1980, $58 billion. By last year? Extreme weather and climate costs nearly doubled to $110 billion. 377 people were killed. Hurricane sandy's tab? 65 billion. Drought and heat waves, another $30 billion. Fighting the black forest fire here in colorado has already cost more than $10 million. And that doesn't even count the cost of more than 500 homes that burned to the ground. Scientists say human-caused climate change is already helping shift the planet's natural balance. Creating more heat waves, drought, and intense downpours. A stormy and expensive reality, that's already on our doorsteps. Clayton sandell, abc news, colorado springs.
