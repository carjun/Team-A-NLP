["A deepening slowdown is challenging Chinese leaders' determination to stick with painful economic reforms they say will deliver more sustainable growth in the long run.", "The latest gloomy data point: A manufacturing survey released Wednesday showed this month's activity fell to an 11-month low.", 'Communist leaders are trying to make China more like developed economies that are powered by domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports and investment. Advisers including the World Bank say that is the right path to keep incomes rising even if it causes growth to slow in the near term.', 'Beijing has resisted calls to stimulate the economy, which would require a new round of government-led investment that would set back their reforms. But they face mounting pressure after growth fell to a two-decade low in the latest quarter, raising the risk of politically dangerous job losses.', '"The tolerance of slower growth is not unlimited," said JP Morgan economist Haibin Zhu in a report.', "The trigger for possible action, say analysts, will be jobs and whether the economy is creating enough of them. Steadily rising living standards help to underpin the Communist Party's monopoly on power and the country's unelected leaders worry unemployment might stir unrest. They express confidence but face forecasts that hiring will tumble as the economy cools.", 'News reports Tuesday that Premier Li Keqiang, China\'s top economic official, said this year\'s "bottom line" for growth is 7 percent stirred hopes Beijing might be planning at least a limited stimulus.', "A drumbeat of data show growth in China's retail sales, factory output and other segments of the economy not just slowing but falling below already conservative forecasts.", "June exports were forecast to grow by low single digits but instead fell 3.1 percent from a year earlier. Retail sales growth failed to meet the government's own projection. Economic growth of 7.5 percent in the three months ending in June was the fifth straight quarter below 8 percent.", "Forecasters say growth could dip below 7 percent in coming quarters. That is far above the low single digits forecast for the United States, Europe and Japan, but below China's double-digit rates of the past decade, which peaked above 14 percent in 2009.", 'That decline is forcing painful change, wiping out jobs in construction and other industries that depend on high growth to drive demand for new factories and other assets.', 'The quickest way to pump money into the economy is through higher spending on building subways and other public works.', "The government has repeatedly used such spending to power its way out of downturns. A giant version of that helped China rebound quickly from the 2008 global crisis. But it came at a price, sharply raising China's overall debt levels and fueling concern state banks might be hit by defaults after they lent heavily to finance stimulus projects.", "Li warned in May that such stimulus spending was losing its effectiveness. He said achieving the ruling party's growth targets this year would depend on pushing ahead with market-oriented reforms, though no major changes are expected until after a Communist Party congress in the autumn.", "The ruling party's plans call for encouraging consumer spending and service businesses such as entertainment and tourism. They are cleaner and create more jobs than investment-intensive steel production and other heavy industry.", 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
