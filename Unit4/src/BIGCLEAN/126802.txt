['        Shopping for a used car is always risky. You never really know what happened to that vehicle before it went on the lot. Was it wrecked? Was it underwater in a flood? Was it totaled by the insurance company, then sold at auction and put back together again?', 'Sixteen years ago, Congress ordered the Department of Justice to create a computerized database consumers could use to get this important information. Believe it or not, that system finally went on line last week.', 'If it ever becomes fully operational, NMVTIS will have title information from every state motor vehicle department. Salvage yards and insurance companies will also be required to report monthly on all junk vehicles.', 'Before you buy any used car, do a database search. Start with the new National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, which is $2.50 per vehicle. You should also check the National Insurance Crime Bureau site. These reports are free. Then if you want, check with CarFax or AutoCheck. Each system collects information from difference sources, so you may get different results. Often times, you can get the dealer to run a CarFax or AutoCheck report for you for free.']
