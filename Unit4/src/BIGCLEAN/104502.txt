['  Stacy Jupiter / WCS    Reef sharks, such as the grey reef shark pictured here, are thriving in Fiji\'s protected waters according to a 2013 study.          In Fiji\'s largest marine reserve, shark populations are benefiting from  "no-take" protections that keep their food supply steady, according to a new  study.Compared with waters where fishing is allowed, there are up to four times as  many reef sharks in a protected zone called the Namena Reserve, researchers  say.This 23-square-mile (60 square kilometers) reserve was designated in 1997 off  the southern coast of Vanua Levu, Fiji\'s second-largest island. For three weeks  in July 2009, researchers used underwater video cameras to survey sharks at eight sites  within Namena and eight sites outside the reserve.Hour-long clips from all 16 locations captured images of five different  species: grey reef sharks, whitetips, blacktips, silvertips and zebra sharks. By  analyzing this footage, researchers found that shark abundance and biomass in  the protected zone was twice as great at shallow sites and four times as great  at deep sites, compared with similar spots just outside of the reserve.

Since sharks have  slow growth and reproductive rates, it can be difficult for their populations to  bounce back from big losses and unsustainable hunting practices. A study  published earlier this year estimated that 100  million sharks are killed by fisheries each year.In Fiji, tradition has kept shark harvesting in check. Many people in the  island nation consider sharks to be sacred and see eating the predators as  taboo, according to researchers with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) who  worked on the new study. Within the Namena Reserve, sharks likely are thriving  because restrictions on fishing make their prey plentiful, the researchers  say."The news from Fiji gives us solid proof that marine reserves can have  positive effects on reef shark populations," Caleb McClennen, director of WCS\'s  Marine Program, said in a statement last week. "Shark populations are declining  worldwide due to the demand for shark products, particularly fins for the Asian  markets. We need to establish management strategies that will protect these  ancient predators and the ecosystems they inhabit."Sharks in Fiji may still be vulnerable to foreign fishing fleets, the  researchers warn, and local communities may be driven to hunt the venerated  animals as prices for shark parts increase. According to the World Wildlife  Fund, a shark\'s fin can sell for up to $135 per kilogram (about 2 pounds) in Hong  Kong.There has been a recent international push to protect the apex predators. At  the meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of  Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), conservationists voted to regulate  the trade of several shark species that are targeted for their fins.The study on the Namena Reserve was published online in the journal Coral  Reefs.Follow Megan Gannon on Twitter and Google+.Follow OurAmazingPlanet @OAPlanet, Facebook and Google+.
