(Ted Fitzgerald/Boston Herald via AP Photo)', 'A judge rescheduled a probable cause hearing for former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez to give prosecutors more time to present evidence to a grand jury in their murder case against him.', 'Hernandez was in court Wednesday for what was supposed to be a probable cause hearing, but prosecutors said the grand jury is still considering the evidence against him.', "Judge Daniel O'Shea considered defense objections to a delay but decided to reschedule the hearing for Aug. 22. Hernandez will continue to be held without bail until then.", "Also Wednesday, O'Shea ruled in favor of media organizations, including The Associated Press, that were seeking access to more documents in the case, including two arrest warrants, additional search warrants and other materials. The records will be released at 3 p.m. Thursday if no one appeals.", 'Defense attorney James Sultan objected to the documents\' unsealing, saying he understood the media\'s "insatiable appetite" but that the release of records is undermining Hernandez\'s right to a fair trial.', "Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the death of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old Boston semi-professional football player whose body was found June 17 in an industrial park near Hernandez's home. He had been shot five times.", "Additional evidence includes boxes of ammunition found at a condominium Hernandez leased and a magazine for a .45-caliber Glock in a Hummer registered to him, said Bristol County Assistant District Attorney William McCauley. Authorities say Lloyd was killed with a .45-caliber gun, though it apparently has not been recovered. McCauley said an ammunition box had Hernandez's fingerprints on it.", 'Sultan said his client has already been jailed for four weeks and that the district attorney could have waited to bring charges, but chose to go ahead last month.', 'Outside court, another of Hernandez\'s attorneys, Charles Rankin, said he was "extremely disappointed" that prosecutors weren\'t prepared to go forward and that he\'s confident Hernandez will be exonerated.', "Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub a few days earlier.", 'Hernandez was kicked off the team within hours of his arrest. New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick broke his silence Wednesday, saying the Patriots will learn from "this terrible experience," and that it\'s time for New England to move forward.', '"We\'ll continue to evaluate the way that we do things, the way that we evaluate our players and we\'ll do it on a regular basis," Belichick said. "I\'m not perfect on that, but I always do what I think is best for the football team."', 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
