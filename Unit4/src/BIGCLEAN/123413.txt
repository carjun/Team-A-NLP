What we learned raises the inescapable question: could it -- should it -- have been stopped? Our investigation begins in the hours just before the shooting broke out.', "On Friday, Feb. 12, nursing student Chantai Simms attended Dr. Bishop's first class of the day at 10:20a.m.: Anatomy and Physiology.", "CHANTAI SIMMS: Thinking back about it, I don't see anything different. She seemed the same. ", "Dr. Bishop's next class, Neuroscience, started at 11:30. And by now, student Rena Webb thought her professor was acting strange. ", "RENA WEBB: I didn't know if she was depressed or what her situation was. I don't know. Because she just wasn't her happy, normal self. ", "And Rena, who usually sat in the classroom's front row, noticed something else in Dr. Bishop's tote bag.", 'RENA WEBB: And I saw the outline of a cylinder in the bag at the bottom of the bag.

Anderson says he drove his wife back to campus that afternoon, dropping her off just before 3 p.m. so she could attend a faculty meeting. He was later asked about it on the fly.', "JIM ANDERSON: Nothing. Just a meeting. She's just got to go there, put in her time and then come home. I was going to pick her up and get a coffee.", 'In a conference room identical to this one, on the floor above me, thirteen people from the biology department sat elbow to elbow around the conference table. Amy Bishop took a seat closest to the door. They talked about the next school year. Then the meeting started to wrap up. ', "MORIARITY: It's very near the end. I had to look down to write something up and I heard a loud -- a bang, a gunshot. And looked up and Amy was standing there with a gun and shooting.

Her eyes and her expression, it was completely different than anything I had ever seen.

Local police aren't talking, but Dr. Williams says right after the shootings, police ran a background check on Bishop and her record was clean. ", "PRESIDENT WILLIAMS: The Huntsville police actually did a criminal background check. And nothing came up. So, even had we done such a check back in 2003, one would presume also that the same results would've happened. ", "So what happened at UAH that apparently caused her to snap? Well, for one thing, anybody who knew Dr. Amy Bishop will tell you that in the last several years she'd been increasingly obsessed over one thing: tenure. ", "Tenure is the holy grail for any professor. Landing a tenured position at a university means you'll have a guaranteed job and a stable salary until you retire. And as the major breadwinner in her family, Amy Bishop certainly felt the pressure to get tenure at a school. She'd had five years to earn it at UAH, and the clock was now starting to run out.", "Like many universities, UAH first considers a professor's teaching abilities. Some of Dr. Bishop's students we spoke to liked her.", "RENA WEBB: She'd always have a big smile on her face coming into class. Very sweet, very open. ", 'CHANTAI SIMMS: Personally, I always thought she was, like, a really brilliant lady. ', "But other students didn't appreciate her. What they saw as her bizarre tangents. Her superior air. Some reportedly even signed a petition against her. ", "But the university also evaluates tenure candidates on the research coming out of their lab, and in that arena Dr. Bishop seemed to be shining. She and her husband had developed an automated incubator to keep fragile cells alive long enough to study. The invention landed Dr. Bishop on the cover of a local technology review and the school's president crowed about the innovation. ", "But in March 2009, after a year-long review of her candidacy, Amy Bishop was denied tenure. The reasons haven't been made public, but UAH president Dr. David Williams stands by the decision. ", 'WILLIAMS: Let me say that going to the bottom line, her tenure dossier, after extensive evaluation at all levels, simply did not meet the criteria that this university has for tenure. ', "Was the denial of Amy Bishop's tenure the key to the killings at UAH? Did she know that at least one of the professors in that conference room had voted against her in the tenure process? Had she been so enraged that she snapped in a way she never had before? Or was there more to the story? ", "There was a lot more indeed as we learned when we delved further into Dr. Bishop's past.", 'Two weeks after the shootings at the University of Alabama Huntsville that left three dead and three injured, the school sent Amy Bishop a terse letter firing her.

In 1986, she was a biology major in college at Northeastern University, where fellow student Isabel Gomes remembers an overriding personality trait. Amy was so painfully shy she was almost invisible. ', "ISABEL GOMES: She just didn't interact with people. She didn't build any bonds at all. At all. And so, she became really easily forgettable, I think, and unnoticeable and unknowable. ", 'But Isabel says Amy found one place she could fit in, one academic field that made her feel at home in the world: science. ', 'ISABEL GOMES: I think that science was the one little slice of society where she actually thought and felt that she fit in. She had found a place where she was visible, a place where people would listen to her, a place where she felt comfortable talking about something, and that was science.', 'After college, Amy Bishop dedicated her life full-time to science, earning a PhD in genetics from Harvard in 1993.

According to police, she flew into an profanity-riddled tirade, announcing "I am Dr. Amy Bishop!" and punching the woman in the head. Bishop was charged with assault and battery. She was put on probation for six months, and then the case was dismissed -- so her name never went into the national criminal record database. ', 'KERR: Punching people at IHOP for the booster seat.

And went into her parents' bedroom to retrieve the powerful, 12-gauge pump-action firearm used for everything from home protection to hunting.

Minutes later, Pettigrew says, he saw Braintree police confront the girl on the street. ', 'PETTIGREW: They\'re like all surrounded her. "Drop the gun. Drop the gun. Drop the gun." And it\'s like an easy 90 second standoff.', 'Only after another officer got the drop on her from behind did Amy Bishop put the gun down. ', 'Even though Tom Pettigrew told all this to a Braintree patrolman at the time, nothing came of it. Amy Bishop was never charged with an offense for brandishing a gun or resisting arrest. But she reportedly was almost booked the afternoon she shot Seth--before something very unusual went down at the station.

Would we be trying to go for the murder? Or do we want to go for maybe manslaughter? And we never got much far, much beyond that. ', "That's because the booking process was stopped, much to the surprise of everyone in the room. Brady says while he was in the booking room with the other officers, somehow Judy Bishop must have used a phone to call the chief, John Polio.

I think probably in most cases, people would simply set the gun down and go for help to unload it, rather than to carry it to someone.', "It's just one of the things that makes no sense to anyone about what happened that day in Braintree, Mass., back in 1986.

", "Congressman: Unfortunately, the second breakdown was compounded by trooper Howe not acting as he should as a state police officer. If you're conducting an investigation or you're responsible for conducting an investigation, you go to the police station, which he didn't do, you go to the autopsy, which he didn't do. It's really not about the reports as much as it is about the fact that he's responsible to conduct an investigation.
