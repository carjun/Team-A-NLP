['Ad opportunity: 1280px x 90px banner filling the bottom of the page that collapses into a small banner ad that hovers on the left side of the screen and remains there unless the user clicks off, or opts to expand it again. The unit essentially operates like an OPA pushdown: start in a closed (collapsed) state, expand, and then retract to collapsed state once again.', "Placement: Approved to run on story pages and section fronts pending site approval. Will be sold on an impression basis. Occupies bottom of page and begins upon page entry. Creative in expanded state should be centered so that it's aligned with site content.", 'Dimensions: Expanded= 1280px x 90px with a 20px gradient transparency; Leave Behind= 100px x 90px.', 'Frequency Cap: 1 ad every 8 hours per user; subsequent expansion effects are user-initiated by clicking. Capping should be accounted for and provided in one tag.', 'Close Button: Close buttons must be present and clearly defined at all times, the "close" button MUST include the word "CLOSE" in visible bold letters and should include a large BOLD X, also aligned with the right rai.', 'Video Duration: 30 seconds max for host-initiated video. If video is user-initiated can play up to 2 minutes max.', 'Video Controls: Must contain toggles for Play/Pause and Audio On/Off; video is click to expand/play', 'Hover Ad colors should always contrast with the overall theme of the site. Cannot mimic any site experience, pages, designs, graphics, or logos.', 'The top edge of the unit should have either some level of transparency or a jagged edge, so there is a clear delineation between the ad and editorial content.', '**Please note that IE6 is not a supported browser for IB Hover Ads - campaign will need to be targeted away.']
