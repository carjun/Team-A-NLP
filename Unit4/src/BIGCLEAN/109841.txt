['Attorneys for Colorado theater shooting suspect James Holmes say detectives "peppered" him with questions like, "Is there anything we should know about?" before he was read his rights.', 'They say in court documents filed Wednesday that something could be inferred about his mental state from the responses, so his answers should be suppressed.', 'Prosecutors have said officers asked certain questions to protect public safety, not as an interrogation.', "Court documents say Holmes also asked about a sign at the police station. Details haven't been publicly disclosed.", "Defense attorneys say Holmes' question shouldn't be allowed at trial because he spoke after asking for an attorney and after a detective told Holmes to ask if he had questions, which they contend provoked Holmes to speak.
