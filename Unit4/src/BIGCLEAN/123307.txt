', 'And when Christopher Rockefeller burst onto the scene, the new money wannabes were thrilled to be rubbing elbows with an old money name.', 'The young Rockefeller soon became a magnet for the social and financial ambitions of many in the Hamptons.', 'The conversation invariably turned to money and whether he had any money making tips for his guests. Christopher had plenty, and even offered his dinner partners a great investment deal. ', 'Mike Taibbi, Dateline correspondent: And when would your fiance and you get this $500,000?', 'Corrine bought in too. Christopher also promised millions to a real estate agent who showed him a $9 million oceanfront estate in the Hamptons. The realtor was so impressed she gave the French Rockefeller $100,000 of her own savings to invest. ', 'And so he swept through the Hamptons like the hottest fashion of the season: a Rockefeller promising a golden end to the summer for the chosen few. ', 'Then, by Labor day weekend, as quickly as Christopher Rockefeller had descended on the Hamptons, he was gone.', 'When he disappeared from the Hamptons in that fall of 2000, no one had any idea that Christopher Rockefeller had also once been a social magnet in Los Angeles in the late 1990s. Unlike the Hamptons, where Christopher made friends with new money stock brokers and other graspers hungry for a quick score.', 'In Los Angeles, Tinsel town, after all, he surrounded himself with a coterie of well known names and faces.', 'She says Christopher told her he would lend his obvious stature and business genius to the venture...', '"Maria": He said that he was here in the States investing in some serious film projects.', 'The boutique would be located on glitzy Rodeo drive, just around the corner from where Christopher kept a three bedroom suite at $15,000/a week.', 'Det.

', 'And so after a month of Asian indulgence, even thought Christopher knew Det. Mueller was on his tail, he made a brazen move: Christopher returned to L.A. and even called Mueller to taunt him.', 'And so it was in the summer of 2000, while he was on the run from the law in L.A. that Christopher arrived in the Hamptons. It was for this limited-run performance that he borrowed the name Christopher Rockefeller, a Rockefeller who ended up conning all those Hamptonites. It also turns out his game almost ended there too, when he was thrown in jail for not paying a $20,000-hotel bill.', 'East Hampton police Sgt. Margaret Dunn and, her partner, Lt. Jerry Larsen got the case.', 'Det. Margaret Dunne: He had posted his $45,000 bail, and he fled. That was the last we saw of him.', 'Det. George Mueller, Los Angeles police: The games not done, he still wants to play that game... and he needs that, he thrives on that, and he wants it.', 'It was April, 2001, eight months after he ducked out of the Hamptons that Christopher defrauded an elderly couple of at least $100,000 in a real estate deal.

', 'At the time, we pressed her about what she did know about her con man husband...', 'Taibbi: When you married Christopher, were you absolutely confident that you knew enough about this man?', 'But Pia learned early on that life with Christopher could change in a heartbeat. Just four months after meeting, they went to Las Vegas, where they did not leave the tables as winners. ', "Taibbi: So you thought it was possible, that this guy that you'd fallen in love with, that he could be flush one day and flat broke, 31 cents, to his name the next? ", "Reyes: Yeah, that's it. But like I said, he has ambition and, you know, he can make money.", "That he could. Unbelievably, a few months later they were living in Beverly Hills, and they weren't down and out. Christopher had paid cash up front for a 3-bedroom suite in the lushest hotel in the city, the Regent Beverly Wilshire. ", 'She bore him a son named Zeus, but says that throughout their 8-year marriage, she asked few questions.', 'His sentence was 5 years in prison and court-ordered restitution of $1.2 million dollars to the few victims who came forward. ', 'So now he was home, the city of lights, and not incidentally the scene of some of his earliest crimes.

', "Taibbi: The most painful thing in your life is not having a father or mother of your own. That's the most painful thing for you. And yet because of the choices you made, the way you lived your life, your son, has been deprived of his father. ", "Rocancourt: --yeah, it's why I feel where the failure is. That failure. There's a failure. There's no question about it. ", "But a lot of questions remain about his early years.

', "Christopher Rocancourt: To be in Cannes is nothing-- [no] big deal. It's just a bit funny that it would be with Naomi. ", 'Since his return to France two years ago, Rocancourt has become a big celebrity, and Cannes was just one of the subjects Christopher was all too happy to talk about last week in Paris. ', "But the orphan-playboy millionaire-conman was not just another storyline for the tabloids as Naomi Campbell's escort. ", 'Far from being just a supermodel accessory, Christopher was in Cannes to launch a new role in his life: believe it or not, as a movie actor. ', "Rocancourt: It's great to be an actor because you can dream. You can fly. So that I like. You can be somebody else for the fun of it. ", 'Which pretty much sums up his life story, as long as you include money in the motivational mix. ', 'Two years ago, we could barely contain our skepticism when he first told us he wanted to act, but a well known French director matched him up with his co-star and red carpet partner Naomi Campbell in a movie called "Bad Love."

", "Det. Mueller: It's pretty sad that people look at him as, if you want to call it famous or infamous. But at the end of the day he really hurt a lot of people's lives and took a lot of money from them, and he will go back to those ways. ", "Mueller predicted two years ago that Rocancourt would eventually go back to a life of crime. It seems it hasn't happened so far. ", 'But Mueller says that in the big picture while Christopher may be making money now, crime, for him, did not pay. ', "Det. Mueller: He went to jail. He was on the run. And, you know, it's always look over your shoulder and always wonder who's gonna come after you, whether it's the police or that victim, that you ruined their life. In this case, Christopher, crime does not pay. ", "And while Rocancourt's business life has been a success, his private life has not. ", "But Rocancourt has never been much of a stay-at-home dad. And while he complains about the loss of privacy now that he's bold face name in France, a day in the life of Christopher Rocancourt is hardly an attempt to stay out of the public eye.

', 'And after this visit, he says he thought about another career once the acting roles dry up, although he might be conning us again. ', "Det. Mueller: He's always been a liar. He's always been a cheater. But if Christopher goes into politics and he runs for office, wherever that may be, well, I think that's gonna be a sad day.
