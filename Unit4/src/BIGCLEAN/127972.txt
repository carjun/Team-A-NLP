['Connie Siskowski holds an old photograph of her, her brother and their grandfather at the Jersey Shore. Siskowski was in her early teens when her grandfather fell ill and she had to become his primary caregiver. Today, she is helping other young people who have to take care of an ill, disabled or aging family member.']
