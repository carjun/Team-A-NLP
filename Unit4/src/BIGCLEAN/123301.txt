['                    There is a certain high school, in a small city in the heart of America, where a ...', 'In the 4th grade, Billy and his family moved here to Fayetteville, Arkansas, a growing city popular for its good schools.', "Billy was a bright kid, but he had trouble reading or concentrating. He was distractible, zoned out sometimes. There was no hint in his records of any behavioral problems, though sometimes, said a teacher, he didn't seem to pick up on social clues very well. Playable is the way his father Curt put it; ripe for teasing.", 'Keith Morrison: If they kicked you would you, what, run after them and try to kick them back?', "It was 2004, he was in the 7th grade, when the trouble burst into view. At least, for Billy's parents.", 'Penney Wolfe: It was a phone call. A childish sort of prank. A classmate called and offered, graphically, to sell Billy a sex toy.', "Penney had to make a decision so many parents have had to make - to get involved or not. She called the boy's mother.", 'Penney Wolfe: Yeah. (laughter) I was like, "No. This is not right and he\'s not going to do this again.', "Penney's telephone call would be the beginning of a campaign she felt she had to wage.", 'A police report was filed, but, the Wolfes say, at least one of the assailants remained in school, unpunished.', "Keith Morrison: I can't imagine what that must be like, to open up Facebook and see a page like that. Humiliating.", 'Once again, Penney said she went to a school administrator - this time asking for help in reining in the cyber-bullies.', "Keith Morrison: Can you give me a kind of a laundry list of the rumors you've heard?", "Worse still, says Billy, kids continued to pick fights with him. But now the Wolfes were done. They're also considering a lawsuit against the Fayetteville school district.", "In March, Billy's parents sued one of the alleged bullies, and other as-of-yet unnamed conspirators for unspecified damages - charging them with assaulting and battering Billy. ", 'Were they right to take it national - to the New York Times, and then our own TODAY show?', "Sixteen-year-old Billy Wolfe admits he's not perfect, but says he's been relentlessly bullied over the past 4 years: half a dozen severe beatings, some captured on camera. Some others painful in a different way. Shouldn't a parent intervene?", "Male student: They say he tries to pick fights with people, but I don't know him. I don't know if he does.", "But in situations like this, there often so much innuendo, miscommunication and speculation that poisons the air - often making it difficult to prove who's right or wrong.", 'Will told us he was in a school hallway one day last year, just minding his own business, when Billy started an altercation.', '"Haha, who said I was gonna touch him?" he writes. "Haha, nah, I got people that are gonna do it 4 me."', 'Ian: I kind of enjoyed it for the first week or two, \'cause people were so like, "Hey, you beat up Billy." ', "Will: If you had someone not leave you alone and you couldn't get away from 'em, what would you do?", "KeithMorrison: I'm trying to think? Would I hit 'em in the face? Do you think I should?", "Will's mom: I'm not on the computer so I'm not a computer person, so I don't know what's goin' on.", "KeithMorrison: You're mad at this kid, huh? Kid s-- starts comin' up and shovin' you for sayin' nothing, I mean-- ", "Will's mom: If he is instigating all these fights, does he think he can instigate it and upset people and get away with it?", "Perhaps the one Billy's most mad at is his neighbor and former best friend. Billy and Dylan Gray, who has cerebral palsy, were practically inseparable once. And then, sometime in middle school, their friendship suddenly turned quite sour.", 'Keith Morrison: Once he and the students started getting into it, he began to pick on you?', 'In fact, it turns out that the infamous "every one that hates Billy Wolfe" Web page originated out of Dylan\'s house - though Dylan claims it was his friends who created it.', "Keith: Do you ever think to yourself that maybe he's been used as a punching bag a bit too much?", "Dylan: I don't know all- every incident that happened with him- but in my opinion, he deserved it."]
