["The drafting of Egypt's constitution was one of the most divisive issues during Morsi's rule. The charter was drafted by an Islamist-dominated assembly after liberals walked out twice, complaining that the Brotherhood and its allies were dictating the process. Protests over the constitution and the direction of the country turned deadly after Morsi issued temporary decrees in late November that put himself and the drafting committee above judicial oversight. The charter was then finalized in a rushed overnight session and passed in a referendum.", "Now that Morsi is gone, many of Egypt's liberals want to remove broadly worded articles introduced by Islamists that give Shariah, or Islamic law, greater weight. But there has been pushback from the ultraconservative Nour Party that backed the military coup.", 'A senior Nour official, Ashraf Thabit, said the party opposes any plans to amend the so-called "identity" articles in the suspended constitution which mainly states that legislation is based on Islamic Shariah law. The constitution under longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak also stipulated that legislation is derived from Shariah.', "The Salafi Nour Party has come under heavy criticism from fellow conservative Islamists for turning against Morsi, especially after authorities shut-down ultraconservative TV networks that promoted their Salafi brand of Islam. The Muslim Brotherhood's Misr 25 TV was also shut down.", "The crackdown on Islamists has been met with an escalation in violence in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula as militants, long active in the area, have intensified their attacks against security forces since the ouster of Morsi.", 'On Sunday, three policemen were killed by sniper fire, according to a security official. The coordinated attacks killed police guarding an administrative building, a TV station and a police station in El-Arish, the main city in northern Sinai near the border with Gaza and Israel, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters.', "Sunday's deaths push to 13 the number of policemen killed in Sinai since Morsi's ouster.", 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
