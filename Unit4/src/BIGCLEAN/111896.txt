["An ancient beast related to today's Arctic-loving beluga whales and narwhals seemed to prefer toasty, tropical waters.Called Bohaskaia monodontoides, the new species of toothed whale lived some 3 million to 4 million years ago during the Pliocene in warm water. Researchers aren't sure why modern belugas have left these tropical destinations and strayed pole-ward, where life would seem to be more difficult.The fossil had been sitting in the collections of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History since its discovery in a mine near Hampton, Va., in 1969. The nearly complete skull represents the only fossilized remains known of the new species. Before it was closely examined, the skull's discoverers loosely identified it as a beluga whale and left it in storage.In 2010, Jorge Velez-Juarbe, Smithsonian pre-doctoral fellow from Howard University, finally took a close look at the skull. He compared it with the skulls of closely related toothed whales, like modern Arctic belugas an...", 'Marine mammal specialists from across the country have descended on an Alaska aquarium to help care for a baby beluga whale that became separated from its mother sho...', 'Stars snarling at each other, mate-swapping, dominant males posturing and establishing their territory.It\'s not quite the "Jersey Shore," but these are among the hig...', 'A young beluga whale whose carcass was found in a river nearly 1,000 miles from its natural ocean habitat probably died last fall and remained in the frozen river al...', 'A young beluga whale ( search ) that apparently took a wrong turn and wound up in the Delaware River ( search ), 80 miles from the open sea, appeared to be making it...', 'Gasper, Beluga Whale  Saved From Mexican Amusement Park, in Grave Condition in Atlanta', 'A beluga whale saved a drowning diver by hoisting her to the surface, carrying her leg in its mouth.Terrified Yang Yun thought she was going to die when her legs wer...', 'Raw video: Scientists unveil sound of what they claim is a  beluga whale  imitating a human voice', 'A baby beluga whale born at the end of August is starting to shed its slate-colored skin for the more mature creamy-white covering, and the baby is a "she," aquarium...', 'Gasper, Beluga Whale  Saved From Mexican Amusement Park, in Grave Condition in Atlanta', "One of the Georgia Aquarium's five prized beluga whales is gravely ill and his immune system remains weak, aquarium officials said.Gasper, a 17-year-old male beluga,...", 'Beluga whales have long delighted residents and tourists alike when spotted swimming the silty waters off of Anchorage, but a federal agency says the gregarious whit...', "It could be the muffled sound of singing in the shower or that sing-songy indecipherable voice from the Muppets' Swedish Chef.Surprisingly, scientists said the audio...", 'Move over, Moby Dick.
