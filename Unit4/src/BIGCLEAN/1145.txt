['Alex Rodriguez walks back to the bench after striking out in the seventh inning with the Yankees as they play the Dunedin Blue Jays at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, July 9, 2013.  (Daniel Wallace/The Tampa Bay Times/AP Photo)', "Alex Rodriguez certainly leads the New York Yankees in headlines this season even though he hasn't played a single major league game.", "Injuries have kept him away from the team since last year's playoffs, and now Rodriguez faces discipline from Major League Baseball in its drug investigation, possibly up to a lifetime ban.", '"The likelihood of a severe punishment for Rodriguez is very high," former Commissioner Fay Vincent said Wednesday.', 'The three-time AL MVP who turns 38 Saturday is among more than a dozen players MLB has targeted following allegations they were linked to a Florida clinic accused of distributing performance-enhancing drugs.', "After Ryan Braun's agreement to accept a 65-game suspension earlier this week, attention has turned to Rodriguez, who four years ago admitted using PEDs while with Texas from 2001-03. He has repeatedly denied using them since, and MLB has never said he failed a test.", "Lawyers for MLB and the players' association were set to resume discussions about the Biogenesis investigation Thursday. Though it was unclear who might be penalized next, all eyes were on A-Rod.", "The Yankees expect Rodriguez to be accused of using PEDs over multiple seasons, of recruiting other athletes for the clinic, of attempting to obstruct MLB's investigation, and of not being truthful with MLB in the past when he discussed his relationship with Dr. Anthony Galea, who pleaded guilty two years ago to a federal charge of bringing unapproved drugs into the United States from Canada.", '"The mess seems very large indeed," said John Thorn, baseball\'s official historian. "If a lifetime suspension is being brooded about and a plea bargain would involve something lesser but still very substantial, that\'s a whole bucket of tar dumped on his legacy."', "With 647 home runs, fifth on the career list and 115 shy of matching Barry Bonds' career record, Rodriguez is among the most prodigious sluggers in baseball history. And his record contracts have put him in the spotlight, first a $252 million, 10-year deal with Texas that started in 2001 and later a $275 million, 10-year agreement with the Yankees that began in 2008.", "But his body has been breaking down and he's been on the disabled list six times in six years. Right hip surgery in March 2009 was followed by left hip surgery this January, three months after the Yankees repeatedly pinch hit for A-Rod and benched him during the playoffs.", 'Just when it appeared he was ready to rejoin the Yankees this week, the team said he strained his left quadriceps.', 'Rodriguez has acknowledged taking PEDs before baseball started penalizing their use. In 2009, he attributed his decision to being "young and stupid" and agreed to work for the Taylor Hooton Foundation to combat steroids.', 'If it turns out he was violating drug rules all along, his reputation may be beyond repair.', 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
