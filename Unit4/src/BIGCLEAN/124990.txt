At 12, Dawn represented Washington state at the National Spelling Bee in Washington, DC. And she was high school valedictorian.', 'Ms. DAWN HACHENEY: (Videotape) I give God the glory for my accomplishments, because without him I could not have remained strong and faithful.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Her best friend Eunice remembers how funny Dawn could be. She was also sweet.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Dawn and Nick were married April 20th, 1990. A few years later, Nick joined Christ Community Church in Bainbridge as the youth pastor.', '(Photos of church congregation with Nick, Dawn, Bob Smith, Robert Bily Craig and Annette Anderson highlighted; church exterior)', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Annette and Craig remember when they first moved there that Christ Community Church was a joyous place of music, even if somewhat off key, a place of warmth, spirituality and family.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: (Voiceover) We were having babies. We were having a lot of things in common at that time.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: They had a real chemistry between them that was real fun and close. Just a cute couple. Dawn was lovely. She was young and innocent and bright and kind and just a really good person.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) But soon Dawn and Nick would be the subject of a dark prophecy. Maybe God was acting in mysterious ways on Bainbridge Island.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Strange goings on at the church and an even stranger prediction of events to come.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) By 1997, Annette and Craig Anderson saw their warm and welcoming church begin to change. They say it became more insular, more separate from mainstream Christianity, and it started to dominate the lives of the church members.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Digging out demons was what Christ Community was after. There had been a change in leadership. Founding Pastor Bob Smith, often described as laid back, even warm and fuzzy, had been pushed aside by another pastor, biblical scholar and self-proclaimed apostle Robert Bily. At Christ Community, a typical Bily sermon lasted hours as people called out, cried, even spoke in tongues. And there were unusual counseling session that Bily introduced that were done in private with Pastors Bily, Smith and Nick Hacheney.', '(Clouds; church exterior; photos of Smith at baptism; photo of Bily; interior of church; photos of congregation; door; photos of Bily, Smith and Nick)', 'Mr. OLSEN: (Voiceover) They were logged into a book, and they watched it happen.', 'Mr. OLSEN: And they became very fearful, and that kept people, I think, closer to the church because if you left the church the gossip would follow.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: No, because we felt like that was the way to be pleasing to God. To be open, to be transparent was something that we were really required to be.', 'Mr. CRAIG ANDERSON: We wanted to elevate ourselves. And if you had some demons, who wants those hanging on, you know? So the process was to clean ourselves to be a better person.', '(Church exterior; photo of Sandy Glass; clouds; interior of church; photo of Glass; child in hallway; cars on road; statue of Gabriel; church interior; statue of Gabriel)', 'Mr. OLSEN: I mean, Gabriel only appeared like twice in the Bible, and third time was Sandy Glass.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) And then God told Sandy and a few other members that there would be a devastating earthquake in Seattle.', '(Church exterior and parking lot; branches; clouds; photo of Glass; branches; sun; photo of Nick; photo of Glass; sun, clouds, church exterior; photo of Nick and Dawn; photo of Glass; photos of Nick; Josh Mankiewicz interviewing Craig and Annette Anderson)', 'MANKIEWICZ: He made it clear that the terrible thing that was going to happen was going to happen to him, to Nick?', '(Photo of Nick and man; photo of Nick and Grace; photo of Nick; photo of Nick and Dawn)', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) And in the fall of 1997 there were hints that things might not be as rosy as they seemed between Nick and Dawn.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Nick had been given a new responsibility that took up even more of his time. He started doing marriage counseling with some of the other young couples at the church.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: He was really relational and seemed to know, you know, know how to break down the barriers and cause, you know, the root issues to come out.', 'Mr. OLSEN: Yeah. Seems like the guy is booted out the door after the first session.', 'MANKIEWICZ: Usually that exercise is something that counselors do for couples, not one member of the couple and the counselor. Because the idea is it shows the couple that they can trust one another.', 'MANKIEWICZ: It sounds as if Nick was maybe drawing you in a little bit more to him, promising you a special, closer relationship with God if you had a special, closer relationship with him.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) And just maybe Nick had already been going down that road with someone else. Pastor Robert Bily had been called in to investigate.', 'Pastor BILY: And Nick was spending an inordinate amount of time with this particular woman. And it was wrong.', 'MANKIEWICZ: It was during that time that Sandy began hearing from God, she said, about how she and Nick would be together. And it turned out God was getting specific. They would be together, God told Sandy, not just sometime in the future, but sometime after December 18th, 1997.', 'MANKIEWICZ: Do you think Sandy really heard that prophecy, or did Nick somehow manipulate her into believing that?', 'Pastor BILY: Well, she could have heard from satanic or demonic forces that are giving her inspiration as well, because they speak to people. They give people ideas.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Whether it was the hand of God, of Satan, or just of man, whatever was happening, that sixth sense that Dawn Hacheney was known for was kicking in. Though December 18th came and went without incident, on Christmas it seemed Dawn felt trouble coming. She told her father that night that if something ever happened to her, she was good with God.', '(Church glass painting; flame; photos of Dawn and Nick; trees; cloudy sky; photo of Dawn; cross)', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Then, later on that night, Dawn reached out to her friend Eunice.', '(Photo of Dawn; photo of Eunice; house exterior; space heater; branches and bridge; flames; photos of firefighters; photos of charred house)', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Despite their differences over whatever was going on between Nick and Sandy, Pastor Bily reached out to Nick in a way that will sound extraordinary, if not unbelievable.', 'Pastor BILY: He was aware of the work we had done in Africa and Tanzania, and our ministry associates there had raised several people from the dead.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: What would I say if he wanted to run me upstairs and make mad, passionate love to me.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) The death of Dawn Hacheney had been a terrible blow to all the members of Christ Community Church. Annette Anderson remembers how Nick seemed to be dealing with it better than most.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: He was peaceful. He looked exhausted. He seemed like he was welcoming everyone that came through the door.', 'MANKIEWICZ: He sounds remarkably composed for someone who had just suffered such a horrible loss.', '(Bremerton police building; photo of Dawn and Nick; excerpts from police report; photo of Nick; photo of Christmas presents; space heater; flames; photos of charred house; excerpts from police report)', '(Photo of Nick; photos of house; space heater; photo of Nick and Grace; Smith and others at baptism; Bremerton Police Department; photo of Glass; sun and clouds; autopsy report)', 'MANKIEWICZ: When Dawn died, you must have flashed back to those conversations in which he told you that something bad was going to happen.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: ...he saw it coming. I was pretty wowed by that in a way, a real sad way.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Was it just an odd form of grieving that led Nick to talk this way or was something else going on? A week or so later, Annette says Nick told her that God was up to something new these days, and it involved the two of them having sex.', 'MANKIEWICZ: So you could serve God by providing physical comfort to one of his servants?', 'Ms. ANDERSON: Biggest mistake of my life. It was a feeling of having jumped over a cliff.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Coming up, Annette was not alone. There would be more vulnerable victims.', '(Photo of Dawn; photo of firefighter; newspaper headline; photo of charred house; photo of Nick and Dawn; church interior)', '(Photo of Nick; photo of Glass; photo of Nick; door closing; photo of Nicole Matheson and others; closed door; photo of Smith and others; photo of Nick; hands typing; excerpt from e-mail; photo of Annette and Craig; bed; photo of Glass; photo of Matheson; excerpt from e-mail; photo of Annette and Craig; crib)', 'MANKIEWICZ: He had you give one of your children cold medicine to put them to sleep so you could go see Nick?', 'Mr. OLSEN: Mm-hmm. You know, the thing about those women, just kind of touching on that sympathy tour he was on, of course none of them knew he was at the next house hours before, you know, that he was going from place to place, you know, e-mailing Lindsey about how much he was in love with her, or going over to seduce Annette, or be with Sandy or Nicole.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Diana was crushed by the death of her only daughter, and she saw in Nick someone who could relate.', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) She says she just wanted to help a broken man, even if that man was her son-in-law.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: It completely destroyed me. It took me down lower than really I would have thought I could survive.', 'MANKIEWICZ: What did you see happening to her during that year? What was she like?', 'Mr. ANDERSON: Well, I always said if I had a gun in the house, you know, she might have used it. It was a tough time to watch your wife get into a cave and, like I said, I think, was almost suicidal.', 'Ms. ANDERSON: Terrible. Just terrible. It wrecked me. It completely destroyed me.', '(Church exterior; photo of Bily; photo of Smith and others; Craig on computer; photo of Glass)', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Sue Schultz was a detective at the Bremerton Police Department when she was assigned to the cold case investigation into the death of Dawn Hacheney.', 'Det.

No. My belief is that if it had not been for Sandy Glass my daughter would still be alive. I believe that she was the instigator of what happened.', 'MANKIEWICZ: Because of the prophecies that she had, or said she had, or because she wanted to be with Nick?', 'MANKIEWICZ: (Voiceover) Did Sandy want to be with Nick so badly that she persuaded Nick to kill Dawn? Was it a self-fulfilling prophecy? Detective Schultz says just the opposite. Nick manipulated Sandy, as he had all the other women, into doing what he wanted.', '(Photo of Nick; suburban street; flames; photo of firefighter; photo of Dawn; photo of Nick; newspaper article; photos of Nick; photo of Glass by photo of Nick)', 'Ms. ANDERSON: Trust is hard for me, especially in the context of church, because I know that power corrupts, and that church is a place that people can get power.']
