['Next week, Governor Ted Strickland is expected to sign legislation that caps the allowable interest on a payday loan at 28 percent. Right now in Ohio, the going interest rate for these short-term loans is 391 percent. The new law also limits a payday loan to $500 and requires the loan to be at least 31 days instead of two weeks.', 'Payday loans are marketed as two-week loans, but the report concludes they only work as a one-time quick cash solution about two percent of the time.', 'Last year, Congress capped the annual interest rate for payday loans to military families at 36 percent. And more than a dozen states have taken steps to reign in payday lenders.', 'Pay day loans might be an option for some people who have an unexpected cash flow problem. But in most cases, these short-term loans become long-term debt that is paid back at a staggering interest rate.']
