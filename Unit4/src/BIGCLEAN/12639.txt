["There's the Royal Suite at the Palace Hotel: Currently between $15,000 and $18,000 depending on the season, but going up to between $25,000 and $35,000 once the hotel completes its $135 million property-wide renovation.", "Then there's the Ty Warner Penthouse Suite at the Four Seasons. That's $45,000 per night. No, that is not a typo.", "But perhaps the most iconic, over-the-top, high-priced suite is at New York's famed hotel landmark: The Plaza.", "I got a rare look inside the hotel's $30,000 per night Royal Plaza Suite. And apparently, I was lucky to do so: The hotel tells me the 4,400 square foot, three-bedroom suite is almost always booked. Did I mention it's $30,000 a night?", 'What can you possibly get to justify paying tens of thousands of dollars a night for a place to sleep?', 'First, guests can only access the suite through a private elevator. No rising the normal elevator with the commoners. Although the people who book rooms at The Plaza can hardly be called riffraff.', "There's a dining room that seats 12. And of course the suite comes with a private chef. For those who prefer to do their own cooking (um, at $30,000 per night, no way would I be doing any cooking, but O.K.) there's a state-of-the-art kitchen with Viking appliances.", 'The powder rooms (not called bathrooms when they cost $30,000 a night to use) have Cheryl Wagner gold-plated fixtures and the sinks are lined with The Plaza insignia. The floor is hand-laid mosaic Italian tile.', "And no 4,000 square-foot hotel suite would be complete without your own private gym. The gym comes with a personal trainer at guests' request. (At these prices I would expect the trainer to burn my calories for me.)", "While The Plaza won't name names when it comes to their rich and famous guests, I suspect that secret panel is how celebs keep their private moments private.", 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
