['        December was all about buying the presents. This month, the credit card bills arrive. That ghost of Christmas past has people scrambling for ways to deal with the debt they ran up. One way to reduce your monthly payments is with a lower interest rate. Right now, the mail is full of eye-catching offers from credit card companies.', 'January is traditionally a big month for credit card applications, but before you put another piece of plastic in your wallet, see if you can reduce the interest rate you are paying on the cards you already have.', 'In some cases, it makes sense to transfer your balance to a newcard with a lower interest rate. You have probably seen ads for zero percent interest on balance transfers. They are very appealing, but you need to know the full terms of the deal.', 'What is the charge?

Right now, it\'s 9.99 percent, but read the terms and conditions and you will see it can go as high as 19.99 percent depending on your credit profile.', 'You will also find out if that low advertised rate really applies to you. Generally, it is only for someone with good credit, a FICO score of 760 or higher. If your FICO score is less than 680, you can expect a much higher interest rate.', 'If you have multiple credit cards, which most of us do, it gets pretty overwhelming to get out of debt. So you need a plan.', 'Are you in serious credit trouble? Talk to a reputable credit counselor before you do something drastic, such as file for bankruptcy.
