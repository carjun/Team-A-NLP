[' The first gameplay trailer for the next in the the popular "Assassin\'s Creed" franchise appeared Monday showing piracy, intrigue, and, of course, assassination on the high seas. Ubisoft"Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag" takes place in 1715, and players will assume the role of Edward Kenway, an Assassin-trained pirate roaming the Caribbean and rubbing shoulders (and cutlasses) with the likes of Blackbeard and other pirate legends.Ship-to-ship combat appears to be a major part of the game, though players will be able to drop anchor at ports like Havana and Kingston to indulge in the inevitable brawls, parkour and elimination of marked targets.And it wouldn\'t be a pirate\'s life without pirate treasure, so there are wild islands and wrecked ships to explore in search of booty. Naturally, some of these are already being offered as a pre-order bonus."Black Flag" will hit the PC and both current and next-generation consoles on Nov. 1, giving players plenty of time to finish up their adventures in the last game.
