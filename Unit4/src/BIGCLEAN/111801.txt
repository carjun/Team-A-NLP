['With thousands of fans filing into Belmont Park for Saturday\'s Belmont Stakes, there was a noticeable increase in security.Metal railings were set up at the main entrance for racing fans to walk through single file. As they did, New York Racing Association officials conducted electronic wand searches and checked bags for prohibited items.New security measures prohibit backpacks, cameras with detachable lenses, coolers and purses larger than 12 inches in diameter. Several fans had to leave coolers behind before being allowed to enter the track, according to one security officer."Whatever they have to do to make it safe is fine with me," said Elise Disimone of New York as she entered the track.An out-of-towner was surprised to see such tight security."I\'ve never been to any event in California where security was as tight as it is now," said Nate Wigle of Sacramento, Calif.
