['                    ANN CURRY: Many towns across America struggled over the last year or two, includi...', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) For most of the country, November 2008 was just another bleak month in recession-time America. Grafton, Wisconsin, was no exception.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) But for the people in this small-blue collar town north of Milwaukee, November 2008 will be remembered as the month when, despite their own troubles, they gave hope to an extraordinary family and, by doing so, gave hope to themselves.', '(People at event; Tyler, Karen, Megan and Kylie Longoria waving from inside of vehicle; public gathering)', 'Mr. JIM KACMARCIK: (Before crowd) If you have received so much more than you gave, I want you to raise your hand again.', 'Ms. KAREN LONGORIA: How do you say thank you to the thousands of people? I mean, this changed our whole life.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) For Karen Longoria, it all began 14 years ago when she went into labor five months prematurely.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) The surviving triplets spent five months in the neonatal unit. Megan and Tyler were diagnosed with cerebral palsy and other medical problems. Kylie was the only child who was born without a disability.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) They lived in Henderson, Nevada. Karen had to quit her job to take care of the kids.', '(Karen with young child; photo of Megan, Tyler and Kylie; house exterior; photo of Karen, Tyler and Megan; Grafton banner)', 'Ms. LONGORIA: I grew up here, so I knew what it was like. I was proud of myself that I could move here and buy a home and provide for my family.', 'Ms. LONGORIA: (Voiceover) I was trying to figure out what was going on with Tyler because he was getting weaker and weaker and I knew something was wrong.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Kylie had never thought twice about leading a life without any physical limitations. Now, for the first time, she felt guilty.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) At daily therapy sessions, Megan was fighting her disease with all she had. For Tyler, just climbing into bed every night was a two-minute struggle, but he insisted on doing it on his own. But to keep going at home was becoming more and more difficult. By the time Tyler and Megan were 13, they were mostly confined to wheelchairs, and the house in which the family had hoped to begin a new life was not built to accommodate kids with SMA.', '(Megan at physical therapy; Ann Curry watching Tyler get into bed; Megan and Tyler in hallway)', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Karen wanted to make life easier for her children, help them become more independent. But how? Renovating the house to make it wheelchair accessible was out of the question. Her take-home pay as a teacher was barely enough to pay the mortgage and provide the family with basic necessities.', 'Ms. LONGORIA: We just would pray together as a family, just give us strength to get through this.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) What followed was a mastectomy, two rounds of chemo, radiation. But Karen says none of the pain compared to the unbearable feeling that she was not able to be there for her children the way she wanted, the fear that she might not be there at all.', 'Ms. LONGORIA: You know, I sometimes think that God gave me cancer just so I could feel what they feel every day. And it put things in perspective, how hard it is them.', 'CURRY: Did raising them and helping them get through their illness help you deal with cancer? Did they teach you how to face cancer?', '(Ann and Karen staring at Tyler and Megan in therapy session; student film of Longorias; Kacmarcik at work)', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Jim first turned to Neil Willenson, a friend and CEO of a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping children affected by AIDS.', 'Mr. NEIL WILLENSON: How could we not act? I mean, how much more can a woman take? How much more can a family bear?', 'Mr. KACMARCIK: Karen getting turned down by the home makeover show, I think, was a real blessing. I was kind of happy. I was happy because I knew we were going to do the same type of thing a different way.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) It was an idea Jim and Neil called Hometown Heroes, a grand vision in which hundreds of local volunteers would gut the house and make every feature in every room wheelchair accessible. They would double the living space without knocking down a single exterior wall, replace all appliances and furniture, turn the unfinished basement into a state-of-the-art therapy room for Megan and Tyler and, get this, install an elevator to take them there. Their vision had a big price tag: $150,000. But not only did Jim and Neil believe their community could raise the money to cover the cost, they thought the volunteers could finish the renovation in time for the Longorias to have Thanksgiving dinner in their new home. That was only two months away.', '(Tree branches; house exterior; house interior; Willenson, Kacmarcik and others at table; photos of house interior; house exterior)', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) But in Grafton, like in most of the US, the financial crisis had hit home. Unemployment in this middle class stronghold had doubled in the last year. Many families were experiencing hardship for the very first time.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Tom Bartlein, the lead architect, knows the work at hand is immense.', 'Mr. TOM BARTLEIN: (Voiceover) This is a very big project to do in 20 days or 30 days.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) First step, recruit enough volunteers to help the professionals pull it off.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) A message from the heart. The question is, will it touch the hearts of others?', '(Newspapers coming off the press; mailman; man reading newspaper; road closed sign; people putting up Hometown Heroes banner)', '(Willenson and others in front of Longoria house on moveout day; Schiff and Longoria family; people showing up on moveout day; stop motion photography of people showing up on moveout day)', '(Kacmarcik speaking on moveout day; people in front of house; Karen and Megan in hotel; construction under way)', 'demolition. Interior walls, the outdoor deck and fences, appliances, cabinets, old carpets, everything has to go. Workers slowed down when they get to a wall the kids painted when they first moved into the house.', '(Voiceover) Each teacher came up with some different stunts to raise money for the Longoria family.', '(People counting money; man carrying furniture; people putting food on plate; people carrying cabinet)', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) ...and found a mission. But will a possible setback mean missing a Thanksgiving deadline?', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Hometown Heroes project, three weeks before an ambitious Thanksgiving deadline. The local photography studio is donating a family portrait session.', '(Voiceover) What does that mean to you, to know that all these people are working to make you happy?', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) The kitchen cabinets have arrived. Ron Grass, in the red cap, is volunteering today for the first time.', 'MIKE: I left my job, went to work for a nonprofit, and then they ended up cutting off the funding, so...', 'Mr. WILLENSON: (Football game) My hope and my prayer is that all of these communities will come together with a common purpose.', 'Mr. WILLENSON: It does. It takes a lot of courage. But once you do it, you keep on doing it.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) There are people who, perhaps more than anyone, understand the pain and difficulties Karen and the kids have had to endure. They, too, have come to help, and found more than they ever expected.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Coming up, how helping to build a room for Tyler helped to build this mom back up after her own tragedy.', 'Carolers: (Singing in unison) We wish you a merry Christmas, a very merry Christmas.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) After almost four weeks, life in a hotel is losing its luster.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Karen and the kids are excited and nervous. Home, they know, will be very different.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) The sisters have never met Karen, but they feel a special bond with her.', '(Pam and Sandy folding quilt; Steve Kittleson building crafts table; portrait hung on wall; muralist painting dolphin; children signing dresser; Jim and Neil in massage chairs)', 'Ms. TAUBNER: We took all of his favorite things and kind of rolled it up into one package, and we hope he likes it.', '(Kacmarcik vacuuming; Albers and other man cleaning garage door; Albers sweeping)', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Danny will be here one more day, tomorrow, when Karen and the kids come home.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) Coming up, a homecoming like no other as an entire community feels the love, and inside, not a dry eye in the new house.', 'Ms. LONGORIA: (Voiceover) I think I started crying. I mean, it was just overwhelming, just walking in this kitchen and seeing that wall taken out.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) In her old room Megan could barely roll her wheelchair across the carpet. Not anymore.', 'CURRY: (Voiceover) This entire story is in that table, in the form of a poem Steve wrote and carved into a wooden circle.', '(Speaking to crowd) This is hard. You guys have been great. This is better than a dream come true because our whole community supported us and helped us and inspired us. And you guys are totally awesome.', '(Voiceover) Thank you for your love and support, and thank you for making our house a home.']
