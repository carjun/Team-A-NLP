["Page 4: 'This Week' Transcript: Sen. Marco Rubio; Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush - ABC News", "RUBIO:  Immigration reform is something that all Americans recognize has to be done.  I mean, I don't focus a lot on public polling, but if you look at these public polls, it's clear the vast majority of Americans understand that what we have in place in this country is de facto amnesty, a broken legal immigration system that needs to be reformed.", "KARL:  The president came out this week and he gave one of his first speeches on immigration in a -- in quite some time.  I'm wondering, do you consider that helpful?  Is it helpful when the president comes out as he did and, is harshly critical of the critics of this bill?", "RUBIO:  Well listen, I think the president has his hands full these days.  I didn't quite frankly even hear the speech.  We were very busy this week.  I -- I think I read some headlines here or there, but obviously the president -- we're -- our job as legislators, you know, as members of Congress, is to pass legislation.  And that's what I hope we'll do out of the Senate, and then the House will have its work, and we'll work together to try to solve this problem.  And then the president will have a decision to make about whether he wants to sign the bill or not.", "KARL:  All right, before we go, I've got to ask you about the Miami Heat.  Series tied at two.  Does LeBron James have to deliver a championship to Miami to be considered -- even considered to be in the same league as Michael Jordan?", "RUBIO: Oh, good.  Listen, LeBron James is one of the  -- is certainly the greatest player in the world right now and one of the greatest players of all time, and I think by the time his career is over, that will be evident to all.  I -- I expect him to win.  I predicted that they'll win this series in six games.  I stick by that prediction.  They will win tonight in San Antonio, and then they'll wrap up the series on Tuesday night here in Miami, on ABC.  I think the pre-game coverage begins at 8:30, if I'm not mistaken.", "KARL: Yeah. That's 8:30 Eastern.  Thank you very much, Senator Rubio, I appreciate it.", "KARL:  We invited the White House to send a representative to discuss the new policy on Syria, but they declined.  Now to talk more about the next steps for the U.S., we're joined by George Will, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, Jeremy Bash, former chief of staff to both the CIA director, and the secretary of Defense, and my colleague, ABCs Chief Global Affairs Correspondent, Martha Raddatz.  George, not long ago you said the president is right on Syria.  Now what?", "WILL:  Now he's wrong.  Two axioms from two great military leaders.  Napoleon said, if you start to take Vienna, take Vienna.  That is don't be tentative, whatever else you do.  And don't be tardy.  General MacArthur said, every military debacle can be explained by two words, too late.  Too late to discern the threat, to prepare for the threat, to respond to the threat.  This intervention in another nation's civil war with sectarian overlays and ethnic complications was announced not by the president, not in conjunction with congress, it was announced by the deputy national security adviser.", 'This is obviously a reluctant president who now has himself in a competition with the Russians who are all in supporting the other side.', "We want to have negotiations.  We're not neutral.  The president has said Assad lacks legitimacy and Assad must go.  So, the negotiations are to negotiate Assad's departure from power, I don't think he's interested.", "KARL:  OK.  You're saying the president is wrong, because you didn't think we should get in there.", "Jeffrey, you've been for a long time saying that the administration, that the U.S. needs to get involved, needs to arm the rebels and do more, now?", "GOLDBERG:  I agree with George, this is the worst of all possible worlds.  This is dipping a toe in.  This is signaling we're in, but not really in.  No one believes, including the president, I believe, no one believes that these small arms are going to change the balance of this war.  I don't think Hezbollah, I don't think the Iranians are sitting there going, oh look, the Americans are sending eight trucks of small weapons to the rebels, we better give up.", "I think that we're going to find that we might be on the slippery slope.  And I happen to agree that it might be too late.  We're not in a position to intervene in what has become a Hezbollah-al Qaeda war.  And I don't know the answer to who do you support in that.  I think neither party is the party you support.", "KARL:  Well, Jeremy, you're just out of the administration.  You were at the Pentagon when a lot of these deliberations were going on.  We know -- what seems like a long time ago now, Secretary Panetta, Petraeus who was CIA director at the time, Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, all made the case for arming the rebels.  That was a long time ago.  Is it too late?", 'BASH:  Well, John, two things have changed in recent weeks.  First, the intelligence community came forward with a comprehensive assessment that said they have high confidence that Assad used sarin gas, chemical weapons to kill 100-150 of his own people.', "BASH:  Assad didn't just walk up to the red line, look both ways, and tip-toe across.  He barreled across the red line.  We set the red line, and now the president has determined we have to act.", "And second, three weeks ago, Hezbollah announced that they are going to join this fight and fight on Syria's behalf to the death.  Now I have been in these rooms, Jon when these issues have been discussed.  The president is not hesitant to order military forces into harm's way.  He did it in Afghanistan, he did it in Libya and he did it deep into Pakistan to get Osama bin Laden.", "BASH:  But he's been careful.  What he wants to ensure is that our military objectives meet a strategy.  And now is the right time to arm the rebels.", "RADDATZ:  I'm not sure I how what the strategy is and how those two match.  Because the small arms are frankly not going to do much good at all.  They may not do any harm, but they're not going to do much good.  It will not change the balance there.", "If the president really wants to make a difference there, and you talk about military force, I  doubt he's going to send in boots on the ground ever, and they've made that very clear.  But if we are in, and it really does appear we're on a slide in, you really can't put your toe in the water on something like  this, you now own, even if it's just a toe, you own part of that.  If you want to make a bigger difference, they have to look at a no-fly zone.", "Now, they're going to leave F-16s behind, they're going to leave PATRIOT missile batteries behind in Jordan after some U.S. military exercises that are taking place over there.  A no-fly zone would be a very big deal.  We talk about the number of casualties over there and that very few of them ", 'are from air strikes, but because Assad has air power, because he has the mobility, because he can resupply his troops, because he can move his troops around by air, he has a huge advantage.', "Will the United States do that next, will someone else do that next?  We don't know.  But that would probably be a huge game changer.", "Because if you want a war of attrition, and you don't have air power and you don't have protections against air power, you're going to lose.", "KARL:  That's going to be a tough sell at the Pentagon, right?  I mean, the military leadership...", "BASH:  Of course, these are imperfect options.  Thank you for pointing that out.  We understand that.  That's why this has been very difficult.", "But when you're in that room hearing the arguments on both sides, and you see the evidence, the concrete evidence that he used chemical weapons, you have to act.", "RADDATZ:  But was it really about chemical weapons?  There was more to it than that.  First of all, Assad's forces are much, much stronger now.  And in the last few months, they have really started to take back areas.", 'WILL:  The Washington Post reported this week that this decision to intervene was made before the conclusion came -- was arrived at about chemical weapons.', 'Second, even if they did use chemical weapons to kill one traction of 1 percent of the 93,000 that have been killed there, how does that change our national interest?', 'George W. Bush undertook two exercises in regime change in Iraq and afghanistan.  Libya now, followed by Syria, two regime change exercises by the Obama administration.', "And there's no denying that regime change has to be the outcome here, which is why poor John Kerry, the secretary of state, is out there trying to get a conference together as though there's a congruence of interest between the Russians and United States.  There isn't.  We're on opposite sides.", "GOLDBERG:  One of the reason that a lot of people like me who were hawkish I think early on are less hawkish now is because this problem might have become too big for any country to handle.  I mean, let's look at Iraq.  I mean, you're talking about a global Shia-Sunni conflict playing out on the Syrian battlefield.  You're talking about Hezbollah and al-Qaeda battling it out on the Syrian battlefield.", 'How do we interpose ourselves into that?  A no-fly zone?  A no-fly zone is not going to be enough.', "BASH:  All the more reason why we just can't stand back.  We have to engage.  The goal is to change the balance of power on the battlefield.  You know, there's a lot to talk about no-fly zones and air strikes, 95 percent of the casualties have been from ground operations.  We have to give the opposition, which is now better organized under General Idriss more of a chance to take it to the Assad regime.", "RADDATZ:  So heavier weapons?  I mean, do you give them heavier weapons, because you're not going to change the balance with small arms.", "Hey, we're almost out of time.  I've got to ask about, Jeffrey, the elections in Iran.  Does this change the calculus at all?  We now have a so-called moderate being elected president.", "GOLDBERG:  Look, this is a fake election and a fake democracy.  Let's not kid ourselves about what we're dealing with here.  These are hand-picked candidates by the supreme leader who are running for president.  That said, this guy is a smoother operator.  He does seem more moderate in his economic approach.  He does seem less confrontational.", "But remember, the leader of Iran is the supreme leader.  I mean, they call him supreme leader for a reason.  It's a nice title, right?", "He's the supreme leader.  He sets national security policy.  He sets foreign policy.  He sets nuclear policy.  So let's not forget where the power lies in that country.", "KARL:  OK.  Just one more thing, Jeremy because you're here, I've got to ask about the NSA and the search for Edward Snowden.  Take a look at what he said to the China Morning Post.  He said people think I made a mistake in picking Hong Kong as a location, misunderstand my intentions.  I am not here to hide from justice, I am here to reveal criminality.", 'How worried is the intelligence community that he is effectively going to defect to China or China will get ahold of whatever else he has?', "BASH:  Very, very worried.  Every day he's in China, Jon, I think erodes his claim that he's a whistleblower.  The information he has in his head and maybe on his person or on his computer or on his thumb drive is very valuable to the Chinese.  They're very interested in it.  If they haven't exploited it already, I suspect they soon will be.", "KARL:  All right.  Unfortunately, we're out of time.  Martha, Jeremy, Jeffery, George, thank you very much for joining us.  Thanks everyone.", "Coming up next, George will join out powerhouse round table.  We'll discuss new revelations about the government's secret surveillance programs, plus is immigration reform in trouble?  We're back in 90 seconds.", 'BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What was true years ago is still true today.', 'KARL:  A lighter moment from the president\'s big speech on immigration.  We\'ll get to that in a moment.  But first the "Roundtable" is here.  We have George back with us, along with Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.', "So I want to start with Syria.  The president made this decision now to arm the rebels.  It came after we heard Bill Clinton weigh in on this.  Clinton saying, some people say, OK, see what a big mess it is, stay out, I think that's a big mistake.", "In fact, the former president suggested that President Obama could be a fool if he were to not get in because of public opposition to our involvement.  Did Bill Clinton force the president's hand?", "BRAZILE:  Oh, I don't think so.  Look, I think the administration was already on a two-track strategy.  One to arm the opposition, and I think second is to work toward a political solution to get Assad out of office.", 'We\'re spending over $500 million in humanitarian aid, there\'s a refugee problem in Turkey and Syria.  There\'s no question the administration had to circle the wagon to make sure that they were arming the quote-unquote, "right people."', "But the administration I believe cautiously decided that it was time to change the political trajectory of what was going on on the ground, and therefore they're going to supply the so-called rebels with some arms.", "KARL:  What's your sense, Mr. Speaker, was this forced politically?  I mean, (INAUDIBLE) have been a lot of...", "GINGRICH:  This is an administration that does almost nothing that is methodical, careful, and professional in national security.  I mean, they don't take the advice of the generals.  They don't take the advice of any -- if you were to say to them, what is it going to take to knock Assad out, that is a huge undertaking.", "He now has Iranian backing, Russian backing.  He has Hezbollah coming in because he couldn't win on his own.", "KARL:  Well, in this case we don't see the generals pushing for that at all.  In fact, as we understand it, the generals oppose even a no-fly zone.", "GINGRICH:  But the generals -- because it's all nonsense.  I mean, what are you going to accomplish?  If the Iranians and the Russians are prepared to arm and equip and support Assad, and if Hezbollah, and by the way, Iranian volunteers, are prepared to help kill Syrians for Assad, then the idea that we're going to somehow marginally affect this is a disaster, I think.", "And this will turn out to be one of those cases where the United States will set itself up to be defeated, and Putin will be quite happy on behalf of Russia to be part of defeating the United States.  I think it's a very badly thought-out process.", 'KARL:  Congressman, are you comfortable with how the president is handling this?', 'GUTIERREZ:  Well, I don\'t think there\'s a good solution.  So I don\'t know if "comfortable with how the president is handling it" is -- I really have an opinion.  I just think there really isn\'t a good solution there.', "Here's what I believe.  I mean, if you talk to the intelligence community and the...", "GUTIERREZ:  And you talk to -- here's what they're going to tell you.  The best-equipped, the best-organized fighters are those allied with al Qaeda.  And those are the ones that are really fighting Assad.", "GUTIERREZ:  And so now we're trying to make a decision who is it we're going to arm?  Here's what can happen, and I think it would be the worst scenario, is that we do arm our proxies, our good rebels, and then the al Qaeda start fighting the American proxy good rebels.  And you know what Assad says to himself, great, I now have split my opposition.", 'So, look, if you take Iraq, we saw what happened in Iraq.  We had, what, 150,000 American men and women there and during that time, over 300,000 Iraqis died in the ensuing civil war.  What makes you think that our involvement is somehow going to solve the problem?', 'So what I say is, look, we really need a diplomatic solution, and it seems to me that the only place we can move today is to force the hands with Russia and with Putin to find a solution that can end the Assad regime.', "WILL:  Well, then the policy should be just don't do something, stand there, because you can always make matters worse.", "The administration says we're going to get our weapons into the right hands.  The Hamiltonians, the Jeffersonians, the Federalists, the Anti-Federalists, the Whigs, fine, let's arm them all.  But they're not over there.  We don't have people like that there.", "The secretary general of the U.N., always helpful, weighs in with the sentiment, he said, there's no military solution to this.  There was a military solution to the American Civil War, the Russian Civil War, the Spanish Civil War, there's going to be a military solution to this, someone is going to win.  And Assad has backers who mean it.  Our side, whatever it is, doesn't.", "GUTIERREZ:  ... what we kept hearing was the Assad regime is on the brink of collapse.  For two years we have been hearing this.  There is absolutely no indication that he isn't -- and his regime, isn't becoming stronger, that it does not have popular support within Syria, in spite of the fact -- this is a civil war.", "BRAZILE:  But they're looking for a political solution.  They're not looking for a military solution.", "BRAZILE:  They're trying to bring Assad, you know, to the table to get him to go away.", 'WILL:  The table that will end this war would be that the one in the kitchen of the McLean farm at Appomattox, someone is going to surrender.', "GUTIERREZ:  But Assad doesn't have one thing, he doesn't have an unlimited pool of money.  He doesn't have oil.  And he needs money in order to keep the...", "GINGRICH:  He has Iranian and Russian money.  And I just want to build on what George said.  In the Spanish Civil War, the democracies ineffectively tried to help one side.  The dictatorships effectively tried to help the other side.  Military power, ruthlessness, and toughness matters in these kinds of settings.  Virtually all of it now is on Assad's side.  And I think the United States proving that it is incapable of being effective will not be a particularly good strategy.", 'KARL:  OK.  I want to turn to immigration, because we heard from Marco Rubio on this, a very critical week for the immigration bill.  We also heard from Speaker of the House John Boehner, interview with George Will (sic).  Take a listen.', 'GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST, "THIS WEEK":  What\'s the most important thing you\'ll get done this year?', 'REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), HOUSE SPEAKER:  I think immigration reform is probably at the top of that list.', 'STEPHANOPOULOS:  One that passes the House, passes the Senate, signed by the president?', 'KARL:  Well, Mr. Speaker, the big question here is will John Boehner, should John Boehner go forward with a bill that does not have the support of the majority of Republicans?', "GINGRICH:  No.  And I don't think he will.  I think John Boehner will find a way to get a majority of Republicans and find a way to get a majority of Democrats, and there will be a more conservative bill than the Senate, and it will be a bill that is stronger on border security than the Senate.", 'KARL:  You really think a majority of Republicans are going to sign on to a bill that includes a path to citizenship?', 'GINGRICH:  Sure, depending on how long the path is and what the circumstances are, yes.  I think -- look, people -- most people have two general beliefs, one is that you have got to do something when you have 11 million people who are currently outside the legal system.', "The other is you have got to control the future.  And that means you have got to control the border and you've got to have some kind of employment system that includes guest workers or you're just going to kid yourself, and 10 years from now be back on the same thing.", "I think Boehner has been very careful.

This is the first time that I know 25, 30 Democrats, members of the Hispanic Congressional Caucus, under the leadership of Ruben Hinojosa, have gone to the speaker, a speaker not of our party, and said, we want to engage you in a conversation because we're looking for a solution.", "What I would hope is that Speaker Boehner will embrace our coming to him and that we can work collectively.  Because, look, this cannot be a partisan issue.  Look, you can talk about Benghazi, and we can talk about Syria, we can talk about Obamacare and its implementation, let's not let this issue, the one issue in which we have seen Republicans and Democrats come together, fall into the morass of the bickering and the fighting here in Washington, D.C.", "I want to say it's Father's Day, right?  A study just came out this week in Illinois, 56,000 children were left without a mom or a dad, some without parents in the last six years.  It's something we have to answer.  It's a tragedy, what's happening to American immigrant families.", "BRAZILE:  If this bill is not pulled to the right in the House, we saw what Steve King did with the DREAM Act.  This is a major test of whether or not our political system can get real things done.

Now Cornyn has an amendment, it is 134 pages long, to a bill that\'s, what, 800 and some pages long?', "WILL:  Well, it's long because -- the bill itself is because there are provisions in it, for example, special exemptions for foreign ski instructors.", "WILL:  At the behest of the good senator from Colorado.  This is a very complicated Rubik's Cube they've put together.  And it comes down to the killer Bs, benefits and borders.

First he was there with Jimmy Fallon, and then on Friday sharing the stage with President Bill Clinton in Chicago.  And of course, he was recently seen high-fiving another Democratic president on the Jersey shore.

I mean, if he wins a large re-election  this fall ...", "GINGRICH:  Because it won't matter.  Look, the average American is so sick of the petty negativity.  He says, look, I was governor of New Jersey.  I did everything I could to help the state of New Jersey, and when I get to Washington, I'm going to do everything I can to help America.

They've got, what, 244 electoral votes, something like that.  Democrat starts out looking for 26 electoral votes.

I want to get to the other political story this week, Mayor Bloomberg, his anti -- his pro-gun control group, is now up on ads in four states targeting Democrats, Donna.

And Huey Long would have relished an idea of a New York Mayor coming down to Louisiana telling him how to vote, you know, on guns of all issues.", "GINGRICH:  I think what this illustrates is why you need to drop all of the efforts to micromanage politics at the candidate level.  I have no problem with him spending the money as free  speech.  But then the candidate he's attacking should be allowed to raise the same quantity of money.
