['        The collapse of the housing market showed no signs of easing in November as sales of new and existing homes plunged and prices took their biggest hit on record. ', 'As the housing-led recession deepens, job loss worries have pushed many potential buyers out of the market. And the relentless pace of foreclosures increases the glut of unsold homes and pushes prices lower, as lenders price them aggressively to get them off their books. ', "The job market shows little sign of improving soon. In a separate report, the Commerce Department Tuesday confirmed that the nation's gross domestic product shrank by a half-percent in the third quarter. Private forecasters such as IHS Global Insight estimate that GDP will fall at a 6 percent rate in the current quarter and 4 percent in the first quarter of 2009, with a smaller contraction coming in the second quarter. ", "Even among those would-be home buyers who still have a job, the pool of qualified borrowers is substantially smaller than it was just a year ago. Banks have learned from the mistake of lending to people who can't afford to pay back their mortgages and have gotten extremely choosy about who they approve for a new mortgage. ", "Home builders have slashed the pace of housing starts, and construction has slowed to a crawl. Yet the inventory of unsold homes remains at historic highs as lenders dump more foreclosed homes on the market. More than a year of public and private efforts to help keep people in their homes still hasn't slowed the pace of foreclosures. ", 'Some analysts doubt that low mortgage rates alone will be enough to get housing sales moving again among new buyers. ', "To help spur sales, the battered home building industry is pressing Congress to provide relief in the Obama administration's promised economic stimulus package. The industry proposal, called Fix Housing First, would include a move to offer mortgages at 3 percent interest and provide a $22,000 tax credit to help buyers come up with a down payment. ", '"Declining home prices are what caused much of the financial and economic turmoil that we are faced with today," Hovnanian told Wall Street analysts on a conference call to discuss the company\'s latest financial results. "If the government wants to enact a stimulus policy that will get to the root cause of the problem, they need to fix housing first." ']
