[' BlackBerry\'s share of smart phone sales at Verizon Wireless fell from a peak of over 90 percent in October 2009 to its current 19 percent, according to a report by ITG Investment Research. The cause? Android phones, led by Motorola and HTC.Google\'s OS is currently found on 80 percent of smart phones sold by Verizon, with the final 1 percent being shared by Palm OS and old Windows Mobile phones. Naturally, sales of all smart phones have risen dramatically since then, but it doesn\'t bode well for BlackBerry\'s maker, Research In Motion."The decline is led by the lack of a Storm refresh, dwindling sales of the Tour/Bold series, and a failure of the new Curve 3G to yet replace diminishing sales of the Curve 8530," wrote ITG telecom analyst Matthew Goodman.As for the future of smart phones at Verizon, Goodman says that shoppers are in a holding pattern now. The carrier will have a "slow holiday season ... owing to an expected launch of the iPhone and 4G LTE handsets" in the coming months.via AllThingsD']
