["        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say.

Pat Quinn signed the state legislation into law, which will allow an estimated 342,000 Illinois residents to enroll by 2017.', '"Some would call it Obamacare. I call it \'I Do Care,\'" said Quinn, surrounded by health care advocates at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "It\'s not a privilege to have decent health care; it\'s a fundamental right."', 'About half of U.S. states are moving forward on expanding the health care program for the poor and disabled, which is a provision in the Affordable Care Act approved in 2010. Last summer, a U.S. Supreme Court decision made it optional for states to take it up. More than a dozen Republican-led states have opted out.', 'In Illinois, and other states expanding Medicaid, enrollment begins Oct. 1 and coverage begins next year. Up to half a million uninsured will be newly eligible for coverage with the federal government footing the bill the first three years.', "The intricate measure was closely watched in the president's home state and went through, at times, heated debate. A last-minute amendment that gives more flexibility to the state's mental health institutions created ripples. U.S. Sen.

After the first three years, states would gradually pick up a percentage of the costs.', "Illinois has lagged slightly behind other Democrat-led states in carrying out Obama's cornerstone domestic achievement.", 'For three years, Quinn had hoped that Illinois could take over the health insurance marketplace, an online insurance shopping site that is available Oct. 1. However, Illinois lawmakers adjourned earlier in the summer without voting on the proposal. Unless lawmakers approve a plan in the fall, the state will partner with the federal government beyond the first year.', "Quinn pushed the Obama connection to Illinois on Monday and said he wanted to sign the bill ahead of the president's scheduled visit to the state. Obama is expected to speak Wednesday at Knox College.", '"I\'m going to bring this bill on Wednesday to Galesburg and say to the president, \'We got the job done,\'" Quinn said.', ' Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
