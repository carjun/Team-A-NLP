It's official. Overnight President Obama signing orders to start 85 billion dollars in across the board spending cuts is just don't. As gonna hurt. Gonna -- individual people -- -- gonna hurt the economy -- overall. This white house press conference would have been framed as just another -- -- today between the president and Republican opponents until mr. Obama received a mixed up this. Let people agree on presenting a fair deal. The fact that they don't take it means that I should somehow do it -- -- mind. Meld with these folks and convince them. To do what's right. For those who didn't catch it you the president seemed confused Star -- Vulcan -- -- With Star Wars yet I'm mind trick but whether President Obama is really the -- and -- -- most.

They happen why can't these two parties come together -- this is what's so frustrating we've known about this for sixteen months and that there was no action in congress this week. Look I think fundamentally have a different problem with a divided government in the past we've got a lot of great things done from the Marshall plan to all the accomplishes the Reagan era. What's different now as the parties are so polarized that there are the kind of conservative Democrats and progressive Republicans that used to exist. That could form coalitions when there was -- -- you have this kind -- gridlock give the stalemate in the American people are paying the price literally today. But what about the argument that these budget cuts are good thing everybody agrees the American government needs to tighten -- felt mrs. start. Right the problem is that as be honest said these were designed to be so don't so painful such broad deep cuts.
