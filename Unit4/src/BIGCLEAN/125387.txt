Not that he'd say so himself.", 'Tami Belshay: Enough to want to have her re-located to-- Missouri to get her straightened up.', 'Mary Solis: The sad part of it is he really, really wanted his marriage to work.', "It wouldn't be the first time a man had left a life not going so well, now would it? And there had been such chemistry once. He was a young nurse, she still a college student. And she was exciting, ambitious.", 'And after graduation they came here to the heart of the California breadbasket, a little town - a suburb, really - called Clovis.', "Theresa Freed: Fresno's nice as well, but-- a lot of-- a lot of wealthy people do live in Clovis, and it has very low crime. ", 'And here was where they made their life, a somewhat unusual arrangement by traditional American standards. She was an entrepreneur, rose to become the president of her own agricultural chemicals company. A double a type - a smart, demanding boss who succeeded by becoming a workaholic.', 'At the hospital where he helped run the nursing department, Tim was a popular leader. The other nurses liked him and looked up to him. ', 'Keith Morrison: So he was always-- as soon as you saw him with her you-- at the beginning, you realized he was whipped, as they say?', 'Tami Belshay: She had a very tough relationship with Kristin. I know that they were really-- at it for quite some time.', "It got so bad eventually that Larissa sent Kristin away; packed her off to live with her grandparents back in Missouri, a decision Tim did not necessarily agree with. Around then might have been the time when resentments started to boil under the placid surface of Tim's demeanor. In public, however, he suffered in silence, even when Larissa spat out her belittling insults.", 'So, divorce it was, but about as messy as a divorce can be: a process which, for Larissa, was extremely frustrating.', "Once, after the split, Larissa sent a young male employee to break into Tim's house and take back items she claimed belonged to her. But somewhere in the painful process, Tim Schuster seemed to grow a backbone. After that break-in, he even bought a gun.", "But the marriage he cared so much about was over. His beloved daughter was gone, the son he adored bounced back and forth through the poisoned air between him and his estranged wife. And then one day he got a pink slip; lost his job in a round of lay-offs at St. Agnes hospital. Had Tim hit bottom? He arranged to meet the hospital's human resources person the next morning.", "Something was amiss in Clovis, Calif. Bad enough that nurse Tim Schuster was laid off, on top of all his other troubles. But now this impeccably reliable man had skipped a crucial meeting with the hospital's human resources officer.", "So Bob and Mary Solis called another of Tim's friends, Victor Uribe. Could Victor check Tim's house? Make sure he's okay?", 'Vince Weibert: I mean, that right there is a big red flag for us to look at and say something happened here.', "Vince Weibert: He-- possibly committed suicide. A man who's going through a divorce-- who's having child custody issues, who may be having financial issues, and now he's laid off from his job and he goes missing that day?", 'Although, the police put two and two together and figured the timing of all this was probably pretty important.', "They even went as far as asking Larissa for information, even though because of the divorce the two hadn't seen each other for months. Still, they asked, would she come in for a chat? Of course, she agreed. And they recorded the conversation.", "Larissa Schuster: No. Not at all, no I don't-- I couldn't do --I can't-- I mean, I'd--we've had our problems and I dislike him and you know--and, and we haven't been able to get along but I couldn't do that to my son.", "Vince Weibert: Detective Kirkhart had received Fagone's name by going through the-- by Tim's ledger.", "Fagone, it turned out, was 21 years old. And a babysitter before and after the breakup for young Tyler, the Schusters' son.", 'Gentle or not, police believed Fagone might know something about the disappearance of Tim Schuster. So they found young Fagone, and took him in for questioning.', 'The interview rooms in the Clovis Police Department are like any other; which is to say, a very uncomfortable place to be. When the 21-year-old named James Fagone was brought in for questioning, he soon caved under the pressure. This was the rest of his story.', 'James Fagone: I was kind of messed up and it was kind of scaring me, kinda, you know, worried that she would do something like that.', "Had Larissa sealed her ex-husband's body in a vat of acid? Yes, said Fagone, telling the rest of his story back at police headquarters, that's what she did. After he obeyed Larissa's directive to shoot Tim with that stun gun, he said, he helped her drag the body to a big blue barrel.", 'James Fagone: I helped her prop up the barrel and then she put him in and, uh, she poured some solution in there.', 'James Fagone: It was really caustic--it was--it was fuming and uh and--and you know honestly she was like you know--I was messed up...she was like --it was too, uh-- it was too, uh, burning my lungs.', 'Vince Weibert: The fact that he was potentially alive when the acid was poured on him.', "Detectives looked into that relationship, too, and concluded it was likely more hero-worship than romance. And the implications of that? Well, listen to Larissa's attorney, a man named Roger Nuttall. He says it was Fagone alone who killed Tim in some misguided act of loyalty to the powerful Larissa. ", 'Roger Nuttall: He talked with his friends about his dislike for Tim Schuster, based upon the way in which Tim Schuster treated Larissa and-- and Tyler, as well.', "Could it be Larissa's rants about Tim were just talk, and her young acolyte took it all more seriously than she would ever have wanted? After all, said attorney Nuttal, there was no physical evidence at all to say that Larissa was the instigator of the murder. It all rested on Fagone's word. In fact, said Nuttal, she didn't do it.", 'Pete Jones, in court: The road to perdition for James Fagone began and ended with a sick sadistic sociopath named Larissa Schuster.', 'With nothing to lose, Fagone testified in his own defense. And though the judge would not allow his testimony to be taped, we can tell you that he portrayed himself as an impressionable boy manipulated by a powerful older woman.', 'Dennis Peterson: James Fagone was intended to be our star witness. When we le-- lose our lead man out in front-- it just left us that background picture of all of these circumstantial facts.', "So, what was left, without Fagone? Well, of course there were those nasty messages Larissa left on Tim's telephone message machine.", 'Sgt. Koch: Tim had saved all the audio tapes that she had left messages for him that were rude, vulgar, and disgusting. ', "And one of Larissa's former employees testified that Larissa seemed to have some evil intent toward her ex-husband. ", "Witness: Once, I was auditing in the lab and there was a news on the TV that a woman ran over her husband and then Larissa she said that she'll do the same thing if she can get away with it. ", "There was the storage locker too. The curious business of Larissa paying for it, but asking an employee to put it under her name, not Larissa's. But if there was a star among the bits of circumstantial evidence it would have been ... The acid. Before Tim's murder, the prosecutor revealed that Larissa bought a big supply of hydrochloric acid, rar more than her chemical company normally used.", 'Theresa Freed: I thought, "How in the world are they going to convict her based on all of the circumstantial evidence?" ', 'Roger Nutall: All of that is circumstantial evidence but none of it places her at the scene ', "Larissa: Behind sights 20/20, I know that I've made some bad decisions that day. I was simply overwhelmed with what was going on in my life on that day. ", 'Larissa: I had learned that he had put the body in a barrel and it was in- at my laboratory in the warehouse.', "Roger Nuttall: Did you purchase that acid so that you could dump your husband's body in a barrel and pour the acid on it?", "Theresa Freed: If I hadn't heard the testimony from James Fagone's trial, I would've bought it.", "Of course, her lawyer didn't mind, especially when the judge allowed the juror to stay on the panel.", 'And then, as defense and prosecution prepared for closing arguments, a different juror was dismissed for being disruptive and failing to pay attention.', 'Theresa Freed: Right after she was kicked off, we kind of hunted her down to find out exactly what she was thinking. And she said that she thought that Larissa Schuster was not guilty at that point.', '"We the jury in the above entitled action find the defendant Larissa Schuster guilty - first degree murder of Timothy Schuster."', "Judge Ellison: And I'm ordering you committed, Ms. Schuster, to the Department of Corrections to serve the rest of your life.", "She still had a friend, who sobbed openly here in the courtroom. And her young son Tyler, who'd always believed in her, and now knew she'd never be coming home. So, tears. But remember, Larissa had a daughter, too, Kristin, the one she couldn't control, the one she sent away. Here in court, Kristin was seeing her mother for the first time since the murder of her father. She wanted to tell the judge that for Larissa, life in prison wasn't punishment enough.", "Kristin Schuster: If it were up to me, the justice system would be an eye for an eye. But it's not. ", 'Kristin Schuster: I pray you are continually haunted at night by the sight and sound of my father fighting for his last breathing moments on this earth. ']
