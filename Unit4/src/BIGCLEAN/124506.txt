['Credit card issuers have created all sorts of rewards cards. You can get cash back, earn airline miles, or collect points that can be traded in for airline tickets, hotel stays, rental cars, cruises, gift cards or merchandise.', 'Reward programs are often complex. There may be limits on what you can earn each month or during the year. Rewards can expire. And you might not earn points if you pay late.', 'You may also have to spend a certain amount of money during the year to take full advantage of the savings. For instance, with the AmEx Blue Cash card (top-rated by Consumer Reports) you get a 5 percent rebate on purchases at supermarkets, gas stations and drug stores if you spend $6,500 or more. Spend less than that and the rebate drops to just 1 percent.', 'Just be careful to read the fine print when comparing gas cards. The rebate you see advertised in bold print is usually a teaser rate that only lasts for a short time. For instance, The Chase PerfectCard MasterCard (a Consumer Reports top pick) gives you 6 percent back on gasoline purchases for the first 90 days and then drops to 3 percent.', 'My wife and I have two rewards cards. We treat them like cash. The rule is: the bills are paid off in full each month. In return, we earn enough points to get at least two coast-to-coast round-trip airplane tickets each year. How can you argue with that?', 'The bottom line: If you pay your bill off in full each month, you might as well play the rewards game. But you must be disciplined enough not spend more in order to earn points, miles, or cash back.']
