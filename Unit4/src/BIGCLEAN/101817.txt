['        Cancer patients are at much greater risk of bankruptcy than people without cancer, according to a large new study. And while the new health care law promises insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans who lack it now, the high cost of cancer care can push many patients, especially younger women, into financial trouble, experts say. ', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'Ramsey and his colleagues matched 197,840 adults from a western Washington cancer registry with an equal number of cancer-free adults by age, zip code and sex. They then determined who had filed for bankruptcy, using court records.', 'The researchers found that 4,408 of those diagnosed with cancer between 1995 and 2009 had filed for bankruptcy, compared to 2,291 of those without cancer. Overall, cancer patients were 2.5 times as likely as others to file for bankruptcy. ', 'Non-white females were the most likely to file, while patients 65 or older were the least likely -- possibly because they were covered by Medicare and eligible for Social Security.', 'The highest rates of bankruptcy were among those with thyroid cancer, which mostly affects younger women. The lowest were in men with prostate cancer, which typically strikes at an older age. ', 'Ramsey believes the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which will extend health insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans, could reduce bankruptcy rates. ']
