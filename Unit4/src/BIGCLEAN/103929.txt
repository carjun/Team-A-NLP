Overall, those reading books of any kind dropped from 78 percent to 75 percent, a shift Pew called statistically insignificant.Those owning an e-book device or tablet jumped from 18 percent to 33 percent, with much of that increase coming from last year's holiday season, when millions received Kindles, Nooks and other e-readers as gifts.Awareness that libraries offer digital texts grew from 24 percent to 31 percent.The telephone survey of 2,252 people aged 16 and older was conducted from Oct. 15 to Nov. 10.
