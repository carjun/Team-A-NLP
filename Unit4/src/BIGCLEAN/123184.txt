Last year, it was barred by the West from Geneva 1.', 'Since then, Washington and the European Union have split with France and the UK over when to supply heavier arms to rebels.', "France and the UK have suggested that if the Geneva talks fail to secure peace, they would be willing to arm moderate rebels not opposed to the West -- but there is no easy way of guaranteeing a rebel group's loyalties.", 'Iran says the supply of light arms, which it believes comes from the U.S. and its allies, must stop to allow a power transition in Syria in preparation for its presidential race in 2014.

In March, the paper reported how that CIA program had expanded.', 'But Iranian officials have alluded to earlier U.S. interventions.

The Iran-based journal, Iranian Diplomacy, termed the attacks a "game changer."', 'An alarmed Iran signaled a shift in battle front tactics in Syria.

Its occupation by Israel lets Iran shame Arab leaders for their inability to reclaim it. But an upheaval in Golan might suit Iran if Israel does not stop attacking its allies.', 'On May 30, Assad warned Israel he was under pressure by the Syrian people to retake Golan. A conflict between Israel and Syria is bound to spread to Gaza, the West Bank and the Sinai where Arabs dispute the 1967 occupation by Israel of those lands.', 'It is uncertain if that is a fight Assad wants.
