We are talking about the sheer reach of the humanity, an endless stretch of people in a refugee cam in syria. It has become the second largest refugee camp in the world, three square miles, half of them children, all of them fleeing the war in syria. Martha raddatz was there spending the day with secretary kerry. Reporter: The refugee camp is bigger than kansas city, 140,000 people on the run from the terror of the assad regime. Enter secretary john kerry, to show concern. But what we found after the video cameras were escorted out was rage. What are you waiting for, said one refugee. At least impose a no fly zone. Kerry acknowledged the horror. This is building into one of the great humanitarian crises on the face of the planet. Reporter: The u.S. Has been sacrificing and that america is helping with humanitarian and military aid. But these people are no longer interested in excuses. By the end of this year, officials estimate that more than half of syria's 10 million people will be displaced.
