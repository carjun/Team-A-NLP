['(Reuters) - NBA All-Star Kobe Bryant was on the verge of making a remarkable move to the modest Italian basketball arena on Friday after Virtus Bologna president Claudio Sabatini described the deal as "95 per cent done."With the NBA in lockout, the Los Angeles Lakers player could be set for a return to Italy having been brought up in the country when his father played there for several clubs."We have reached a financial agreement," Sabatini was quoted as saying by Italian media."I\'ve gone beyond my last offer of three million dollars gross. Now we have to discuss the benefits. There are still some things to work out but I\'m very optimistic -- it\'s 95 per cent done."Talks with the shooting guard had initially hit a snag with the American asking for a season\'s contract and the club, unsure of when the NBA lockout might end, offering a game by game deal."We\'ve reached a compromise," said Sabatini, revealing the new deal would be for 10 games.
