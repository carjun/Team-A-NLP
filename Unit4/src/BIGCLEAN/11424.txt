See More ', '\t\t\t\t\t\tAll righty, then now to the escalating controversy swirling around a super bowl ring and whether russian president vladimir putin stole it or was given it as a gift by the owner of the new england patriots. The story keeps changing with the kremlin and robert kraft speaking out. Abc\'s nick watt has that story. Reporter: Vladimir putin is a man would has everything. Presidency of the largest country on earth and a great body. But he\'s never won the super bowl. Super bowl is the highest form of competition. Reporter: So was that jealousy on putin\'s face when new england patriots owner robert kraft showed off his super bowl ring on a visit to russia in 2005? He put it on and goes "i can kill someone with this ring" kraft told a gala dinner recounting that moment and put it in his pocket and three kgb guys got around him and walked out so did putin steal the 4.94 carat chunk of gold encrusted with 124 dimes and huge sentimental value? A mythed kremlin spokesman calls the weird saying it wasn\'t stolen but a gift. Kraft did say the same thing in the wake of the handover eight years ago but he now claims that was under white house pressure and he\'s now changing his tune. It\'s a humorous story that robert retells for laughs. Kraft\'s spokesman cryptically told abc news he loves that his ring is at the kremlin but clearly vladimir putin does not love this new version of the story.
