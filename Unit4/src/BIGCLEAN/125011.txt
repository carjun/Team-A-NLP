He, the dropout, obviously wasn't... But he certainly seemed proud of his family. After all, his father had been a math professor and later a successful businessman.", 'Bennet Reid: But I always asked him, "Well, what do you do. How are you gonna take care of the baby and her." I was always concerned that they were just getting by.', 'Keith Morrison: Was there any sign of his parents at all during this period of time?', "But Ricky and Sparkle were ecstatic. They named their little girl Analla, which in Hindu means 'fiery one.' And all the while that young love just seemed to grow.", 'And then, just as the young couple was getting used to parenthood, Ricky came to his in-laws with dreadful news.', 'Donna Lowry: It was October of 1999 that he-- told us that his father died from diabetes-related complications.', 'There was to be a traditional funeral, the burial would be in India.

I remember thinking, I\'ll take the baby. You know, we\'ll-- we\'ll make sure everything\'s okay.', "There are times when a parent cannot make anything right. By the time Donna arrived at Sparkle's apartment, Sparkle's father was already there.", 'He could not yet know who the murderer was, or the incomprehensible design behind it.', 'Donna Lowry: Having my colleagues pointing their cameras at me and coming over and-- and they were very compassionate about what we were going through, but it was very invasive, people wanting to know more about it and how we felt. How many times have I been on the other end of that kind of thing? ', 'Lt. Lee Brown: There was a lot of blood, she had multiple stab wounds. And her throat had been cut, and she had been strangled.', 'Keith Morrison: Were there any signs that anybody had forced their way into that apartment? ', "Was it the marriage? They seemed so happy. In spite of whatever difficulties they may have encountered with their own immaturity and sudden parenthood, they had been inseparable. But now, Detective Brown couldn't help but notice that his behavior seemed a little odd.", "Bennet Reid: He was just walkin' around-- holding the baby. I can't say he ever actually showed any emotion that night.", "Detective: I've got to ask you this, Ricky, because it strikes me as odd, it really does.", "Donna Lowry: That was the last time we actually saw him.

And that he was against it and did not want that for his son. Did not want that for his family.', 'Prosecutor: Did the defendant ever express feelings about people of other races in particular black people?', 'Walmer: Yes.

A reluctant witness, but he did tell the story.', 'Ricky: I did not. I was supposed to be at hotel working and going to school, not dating anybody.', "Instead he lied to his in-laws, told them his parents were dead. All to avoid questions about why his parents weren't involved in his life and his baby's life.", 'And that is why Ricky and Sparkle, afraid of the consequences of disobeying his parents, moved to Atlanta in the spring of 1999, when she was not too obviously pregnant yet. ', 'Prosecutor: Did you and Sparkle move away in order to get away from your parents?', 'PI: He was attempting at that time to arrange a marriage for another child.

He hired someone else to do it. He is responsible for that because he sent the hit man to her door.', "So there it was. The prosecution's case for conviction. A father's intolerance of his son's bride.

Not the work of a hired killer, said the defense.', 'Defense attorney: What type of hitman shows up with no weapon? What type of hitman goes to the house without a weapon and uses things in the house to commit the murder? ', "So why would Herbert Green and Willie Fred Evans tell the prosecution they'd set up the murder under contract from Chiman Rai? ", 'Defenseattorney: Does a peaceful man with no history of violence in his entire life suddenly turn to violence and murder when he is older than 60. Their motive is weak and quite frankly not there.', 'DefenseClosing: It was a senseless stupid brutal crime. But this man had nothing to do with it.', "There is no telling quite how a jury will react to the stories it's told. No way for a waiting family to know what to think. The jury stayed out...

Burglary, we the jury find the defendant Chiman Rai guilty....', "Donna Lowry: Guilty came out of the mouth of the foreman. It was unbelievable. Just the tears started flowing, and couldn't stop...", "It may have been the incriminating hidden camera footage of Rai talking with Herbert Green that swayed the jury. But it was a death penalty case. And so now the jury sat to hear pleas for Rai's life. His children, with the exception of son Ricky, pleaded with the jury. It was the first time Rai showed any emotion during the trial.", 'Sandy: My father is still the greatest man I know. I ask you to let him live so others can benefit from his positive traits.
