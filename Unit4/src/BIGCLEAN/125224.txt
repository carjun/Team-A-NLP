Ed Schiller was getting ready to leave his car and enter the office building where he worked. But first, Ed made a call to Stacey.', "Ed didn't just embrace life, he leapt at it: Whether it was on the slopes, or during a quiet moment holding his brother's baby, Ed Schiller seemed to be a guy with a million friends - and no enemies.", 'When Stacey finally talked to Jim Brescia later that day, he said something that sent a chill up her spine.', 'Ed Schiller lay dead in his Nissan Maxima in a parking garage off a busy street in Newton, Mass.

I just had to let him know my feelings for him and-- and where I was and how I got there.", 'And while working as a bartender at a country club Stacey met Jim Brescia, a man nine years older. He was engaging, and he had a career-- a good paying job at the defense technology giant, Raytheon.', "He was controlling, she said, and selfish, and worst of all, he wasn't Ed Schiller. But in the end, Stacey agreed to get more deeply involved with Jim. She wanted a man who came complete with a commitment. ", 'Their wedding --ironically-- was at the Wayside Inn chapel - the romantic spot where she and Ed had spent so much time.', 'Stacey Rock: I was still trying to pretend-- trying to make him Ed, I guess, in a way.', 'Josh Mankiewicz: How long after that wedding did you realize you were with the wrong guy?', 'But get married she did.

After four interviews and the threat of a murder conspiracy rap hanging over her, Nancy Campbell cracked.', "Juror: Look at the evidence, it's circumstantial. There's calls, but there's no hard evidence.", 'Prosecutor Adrienne Lynch: James Brescia refused to accept that his marriage to Stacey Brescia was over, and he refused to accept that those problems had nothing to do with Edward Schiller.', "But would jurors buy the rest of the case from Middlesex County Prosecutor Adrienne Lynch? It would hang on the testimony of two women in Brescia's life, his co-worker, Nancy Campbell and his ex-wife, Stacey.", 'On the witness stand, Stacey would have to confront the man she says brought so much grief to her life. ', 'Prosecutor Adrienne Lynch: In 2005, was there a particular reason that you decided to go forward with the divorce?', 'Stacey said she had wanted a divorce even before she and Ed reconnected, but that once she started seeing Ed, Jim Brescia became obsessed with that new relationship, even having them followed by a private eye.', "Stacey Rock: I remember him saying, if we ended up together it wouldn't be good for his health. And -- I said, even if you think of doing something silly or stupid think of your kids.
