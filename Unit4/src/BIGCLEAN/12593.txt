I have no idea what any of us were looking at at that particular millisecond when the picture was taken. I'm somewhat sheepishly concerned that it was my preventing one of my early spring allergic coughs, so it may have no great meaning whatsoever. 06:21:18", "older2May20115:15pm, EDTPhotographer describes celebration outside White House following Osama bin Laden's deathnewer2May20116:39pm, EDTOsama bin Laden's death resonates at Arlington CemeteryDiscuss this post", "Charlie BuffingtonAs an American of this great country are happy about the news of the death of Osama bin Laden. A lot of Americans have died at the hands of this evil individual, which will be a mark in our memories forever. Speaking for myself and I'm sure other American people are asking the same question, how can we be sure that the death is of a real nature. They say they have proven his death by DNA, but we the American people deserve the right to know or see the facts of his death. We want to believe but how can we believe just on hearsay alone. I fly my American flag today for those who have died at the hands of Bin Laden and for me and my family............true American Patriots!", '"As an American" vs. "Your government lies to you, and you can\'t tell the difference."', 'Obviously he\'s a liar: "Your govenment..." Makes me wonder who his government is.', "Now, if this were a raid on a building that was principally underground with meters-thick metal doors and it only took 10 minutes--well, no, that's a bit too Hollywood.", "This is actually a fairly simple little operation--the main difficulty was that it was done in a foreign country that wasn't warned first (that makes it very tricky) so that the primary target wouldn't flee.", "I don't see any reason to doubt this raid. Now, was this the major victory that is claimed, are we in a simple engagement to get rid of Al Qaeda, etc. Those things are a bit different. Certainly, there is a lot more to diplomacy and the world power structure than most of us understand. Is there a particular reason that we have to be mindless drones for going about our lives even though we know perfectly well that we are about as well informed as people were during WWII? We are only just now finding out about what happened then--heck, we are only just now finding out about what went on during the Civil War.", "Most of us aren't quite so narcissitic that we have to know precisely what is going on with everyone, every second of every day. If I wanted to know about such things, I'd work for the government and earn enough trust that I could know what was going on on a higher level. But, I don't. This does not make me a mindless drone--it makes me practical. I vote for people who are reasonably trustworthy (no, I didn't vote for Bush) and leave it at that.", 'The US will definitely continue to provide aid to Pakistan. If the nations were not on "talking terms", the US may not have been able to carry out the attack with helicopters etc. The US has known about the ISIs agenda and is working around it by pusing aid etc. It would be very difficult to work with a non-democratic government in Pakistan and the US has to prop up the government through aid for the benefit of the US.', 'If he was not then I think somehow he would be the first person to stand up and say..', "tas-austAt the end of the day Osama is gone, wether it happened years ago or days ago it doesn't make a difference, but do you really think your president and government would make something up to increase the US as targets and have the chance a retaliation terrorist attack to make them selves more popular? NO didn't think so, get a life and be happy, obviously osama is gone because there hasn't been any further videos made of him. Don't you people think osama would have been in front of a camera telling us that america has failed again if he was here still, why would the president want to create more heartache for the 9/11 families just for his own satisfaction?", 'Newsvine Privacy StatementAs a new user, you may notice a few temporary content restrictions.
