['The oil and gas industry has cost Louisiana hundreds of thousands acres of coastal land that serve as a natural buffer against flooding from hurricanes, officials in charge of New Orleans-area flood protection say in a lawsuit seeking to hold dozens of companies responsible.', "Corrosive saltwater from a network of oil and gas access and pipeline canals has killed vegetation and swept away vast amounts of soil, the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East's board of commissioners claims in the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in Orleans Parish Civil District Court.", 'The wetlands are considered a crucial buffer against hurricanes because they can help keep storm surge floodwaters at bay.', '"What remains of these coastal lands is so seriously diseased that if nothing is done, it will slip into the Gulf of Mexico by the end of this century, if not sooner," the lawsuit says.', 'Oil and gas industry leaders and Gov. Bobby Jindal were highly critical of the lawsuit. Jindal\'s office issued a statement Wednesday night saying the governor demands the lawsuit be withdrawn. He questioned the legality of the board\'s contract with its lawyers and referred to the suit as a "trial lawyer windfall."', 'The board says it will have to bear many of the costs associated with the need for increased flood protection. The lawsuit, a draft of which was provided to The Associated Press before it was filed, seeks unspecified damages.', '"Even the industry recognizes they are responsible for some of the land lost, and it\'s not an insignificant amount," said board vice president John Barry, author of "Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America."', 'About 100 companies are named as defendants in the lawsuit, including Apache Corp., BP America Production Co., Chevron USA Inc., ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., Shell Oil Co. and The Pickens Co. Inc.', 'Officials in the oil and gas industry said they will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.', 'A statement from Chris John, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, said the industry has been involved in trying to fight coastal erosion, a phenomenon he said involves "both natural changes and many man-made activities."', 'John called it "a contingency lawsuit where the plaintiff attorneys stand to gain millions of dollars."', "Jindal said in his statement that the board had overstepped its authority by filing suit against nearly 100 companies, effectively taking on the role of the governor, attorney general and environmental entities in determining the state's policy on coastal issues.", 'State law requires approval from the state attorney general and the governor of any contracts in which a state board or commission hires special counsel or attorneys, the governor said, adding he gave no such approval.', 'Attorney General Buddy Caldwell said in an emailed statement that his office\'s role was to review the contract, make sure the lawyers involved are qualified to practice in the state and that the fees charged are" within the parameters normally paid by Louisiana agencies under similar circumstances."
