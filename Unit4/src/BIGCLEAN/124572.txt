Fate maybe because number 15 was her lucky number, the girl from the cross-town rival watching the game up in the stands, the pretty blonde named Michelle, who would become 1986 homecoming queen at Pepperell High.', 'Ms. MICHELLE REYNOLDS: It was an honor because the whole school votes for the queen, and so it was an honor.', 'Ms. BEVERLY OWENS: They were both popular, both nice looking, both friendly, had a lot of friends, social. I mean, they had it all.', 'Sheriff TIM BURKHALTER: This kind of gruesome murder was very eye-opening for our community and very big news.', 'Ms. BENEFIELD: I mean, she was just a beauty, absolutely. Walk into a room, and everybody looks. You know, she had that presence.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: Right. And actually when we got back to their house, I got sick and threw up because I was so nervous.', 'Ms. BENEFIELD: This was it. This was her family. She was finally going to have what she wanted.', 'Ms. BENEFIELD: Security because when I saw them together I saw that. I saw that security. I know she loved him. I also know that she could lean on him and depend on him.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: We had goals. We wanted to buy a house, we wanted to go on a cruise and buy a camcorder; and we did all three. And after that, we decided to try and start having children.', 'Ms. BENEFIELD: One had cheated. The other one had cheated. So you have both stories.', 'Ms. KITTY WALKER: He was in an apartment that he had rented, and I can remember him saying that he curled up in the fetal position in the closet and asked for God and asked for reconciliation.', 'Ms. BENEFIELD: You know how they always say God, family? I think God was first with him, then his family.', 'Mr. THAD REYNOLDS: (On stage) God working in my life, watching God work in their lives.', 'Mr. T. REYNOLDS: (On stage) John 8:36, God has done a miracle in my life. God says pursue righteousness, pursue faith, pursue love with others who call on the Lord.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: (On stage) Oh, honey, I was so busy this morning, I forgot to put the roast in the oven. You know how crazy it gets around our house on Sundays.', 'Ms. OWENS: If I had to pick a time that he was his happiest, it was when he had all four kids and Michelle at home.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: Our children were like best friends, and we would go out to eat with them, go to a movie.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: Scotty told me later on that she was jealous of me and asking him if he thought she was prettier than me, and she was just jealous of me, and so she just started getting away from me.', 'Mr. HARPER: Everything was good, you know, as far as vocationally, you know, a good job.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: He was fun to be around and made you laugh, and just a great sense of humor.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: I would, you know, have to ask him if I needed like costumes or something for one of the dramas, and he would tell me how to go about getting it.', 'Mr. HARPER: Not wanting me to be around her without Paige around, not wanting me to talk to her.', 'MURPHY: You want each other, but you still want to keep what you have, is that the dilemma?', 'MURPHY: I get the picture of you kind of easing your way out of the room after lights out, tip-toeing down the hall, is that the way it happened?', 'Mr. HARPER: I think Paige knew that Michelle and I was closer than she wanted us to be.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: Yes, sir. I was afraid that my husband might hit me, and I was just afraid that he would blow up.

It just seemed out of character for what is a nice, quiet place to live.', 'Ms. PATTERSON: They wondered if it was a stranger murder, where somebody had just walked by and saw the lights on, saw the cars outside and then came in.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: They came and knocked on the door, and had told me about it, and I just fell on the floor crying.', 'Ms. OWENS: Yeah. They helped me get back up, and I walked in and went to Michelle. She was sitting on the couch. I hugged her.', 'Ms. REYNOLDS: It was only like a five minute that I remember her just hugging me, and that was pretty much it. ', 'Ms. PATTERSON: No. He filled in the blanks, and that was when their relationship changed.', 'Ms. PATTERSON: Absolutely, absolutely. He would never have crossed the line. He would never have initiated this.', 'Ms. PATTERSON: No. They ask consent to search his van, the burgundy van, and he agrees.', 'MURPHY: What was he thinking? Why does he let this stuff reside on the computers?', 'Mr. HARPER: There was nothing I could say that could take it back, and there was nothing I could do to fix it.', 'Ms. OWENS: And there was like no emotion, no anything.

They were talking about how much they missed each other.', 'Ms. STAATS: There were several of these conversations, and in none of them are there denials of any of it.', 'Ms. PATTERSON: He and another guy who worked at the IT department started looking, and they went into the server room, and they took the suction cup device.', 'Mr. VIC REYNOLDS: In this case there was absolutely a moral backlash against Michelle.
