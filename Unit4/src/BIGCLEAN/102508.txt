['  TV2 A broadcast from Denmark\'s TV2 mistakenly used a digital render from Ubisoft\'s "Assassin\'s Creed" video game to depict the Damascus skyline. A Danish television channel has admitted it mistakenly used an image from a computer game to illustrate a news report about Syria. TV2 Head of News Jacob Nybroe said Sunday the picture that was used as a backdrop behind news anchor Cecilie Beck on Feb. 26 came from Ubisoft\'s adventure game "Assassin\'s Creed." He says he learned about the mistake this week, following speculation about the origin of the image on social media sites. One of the TV channel\'s employees had found the image online and thought it was a photo of Damascus\' skyline. (You can see the original, with a Ubisoft copyright notice, here, as ITV points out.)Nybroe says it was a terrible mistake and a "reminder to us all of the importance of verifying the sources of pictures."']
