['Tom Jenkins holed out for eagle on the par-4 third hole and finished with a bogey-free 7-under 65 on Saturday to take a three-shot lead in the Boeing Classic.The 64-year-old Jenkins is trying to become the oldest winner in Champions Tour history. Mike Fetchick was 63 when he won the 1985 Hilton Head Seniors Invitational."I won\'t think about it until I\'m on the 18th with a five-shot lead," Jenkins said. "I\'ve been in a couple of situations this year after the first round and didn\'t handle it very well, certainly not having been there, and at this age, it\'s tough," Jenkins said. "The nerves are not as good as they used to be."Jenkins had a 9-under 135 total at TPC Snoqualmie Ridge. He won the last of his seven titles on the 50-and-over tour in 2006.On the 439-yard third hole, Jenkins hit an 8-iron from 148 yards that bounced off the collar of the green and rolled into the cup."Stuff like that happens, kind of gets you jazzed up and kind of gets you through the start of the round," said J...', 'Jay Don Blake watched his putt lip out and figured his best shot at winning was over.Mark O\'Meara just doesn\'t miss putts inside 8 feet, in a playoff nonetheless."I\'...', 'Langer shoots final-round 69 for three-stroke victory over Price at Boeing Classic ', 'Bernhard Langer closed with a final-round 69 and pulled away from Nick Price down the stretch to win the Boeing Classic on Sunday.Langer got his fifth Champions Tour...', 'Price birdies 5 of last 7 holes for 63 to take first round lead at Boeing Classic ', 'Nick Price spent more than an hour on the practice range Thursday night trying to find the swing that had eluded him last week at the Jeld-Wen Tradition.He even took...', 'Russ Cochran fired a 6-under 66 on Friday to take the first-round lead of the SAS Championship.Cochran won this title in 2010.Andrew Magee, Steve Pate, Boeing Classi...', "Australia's Peter Senior shot a 7-under 65 on Friday to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Champions Tour's inaugural Hawaii Championship.Winless in...", "Fred Couples withdrew from the Champion's Tour Boeing Classic on Friday because of back problems on the first hole.Couples, from Seattle, has a long history of back ...", 'PGA TOUR - THE BARCLAYS, Bethpage State Park (Black Course), Farmingdale, N.Y. - The PGA Tour FedExCup Playoffs begin Thursday with The Barclays, the first of four e...', 'Tom Lehman became the first-ever back-to- back Charles Schwab Cup winner on Sunday when he fired a 5-under 65 to secure a 6-stroke victory over Jay Haas at the Champ...', 'Jay Haas fired a 10-under-par 60 on Friday to grab the lead after two rounds of the Charles Schwab Cup Championship.Haas began the day two strokes back of defending ...', 'Tom Lehman fired an 8-under 62 on Saturday to secure the lead after three rounds of the Charles Schwab Cup Championship.Lehman, who started the day five shots behind...', 'Defending champion Jay Don Blake fired a 6- under-par 64 on Thursday to grab the lead after one round of the Charles Schwab Cup Championship.Gary Hallberg is one str...', 'Dan Forsman fired a 7-under 65 on Friday to take the first-round lead of the Greater Hickory Classic at Rock Barn Golf & Spa.Fred Funk, David Frost and Larry Mize sh...', "Jay Don Blake birdied the second playoff hole Sunday to defeat Mark O'Meara and win the Boeing Classic.Blake and O'Meara both shot 4-under 68s in the final round and...", 'Mark Calcavecchia opened his title defense in grand fashion Friday with a 7-under 65 and the first-round lead of the Boeing Classic.Calcavecchia toppled Russ Cochran...', 'Tom Jenkins missed shooting his age by a single stroke on Saturday when he fired a 65 and took the second-round lead of the Boeing Classic.Jenkins finished 36 holes ...', 'Defending champion Mark Calcavecchia eagled the par-5 eighth hole and finished with a 7-under 65 on Friday to take the first-round lead in the Boeing Classic.Calcave...', 'After winning the Senior British Open, Fred Couples took a break to the point of not hitting a putt for three weeks.So not only does Couples have the pressure of pla...', 'Russ Cochran posted a six-under 66 on Friday shot lead after the opening round of the Boeing Classic.Cochran, the Senior British champ earlier this year, had an eagl...', "Mark Calcavecchia , Kenny Perry , Jeff Sluman round leader Russ Cochran are tied atop the leaderboard following Saturday's second round of the Boeing Classic.Calcave..."]
