There were multiple gunshot wounds and her throat had been slashed. Her pants had been pulled down, suggesting a sexual assault.

And he was talking about some things that I could relate to, so I went over and I started talking to him. And from that day on, we were talking.', 'The detectives already suspected there was much more to it than that.

He went home. From enough time for him to leave home, I mean, leave my house and get home, he called me. I thought he was calling to say he made it home.', 'It was all so shocking and sudden. All she knew was that Keyon was beside himself with grief and that she needed to be there for him.', "The crime, as far as Carla knew, was basically a burglary gone bad. That's what Keyon had told her.", "CARLA HUGHES: Keyon said that he found her by the car. He said when he let the garage up, she was by the car, keys on the ground. She didn't make it in the house cause she still had her purse on her shoulder or something. And she was holding books or something.", "Though Carla gave the detective a detailed accounting of Keyon's movements on the night of the murder, he wasn't quite sure what to make of it all.

Just hearing from what you've told me, and from what I've told you, what do you think?", 'There seemed to be a brittle chill in that answer.

She said a woman did that. And it was probably some woman that he was fooling around with.", 'The suspicion that Keyon may have been cheating on Avis was not without cause.

He said hello, and I kind of noticed Avis kind of looked at him, you know, kind of gave him a little look.', 'Whatever Keyon may have been up to then, the family was in no mood to see a public display of grief from him now.', 'DEBRA BANKS: He was not crying. He was just hollering. He showed tears like this here. No tears. No tears at all.', 'As chairs scattered, other Banks men rose to confront Keyon.

But I don't have one.", "Two days after the murder of Avis Banks, the detectives were no closer to making an arrest than they had been on the night her bullet-ridden body was found in her garage. They had an unfaithful boyfriend who'd acted suspiciously, but they didn't have a murder weapon. Then an amazing thing happened.", 'DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: Frank got a phone call from one of the local attorneys just outside of Jackson that indicated to him in that phone call that he had some valuable piece of evidence that we think may be tied to that crime, and that they told him at that point that it was a .38 revolver.', 'Not only did the attorney turn over a gun, he also turned over a witness who knew who had that gun on the night of the murder.', 'DETECTIVE FRANK DILLARD: His name was Patrick Nash, who was a cousin of Carla Hughes.', 'DETECTIVE FRANK DILLARD: According to him, she borrowed the gun for her protection.', 'According to the cousin, Carla borrowed a fully loaded revolver three days before the murder and returned it, empty, less than an hour after this encounter with Detective Dillard.', 'HODA KOTB: Did you find that at all weird that a cousin would rat out their cousin like that?', 'DETECTIVE FRANK DILLARD: Not in this particular case because, pretty much, this whole family seemed to be stand-up people, good people.', "DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: There was actually some conversations between Patrick's father and Carla about that gun prior to bringing it to us.", "DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: And I think at that point they realized they didn't want any part of this. They were going to do what they had to do to do the right thing.", 'If true, it was clear that Carla Hughes had lied about not having had access to a gun on the night Avis Banks was murdered. Now, detectives wanted to know what else she might be lying about.', 'JOHNNIE WALLS: You can stop them from charging you if you put the finger on him.', 'For investigators, the murder of Avis Banks had all the earmarks of a classic death-by-boyfriend.', 'Call it gut instinct, but detectives felt that a man who cheats on his pregnant girlfriend, calls his mistress instead of calling 911 after he finds her body, tests positive for gunpowder residue at the police department, and then abruptly stops cooperating with the cops might be guilty of something.', "DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: We've got to a critical point in this to where we've got some information that we're trying to verify. And due to that information we are receiving, we're not going to make any more comments on the case at this time.", "And yet, in spite of all that, the detectives still didn't feel they had the kind of evidence that would hold up in court if they actually arrested Keyon Pittman and charged him with murder. For instance, though the gunpowder residue found on his hands the night Avis Banks died might look incriminating, gunpowder residue is not the same as gunpowder burns. Burns would come from firing a weapon. Residue could theoretically have rubbed off on Keyon's hands when he cradled Avis' body. And regardless of how suspiciously he had acted, Keyon Pittman appeared to have a rock solid alibi.", "DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: We know Keyon's at basketball practice some 12, 15 miles away. And we have eyewitnesses that put him at the basketball practice at the time of the murder.", 'Still, up until relatives of one of his girlfriends surfaced with a potential murder weapon, Keyon Pittman was suspect number one, two and three. The gun changed everything.', 'DETECTIVE FRANK DILLARD: We sent it off to have a ballistic test done. And, of course, the results came back as a positive match.', "This was not just any lawyer.

I need to talk to my supervisor.', 'Normally, a curtain of privacy is drawn at this point. An arrest is made and everybody prepares for trial. But not in this case.', 'In this case, the detective pulls the attorney aside and encourages him to coax a confession from Carla.

And they don't understand why you're trying to protect him.", 'CARLA HUGHES: Why is it that I got to be trying to protect him?

They have a murder weapon and a witness, who happens to be a cousin of hers, who will say that she borrowed the gun shortly before the murder and returned it two days after.', 'But in spite of that incriminating piece of evidence, Johnnie Walls tells his client that the detective has hinted that he wants to make a deal.', "JOHNNIE WALLS: Okay. And you don't want to make a statement that's going to implicate yourself.", 'With Carla unable or unwilling to tell either her lawyer or police anything that might implicate Keyon, she was immediately charged as an accessory in the murders of Avis Banks and her unborn baby.', 'HODA KOTB: Did either Carla or Keyon have any sort of criminal background?

She played soccer. She was a cheerleader. She tracked, played basketball. She was a majorette dancer in the band. She was in the key club, student council.', "By the time Carla reached high school, she was clearly Greenville's golden girl...a beauty queen who competed in Mississippi's National Teen and Miss Teenage America pageants.", "Carla was also an honor student, on the mayor's youth council, and a page in the Mississippi State Senate.", "LINDA HUGHES: She's just able to accomplish anything. You know, if she was with her daddy, whatever his hobbies were, she was able to tap into that.", "Always daddy's girl, Carla learned to ride and show the Tennessee walking horses that her father, Carl, trained. In 1995, at the age of 14, she was crowned Mississippi state champion and went on to finish sixth in the world competition. And her record of accomplishment did not stop there.", "Collegiate honors, a master's degree and work toward a doctorate had laid the groundwork for a stellar career in education. In short, her life seemed charmed. Not even a failed romance that left her with a two-year-old son to raise had sidetracked her. ", "Then along came Keyon Pittman. Four months after meeting him, Greenville's golden girl was in deep trouble. Detectives had not only put a murder weapon in her hands, they'd also found a pair of blood-flecked shoes in her townhouse that had a tread pattern that matched a footprint left on a back door at the murder scene.", 'Overnight, that discovery caused the original accessory after-the-fact charge to be upgraded to first-degree murder.', "CARL HUGHES: You know, sometimes you have to get the horse's attention, and she just...", "HODA KOTB: Multiple gunshots, multiple stab wounds. And they say that they've got some evidence against your daughter, a gun that they say the bullets came from. How do you explain that?", 'CARL HUGHES: I fixed the door once at the back of the apartment where it looked like somebody had tried to get in.', 'HODA KOTB: So the gun was there, and the bullets from the scene are connected to that gun.

Most folks can't live without them. I believe that most folks probably have no idea of the records and the type of records that cell phone companies keep.", 'Michael Guest got a good feel for that when it became his job to prosecute Carla Hughes for the 2006 murders of Avis Banks and her unborn child.', 'MICHAEL GUEST: I think the two most important pieces of evidence that we had were the cell tower records and the gun itself.', 'Witnesses could link the murder weapon to Carla Hughes, and the prosecutor hoped a jury would buy his theory that Carla killed Avis in a jealous rage because she wanted Keyon Pittman all to herself. But it was the story these towers told that would ultimately reveal what happened on the night Avis Banks died.', "MICHAEL GUEST: You're building a timeline based on the cell phone record of Avis Banks, the cell phone records of Keyon Pittman and the cell phone records of Carla Hughes. In our particular case, the cell tower records not only placed Miss Hughes there in the area where the crime occurred...but it also placed Mr. Pittman miles away across town at basketball practice.", "According to that timeline, Avis Banks left her job at the day care at 5:10. She would have been about 10 minutes from home at 5:36 when she'd called Keyon Pittman at basketball practice to ask about dinner plans.", 'That was to be the last phone call Avis Banks would ever make. Immediately after hanging up the phone from Avis, phone records show Keyon called Carla. That call bounced off this tower, which is roughly a quarter mile from the house Keyon shared with Avis.', 'MICHAEL GUEST: The cell tower records showed that Miss Hughes was in the area. There was one call that occurred, I believe, at 5:37, another at roughly 6:04, 6:05. So within a 30-minute period of time, we can place her in the vicinity of the crime.', 'The detectives believed Avis Banks was murdered between 5:50 and 6:00 PM. If Carla was near the house when Keyon called her at 5:37 and Carla was calling Keyon from that same area at 6:05, that would seem to suggest that the two middle school teachers were possibly partners in murder.', "DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: We think that he's had conversations with Carla prior to coming home that night, to where she indicated to him what she had done, probably in an attempt for the two of them to be together.", "One of those conversations may well have taken place here, at Carla's townhouse. This is where Carla said Keyon Pittman came after basketball practice to pick up some groceries he'd dropped off earlier. According to Carla, he spent about 45 minutes and left at 8:30. At 8:31, cell records show he was on the phone again, this time not to Avis to say he was headed home, but to Avis' mother Debra in Vicksburg.", 'DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: Keyon made the phone call to Debra Banks while he was en route home asking if she had heard from Avis, which, according to Debra, is just extremely unusual and just out of character for Keyon. So I felt like certainly that he knew at that point.', "HODA KOTB: There were lots of red flags flapping all over this case that are pointing to him. Why wasn't he charged as an accessory?", "The key to prosecuting Keyon, they felt, was Carla Hughes, but she wasn't talking. Carla Hughes wanted no part of a plea deal.

This time, Carla would be on trial for her life, and Keyon's secret life would be laid bare for all to see.", 'MICHAEL GUEST: Myself and Senator Walls, we wore dual hats. We were both prosecuting and defending. We knew that, you know, the defense was going to have to try to shift the blame off of Carla Hughes, and we knew that the person that they were going to shift that blame onto was, in fact, Keyon Pittman.', 'From the outset, prosecutors seemed to have ample evidence to prove the former beauty queen was a killer.', 'MICHAEL GUEST: There will be but one verdict which you can reach, and that verdict will be that this defendant, Carla Hughes, is in fact guilty of capital murder in the death of Avis Banks.', 'Not only did they have witnesses who would say Carla had the murder weapon in her position...', 'MICHAEL GUEST: Do you become concerned that this gun may have been used in a crime?', "...they also had lab tests that revealed Avis Banks' blood was found on a pair of shoes found in Carla's closet.", "MICHAEL GUEST: The tread pattern of those shoes matches the tread pattern that officers had photographed and documented and observed on the rear door of Avis Banks' residence.", 'And then there were the cell phone records. With graphs, charts and expert testimony, the prosecution could put Carla Hughes in close proximity to the murder scene.', 'MICHAEL GUEST: But the records of Carla Hughes show that at 5:37 PM and then again at, I believe, 6:05 PM, that she is either making or receiving two phone calls, and that those calls both are bouncing off a tower located less than a quarter of a mile from the residence where Avis Banks was killed.', "At the same time, cell records seemed to provide a convincing alibi for Keyon Pittman, the ex-boyfriend Carla's defense team hoped to implicate.", 'MICHAEL GUEST: It would have been impossible for him to have left basketball practice, gone home, committed the murder and then returned to basketball practice.', 'It seemed like a solid case. But with nine women on the jury, prosecutors were well aware that their biggest problem could be their key witness, Keyon Pittman.', "The dicey job of managing Keyon's testimony fell to veteran assistant prosecutor John Emfinger.", "JOHN EMFINGER: Keyon Pittman's story is essential to the case. His relationship with Avis Banks, his relationship with Carla Hughes, that's the sum and total of this case. And so he had to tell the story because we couldn't get it from anywhere else.", 'From the very beginning, Keyon Pittman appeared to be on the verge of an emotional meltdown, but in this room he would find little sympathy.', 'With Carla Hughes sitting just a few feet away, Keyon Pittman recounted how their relationship had begun in August 2006 as a friendship between colleagues at Chastain Middle School. Then, he said, it quickly blossomed into a torrid affair worthy of Hollywood.', 'But the movie scenes Keyon described seemed more like "Fatal Attraction" than "Love Story."', 'JOHN EMFINGER: What did you think was going on? What did you think was happening?', "According to Keyon Pittman, the relationship was all about sex. In addition to frequent liaisons at her townhouse, Keyon said they'd even managed a romantic weekend in Memphis when he'd told Avis he was helping a friend move.", 'JOHN EMFINGER: Were you going to leave Avis Banks for Carla Hughes, or how did you view the long-term prospects for your relationship with Carla Hughes?', 'But before long, Keyon said he noticed that Carla was taking their sexual romps a little too seriously. He said she insisted he meet her parents and introduced him to friends as her future husband. At one point, he said, she even told him she was pregnant.', 'Though that pregnancy turned out to be a false alarm, Keyon told the court that Carla started stalking him and Avis, and even threatened to confront Avis face to face.', "KEYON PITTMAN: After that, she just went the other way. I'm not sure where she went, but she didn't come to the house that night.", "A close call, to be sure. But, according to Keyon, no matter how often he told Carla he would never leave Avis, she would not let up. On the weekend after Thanksgiving that year, Keyon told the court that Carla had rented a hotel room in Picayune, Mississippi, where he and Avis were visiting his mother. Through text messages, Keyon says she asked him to leave Avis at his mother's house and meet up with her at a restaurant outside of", 'JOHN EMFINGER: What was the nature of your visit or your conversation with Miss Hughes at that point in time?', 'This was where the delicate, high-wire work began.

If I hadn't been thinking poorly, making bad choices, or made a bad choice to sleep around and flirt with other women, this chain of events would have never taken place, probably.", "JOHN EMFINGER: Now, you don't have any personal knowledge about who may have killed Avis, do you?", "JOHN EMFINGER: The only information that you have or that you know is things that you've read in the media or that you may have heard during the course of the investigation of the case, is that correct?", "JOHN EMFINGER: I'm convinced that he did not know about it beforehand. I am convinced that when he left Carla Hughes' apartment that night that he knew something was wrong. His explanation to me is he's never been able to not contact Avis.", "Carla Hughes' attorney, Johnnie Walls, was considerably less inclined to give Keyon Pittman the benefit of the doubt when his turn came to offer a defense.", 'JOHNNIE WALLS: The evidence in this case is going to show you that Keyon Pittman was their suspect and he still should be their suspect, and the evidence will show that you that you should let Carla Hughes go home.', 'JOHNNIE WALLS: Have you found any evidence, fingerprints or otherwise, that places Carla Hughes in that house?', "For three years, while his only child sat in jail awaiting trial for murder, Carl Hughes kept the faith. Her ribbons and trophies might be vanishing beneath blankets of dust, but her father's pride remained untarnished.", "Carl felt it in his bones. His little girl was not, could never have been the person prosecutors now portrayed as a cold-blooded killer. With her former lover now married to someone else, Carl could see only one explanation for Carla's refusal to implicate him.", "CARL HUGHES: I don't think she knows anything. I honestly don't think she knows anything.", 'CARL HUGHES: Because if she knew, she would have told us something, and especially after he gets married.', "But Carla's attorney, Johnnie Walls, knew he had to tell the jury something, an alternative theory that might convince at least one juror that someone other than Carla Hughes killed Avis Banks.", 'With that in mind, the defense attorney became a prosecutor, and set his sites on Keyon Pittman.', "JOHNNIE WALLS: My prosecution did not have to show the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Keyon did it. My prosecution was to show the jury that there's another theory with this evidence. The evidence in this case is going to show you that Keyon Pittman is the one that had the opportunity, had the ability and had the motive.", "According to Walls, Keyon Pittman must have planted incriminating evidence, the gun and a pair of blood-flecked shoes in Carla's townhouse, after the murder. Because police found no trace of her at the scene of the crime.", 'JOHNNIE WALLS: Have you found any evidence, fingerprints or otherwise, that places Carla Hughes in that house?', 'In fact, Walls argued that a police dog had failed to turn up even the scent of a stranger at the murder scene. On the other hand, the lawyer accused the police of dropping the ball when they had Keyon Pittman in the police station that night.', 'JOHNNIE WALLS: If you really consider him a suspect, why not check his clothes for gunpowder residue?', "They didn't check his clothes. Checked his hands, though. And they found gunpowder particles on his hands.", "JOHNNIE WALLS: Well, if they found them on his hands, why not go further and check his clothes? They didn't. Okay. If they did, they never showed the report to us.", 'The cell phone records that prosecutors said put Carla in the area, Walls said, amounted to nothing. She lived less than four miles from the murder scene and happened to be out running errands that night.', 'JOHNNIE WALLS:They could not even put her on the street. With the cell phone evidence, they could put her in the zone. But the zone is two and a half mile radius.', "On the stand, Keyon had claimed that he rushed home from Carla's house that night because he'd become concerned about not hearing from Avis while he was at basketball practice.", "KEYON PITTMAN: I kept going home. I picked up my pace, you know, trying to get home because it wasn't like her not to call.", "Johnnie Walls was skeptical. Cell phone records showed that Keyon had called Avis' cell twice that day, once at lunchtime and once again just before he arrived home and found her body.", "Why so few calls to Avis if he'd been concerned about her? Walls argued that Keyon clearly had time to call because cell records showed dozens of calls and text messages he'd made to others during basketball practice that night. Besides his calls to Carla, Walls argued, Keyon was also busy flirting with another woman, a Bridgette Matlock, the mother of one of his players.", "JOHNNIE WALLS: Didn't you text Bridgette or call Bridgette on the 29th at least 40 times during the day?", "As for Keyon's claim that Carla had stalked him, Johnnie Walls said it was Keyon who had pursued Carla, Keyon who had constantly called her, and it was Keyon who'd brazenly parked his mistress's motorcycle right under Avis' nose in his garage.", "JOHNNIE WALLS: Oh, okay. Well, did you tell your future wife that that motorcycle belongs to a sex partner that I'm having sex with?", "JOHNNIE WALLS: When you told her that the motorcycle was for a buddy, didn't you lie?", 'KEYON PITTMAN: I covered it up. If you asking me if I ever told a lie or whatever, yes, I have told lies before.', "It was a withering assault on Keyon Pittman's character. Johnnie Walls even produced a witness who claimed Keyon had left basketball practice early, suggesting that Keyon could've possible driven home and killed Avis himself. But after two days on the stand, the most important part of Keyon's story, his alibi, still stood.", 'JOHN EMFINGER: Counsel asked you a number of times what would have kept you from standing in that door when Avis got home from work and doing this to Avis. Okay? Between 5:45 and 6:15, where were you?', "In the end, believing that he'd done all he could to create a reasonable doubt, the attorney decided not to put his client on the stand.", 'And so, after six days of testimony, the jury of nine women and three men retired to consider the fate of Carla Hughes.', 'If convicted of a double homicide, she would face either a life sentence or death. If acquitted, the family of Avis Banks would be left wondering who killed Avis. And yet, in spite of the stakes, two families, linked by tragedy, had managed over the years since the murder to rise above rancor and forge an unlikely bond.', 'FRED BANKS: You know, we sitting over there. They sitting over here, so they think we angry.', 'FRED BANKS: As the trial went on, we started talking. You know, real nice people sitting up there.', 'JUDGE: All right, the court having received the verdicts, if the defendant would please rise.', 'There had been many times in her life when Carla Hughes had stood before an audience waiting to be judged. But this time, there was more than a tiara, scholarship money or a bouquet at stake: this time it was her life.', 'JUDGE: We, the jury, find the defendant Carla Hughes guilty of capital murder as charged in count one of the indictment, guilty of capital murder as charged in count two of the indictment.', 'And this time, her composure cracked under the weight of it all. In that moment, Fred Banks silently pointed to the sky and acknowledged the daughter he believed was watching from on high. A burden had been lifted.', "Across the aisle, a shadow of disbelief settled over two parents who'd made raising the perfect daughter their life's work.", "CARL HUGHES: I couldn't believe it. Just couldn't believe it. And I guess the hardest part was when they was taking her away. And she said, `Daddy, help me.' And there's nothing I can do. And that's probably the hardest part of it.", 'Immediately after the court recessed, attention turned to the penalty phase, where prosecutors were prepared to argue that Carla Hughes pay for the death of Avis Banks with her life.', 'MICHAEL GUEST: The thing about the case that bothered me was the fact that Miss Banks was pregnant. She was five months pregnant. She had done nothing to Carla Hughes. And then for her to be killed in the manner in which she was killed, I believe that this was a case that death needed to be an option for the jury.', 'But while the prosecution focused on the brutal death of Avis Banks, the defense wanted the jury to hear about the life of Carla Hughes.', 'LINDA HUGHES: We received her when she was six weeks old. My cousin was in distress with other children, and she was not able to afford to take care of all of the children. And as soon as the two of us walked in that room and looked at that beautiful child, we knew we had to take her and raise her in the way that the Lord would have us to do.', 'With the help of a hastily assembled cast of character witnesses, Johnnie Walls told the story of how that little girl had gone from having an uncertain future to a bright and shining one', "JOHNNIE WALLS: You should want her to live so that maybe while she's there she can help somebody, like she's always done. So I ask you to spare her life because when you kill her, there's nothing you can do to bring her back. And if it's later determined that somebody else committed this crime, you won't be able to correct that!", 'After a one-hour deliberation, the jury returned to the courtroom one last time.', 'JUDGE: As to count one, sentence is, we the jury find that the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. As to count two, the life imprisonment without parole.', "It was then, when the courtroom was filled with the finality of such monumental waste, that a rare moment of grace shone through. Two fathers who'd invested all they had in their daughters consoled each other and said goodbye.", 'FRED BANKS: I saw me in him. The verdict came and I walked out, he just happened to be coming out, too, and I grabbed his hand to shake his hand, and I could see he was trying to embrace me, so I embraced him.', 'The man at the center of the case that brought Carl Hughes and Fred Banks together in that courtroom has now moved on and built a new life for himself a thousand miles away. But Detectives John Neal and Frank', 'Dillard say that even though Keyon Pittman was never charged in the murder of Avis Banks, he is still on their radar...', "DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have the person in jail serving a life term who killed Avis Banks. We're absolutely confident in that, 100 percent. Our angle on Keyon Pittman is some type of an accessory.", 'DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: Aided her in setting it up or, at the very least, knew before he got to the house that she had been murdered.', 'Dateline tried to reach Keyon Pittman for comment for this story at his home in Michigan, but he did not return our calls.', "DETECTIVE JOHN NEAL: We're hoping that Carla wants to talk to us at some point in time. We think that she's the one that holds the key to if Keyon was involved. And it may be that she drops another bombshell on us and he wasn't involved in any way.", 'CARLA HUGHES: [telephone] That is one of the biggest or the biggest misconception about my case, that I know something that I could tell the police.', 'In a phone interview from the prison where she is currently serving her life sentence, Carla Hughes told me she had never met Avis Banks and knows nothing about her murder.', "CARLA HUGHES: [telephone] I have a five-year-old son who was two at the time, and if there was anything that I could have told the police, you can believe that I would have told them from day one. I did not know anything about it and I didn't participate in it. I was ultimately framed and used, and that's all I do know. That's all I could tell police.", "Though Carla Hughes is currently appealing her conviction, Debra Banks says she is confident that Carla and the young man who almost became her son-in-law, Keyon Pittman, will never be able to escape her daughter's gaze.", 'DEBRA BANKS: Every time him and Carla close they eyes, they see Avis. He see her. He see her.', "ANN CURRY: And you can find more information about this story on our Web site. And that's all for this edition of Dateline Friday.
