["This photo, provided by Associated Press writer Matt Crenson, shows Crenson's great grandfather, Gus Crenson, with his wife, Lillian, on their wedding day in 1919 in Liverpool, England. Genetic tests on Matt indicate that both Gus and Matt may have Jewish ancestry. ", '        This much we know: He was about 5-foot-2, bald, with hooded eyes, thin lips and a deadpan look that gave nothing away.', 'What a convenient sequence of events both for Gus and the nation, which at just that moment desperately needed sailors to ferry supplies across the Atlantic to its allies in World War I.', 'Most of our genetic material gets passed from one generation to the next through a process known as recombination. Recombination keeps us from being clones by giving everyone (except identical twins) a unique combination of genes, half from each parent.', 'That mixing process makes most of our DNA practically useless for inferring ancestry, at least with current technology. But there are two small sections of the genetic code that never recombine. The Y-chromosome, which confers maleness, is passed directly from fathers to their sons. Another odd little package of genes known as mitochondrial DNA is always inherited from the mother.', 'Those two portions of DNA can only change by mutation. That means if you know how fast the genes of the Y-chromosome or mitochondrial DNA mutate over the generations, you can calculate how long ago two people shared a common ancestor by comparing their genetic code.', 'Mitochondrial DNA mutates relatively slowly. So it is hard to use it to find out about what happened in the last few generations, or even in historical times. It is better-suited to studying the expansion of the human species out of Africa 70,000 years ago, the arrival of people in the Americas more than 12,000 years ago or the spread of agriculture into Europe after the ice age.', 'But the Y-chromosome mutates faster, making it practical for exploring genealogical relationships in the last few hundred years. That was exactly what I needed.', 'I contacted a genetic testing organization, Family Tree DNA, based in Houston. I scraped my cheek with a little brush, dropped it into a preservative solution and sent it off.', 'Then I waited as the company extracted the DNA from my spit sample and created a genetic profile of it. The procedure is very similar to forensic DNA fingerprinting, which looks at multiple sites where the genetic code can vary from one person to another. Look at enough sites, and the particular combination of variants in any given person is virtually unique.', 'Family Tree DNA looked at 37 sites on my Y-chromosome. Then they compared my DNA profile to those in a database of 60,000 men from around the world. The price of a Y-chromosome test ranges from $149 to $349, depending on the level of precision.', 'I called Bennett Greenspan, founder of Family Tree DNA, and told him that I had some questions about my results. He opened up my site.', 'The closest to me was another poor slob who had no idea where his ancestors came from. After that, two guys whose ancestors came from Ukraine and Galicia, on the border between Poland and Ukraine. Then Hungary. Another Ukraine. A couple of Germanys.', 'And it makes sense that I would be descended from German Jews, Greenspan said. Because of the Holocaust, descendants of German Jews are relatively rare today. So like me, they frequently find themselves most closely matching the descendants of Jews from Eastern Europe.', 'Then again, Gus may have known nothing of his ancestry. It is entirely possible that, half a century after his death, I am learning something very personal about Gus that he never knew himself.']
