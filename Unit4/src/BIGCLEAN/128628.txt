"Strong effective membership of the EU contributes to this."', 'Australia valued the role that Britain played in shaping EU foreign policy, it added. "I hope to see this continue long into the future," the author, whose name and signature had been blanked out at the bottom, said.', 'A second letter sent from an unidentified individual based at Parliament House in Canberra said EU membership allowed Britain to better "leverage" its global influence and meant it was viewed as "a platform for trade and investment in the broader EU market."', '"I encourage the UK to maintain its influence by remaining an engaged participant of the EU internal market," it said. With a market of 500 million people, the EU is Britain\'s main trading partner.', "The British government said in Monday's review that the economic benefits of Britain's EU membership outweighed the loss of independence on policy.", 'However, polls suggest more Britons want to leave the EU than stay in. A YouGov poll in May said 46 percent would vote to leave, 35 percent would opt to stay in, 16 percent were undecided and 4 percent would not vote.', 'Cameron says his preference is for Britain to remain inside a reformed EU. Trailing slightly in most polls, it remains unclear whether he will win the next election.', "He has said he will try to renegotiate Britain's membership before giving people a straight in-out vote.", 'Australia is not among the top ten foreign investors in Britain, but in 2011 British government statistics put the value of existing Australian investments at 11.6 billion pounds.', ' (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2013.
