['The genetic pattern, known as an inversion, is a stretch of the DNA code that runs backwards in people who carry it.', 'More than 29.000 Icelanders donated DNA samples to a database open to scientists, which DeCODE specializes in studying.', 'Genes are carried on structures known as the chromosomes. The DNA code varies from person to person, but the genes and other part of the code generally lie along the same chromosomes in the same order.', 'This large stretch of DNA is on chromosome 17, Augustine Kong and Kari Stefansson of DeCODE found. They are checking to see whether the inversion affects the function of the genes contained in it.', 'About 21 percent of all Europeans they looked at have the same inversion, which they named H2, but just 6 percent of Africans and 1 percent of Asians.', 'The effects of the H2 inversion are not seen on an individual level, as each carrier produces an average 0.06 more children. But across populations and generations, it adds up, the researchers said.', 'Calculations suggest the inversion has existed for about three million years, the researchers said.', 'It could be that the inversion has survived in the human genetic code for that long.', 'Or it could be that modern Homo sapiens bred with earlier species, such as Homo erectus, and inherited the genetic variation that way. The two species may have lived side by side for a time before Homo erectus went extinct, sometime between 400,000 and 50,000 years ago.', 'And the researchers say the inversion makes carriers more fertile. In each generation, an H2 carrier has about 3.2 percent more children than people without the sequence.']
