U.S. home-builder confidence in the market for single family homes rose in  May amid rising home prices despite increasing building materials costs, an  index showed on Wednesday.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index  edged up three points to 44, from a downwardly revised 41 in April. Economists  in a Reuters survey were expecting a reading of 43. Any number over 50 indicates  that more builders view conditions as good than poor."Builders are noting an increased sense of urgency among potential buyers as  a result of thinning inventories of homes for sale, continuing affordable  mortgage rates and strengthening local economies," said NAHB Chairman Rick  Judson, a home builder from Charlotte, N.C. "This is definitely an encouraging  sign even amidst rising challenges with regard to the cost and availability of  building materials, lots and labor." Each component of the index rose in May. The index gauging current sales  conditions inched up four points to 48, while the index measuring expectations  for future sales rose a single point to 53, the highest level since February  2007. The index gauging traffic of prospective buyers increased three points to  33."While industry supply chains will take time to re-establish themselves  following recession-related cutbacks, builders\' views of current sales  conditions have improved and expectations for the future remain quite strong as  consumers head back to the market in force," said NAHB Chief Economist David  Crowe.
