['Dr. Susan Debin, 64, of Orange, Calif., turned to a hybrid concierge practice two years ago. About 125 patients pay $1,600 a year for extra services including an extended physical and her personal cell phone number. But what about the rest of her patients?', 'As many as 5,000 doctors nationwide have opted for full or partial concierge practices. Surveys suggest that number could quadruple within the next few years. ', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'The move to smaller, premium practices will worsen an already dire shortage of primary care doctors, creating an elite group of well-compensated physicians who see fewer and fewer upscale patients, dumping the rest on their increasingly harried colleagues, critics contend. ', "Changes to your care? Overhaul's impactBut proponents of direct-pay and concierge care say the new models are the result of frustrated doctors defecting from a broken medical system, one that forces physicians to see too many patients for too little pay and with too much red tape. ", 'Engelhardt and others reject charges of elitism, saying that paying extra for medical care is no different than affording other amenities of modern life, like a $4 daily latte or a fancy cell phone plan.', 'The movement toward concierge care has exploded in recent years. Five years ago, there were 250 concierge doctors in the nation, serving perhaps 100,000 patients. Today, more than 5,000 primary care doctors run retainer practices serving 500,000 patients, according to the Society for Innovative Medical Practice Design, a concierge association. ', 'An additional 7 percent of doctors surveyed in 2008 by the independent Physicians Foundation plan to switch to a concierge practice within three years. ', "For the Goodriches, the differences are clear. When Marjorie Goodrich goes to the doctor, she doesn't sit in the regular waiting room that her husband uses, with its close-set chairs and drab paint. She enters a different door in back, where plush chairs, fresh coffee and bottled water are available. More important, she sees Debin every time, while her husband typically sees a newer doctor or a nurse practitioner. ", 'Worse, it was barely possible to assess illness, let alone prevent it, which attracted Debin to primary care in the first place. ', 'By the end of the night, however, Scherrey and her husband had decided to join. Scherrey, who works at an insurance agency primarily to ensure health coverage, said top-quality medical care should be available to anyone willing to pay for it. ', '\t    Mary Ann Scherrey, 64, a cancer survivor from Whittier, Calif., said paying for premium health care is a wise choice for her and her husband.', 'Despite the attention being lavished on health reform, none of the proposals now in play is likely to change the way doctors are paid, which is the key to actual overhaul, according to Weil, the concierge care analyst.
