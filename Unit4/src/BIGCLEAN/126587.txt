If the distribution of the cake is unfair, those who make the cake won\'t feel motivated to bake it." Political analysts say the spat, which was widely aired on Chinese media last year, drives to the heart of the factional problems besetting the CCP.', "The political divisions came to a boil in March 2012, when China's national legislature convened its annual meeting in Beijing.", 'Speaking to reporters on March 9 on the sidelines of a panel discussion of Chongqing delegates, Bo defended his policies. "Ask any citizen on the street if they support fighting corruption and they\'ll say \'yes\'," he boomed.

Wen also refered to the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution - a reference that alluded to Bo's red revival in Chongqing - and said that the city's stellar double-digit economic performance had been the fruits of several administrations and not just Bo's work alone.", 'On March 15, the state-run Xinhua news service announced that Bo had been dismissed as Chongqing party chief and, almost a month later, he was suspended from the CCP\'s Central Committee and its Politburo-- the second-highest decision-making body in China -- ahead of investigations for "serious disciplinary violations."', "Bo's dismissal is the most sensational political scandal to hit the Chinese Communist Party in recent years.", 'As a "princeling" - a son of a revolutionary veteran -- Bo was considered a strong contender for promotion into the Standing Committee of the party\'s Politburo, whose nine members decide how to run China.', 'His father Bo Yibo, who had a similar relaxed and open style, was imprisoned and tortured during the Cultural Revolution as a "capitalist roader."', "His credentials as an economic reformer were cemented during the 1980s when he famously visited the Boeing factory in the United States. Seeing just two planes on the tarmac, Bo senior asked if they were the only planes the factory planned to produce. When he was told that Boeing only made the planes that were on its order books, he immediately saw the problems of China's planned economy which produced goods regardless of whether there was a market or not.", 'Bo Xilai himself spent five years in jail during the Cultural Revolution and was said to have denounced his father during the tumultuous political upheaval -- an action that some argue may have cost him political allies in a culture that strongly values family ties.', "After his release, Bo entered Peking University's history department in 1977 and two years later, after gaining a degree, Bo got into the master's degree program in journalism, the first ever, at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.", '"His top ambition then was to be a Chinese journalist posted overseas," recalls a classmate and close friend of Bo.', 'He shows too much personality and charisma in the post-Mao political culture that emphasizes collective leadership.Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at the University of Iowa', 'After graduation, however, Bo did not pursue his ambition to become a foreign correspondent. Instead, he worked his way up as a local party and government official.', 'He spent 17 years in Dalian, a charming but gritty coastal city in northeastern China. He became Dalian mayor in 1993 and transformed it into a popular investment and tourism destination.', "As early as 1999, Bo was expected to move to Beijing for a ministerial post but his promotion was aborted when he failed to get elected into the Central Committee, the Communist Party's ruling elite.", 'Bo served as the governor and later party chief of Liaoning, a rust-belt region in northeast China which then boasted of large but mostly money-losing state-owned enterprises. In Liaoning, Bo dealt with high unemployment and endemic corruption.', 'In 2004, when Bo finally got elected into the elite Central Committee, he moved to Beijing as minister of trade and commerce.', '"He was a tough and effective negotiator in terms of defending China\'s global trade policies and interests," said Wenran Jiang, a professor at the University of Alberta and Bo\'s former classmate at Peking University.', "For decades, Jiang recalled that Bo stood out as one of China's most dynamic and maverick politicians. Instead of reading prepared speeches, for example, he often spoke extemporaneously.", '"He would have had a chance to become China\'s top leader, if China had direct elections.

Wang was promoted to vice mayor as a reward.', 'On February 8, 2012, Wang was unexpectedly reported to be "on leave" for health reasons. Days later, Wang mysteriously fled into the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, six hours\' drive away from Chongqing.', 'The next day, Wang left the consulate "of his own volition," U.S. officials said, and was taken into custody by security officials.', 'It remains unclear why Wang attempted to seek refuge in the U.S. consulate and what repercussions his action may have.
