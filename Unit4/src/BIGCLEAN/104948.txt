['            US one step closer to clean, almost limitless energy as magnetic force crunches cylinder', '        A crushed tube the size of a thread spool has brought the United States one step closer to harnessing nuclear fusion as a clean, almost limitless, power source. ', '"Our experiments were designed to test a sweet spot predicted by the simulations where a sufficiently robust liner could implode with a sufficiently high velocity," said Ryan McBride, a researcher at the laboratories in Albuquerque. ', 'Such careful balance is needed to crush the beryllium cylinder in the right way to achieve sustainable fusion someday. A thicker cylinder would make the crushing implosion less efficient, and a thinner cylinder could rip apart under the stress.', 'The cylinder is designed to hold a BB-sized fuel capsule containing deuterium fuel. Seawater contains huge amounts of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, and half a bathtub of seawater could theoretically create the energy equivalent of 40 train cars of coal. ', 'The Sandia test used a laser to preheat the metal cylinder before zapping it with electricity to create the crushing magnetic fields. Other inertial confinement fusion efforts would harness even more powerful lasers, such as the cluster of lasers at the National Ignition Facility that focus like a mini-Death Star on a target. [ Record-Breaking Laser Shot Paves Way to Fusion Energy ] ', 'Sandia researchers have used simulations to show that their Z machine could trigger "break-even" nuclear fusion that creates just a bit more energy than it takes in. But a more powerful machine could eventually lead to "high-gain" fusion using the new crushing technique, creating more than 1,000 times the energy put in, thereby making fusion power practical. ', '"We are now confident enough to take the next steps on the Z facility of integrating in the new magnetic field and laser preheat capabilities that will be required to test the full concept," said Dan Sinars, manager at Sandia National Laboratories.
