[" Has the high cost of health care forced you to cut back on medical expenses - including doctor visits or prescription medicines. If so, we'd like to hear from you. If you're interested in sharing your story, send us an e-mail telling us a little about who you are, where you live and what kind of cutbacks you've had to make. Be sure to include contact information so we can get in touch. (We won't publish any stories without contacting you first.)"]
