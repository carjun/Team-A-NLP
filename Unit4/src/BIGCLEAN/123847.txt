An update aired on Friday, Aug. 28, 2009.', '        Take a luxurious cruise ship, handsome honeymooners, add sun-drenched ports of call, parties till dawn... and an ugly blood stain on the awning over the life boat deck, and you have the ingredients for a classic old-fashioned mystery like a dusty Agatha Christie. ', "Dennis Murphy, Dateline NBC: You've got a floating crime scene here, don't you? Potentially.", 'Is it even knowable what happened aboard the vessel Brilliance of the Seas, somewhere between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean Sea?', 'George had graduated from Babson College in Massachusetts with a business degree, a background he hoped to bring to the family store when his father retired.', 'The tantalyzing ports of call included Barcelona, the French Riviera, Rome, and the Greek Islands.', 'The 2500-passenger cruise ship is one of the most popular in the Royal Caribbean fleet. A virtual floating city of cabins, restaurants, bars, a casino, and health club, everything for travellers who want to see some of the world and still bring the comforts of the mall along with them.', '"We attract a lot of active vacationers, a lot of families," says Lynn Martenstein, then-vice-president with Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines.', 'On June 29, four days after the Newport Wedding, the couple boarded the cruise ship in Barcelona, Spain.', 'They and every other passenger were issued a card called a Seapass or an A-Pass:an electronic key embedded with your photo that not only opens your cabin, but records the precise time of day you entered and left. The same goes for boarding and leaving the ship.', 'Leaving Barcelona, settled into their stateroom, from their balcony, George and Jennifer could watch the water gliding by that night as they made their way to the first port of call, the south of France.', 'An important new chapter in their lives had opened-up. They were young, by all accounts in love... and he had only five nights left to live.', 'The honeymooners, Jennifer and George, had booked themselves on a snazzy state of the art cruise ship, a floating five-star hotel with round-the-clock diversions.', 'Up on deck 7, Illinois teenager Emilie Rausch and her sister, cruising with their mom, were thrilled with the view out their balcony.', 'This particular line of ship was designed with active families in mind more than the sedate retirees, of the cruise ship stereotype. ', 'Up on deck 9, Clete Hyman, for instance, a deputy police chief from Redlands, Calif., now retired, had reserved cabins for eight extended family members: a stress-free, no cell phones, no e-mail, spin around the Med.', 'And the cruise line delivered on schedule...the delights of Florence on July 1st. And wonderful weather in Rome on the 2nd.', 'Two days into the trip, though, Clete Hyman did have one complaint. After leaving France, the young couple in the cabin right next door, no. 9062, had a noisy party with he guessed four to six other people that lasted until 3 a.m. ', 'After dinner, the young crowd would try their luck at the casino on deck 6, continuing the festivities late into the night at the disco bar on 13, with the newlyweds sometimes joining them.', 'Greer: Fun, good group of guys, loud. You know, 18-to-20-year old guys on a boat partying.', 'On the Fourth of July, the ship tied up in Mykonos. The Greek island with the whitewashed houses and blue doors was as beautiful as the brochures.', "Murphy: So he doesn't stagger out of the casino that night with a wad of hundreds in his pocket?", 'With the night in full swing, Josh would make an emphatic point about what he thinks he sees next. ', 'Packed into the elevator with the party-ers is the casino manager and one of his dealers. Josh says he thinks he sees the casino manager put a move on Jennifer, right in front of her by now very drunk husband.', "Greer: Jennifer's there, but there's a couch adjacent to the table. Jennifer sits down on the couch with the casino manager sitting right next to her.", 'The boys sat in a semi-circle, doing shooters of absinthe, almost in a kind of ritual.', 'Greer: The lights go on. Time for everybody to go to their rooms. The Russian boys and Josh escort George back to his room.', 'Jennifer is no longer with the guys. For months, there would be speculation about her whereabouts in the next four and a half hours.', 'Hyman: This went on for a period of time. And then we heard what sounded like arguing out on the balcony.', 'Murphy: So after you heard these voices on the balcony part of the cabin, what happened next?', 'Now it was about 4:15 in the morning. Chief Hyman heard the adjacent cabin door open and voices receding in the hallway.', 'Hyman: So, I waited for a couple of seconds and then opened the door and looked out.', 'Whoever was next door the chief says he heard them moving between the cabin and the balcony. It was now approaching 4:20.', 'Hyman: And then for the last, maybe, couple of minutes it appeared to be concentrated out on the balcony area. The chairs on the balcony are metal so they make a different type of sound. I heard that noise and then there was silence. It got very quiet. Heard no voice. It was just very quiet.', 'Hyman: The first thought in my mind was somebody fell on the balcony because it was the last place I had heard anyone. However, I quickly dismissed that because the noise was just too loud. There was actually a reverberation to the noise. And somebody just falling you know off their feet to something on a balcony would not cause that much noise.', 'Greg Lawyer: And then all of a sudden there was a lot of noise coming from the cabin next door, the George Smith cabin, and what it sounded to me like is somebody was throwing things against the wall, like throwing furniture in the room against the wall or against the floor. ', 'Greg Laywer: And these there were maybe a series of shuffles and bangs against the wall. And then it ended with one big thud like somebody had picked up the couch or the sofa and threw it against the wall. And then that occurred, it was maybe a stretch of like two minutes, something like that, where these thuds took place, what I call trashing the room and then it went quiet.', 'Greg Lawyer, curious, opened the door to see two uniformed ship personnel standing outside the Smith cabin.', 'With the offending loud party now over, Royal Caribbean says the uniformed men left without entering the Smith cabin.', 'Chief Hyman and his wife could finally get some peace and quiet and a few hours sleep.', 'At 7 a.m., the chief went out on his balcony to take some snapshots of the Turkish port and peeked around the partition to the Smith cabin next door. He saw cigarette butts, and the metal chairs and coffee table moved. ', 'Hyman: I noticed that the drapes had been pulled back. That was allowing me to see in that the bed appeared to have been slept in. The sheets were in disarray.', 'Murphy: Did you notice if the furniture in the room had in fact been moved around?', 'The chief, and so many of the other guests wondered, as wild rumor and speculation swept every nook and cranny of the ship. There was buzz about missing money and blood found in the cabin.', 'How was it that George Smith fell to a terrible and certain death in the sea between Greece and Turkey?', 'George Smith, 11 days into his marriage, had disappeared from the luxury cruise ship.', 'Lynn Martenstein, cruise line vice president at the time of the incident: We started notifying proper authorities. In this case it was the FBI and American consulates, because we were dealing with an American citizen. It was the Turkish authorities because we had just docked in a Turkish port.', 'Martenstein: They took samples. They took photographs. They dusted for fingerprints. They did their forensic investigation both of the cabin and the metal overhang. They spent the better part of the day on the ship.', 'By 6 p.m. that night, the blood stain on the overhang was cleaned and according to some passengers, painted over. The Turkish investigation on the ship was concluded.', 'Jennifer, according to the Cruise Line spokesperson, gave a statement to the Turks in the presence of an FBI representative and was then flown home to the U.S.', "Josh's statement is the only one we know about in detail. That's because his mother and father sneaked a home video camera to their son's appearance before Turkish authorities on shore. And those bootlegged pictures capture a chaotic initial inquiry. ", "Josh, in the red shirt, is being asked here to set down a perfunctory chronology of what he did and saw and then sign the statement when it's typed up.", 'Interrogator through a translator: And then you took George to the room and he was very drunk.', 'Interrogator through a translator: Yeah, is it the same story. You took George to the room and he was very drunk.', 'Josh signs the statement and after the initial business is over, makes a point of defending Jennifer and implicating the casino manager.', 'After our interview, the cruise line V.P. added another detail about Jennifer: She allegedly left the disco bar alone at about 3:20 and a custodian on that deck, deck 13, thought she was wobbly and needed help. The custodian rode down with her in the elevator to 9, her cabin deck level.', 'Dateline asked Van Zandt, an NBC News analyst, to look at the public record of evidence in the George Smith case.', 'What about an accident? Both witnesses either side of the Smith cabin noticed one of the metal balcony chairs had been turned around so that its back was near the 4-foot railing.', 'Hypothetically, did George Smith, foolishly perch on the balcony rail for a breath of fresh air or literally a last cigarette?', "Van Zandt: I push the chair up against the balcony. I sit up on the edge. I have a cigarette. The ship hits a bump or something and I go over the side? We can't say that didn't happen because we dont have the body to get the forensics from. So I cannot at all discount the idea of an accident.", 'Van Zandt: We get homicide and accident. We take our legal pad. We draw a line down the middle and then we start to build a case on either side and see which one we can support with the evidence.', 'We looked at each bit of evidence, in turn, starting with the photo of the bloodstain.', 'Van Zandt: When you look at this picture here do you see this point right here? That looks like that was pooling blood. This is 10 feet-plus wide here so if a human body fell here, if this is perhaps evidence of a head injury.', "Since the bloodstain doesn't tell the full story, that makes the statements by witnessess all the more important.", "Assuming those three people had just come from George's room, Van Zandt thinks that could be important for the foul-play theory. Remember they had been a group of five.", 'Van Zandt: Four as a posse, plus George. Five. Three out the door. George is still there. Where is the other person? And who is that? Somewhere in between is the story of that fourth person.', "But the attorney for one of the Russian boys now says Clete Hyman's recollection is wrong. He insists all four boys left George's room together, which would mean there is no fourth person left to account for.", 'Van Zandt: The challenge here is this single voice. Is this allegedly highly-intoxicated man talking to himself? Is he rambling on because he drank too much, because he won money... or, is this, perhaps, George Smith laid out on a bed? And this other person still in the room of this group of four, this one is still there?', 'Murphy: Purely speculation: what the couple hears, what they regard as this kind of violent moving about of furniture. Could it be a physical fight? Could it be guys exchanging blows and throwing one another around the room?', 'As for the three Russian boys and Josh Askin, their attorneys have said their clients did nothing wrong and are unfairly living under a cloud of suspicion. ', "Keep in mind, F.B.I. investigators have many more interviews, photos and presumably forensic evidence than we've talked about with Clint Van Zandt. ", "Five months after George Smith's mysterious death, Jennifer Hagel Smith broke her silence about her husband's last day alive.", 'Jennifer Hagel Smith: We had this just great dinner, a very romantic dinner. And we were just, you know, toasting to the future, toasting to life, and just saying, god, we are the two luckiest kids in the world. And we kept saying that. And it`s ironic now.', "But she said she couldn't reveal much about those critical hours in question the night her husband disappeared.", "Mr. George Smith III: Oh, there's no doubt. Once we heard exactly about the blood and about the way he fell on to the...", "Mr. George Smith III: The overhang and the way he fell onto the overhang, it wasn't like he fell overboard. It was like he was dumped overboard.", 'Just the latest, sad chapter of a marriage that lasted only 11 days: the tragic voyage of Mr. and Mrs. Smith.', '        The presidents of Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean International defended their industry and their practices to senators Wednesday following two recent high-profile fires that damaged ships.']
