['            A detective searches for answers to a series of murders in Buffalo, N.Y. Could the wrong woman be in prison?', 'The first woman exonerated by DNA evidence, Lynn Dejac had her prison sentence reversed in November 2007.', 'And yet, way up high in a New York City hotel conference room, the sleek crowd, the lawyers, the judges are here to honor him for his work with the Buffalo Police Cold Case Unit. The unit solved a string of rapes and murders that stretched back more than 20 years and, in the process, freed an innocent man from prison.', 'But Dennis Delano is in no mood to spout the usual banalities of a grateful cop clutching his big award.', "Dennis Delano: I'm speaking to you as lawyers. I'm just an average person, average intelligence. I just happen to be a person with a lot of experience in police work. ", 'And this gathering of the cream of New York law can hardly mistake the tone of an angry man.', "Dennis Delano: Surely people with law degrees have to be able to address and see that there's a flaw in the system. Something has to be done with the system. I don't know what. I just know something has be changed. ", 'Yes, and right here, even as he is speaking, he knows his own future as a cop is very bleak indeed.', 'Here is where it began, months earlier; a simple service in a modest church. Buffalo, N.Y. ', 'Detective Dennis Delano was at his usual Sunday post - a member of the church band. ', 'It was just a fluke, really, when Trish Radzikowski learned that the man helping with the service...was actually a detective, a specialist in cold cases.', "Trish Radzikowski: I just thought I gotta talk to this guy because he's the one that can look at my sister's case. ", "Her sister's case? Well, that would be the dreadful business of what happened to Joan Giambra 13 years ago.", 'Trish Radzikowski: Sometimes I still find myself not totally, you know, absorbed it after all these years. ', 'Joan Giambra was 42-years-old the night her attacker raped her, choked the life out of her, left her naked and dead in the living room. ', "A monstrous crime. Moreso because whoever did it also assaulted Joan's 11-year-old daughter.", "And when the police came they found that little girl also naked and sprawled, unconscious, across her mother's dead body.", 'The girl, Kathleen, was breathing but in a catatonic state when her brother Don Cormier saw the ambulance take her away. ', "Don was Joan's eldest son; he lived just around the corner. He'd been at his mother's house just the night before. ", 'Don Cormier: I got out of work and I stopped over before I went home. and, normal. Kathy was awake.', "Don Cormier: And I'm trying to get her to go to bed. And my mom on the phone, talking to one of the siblings, as usual. And it was nothing out of the ordinary. ", "Don Cormier: One of my mom's friends came and knocked on my door and told me that there was a problem.", "Don Cormier: I ran down to my mom's house. And that's when I saw Kathy on a gurney, and my mom was covered up. And I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. ", 'Difficult even now for Don to remember. Just as, for Kathleen, the lack of memory is tormenting.', "Kathy: It ate me up inside for 15 years almost that I can't remember. Trying to remember every day. And there's a reason why I don't remember maybe it was too hard", "But all the initial horror -- and it did grip the city for a time -- seemed gradually to fade away as interest shifted elsewhere. And the investigation of Joan's fate just died.", 'Trish Radzikowski: Our family had to pretty much make our own closure for this. We just have to, you know, count on, you know, God to provide the justice, you know, that we may never see.', 'And so, when she learned that man in her parish was a detective, her deeply religious heart skipped a beat.', 'Trish Radzikowski: I was meant to be there. I believe that all that was not an accident. ', 'Detective Delano, it should be said, did not gush enthusiasm. He has heard far too many entreaties that wound up going nowhere. Still, she was a church member.', 'Dennis Delano: I pulled the file, located the file, starting re-investigating it. My squad did. ', 'Sam Giambra: At first, it looked, frankly, obvious. One more case among many of an angry husband, a woman who wanted to leave.', 'Dennis Delano:: She was going to serve divorce papers on her husband a week prior to her death. After reading the file, the most likely suspect seemed to be her husband. ', "There wasn't enough evidence for that back then. But, there is one investigative tool that's come a long way since 1993, and of course that would be DNA. ", 'Dennis Delano: The clippings from the fingernails indicate that there was a struggle, and that she had scratched her attacker.', 'The latest DNA technology could identify even a few stray skin cells left under those fingernails by the assailant.', "Now they could know for certain if the killer was Joan's husband. If the DNA was his, he must have been the murderer.", 'Dennis Delano: When we went looking for the husband to talk to him, we found out that he was deceased.', "Dead end again? Not quite. At the time of the murder, the coroner had preserved a crucial piece of information -- a sample of Sam's DNA. What if that new DNA technology was applied to the old sample?", "Dennis Delano: We tried to match his DNA with this DNA found at the Giambra crime scene. And it turned out that it wasn't a match. ", "So the murderer wasn't the husband. Couldn't have been. Now the mystery was irresistible. Delano and his team went to work in earnest.", 'Dennis Delano: My partners and I, began taking DNA samples from everybody that we could find that was associated with that case. Everything was negative.', "But DNA of course is not the only thing a good investigator has at his or her disposal. Often it's simple chatter that will break a case, remembered stories.", "Like the story another of Joan Giambra's daughters told about a local bartender, who, in the weeks after Joan left her husband, took her stepping out on a date or two.", "Dennis Delano: That he had called her a few times after her mother's death, asking her how she was. And he felt bad because he used to go out with her mother, and all of this stuff. ", 'A bartender? Who was this man? Maybe -- if he was still feeling bad all these years -- he might help solve the crime. Of course, as it would turn out, there was much more to it than just a courtesy call.', 'Joan Giambra, a mother of three, was found strangled and naked on her living room floor, her 11-year-old daughter unconscious, naked, and draped over the dead body. ', 'And now, all these years later, Detective Delano and the Buffalo Cold Case team encountered a very curious story.', "Another of Joan's daughters told them about a mysterious phone call she'd received after the murder from a man who claimed he dated her mother, pumping her for information.", "Jackie Giambra: Told me he was a friend of my mother's. And you know, if they found out what happened to her.", "Weirdly similar to the detective's name, Dennis Delano. Though two more dissimilar lives would be hard to find.", "Thirteen years after the murder, Donahue still hadn't gone far from the gritty watering holes on Buffalo's south side where he'd once tended bar.", "A man who'd lived life on the opposite side of the law from Detective Dennis Delano.", 'Lissa Redmond: He seemed very surprised that after all these years we were there knocking on his door.', "Why get a sample of DNA? Well, if he'd dated Joan Giambra, and then checked up on events after the murder, he had to be considered a suspect.", 'Dennis Delano: And when Detective Redmond asked him for a DNA sample, he agreed to give a DNA sample. Go figure. ', "Dennis Donahue's DNA matched the skin cells found under Joan Giambra's preserved fingernails.", 'But a funny thing can happen when you start to pull the loose thread at the end of a long and ragged case.', 'Detective Delano and the Buffalo Police Cold Case investigation began to turn up something else: Strange similarities to two other Buffalo murder cases, one in the 1990s, another going way back to the 1970s.', 'Dennis Delano: There was a lot of similarities in the crime scene photos with two of our prior cases that had looked at earlier. ', 'One of those cases was the rape and murder of a middle-aged woman named Carol Reed on Sept. 9, 1975.', 'Her body, naked and strangled, was found on the living room floor, in this apartment complex in Buffalo. ', 'Lori Krug: It was very difficult. But I think I kind of used, "Oh, I\'ll think about it tomorrow. I\'ll just get through today."', "Keith Morrison: You saw the blood stains on the carpet. That couldn't have been easy.", 'Dennis Donahue, it turned out, was a person of interest in the Carol Reed Case. He lived just down the hall in her apartment building. But there was no way then to test the minute bits of evidence in and around the body for DNA. And and no other evidence turned up, so the investigation died. But now, all these years later, Detective Delano began to get that gut feeling cops are famous for.', "Dennis Delano: Carol Reed was murdered -- left nude, face up on her apartment floor -- in 1975. 9/9/75, OK? Joan Giambra was murdered on 9/9/93. Dennis Donahue's birthday is 9/9/52. So both of them homicides were committed on his birthday. And it was more than a coincidence.", 'Keith Morrison: Two murder cases. Same month and day. One M.O.: Rape, strangulation, nude corpses. ', 'About then, in fact, Detective Delano got another tip on another homicide, and once again, like a bad penny, the name Dennis Donahue popped up.', 'Dennis Delano: So I hunted that file down. That was from 1993. I read that file, and I said, "Sure enough, it\'s the same Dennis Donahue."', "Donahue had been questioned in the 1993 Valentine's Day murder of a 13-year-old girl named Crystallyn Girard. ", 'Now we had him at three homicide scenes. All three victims female. All three victims left to be found nude, lying face up. ', 'It all looked so similar. Again, that distinct method of killing. Again, Donahue was a suspect, but not charged. ', 'Dennis Delano: When I first read the file and I saw somebody was convicted of it...', "It should by rights have been enough to make Detective Delano stop pulling that thread. But it wasn't.", 'And thus began a strange and dangerous struggle between a cold case cop and the system he was sworn to uphold.', "Now it's just a workingman's town. Back then, there was a bar on every corner, just about. ", "This was the neighborhood where Joan Giambra was murdered. And it's where 13-year-old Crystallyn Girard grew, lived and died her dreadful death on Valentine's Day 1993. ", "Dennis Delano: We came to the conclusion after pouring over and over it again, that mostly likely she didn't commit the crime.", "Instead, believed Detective Delano, the murderer was Dennis Donahue, Dejac's jilted boyfriend, the same man now charged with killing Joan Giambra.", "Andrew Lotempio: I'm gonna sit down with Detective Delano and help him in any way I can.", "Lotempio had always believed Donahue committed the crime, and thus an unlikely alliance was formed: The detective and the defense attorney set out to free Lynn Dejac and find convincing evidence against her daughter's killer. ", 'Andrew Lotempio: I had directed them as to what evidence might have been in the evidence boxes that could be re-tested for DNA using the current DNA technologies.', 'Detective Delano and the Buffalo Police Cold Case squad dug up the evidence box. Was there enough material in here to produce a sample of DNA? ', 'Dennis Delano: There was blood on some type of fluid. There was male DNA found in that mixture. ', 'Frank Clark, District Attorney: The issue is whether that fact indicates that somebody other than Lynn Dejac was the person who killed her daughter. ', 'And D.A. Clark was of the view that the matching DNA did not necessarily indicate another killer.', "Except, well, you've probably already gathered that Detective Delano wasn't about to do that.", "He did not quit. He went over the boss's head again, and made his case to the public on T.V. ", 'To which Frank Clark shot back, also in public, a not-so-veiled suggestion that Donahue might have been having consensual sex with 13-year-old Crystallyn, and that her mother may still have been the killer.', "Frank Clark: Let's take a hypothetical. If somebody has sexual relations with somebody else, and that somebody else turns up dead two days later. Is the fact that they had sexual relations evidence of the homicide?", "Well, those, as far as Detecitive Delano was concerned, were fighting words. The D.A., he said, had impugned the character of an innocent, murdered girl. The very idea she'd been having sex with that man...", "Dennis Delano: That's absurd. And it's disgusting. None of the investigators came up with anything even remotely close to that scenario. And for him to publicly state something like that, I think it's totally unconscionable, and irresponsible. ", "It was an unequal battle, of course. Detectives aren't supposed to take on the D.A., especially on television.", 'A judge had been looking at the new evidence Detective Delano had found -- and issued an order to release Lynn Dejac from prison.', 'And just like that, Lynn walked out of the courthouse into the cold Buffalo air.', 'The D.A. had an option now. He could drop all charges against Lynn Dejac. Or, he could try her all over again.', 'The decision was quick. Re-trial. For murder. Really? In spite of that new exonerating DNA evidence?', 'It was just before Christmas when, after 13 years in prison, convicted of murdering her own daughter, Lynn Dejac was released -- but not quite free. ', "Lynn Dejac: Because they're still trying to say that they're going to retry me. When they retry me, and I hope and pray to god that they do, then I'll be vindicated. ", 'Keith Morrison: Here, as she sat with us, she was still waiting to learn her fate.', 'Lynn Dejac: She was my heart. She was considerate. She was compassionate. She looked out for me, more than I looked out for her.', 'And often it fell to Crystallyn, at 13, to mother her 8-year-old brother Eddie while Lynn was out working at the bar. ', "And then, Valentine's Day 1993. Crystallynn spent the evening at home, alone, while her mother attended a friend's wedding with Dennis Donahue -- a man she admits she was dating not for love, but for help in starting a business. ", "Lynn Dejac: Truth of the matter, I was playing him. And I don't know what I was gonna do at the end, but I knew I was playing to try to get this business outta him so I could be on my own.", 'Keith Morrison: But she soon noticed odd things about Donahue. For one thing, she says, he was very possessive.', "Lynn Dejac: Yes. I had told myself, after the wedding, that I was going to break up with him. And that's exactly what I did.", "Thus a night of drama. Donahue, she says, wouldn't take no for an answer. Says he followed her here to her mother's bar. It's been closed for years now.", 'And when she fled the bar, he followed her home, about six doors down the street.', 'Around midnight, she said, a screaming, drunken fight ensued. And still, Donahue refused to leave. Crystallyn helped her mother call 911.', 'Lynn Dejac: He slapped the phone out of my hand, and I proceeded to, again, pick up the phone and call the police. Because the police are coming, he now leaves. ', 'And then Lynn Dejac made what may have been the biggest mistake of her life. She turned to her daughter, and said: ', 'Lynn Dejac: "Don\'t answer the door when the police come. I don\'t wanna get in any trouble for leaving you home alone." ', "That's right. She left her daughter alone in the house and headed back down the street to her mother's bar. She rationalized, she says: Crystallyn was an accomplished babysitter, she could look after herself.", 'The night spiraled from bad to worse. Lynn met up with an old boyfriend at the bar and left with him, ditching Donahue -- who then stalked the pair of them throughout the night, jealousy fueled by alcohol, drugs and rage. ', 'Lynn Dejac: We got out of the car and Dennis Donahue came out of nowhere. Grabbed Michael from behind and put a knife up to his throat. I happened to be in front of the car at this time. And he was asking me, "Is this what you want? Is this what you want?" And I said, "Yes it is."', 'Lynn says she slipped back to the house to check on her daughter one more time at about 4:30 a.m. Her story is supported by the former boyfriend, who says he went with her. ', 'She and her male companion went back to his place, where she spent the rest of the night. And it was after noon by the time she arrived home again. ', 'Lynn Dejac: When I came in, I just knew something was wrong. I\'m, you know, "Krista Lynn, where are you? Are you up?" ', 'She was lying on the bed, naked but for some red socks she had worn for Valentines Day. ', "Lynn Dejac: You just-- you-- you-- just-- I don't know how to explain it. You just don't wanna believe what you're seeing.", 'Lynn Dejac: I went down for questioning anywhere from three to five days in a row, for many hours each day. And I think around the first day, toward the end, it started-- I started feeling like, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is not going like I feel that it should be going-- questioning-- the questions that should be brought to a grieving mother." It just didn\'t. And I started feeling it then.', 'Keith Morrison: Did you ask them, you know, "Have you talked to this Donahue person?"', 'And then the rumors started. Before long, almost everybody in the neighborhood had a theory about what happened to that little girl. But it was months later when a tip finally broke the case wide open.', 'That was the two-time felon who told police that Lynn had admitted to him one night at a bar not far from here that she killed her own daughter. ', "Eight months after her daughter's death, Lynn Dejac was charged with second-degree murder. ", 'By that time, Lynn was pregnant with twins. Her 8-year-old son Eddie was taken to foster care right away, the twins right after they were born.', "A little more than a year after Crystallyn's death, Lynn was tried, convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life. ", "Lynn Dejac: Oh, I don't think they thought I was a very good person at all. So I feel it was more my lifestyle that got me convicted, not the actual crime itself.", "Keith Morrison: It's true what they say that the pain never really goes away, does it?", 'Lynn Dejac: It never goes away. Never. And you never stop playing the what if game.', 'Lynn Dejac: I play it all the time. "What if I wouldn\'t have played this man?" "What if I would\'ve stayed in school?" "What if I wouldn\'t have left her to baby sit her brother, baby sit herself?" So, every day, all the time. "What if?" If only.', 'And then, just a few days after this interview, in February 2008, the D.A. had an announcement. A new medical examiner was brought in to review the evidence. The famous Michael Baden had reviewed the evidence and pronounced death by cocaine. ', 'Michael Baden: Abundant amount of froth that was present around the nose and mouth which indicates a drug overdose... ', 'Frank Clark: "We are up here saying that the system was wrong and made an error...:"', "While cocaine was found in Crstallyn's body at the time of her death, the original pathologist says the amount was too small to be lethal. And he still stands by his original conclusion -- Crystalllyn died a violent death by manual strangulation. And then, of course, there's the new DNA evidence linking Donahue to the scene. ", "To make the point that it was a homicide, the detective again went over his boss's head to the media. He took his evidence -- and a reporter -- to a convention of forensic scientists in Washington, DC.", 'Dennis Delano: They finally agreed that the death was most likely not a cocaine overdose, and their reasoning was that you could not ignore all the other evidence in the case and rule it a cocaine overdose. ', 'And that is when the Buffalo police, said enough is enough. Detective Dennis Delano was suspended without pay. ', "Lynn Dejac: My boys were still babies to me. And I'm coming home to grown men. You know? And I want to be hugging them and kissing them and taking them into my arms and, you know?", "Lynn Dejac: Just be affectionanate and because they haven't had female interaction like that, female touch. They would jerk away from me. And it would stab me right in the heart. ", 'Her youngest, the twins born as she went to prison, are teens now. Her eldest, Eddie, served two tours in Iraq, and has a wife and kids of his own.', "The twins' father is Chuck Peters. He married Lynn in prison, and stuck with her all these years.", "Lynn Dejac: My daughter wasn't a drug user. My daughter didn't use drugs. My daughter was on the honor role. ", 'Then her hero, the man whose investigation freed her, was suspended without pay.', "And finally Dennis Donahue, once briefly her boyfriend, went on trial for second-degree murder for killing Joan Giambra. That's the cold case that started it all.", "As Lynn Dejac waited for Donahue's trial to end, she celebrated mother's day for the first time in years. She replaced her prison Polaroids with a real family portrait.", 'Dennis Delano: And a day later...after seven hours of deliberation, the jury reached its verdict. Dennis Donahue was guilty of murdering Joan Giambra.

Like she was in her glory and finally can rest in peace. ', "But for Detective Delano it wasn't enough. There were still those other two cases. Carol Reed, who was killed in 1975.", "Dennis Delano: It's supposed to be kept forever, yeah. I've never heard that, of that being done before. ", "Perhaps the biggest outrage, for Delano, is that Dennis Donahue -- whose DNA was linked to 13-yeard-old Crystallyn Girard's case -- can never be brought to trial in her death. ", "Why? Because, back in 1993, Dennis Donahue testified before the Grand Jury that indicted Lynn Dejac, Crystallynn's mother. It turns out that testimony, under New York state law, gave him automatic immunity from prosecution. ", "And now? Even after Donahue was found guilty of murder in the Giambra case, the detective was still furious that the D.A. had allowed Dennis Donahue to escape prosecution for the murder of Crystallyn Girard. Still furious at Clark's suggestion that Crystallyn wasn't murdered at all, but overdosed.", 'Dennis Delano: You wanna know how many pills I take for blood pressure and stuff?

I mean, they covered up a homicide. And that's not acceptable. I don't care who it is. I don't care if it was the president of the United States that told me that this is a cocaine overdose. It's not a cocaine overdose. It was a homicide. Her mother was falsely imprisoned. She was in prison for 13 years for something she didn't do. Shame on them. It's a 13-year-old little girl.
