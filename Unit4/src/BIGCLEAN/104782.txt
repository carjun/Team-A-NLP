[" Verizon Wireless / Motorola's Droid Bionic is probably the (second) most anticipated phone of the year, a dual-core Android phone that runs on Verizon's truly fast 4G network, and can power a netbook-like dock for full-screen Web browsing. Good news: It's finally here.As we mentioned last week, the phone will be available Thursday, Sept. 8. It will cost $299.99, not surprising given both the chip and the 4G network, not to mention the fact that in addition to the 16 gigabytes of internal storage, you get a pre-installed 16GB microSD card.The phone has beautiful specs, including an 8-megapixel camera, a 4.3-inch 960x540 screen and the ability to send 1080p video to your TV via HDMI. It runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread, introduces Motorola's ZumoCast app, which lets you access videos, music, pictures and documents stored on computers, and has Flash video support built in. Given all the tech, it's reasonably thin, nearly a half inch at the thickest.The phone follows Motorola's dual-core Atrix and Photon, available at AT&T and Sprint, respectively. Both of those phones have been well-reviewed, performance-wise (though the usefulness of the lap-dock accessory has yet to be clearly established).Accessories include the Lapdock netbook adapter, with 11.6-inch screen, which will cost $300; a $100 HD Station for docking with the TV; and a $40 Navigation Dock. The $50 Battery Dock is a charging station that comes with an extra battery. Hopefully that's not a sign that the combination of dual-core processor and 4G network is a battery killer, but we have feared as much. Stay tuned for the reviews.More on the Motorola Droid Bionic (and its super-powered siblings at other carriers):Motorola Droid Bionic available Sept. 8Motorola pushes Bionic launch to summerMotorola Photon 4G packs power, versatility (Sprint)Motorola Atrix phone/laptop combo can't live up to hype (AT&T)Catch up with Wilson on Twitter at @wjrothman, or on Google+.
