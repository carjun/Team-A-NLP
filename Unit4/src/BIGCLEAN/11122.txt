[' JONATHAN BAINBRIDGE / Reuters MasterCard credit cards are seen in this illustrative photograph taken in London December 8, 2010. A group of retailers, including Macy\'s and Target sued Visa and MasterCard on Thursday,  breaking off from a proposed $7.2 billion settlement reached last year over fees  to process credit card transactions. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District  Court in Manhattan, came ahead of a May 28 deadline for the millions of  merchants affected by the settlement to decide whether to forego receiving  damages under the pact and pursue their own legal action. That  settlement, pending in federal court in Brooklyn, would end litigation on behalf  of merchants that accused Visa and MasterCard of inflating so-called  interchange, or swipe, fees. Many retailers criticized the proposed  settlement after it was announced last July. They say the pact offers  inadequate compensation and forces them to sign broad litigation releases that  could shield Visa and MasterCard from future lawsuits over antitrust violations.  By "opting out" of the settlement, the retailers can pursue separate  litigation seeking damages over allegations of past antitrust violations. But  even so, merchants would still be bound by other legal rulings if the  settlement goes forward, including changes to Visa and MasterCard\'s swipe-fee  rules. The pact received preliminary court approval from a federal judge  in Brooklyn in November, and Visa and MasterCard have said they are  confident the settlement will win final approval. Representatives of  Visa and MasterCard had no immediate comment on the new lawsuit. Also  named as plaintiffs in Thursday\'s lawsuit are JC Penney, Kohl\'s and TJX. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and triple  damages, as well as other remedies. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart and 18 other retailers said they would both opt out and consider pursuing separate  legal actions over damages. Wal-Mart is not named as a plaintiff in the case  filed Thursday.
