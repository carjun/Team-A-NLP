See More ', "\t\t\t\t\t\tWe head now to the middle east now to tahrir scare in egypt almost two years ago and once again egyptians are protesting this time trying to hold on to their democracy during a turbulent november. And abc's alex marquardt was on the scene in cairo today. Reporter: The birthplace of egypt's revolution today once again ringing with calls for the downfall of a dictator. This time it's for this man, president mohammed morsi who america relies on to be a peace broker. It has led to days of bloody clashes. The crowed is chanting erhal, or leave. These are many of the same chants we heard two years ago during the revolution, except that they've substituted mubarak for morsi. Egyptians topple ed hosni mubarak, the dictator who ruled for three decades and now. He's like a pharaoh. Reporter: Morrison's office says it is temporary to put egypt on the right track. Tonight the wise voices say it's far from fear that will win the showdown but there are certainly more bloody days ahead on egypt's bumpy road to democracy. Alex marquardt, abc news, cairo.
