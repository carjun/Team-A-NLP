Secretary of state hillary clinton has broken off her farewell tour with president obama for a final high-stakes mission, to broker a truce. It's a mission both she and the president have shied away from for most of obama's first term, one that could shape foreign policy all through his second. Secretary clinton is planning to shuttle between all the major players and our team has been reporting from the field all day and begin with matt gutman in jerusalem. Good evening. Reporter: It could be her most important one. She could be the key player in brokering a truce and tonight all eyes are on her. Hillary clinton arriving for twelfth hour diplomacy, and a midnight meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. America's commitment to israel security is rock solid and unwavering. That is why we belie it is essential to de-escalate the situation in gaza. The goal must be a durable outcome to promote regional stability and advances the security and legitimate aspirations of israelis and palestinians alike. Reporter: The secretary of state now in the eye of this deadly storm, with breakneck meetings of all the major players in jerusalem, cairo and gaza. All day rumors of peace flew, but so did the rockets and the leaflets. Israel dropping thousands of them warning some 200,000 gazans to flee homes that could be bombed. And they fled with mattresses and luggage piled high on donkey carts and rickshaws as israel pounded away at rocket launchers. A lot still remaining in harm's way. Anger soaring there and in the west bank, where palestinians tossed stones protesting the raids, battling israeli troops. We just have to get back into our cab here because we got tear gassed. The clash is spilling over right into the checkpoint here between israel and the west bank. The fighting is exacting an excruciating cost, nearly 150 palestinians and 4 israelis dead. And tonight, over 3.5 million israelis remain in rocket range, cowering from ceaseless sirens and the spray of shrapnel. Nearly 140 rockets lobbed into israel in the past few hours palacing through homes in israel's southern city of beer sheva and 60 miles north, in a tel aviv suburb. Those in rocket range refuse to return to the status quo. Stop firing in 48 hours and then for next week the same thing happened. Reporter: Israeli officials are telling me secretary clinton will hear a lot of that sentiment, israel's unwillingness to settle for anything more than a long hi-term cease-f cease-fire. George, both sides are dug in. So there's still much to work through. All right, thanks, matt. To alex marquardt in gaza. Alex, there was some hope a cease-fire might be taking hold but that bombing has not stopped all day where you are. Reporter: No, it really hasn't, george. It's been strange to hear about peace talks and cease-fires when really the explosions have not stopped. For much of the night there's been incoming artillery and air strikes in the sky have not stopped and a short while ago we saw militants firing rockets from here just behind us and that has been going on for much of the day. Gazans say what they want is peace and quiet but what's been happening for the last week is gazans defending themself and see the u.S. Completely siding with israel. So while they would like to see a cease-fire they say true peace cannot come along until israel stops targeting people in the gaza strip and that blockade of gaza is lifted. George? Alex, thanks very much.
