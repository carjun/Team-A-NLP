Stephen Reitz.', 'Detective Ken Gallatin: He had actually gone down to the fire station and-- and said that his girlfriend was hurt up in the apartment. He may have killed her.', 'Paramedics rushed to the hotel and tried to revive Eva Weinfurtner. But it was far too late for that.

I wasn't dreaming about Eva.", "Stephen Reitz: It began to occur to me that I was responsible for that 'cause of the wounds; that was what I used to do shark fishing.

Now Reitz made the most remarkable claim: This horrible violence grew out of a completely unconscious sleepwalking episode.', "Was this a clever ruse that Reitz had cooked up in the minutes after the killing? Or was his claim actually legitimate? Reitz's parents, who by now had arrived at the sherriff's station in Catalina, also claimed that their son had a history of sleepwalking.

There's no doubt that this occurred. And there's no doubt that he did it. Now, the only question is, was he in his right frame of mind or was he sleepwalking?", "If he truly was sleepwalking and not conscious of his actions, Stephen Reitz would also walk away from any and all charges. He could not and would not be held accountable for Eva's death, a killing to which he had just confessed.", "Stephen Reitz: I woke up and I began to get consciousness of the situation and I realized it was Eva on the ground and I looked around and I couldn't believe it was her.

Tell us your-- your side.", "Nothing in Reitz's story suggested he would ever want to harm Eva, let alone kill her, especially during their stay here in Catalina.", "Keith Morrison: I mean, this is a woman suppos-- he's having an affair with her. If he doesn't love her, he at least likes her.", "Stephen Reitz: When I saw how horrific-- I mean, it just amazed me. I couldn't believe it really. I mean there was no reason for it.", 'Detective Richard Tomlin: That was extremely odd because, once again, if you saw the destruction, the mayhem in the room, you had to figure somebody had to hear something.', 'And based on the chaos of the crime scene, detectives surmised the attack took several minutes.', 'Detective Richard Tomlin: This was not a quick two-second stabbing and maybe a muffled scream or cry for help. This took a little while to do.', 'And all done, according to Stephen Reitz, completely unconsciously while sleepwalking.', 'Ken Gallatin: There was no outward emotion where there was any indication that he was remorseful for his actions.', 'And then, as they wrapped up their interview with Reitz, the detectives got one more surprise.', "Reitz was flown back from Catalina to Los Angeles later that day.

How could he even get off on that type of defense? You know, he did it. He was there. He knows he did it. We know he did it. How-- how-- why is this even going to trial?!?', 'Science took over then - for a while. A world-recognized sleep disorder expert from Stanford University joined the case. Reitz was also sent to a sleep clinic like this one, for a battery of tests to see if he really did have a recognized sleeping disorder; something severe enough to have produced such violence.', 'He was wired, and monitored and recorded. And as he fell asleep, cameras rolled. Then, the tests revealed not only a propensity to sleepwalk, Reitz also suffered a significant night terror that was caught on tape and later featured in an Australian documentary on sleepwalking.', 'Keith Morrison: Is it possible that in this case there was a sleep terror episode and a sleepwalking episode which would somehow happen at the same time and thus created this tremendous violence?', "Dr. Alon Avidan: It's very likely. Patients may wake up, be terrified-- fulfill all the criteria for what we call sleep terror, and then go on to develop a sleepwalking episode.", "Dr. Alon Avidan runs the UCLA Sleep Center in Los Angeles. He was not involved in the case, but has studied sleepwalking for years. It's one of many types of sleeping disorders. ", "Dr. Alon Avidan: What happens is that patients are neither asleep nor awake. But when you look at their brain activity, they're asleep. And yet, they act out behaviors as simple as talking to more complex episodes such as walking that we see in sleepwalking.", "Keith Morrison: And in the morning, they wouldn't be aware of any of this activity?", 'And if someone with a history of sleepwalking, like Stephen Reitz was claiming, and who uses drugs or alcohol like those found at the crime scene, then the chances of an episode are even more likely.', 'And there was one more "risk factor" that may have contributed to the violent nature of Stephen Reitz\'s alleged sleepwalking episode. He was bi-polar, which made him more susceptible to violence behavior during a sleepwalking episode incident, much like those seen in sleep disorder clinics.', "Dr. Alon Avidan: They may be dreaming that there's an intruder in the house, and they're trying to protect themselves against the intruder, and in a way, punch and kick and hurt their bed partner. ", "And perhaps even kill them? Yes, says Dr. Avidon. It's rare, but it happens. Consider the story investigators were about to encounter. It had happened before. With an astonishing result.

She was the best witness in this case.", 'DA Chris Frisco had a problem. Stephen Reitz, under investigation for killing his girlfriend Eva Weinfurtner, claimed to be sleepwalking - not in control when he beat and stabbed her to death.

", "But ultimately DA Frisco wouldn't get a chance to make that case to a jury. He was transferred to another office, and handed the case to DA Dinko Bozanich, who, remember, specialized in trials involving mental defenses.", "Dinko Bozanich: How many times do you hear about anybody really committing a crime while they're sleepwalking except for ones that have been caught and then raise that as a defense instead of something else.", "Well it turned out there was one particular case here in Toronto, Canada. It was more than two decades ago. And it too was a violent crime, involved a man with no apparent motive, and later on had no recollection of what he had done, just like Stephen Reitz. This killer's name was Kenneth Parks and his story made headlines around the world. It was 1987. Parks was 23, married, the father of a baby girl.", "It happened about 2 a.m. Parks had fallen asleep in front of the television set. He got up, put on his coat, walked out the front door of his house, climbed into his car, drove 14 miles - a drive on which he encountered several major intersections - parked at his in-law's home, went inside, beat his father in law, leaving him barely alive, and then beat and stabbed to death his mother in law. Then he got back into his car, and drove away.", 'Dr. Alon Avidan: And only realized what he had done after the episode and turned himself into the police.', 'It was, in some ways, just like the killing of Eva Weinfurtner: a fatal beating and stabbing, the killer claiming no memory of what he had done. Nor was there any apparent motive. The Toronto investigation revealed that Parks was very close to his in-laws. Was either truly horrified, or was a very good actor.', 'Psychiatrist Dr. RH Billings was assigned the case of Kenneth Parks. Saw him soon after the killing.', 'Dr. R.H. Billings, psychiatrist: He was believable because he was so distraught and he was extremely willing to talk about anything I asked him.

Billings, psychiatrist: No history of that and I think it was by chance, really, when another patient told me about sleepwalking, of how complicated the behavior could be.', "Dr. R.H. Billings, psychiatrist: There's no conscious awareness of what happens. ", 'Or perhaps even killing their girlfriends in Catalina. Diagnosis or no, Ken Parks was charged with first degree murder, just like Stephen Reitz was. Parks spent a couple of years in jail before he went on trial here and his defense made the case that he should be found not guilty because he was completely unconscious of what he had done.', 'Dr. Alon Avidan: Their argument was that he committed this crime, being completely unaware of what he was doing.', 'Detective Ken Gallatin: And they set him free. They let him go. Said he was not guilty.', 'Now some 15 years later, and 3,000 miles away in California, that verdict in Toronto resonated as the trial approached in the case against Stephen Reitz.', "Lannelle Piro: Hearing about trials that had gone on and the people were innocent, you-- you know, of course that-- that's scary. It's very scary. There's no accountability.", "But the LA County District Attorney's office was determined to hold Reitz accountable and sought a first degree murder conviction, which seemed a bit risky, given Reitz's alleged sleepwalking history, the Parks case in Toronto and the medical experts backing up his story. Second degree murder, even manslaughter, would be easier to prove and might ensure a conviction.", "Dinko Bozanich: I would rather try the case and lose it. Let them present their defense, as skeptical as I am. And we don't prove it. And the defendant walks. So be it.

Bizarre, bizarre behavior.', "Could that have been another sleepwalking episode, another unintended attack? Perhaps even a precursor to what happened here in Catalina? Detectives kept digging and from Eva's friends and family they heard allegations about a dark side of Stephen's personality.", 'Eva, conflicted, perhaps confused, ignored the advice of her friends. And even, as the story goes, a mystical warning. ', 'Lannelle Piro: She\'d gone to a psychic. She didn\'t tell the woman anything about her life, and she said-- "You\'re in a relationship with a younger man that\'s not your husband." And Eva was, like, "Yeah, that\'s really weird, you know." And the psychic said, "If you don\'t break it off, he will kill you." ', "April Bozarth: I think that-- she knew that she had gotten in a little bit too deep.

And why just after she'd made that far better plan to go to that very same place the following week for a reconciliation with her husband?", 'Now Reitz and medical science would be on trial. Was his lover, Eva Weinfurtner, killed in a tragic, unconscious accident? Or was it a cold blooded, calculated murder?', 'There was no question he did it...

He was 28 by then. He seemed calm, composed. Not the least bit threatening.', 'Prosecuting the case, however, would be a new district attorney. The third one assigned to the case. Remember, the first DA, Frisco, was transferred away; the case re-assigned to Dinko Bozanich, who specialized in mental defense cases.

I would\'ve said, "Ken Lamb."', "Ken Lamb, a former LA police officer. He'd never handled anything like this case before. But he picked it up. Fast.", "Ken Lamb, DDA: It's whether or not during this murder he was conscious or unconscious. If you're conscious, then he's guilty of murder.", 'And based on what happened to Eva that night, argued Lamb, Reitz had to have made a series of complex decisions, fully aware of exactly what he was doing.', 'Ken Lamb, DDA: Look at the beating. This is repeated over and over and over. That takes energy that takes thought, that takes awareness. ', 'Detective Tomlin offered a theory during his testimony about the attack, and that theory did not involve sleepwalking.', 'Det. Richard Tomlin: I think something went wrong, obviously, in that room, and he snapped.

He told them Reitz had a temper, and that Eva's relatives had noticed bruising, bite marks.", 'Chris Frisco, DDA: So, you see, the parallel, the very same behavior, pounding on the door, breaking into the room, wielding a pocket knife and then, threatening to-- to gut her, is the very same-- same thing he did in this case. How do you say he was sleepwalking when on the prior occasion he had the dress rehearsal?', "As for the night she was killed, Reitz's attorney Ted Veghanes insisted Steven couldn't possibly have been that angry, couldn't have known what he was doing.", "Ted Veghanes, Defense attorney: There's nothing that occurred that makes sense. The act itself is bizarre. The act itself is an act of somebody losing it.", 'And then, the heart of the defense: The medical expert from Stanford University explained how people can and sometimes do violent things unconsciously while asleep.', 'He detailed the battery of tests Reitz had been given, which showed his propensity to sleepwalking.', "Ted Veghanes, Defense attorney: Is it a fake? No, no, no! You're in REM sleep. There's no way you can fake it. ", 'The trial lasted three weeks. And now the jury would have to decide if it was conscious rage, or unconscious tragedy. Guilty. Or not.', 'In the end, the jury had rejected the science. Did not buy the data and the tests that show a link between sleepwalking and violence; at least when it came to Stephen Reitz.', 'Steven Reitz is in prison now. Sentenced to 25 years to life. And justice, if you believe an ex-District Attorney, won the day.', "Dinko Bozanich: If, however, he had prevailed? Well, I'm sure we would've seen a bunch of sleepwalking defenses presented since. So it's going to take awhile for somebody to try it again.", "Lannelle Piro: The verdict - you hope that, that closes the book. I don't know if it'll ever be closed in my heart. But at least he's not free. Obviously Stephen's the only one that knows what really happened."]
