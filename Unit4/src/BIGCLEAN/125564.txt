There's no burglary. Nobody broke in. The front door is locked.", 'Now, generally speaking, the grisly work of a crime scene investigator, while very difficult, is fairly straightforward.

So they had him take off his shirt, they looked at his body very carefully, up and down, they looked for bruises or cuts that would indicate defensive wounds. And? Not a scratch on Bob. Though you'd think there would be, if Toni had been fighting back. Chaos in a front hall indicated Toni had valiantly fought for her life.

They talked to the neighbors, some of whom said they saw a drifter in the area right around the time of the murder. By the time the police went looking, that drifter was long gone.

Oh, and there was one rather inconvenient complication. It appeared that certain crime scene protocols weren't too carefully observed. For example, the foot prints might have been made by police personnel themselves.", "John Van Houten: It could have been the paramedic. Walked in the house, there-- they do it all the time. They walk in, and they don't mean to. They step on the blood. It could have been the police officer.

It rained and they didn't take the evidence before that. How damaging was that to the state's case?", "And then there was the question of Bob Heartsong's appearance.

If you're a robber and you're gonna do that, you're gonna take something. Nobody took anything. ", "And as for those mysterious hairs found on Toni's body? None of them matched the drifter. Nor did the bloody boot prints. They let him go. The police moved on after that. And Bob? Well, everybody deals with grief in his or her own way.", 'Some of his friends were a little surprised when - after two years - he got serious with a woman he met online: Suzye Goldstein.', "Bob Heartsong: I asked my son, Jake, whether he minded.

Having-- a relationship-- trying to balance your life back out? You've got a vacuum in your life and you're trying to-- find balance again. ", 'Suzye was bowled over. Bob seemed like just the right sort of guy for her. A soul mate.', 'Suzye Heartsong: This guy has got one a heart of gold. He wants-- he wants what you want for you. ', 'And, in fact, he told Suzye all about Toni, and about the suspicion that attached to him after the murder.', "Suzye decided to be prudent. She checked out his story with police. And here's what they told her:", 'Susan Heartsong: They said, "No, he\'s been exonerated." And once you get to know Bob, you know there is no way.

And suddenly, the Heartsong case was red hot again.', "John Van Houten: We got the federal grant and it was to review for D.N.A. And they redid the-- D.N.A. with today's technologies.

There was evidence collected on and around her brutalized body, but it proved nothing. But by August 2006, that very same evidence began to speak. And Bob Heartsong was among the first to find out what it said.", "They had found something under Toni's fingernails back in 2000. Hard to know what it was then. Now six years later, advanced DNA testing could identify that something as blood. Bob's blood. What was that doing there?", 'John Van Houten: He was-- asked was there a fight, an altercation? Did he bleed during work? Did he cut himself? Everything was negative. "No, I did not. I wasn\'t bleeding that day. And then I asked him, I said, "Well, then how would your blood get under her left thumb?"', "But DNA, the police told Bob, doesn't lie. And in this case, it seemed to confirm the detective's suspicion. It was not some mysterious intruder who struggled with Toni that dreadful day. It was Bob. And the investigators worried away at some other bits of the story, too. One thing in particular. Nobody ever found the murder weapon. The knife that killed Toni. A whole set of kitchen knives, within easy reach on a counter, was untouched. But there was a missing knife. In fact, that knife was the only thing missing from the house after the murder. It was Bob and Toni's favorite tofu knife and they had always kept it out of sight in a drawer, said D.A. Barbara Burns.", 'Barbara Burns: Why would a stranger with all these knives in view and easy reach start looking in a drawer for a knife to use to kill Toni Heartsong?', "The D.A. also found it suspicious that Bob seemed to know a little too much about the state of his wife's clothing after the attack. Although she had not been sexually assaulted, her thong underwear had been awkwardly pulled low in the back.", 'Barbara Burns: The actual position of the underwear had not been known to the investigators or the detective until the autopsy. Yet when the detective went back the next morning-- Mr. Heartsong described to the detective at that time that the "mysterious assailant" must have come into the house and startled her while she was in the bathroom. And she must have pulled her shorts up without pulling her underwear up.', "Keith Morrison: Maybe he'd heard from somebody that they appeared to be pulled down, was offering an explanation. ", 'Barbara Burns: It was too coincidental and too ironic to be able to explain all of that away.', "Still, why would a man as devoted as Bob Heartsong - and a mild mannered man at that - attack the love of his life? D.A. Burns poked around in Toni's diary. Was this relationship really so idyllic? Maybe not.", 'Barbara Burns: In her journal, in her own writing, she does make a statement, "There\'s not enough to leave, but there\'s not enough to stay." Now, what does that mean? There\'s not enough love loss to leave? There\'s not enough love to stay? There\'s not enough loss of money to stay. ', 'Barbara Burns: There were other things in the journal, too, where she talks about, "He\'s not as loving," or, he\'s not showing her and the kids as much attention. It\'s all about work, work, work. ', "Bob Heartsong: In your relationships don't you ever have a day that you struggle with?", 'Bob Heartsong: Oh yeah, yeah, okay. We go through this. If you don\'t-- do-- is this a reason to be accused of killing your wife? One of the last things that she wrote in her diary: "Things that I\'m grateful for." And she has a list. And-- I was-- I\'m "Bob" is on the list.', "Besides, said the friend, Linda Armstrong, it wasn't just marriage to Bob that troubled Toni. ", "Linda Armstrong: Toni was turning 50. Toni had had-- thyroid cancer. It wasn't necessarily Bob, it wasn't necessarily the business, it was just everything at one time hitting her. ", 'Mid-life angst? Or, as investigators had now come to believe, a confrontation over the family business.', 'John Van Houten: Another investigator I spoke to who had this case for a little while said that he-- he was going broke and he was looking to get a partner in his business because he was-- he was financially strapped.

Linda Armstong didn't think so.", 'Linda Armstrong: She wasn\'t a 100 percent "I\'m thrilled to death about it." But she wouldn\'t-- didn\'t disagree about it.', 'But now police put together a theory: that on Sept. 26, 2000, Bob Heartsong left his job site in Del Ray Beach in the early afternoon, went home, argued with Toni and, in a moment of uncontrolled rage, stabbed her to death with their favorite knife.', 'Then, desperate for an alibi, he drove back to Del Ray to the car dealership, before driving home again at 5, "discovering" Toni\'s battered body, and calling 911.', "Barbara Burns: Whether it's as a prosecutor or as a detective, an investigator, you start understanding that people who don't just answer a question but feel a need to explain that question generally have something to hide.

I lost my temper, and that\'s what happened. Except after he beat her, he realized, "Oh boy, I really messed up now." And then when she went to get back up, he stabbed her.

There wasn't any life insurance policy on Mrs. Heartsong. There wasn't a motive.", 'But a few miles away, Prosecutor Barbara Burns, armed with brand new DNA technology, had carefully and slowly built what she believed was a solid case.', 'Barbara Burns: These things standing alone might raise reasonable doubt, you pull them together and see, wait a minute, each of these is a piece of puzzle. And by golly, they fit.', 'And so in September 2008, after almost two years of jail time and house arrest, Bob Heartsong, still with the unwavering support of his sons and new wife, was ushered into the Palm Beach County courthouse to face his accusers.', 'Prosecutor: The evidence presented by the state will show how the defendant orchestrated the events of the day. ', 'And how he managed to return to his residence to surprise his wife, Toni Heartsong. Engage in an argument with her. Which led to unspeakable violence and a brutal bludgeoning and stabbing death of Toni Heartsong. Step by step, Prosecutor Burns layered on the evidence of guilt.', 'Prosecuting attorney: So the-- the blood that you got the result on, on the left thumb of Tony Heartsong was the blood of Robert Heartsong. ', "And Heartsong, remember, had offered no explanation, reasonable or not, for how that blood had gotten there. But the blood under Toni's fingernail was not the only significant discovery.", "As Toni struggled with her attacker, she'd left a bit of her blood on a glass entertainment unit, blood mixed with a substance from someone else's DNA. And now that someone could be identified.", "Prosecuting attorney: For certain, you do know that whatever the component is, it's still Tony Heartsong and Robert Heartsong. ", "Though it was Bob's DNA, they still couldn't figure out just what it was: blood or something as simple as sweat. Nor could they say when it got there on the entertainment unit.", 'But to prove guilt once and for all, the prosecutor set out to convince the jury that indeed there had been motive for the brutal crime. How would she prove it? ', "Prosecution: Did he discuss with you the-- the status of his marriage on or about the time of his wife's murder?", "Infidelity? In the perfect relationship? Well, in fact, Bob did claim that Toni had an unfaithful interlude 15 years earlier. And that he had entertained the idea of an affair with someone else, but that that's all it had been: a fantasy.", 'But it was more than that, said the jailhouse informant. Just before the murder, he told the jurors, Bob Heartsong asked his wife for a divorce. Though Bob denied the allegation, the informant held fast to his story.', 'Keith Morrison: --hell of a distance, however, between driving around your truck and saying, "I wish I were dead," to taking a knife and stabbing your wife\'s eyes out. That\'s not the same thing--', 'Barbara Burns: Most often the most violent of all crimes and all killings are domestic related. And some of them have no history of violence.', 'Could a jailhouse informant be trusted? Some jurors might not think so. But what if the prosecutor could put Bob Heartsong at the crime scene at the very time of the murder?', 'Now this would be quite a surprise: The one witness of whom Bob Heartsong might quite properly be terrified.', "For years, Bob Heartsong had told his accusers he could not possibly have killed his wife because he wasn't home. He was miles and miles away when his wife was murdered.", 'And then along came a next-door neighbor by the name of Carol Parkman who said she knew exactly where Bob was just around the time his wife was killed.', 'Barbara Burns: How is it that you knew that it was Mr. and Mrs. Heartsong that were doing the arguing?', 'Barbara Burns: Her explanation was that only after his arrest did she feel comfortable.

But bottom line is this, Mr. Heartsong wasn't there.", "He wasn't? Well, obviously Defense Attorney Maxwell would have to do something to impeach that nosy neighbor. And, what do you know, a check of the record revealed that Ms. Parkman had told a number of stories about what she did or didn't hear that afternoon. There was one version of her story after Heartsong's arrest in 2006 where she'd admitted hearing something.", "Barry Maxwell: You basically said that you heard voices, but you could not identify anyone. You told them that, didn't you?

And your answer was, "No, I can\'t." Correct?', 'Barry Maxwell: And by the same token, can you tell us for a fact that it was Robert Heartsong that you heard talking?

He certainly would be able to punch, push out, but it would be much weaker than normal. ', "And even if he had mustered the strength to battle his wife, wouldn't he have sustained some physical wound from the struggle? But family friend Linda Armstrong testified to what she saw when Bob Heartsong had dinner with her family, hours after the murder.", 'Defense attorney: Did you put crime scene tape up-- you put it up across the entry way, correct?', "Still, there was that prison snitch, the man who told the jury that Bob admitted his marriage was in crisis, that Toni was enraged about Bob's plan to take on a business partner. The defense called the would-be partner, who did admit the Heartsongs argued about the deal. But that wasn't all he said.", 'Defense attorney: After you spoke of Mr. and Mrs. Heartsong bumping heads, what was the rest of your paragraph?', 'Peter Sutton: My answer was, "I wish I had half the relationship with my wife that they had." I wish you could see the look in-- in their-- faces when they-- saw each other. It was-- I mean, lit up.', "No, said Defense Attorney Maxwell, the killer must have been someone else. And he offered the jury one more piece of evidence. Found at the autopsy, inside Toni Heartsong's underwear.", "Defense Attorney Maxwell: We have what the lab describes as a black man's hair. We have a brown/blond beard hair.", "Defense Attorney Maxwell: Mrs. Heartsong-- we-- we know that she was at Burdine's about 9:00 the morning that-- the morning of the murder. And so the State argues she was trying on clothing. And therefore that's how the hair-- ended up in her pubic hair area. I'm sorry. But I don't know any woman present on this earth who's going to try clothing on and not have panties on.", 'Barry Maxwell: Give Mr. Heartsong his freedom back. Find him not guilty because, in fact, he is not guilty. Thank you. ', 'But for Prosecutor Burns, this was more than just one more cold case brought back to life. About this one, she said, she was sure.', "BarbaraBurns: He can't admit it. And he never did. But the evidence is there to convict him as charged.", "There is no telling just what a jury will decide to do in an hour, or a day, or a week. In Bob Heartsong's case, it was just three hours. He stood at the defense table. ", "Not guilty! All that new DNA technology, all the investigator's, the prosecutor's, certainty, did not amount to proof.", "Bob Heartsong (after trial): All I want to say to you is that I'm free as I should be. I didn't do it. I never could have done it to anybody. It's impossible for the kind of person that I am.", 'And Bob Heartsong walked out of the courtroom and into the arms of the second love of his life. And felt - almost - like a free man.

But in the eyes of the law, Bob Heartsong did not kill his wife. And should pay no price at all.', 'But pay he has certainly done. In practical terms, the cost to the Heartsong family has been in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Not to mention imprisonment while waiting for trial: He lost his career, business, time... And emotionally? Well. He is a spiritual man, he says. ', 'Bob Heartsong: I might have my moments of bitterness, but I come out of it very quickly. I spend a good time doing what I do.
