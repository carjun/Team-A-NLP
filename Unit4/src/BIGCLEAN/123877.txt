Without a warrant, he couldn't just walk up to Laudenberg and grab some DNA.

So we didn't need much.", "So the plan, a high tech, DNA sting was hatched. An undercover cop would meet Laudenberg, have a cup of coffee with him, and when Adolph left, he'd pick the coffee cup, bring it to the LAPD crime lab. And the technicians here would extract the saliva from the coffee cup, test it for DNA, compare that DNA to the material found at the crime scene and see if there was a match.", 'He was a transient, living all over sprawling LA County, apparently in a mobile home. But where? Before Dinlocker could run the sting, he first had to find him!', "Bob Dinlocker: We made contact with people out there, transient people, street people, people in the neighborhood to see if they're familiar with any type of guy--maybe show the picture.", "Bob Dinlocker: I was starting to get really concerned that we weren't going to find him or the guy wasn't in the area anymore and this was a really good, really workable case, so there was an anxiety level to try & find this particular person.

It had to be a voluntarily discarded and a completely discarded DNA sample.", "Keith Morrison: Otherwise what? Couldn't use it in court? Couldn't use it to get a conviction?", 'Laudenberg himself suggested meeting at a neighborhood donut shop. And there he was, a surveillance camera trained on him through the window there, sipping on a cup of coffee.', 'Dinlocker was on his own. If he had any problems, nobody was there to help, not even Detective Bengston, who was downtown at police headquarters, waiting.', 'Bob Dinlocker: My goal was for him to take many sips of that coffee and then, however it went down, for it to be discarded and keep track of it and collect it.', "Bob Dinlocker: And right away, my heart started pounding and the blood's going up.", 'The investigation of a 30-year-old serial murder case now hinged on whether undercover cop Bob Dinlocker could get what he needed from the prime suspect; a man who looked like Santa Claus, of all people. He needed Adolph Laundenberg to leave behind a saliva sample on a Styrofoam coffee cup. ', 'But the well-planned sting operation was already starting to unravel. Suddenly Laudenberg had asked if he was being questioned about the murders. Dinlocker had to think fast.', 'Bob Dinlocker: And as it worked out, the best possible circumstances happened. He got up, apparently forgot about the coffee and just walked away from it. And I followed him out of the restaurant.', "And, in a heartbeat, a second undercover cop swooped in and took Laudenberg's cup with the precious saliva sample, then rushed it to the crime lab.", "Richard Bengston: We have the sample now. This is our suspect. This is going to be great. All right now, let's wait for the testing to be done.", "For the next two months, DNA from Laudenberg's saliva would be extracted, analyzed and compared to the specimen taken from Lois Petrie's body. The entire case now hung on whether these two microscopic specks of evidence would match or not.", 'The suspect, Adolph Laudenberg, went about his transient life unsuspecting, unaware.', "Would the DNA from the coffee cup match the sample taken from Lois Petrie's body?", 'Richard Bengston: The evidentiary profile from the Lois Petrie case, from the vaginal slides, is an exact match with the suspect profile of Adolph Laudenberg. Unbelievable! Twenty-something years later, and we finally have answers to one piece of the puzzle.', 'Once in a very long while, a person in the lonely business of retrieving lost justice has a good day.

I don't know if he was trying to spook me.", 'Renee Laudenberg: It was just what I had to do. I felt protected because now there were detectives involved, and there were main, big people involved that knew my story and believed my story.', 'Richard Bengston: I had no doubt.

He has not been arraigned, so he has not entered a plea. We should note that never before, in the history of the LAPD, has DNA this old been used as evidence in trial.']
