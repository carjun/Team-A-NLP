Ginger zee tells us this flood was more than 40 miles away from the storm that caused it. Reporter: Surging through the desert. Flash floods made for a dramatic weekend under water in the southwest. At least 14 people had to be rescued in arizona. Plucked from raging waters debris filled and up to four feet deep. In tuson, three children were playing in a river bed when a wall of water came at them. If it's not raining where you're at, but it's raining back in the mountains, water is going to be down here in 20 minutes, half an hour. Reporter: In the desert, rain can fall in the mountains. And it has nothing to absorb it. It keeps rushing downhill. Sometimes becoming a wall of water full of debris. Just like this video in utah. That's the front edge of something called a dry wash. The front of the flood starts to get clogged up with debris. Reporter: Six hours after it had rain 40 miles north, the deep, dark mess full of bushes, mud and trees attacks. Some parts of the desert southwest will still see heavy rains in the next 48 hours.
