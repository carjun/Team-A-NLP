[' Bumble Bee Foods LLC is recalling some of its 5-ounce canned tuna because of a risk the fish could spoil. The company said Wednesday that some cans\' seals may not be tight enough. Loose seals could let in pathogens and spoil the tuna, sickening an eater. There have been no reports so far of any related illnesses. The cans were distributed to retailers across the country between Jan. 17 and Feb. 28 and have "best by" rates that range from Jan. 16, 2016 through Jan. 18, 2016. The products subject to the recall include Bumble Bee brand and Brunswick brand 5-ounce cans of chunk white albacore in water and chunk light tuna in water and vegetable oil. Consumers who think they may have purchased one of the recalled products can contact Bumble Bee to get their money back and throw away the canned tuna. Bumble Bee is privately held and based in San Diego.']
