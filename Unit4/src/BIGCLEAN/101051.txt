[" John Amis / AP Job seekers line up to register to attend a job fair held in Atlanta, Thursday, May 30, 2013. The Labor Department reported a drop in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment last week. The number of Americans filing new claims  for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week, in line with the  recent moderate pace of jobs growth. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department  said consumer spending  increased 0.3 percent last month, after a  revised 0.3 percent drop in April.Consumer spending in April was previously reported to have declined 0.2 percent.Initial  claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally  adjusted 346,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the  previous week were revised to show 1,000 more applications than  previously reported.  Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to fall to 345,000 last week.       The four-week moving average for new claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 to 345,750.       A Labor Department analyst said no states had been estimated and there were no special factors in the state data.        Employers added 175,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month,  with the unemployment rate ticking up a tenth of a percentage point to  7.6 percent. Job gains have averaged 172,000 over the last 12 months.        The Federal Reserve, which has been closely monitoring the labor  market, said after its policy-setting meeting last week downside risks  to the outlook for the jobs market had diminished since the fall.        Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank could trim the $85  billion in bonds it has been buying each month to keep interest rates  low and bolster the economy sometime later this year and likely bring  the program to a close by mid-2014.       The claims report  showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state  programs after an initial week of aid fell 1,000 to 2.965 million in  the week ended June 15.   U.S. consumer spending rebounded and  incomes recorded their largest increase in three months in May, adding  to data that have suggested the economy has shifted to firmer ground.      Last month's consumer spending  increase was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for  inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent last month after dipping  0.1 percent in April.       Consumer spending accounts for 70  percent of U.S. economic activity. Though the pace of spending has  slowed from the 2.6 percent rate notched in the first three months of  the year, consumers will likely continue to drive growth in the second  quarter.       Recent data, including housing, regional factory  activity, business spending plans and consumer confidence, have pointed  to an economy that is regaining some speed after stumbling early in the  second quarter.       That is broadly supportive of the Fed's view last week that the downside risks to the economy's  outlook have waned.       That theme held as other details of the  Commerce Department report showed income grew 0.5 percent last month,  the largest gain since February, after nudging up 0.1 percent in April.  That reflects a steady pace of job gains.       There was also a bit of inflation in the economy last month, pointing to some pick-up in demand.        A price index for consumer spending inched up 0.1 percent in May  after declining two straight months. A core reading that strips out food  and energy costs also rose 0.1 percent after being flat in April.        Over the past 12 months, inflation rose 1 percent, still below the  Fed's 2 percent target. The index had increased only 0.7 percent in the  period through April.       Core prices were up 1.1 percent from a year ago after rising by the same margin in April.   "]
