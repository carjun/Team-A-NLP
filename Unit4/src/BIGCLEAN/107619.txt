But that may change soon. He may be allowed to leave the airport while russia decides if it will grand him asylum. Martha raddatz joins us from washington with much more on all this. Good morning, martha. Reporter: Good morning, robin. The drama this morning is intense. At any time now, the man the u.S. Says has committed espionage, could be free in russia, with massive amounts of secret data in tow. This morning, all eyes are on the moscow airport where fugitive edward snowden is preparing himself for possible release. We now know that snowden has started learning russian, for what may be months of freedom, or maybe permanent residence there. We are also learning that after a month of wearing the same clothes, snowden has been given fresh shirts and jeans and a copy of "crime and punishment," so his lawyer says, he can become familiar with russian literature. It was snowden\'s handwritten request for asylum that could lead to his freedom. The russian officials saying the paperwork is being processed. While the russians saying he would be watched carefully by russian authorities during his stay. It is the classified material that he is carrying on as many as four computers, that worries u.S. Officials. Unless he got careless and left them in his room, there is no method that the government or somebody in russia, china or the united states, would have for obtaining the information he possesses. Reporter: But that remains a major concern of the u.S. And it would certainly not be impossible for the russians to steal the information, especially if snowden is released under their watch. Edward snowden is seen by some as a hero. But last night, the house defeated legislation that would have blocked the national security agency from collecting phone records of americans.
