['It seems that the Washington Wizards may have found a perfect fit with the third pick in the draft.Otto Porter from Georgetown is a local guy and fits the Wizards\' most glaring need - a small forward.With John Wall and Bradley Beal manning the backcourt, and veterans Emeka Okafor and Nene up front, Porter is a natural small forward.
