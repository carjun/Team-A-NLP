['        The Food and Drug Administration review released Tuesday concluded that menthol cigarettes likely pose a greater public health risk than regular cigarettes.', "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'The review does not make a recommendation on whether to limit or ban the minty smokes, but the FDA is seeking input from the health community, the tobacco industry and others on possible restrictions.', 'According to the review, there is little evidence to suggest that menthol cigarettes are more or less toxic or contribute to more disease risk to smokers than regular cigarettes.

The process that the FDA has laid out is well known and it\'s going to take some time to be done right. We really as a company are planning to constructively engage both on the process and clearly on the outcome. We\'ve all concluded in the past that having movement from a regulator is preferable to not having any, and really I think this report was sort of the predicted next step."', ' Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
