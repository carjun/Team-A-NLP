Carlos and Peggy's two older boys were off on their own now. Carlitos, 29, had followed in his dad's footsteps and was now lawyer. Merced, 23, was out in Colorado finishing college. Alysia, 16, a bubbly high school cheerleader, was still living at home. She was going out with friends that night.", "Carlos Perez-Olivo: We wanted to enjoy ourselves while we were young.

He was on familiar turf.", "Carlos Perez-Olivo: That's why we moved up to Westchester, because we felt up here it was safer.", "But this autumn night, something was very different. In the past three months, Carlos had stopped practicing law. He'd been disbarred after some clients had accused him of running off with their money.

Tony Tota does the ballistics work for Westchester County.

There's a constant flow of vehicles through it, a New York City toll barrier on a Saturday night.", 'Though the detective noted with interest there was a car matching that description ahead of them at the toll plaza.', "Dennis Murphy: It didn't look as though there had been a struggle in the back seat?", "The county crime-scene techs had also analyzed scorching from the muzzle blast, measured the angles of the bullets' trajectories, and mapped out the blood spatter and what they found wasn't matching Carlos' account of the struggle.", 'Start with Peggy, the victim. The M.E. determined that the gun had been fired right near the back of her head: the bullet went straight and true, not angled up or down, an amazing shot for a gun being wildly fought over.', 'Another bullet went into the fabric beneath the roof. The angle of entry dictated to the county ballistics experts where the gun had been when it was fired. ', 'Detective Simmons: When they looked at the angle of entry of that bullet hole it appears to be from coming out towards the outside of the car rather than inside the car.', "Another bullet shattered a rear glass panel. The angle told the county's experts it was fired straight into the glass like Peggy's fatal wound.", 'Tony Tota: My findings were that that hole in that glass was straight on, 90 degrees.', 'Detective Simmons: It seems like it would be impossible to get yourself up into that position where the bullet could go through him and then go through that glass at the angle and height that it did.', "Other questions: Carlos' overcoat folded on the back seat. Sticking out of the pocket was a small white garbage bag. Inside the bag, crime scene analysts found gunshot residue.", 'Detective Simmons: It seemed like that was a tremendously high concentration of gunpowder residue inside that.', "Dennis Murphy: My totally non-expert brain could see gunshots being fired in a contained area and it's raining down particles of something. That's gonna be detectable to the lab.", 'Detective Simmons: For it to get down inside in a pocket in a bag down in there in the concentration that it did is very difficult.', "There was so much that didn't add up to the detective. Peggy, as Carlos told it, had remained snoozing as this fight in a confined space broke out Carlos Perez-Olivo -- despite his willingness to take a lie detector test -- wasn't entirely eliminating himself as a suspect. After all, there was the admitted former girlfriend of many years.

There was a struggle for the gun, as Carlos told it, shots fired, killing Peggy, wounding him. The investigators made a video demonstration of the sequence of events as he'd told it to them. In the confined interior of the Mitsubishi, they couldn't understand how Carlos ended up in the back seat as he struggled for the gun with only the narrow opening of the console to get there.", 'Prosecutor Difore: There is no way imaginable that Mr. Perez Olivo could have gotten through the space, in between the space in between the seats. The space as measured was 9 inches. And he would have you believe that he is tussling with the assailant in the backseat, and he gets into the backseat of the car. Not possible.', 'And the prosecutors thought the very fact that Carlos drove to the hospital, instead of waiting for EMTs to come to him was also part of his master plan.', "Prosecutor Difore: He needed to get away from the exact location of the murder because he tossed the gun not far from the location of the murder. He wanted to divert the police away from that location so they wouldn't recover the gun.", 'And something caught their eyes as they played back that security camera video taken when Carlos arrived at the hospital. Take a look for yourself.', "Prosecutor Difore: You've lost all control virtually. And there would be no reason. What would be the advantage for the perpetrator to get into the backseat of the car. None. ", 'And perhaps most importantly to the prosecutor also from a common sense point of view was, if this was a professional hit -- or a carjacking -- why would the gunman kill the wife and leave the husband, an eyewitness, with little more than a treat and release wound?', 'Dennis Murphy: With the male with a very minor wound and the female dead. Does that make sense?', "Prosecutor Difore: Exactly. If you are the carjacker, you take the car. And if you were a hitman, you'd shoot him dead.", "Suspicions about the husband's story, but they'd need much more than that if they were going to convince a jury that Carlos Perez-Olivo killed his wife.", "Prosecutor Difore: They did appear to be a loving couple, but you know there's no telling what goes on behind people's closed doors.", 'So investigators starting pushing those doors open, looking into deeper psychological terrain. ', 'They saw a man who had been at one time hospitalized with clinical depression and who had now lost his ability to practice law. He had been disbarred, a disgrace they believe he concealed from his family. ', 'Prosecutor Difore: Practice was done over. There was no apparent means of income. ', "What the prosecutor saw left was the life insurance on her: $900,000 was not a fortune by Chappaqua standards, but enough the authorities figured for Carlos to set himself up for the next chapter in his life, perhaps with the old girlfriend he'd sent flowers to that day.", "There'd be no costly divorce for him. A movie and dinner date in New York -- followed by a bullet to the brain -- would be the way out. ", 'Prosecutor Difore: All part of a plan, a very devious and diabolical plan to commit murder and get away with it. ', 'But this case would turn out to have a star witness having to do with that very handgun the divers had retrieved from the lake.', "The court was about to hear from the prosecution's star witness. His testimony would be about the vintage German handgun used to kill Peggy that divers had fished out of the roadside lake.", "Mark Gazzola would tell the court that he'd seen the distinctive Walther PPK semi-automatic inside Carlos' house five months before Peggy was murdered. His story starts back in June of 2006, Carlos and Peggy were renters boxing up for yet another house move. ", "Mark Gazzola was helping out his uncle, the Perez-Olivio's landlord, in making sure that the tenants had left the property in broom-swept condition. He found the house was anything but packed-up.", 'Mark Gazzola: boxes were in the living room, furniture was still there. It was just chaos.', 'So Gazzola made a distress call to his father to come help him get these tenants out quickly because the house had been sold. ', 'As they worked their way through the bedrooms, his father noticed a partly opened manila envelope.', 'Mark Gazzola: He saw a gun inside of it. So he called my attention. I turn around and we look and it was, it was a pistol that was on the floor.', 'Mark Gazzola: Absolutely, yeah absolutely. I have a pistol permit, I know my firearms. It was a German Walther PPK.', 'The pistol, in question, is one some collectors like Mark Gazzola keep their eye out for. The Walther PPK is known as the James Bond gun and has a certain cachet.', "Gazzola, it turned out, had been shopping around for a Walther PPK and the pistol Carlos was holding was exactly what he'd been looking for.", "Carlos, he said, answered that the gun had sentimental value something about it being a gift from a client, and he wasn't interested in selling it. End of the conversation. Back to sweeping out the house.", 'Then that November weekend it was all over the news: that ambush shooting of Carlos and Peggy Perez-Olivo.', 'Mark Gazzola: My immediate response was I felt horrible. I felt bad. I had just helped him clean up. I knew her she was nice. She made me something to drink while I was at the house.', 'As he followed the news of the shootings, Mark Gazzola told his co-workers about that June day when he saw the gun in the Perez-Olivo home.', "In the courtroom, the prosecutors saw him as an unshakable witness. He spoke with encyclopedic certainty about Walther PPK's: their caliber, the place and years of production.", 'ProsecutorDifore: He was an extraordinary witness as luck would have it. He was a gun enthusiast, very familiar with that particular gun and in fact searching for that particular gun.', 'And Mark Gazzola identified for the jury the murder weapon as the very gun he saw in the Perez-Olivo house that day.', 'Dennis Murphy: Is the gun in evidence the very same one you saw at the house that day?', "Carlos dismissed Mark Gazzola's story altogether. No way could he have seen a Walther PPK in his house.", 'MarkGazzola: Our discussion was not of a pellet gun. It was a German Walther PPK.', 'The gun...the story of a troubled marriage and teetering finances. The defense had its work cut out for it.', 'But Carlos Perez Olivo -- a onetime criminal defense lawyer who had represented clients accused of murder -- would fight back with all he had. ', "Carlos Perez-Olivo: Of course not, please. If there was any way that I could change places with her, if there was any way I could be dead, I'd be very happy.", 'ChristopherMcClure: Their case has been nothing more than innuendo and speculation.', "The defense was up and it had to undo the prosecution's damaging version of the story of Peggy's murder.", 'ChristopherMcClure: Just not credible, just not believable. He has no idea what he saw.', "Defense attorney Christopher McClure took on the biggest problem: Mark Gazzola's testimony about seeing the murder weapon in Carlos' hand five months before his wife was murdered.", 'Was it funny, posed the defense, that anyone could have such vast knowledge about the Walther PPK at their fingertips, the way Gazzola seemed to on the stand?', 'And co-defense attorney Richard Portale would also try to poke holes in the forensic evidence, starting with that the reconstruction demonstration.', "It didn't contradict Carlos's account, the defense team argued, because significantly, it failed to take into account the position of the driver's seat during the struggle: they argued the seat was pushed back further at the time of the shooting, leaving enough room for Carlos to be dragged into the back of the Mitsubishi.", 'RichardPortale: The seats were not placed in the same position they were in at the time of the incident.', 'The prosecutors had argued that Peggy was shot at close range with the gun put beneath the space of her headrest, but the defense said that was just one "possible" scenario. ', 'RichardPortale: Their claim that the muzzle of the gun was under the headrest and that was not supported by any of the forensics, any of the gunshot residue pattern analysis that we had done.', 'ChristopherMcClure: It was a wound to the stomach and fortunately it went in and out, but even their own doctors testified there are major organs around there. ', 'And the defense team pointed out that Carlos could have been shot in the stomach during the struggle with the gunman with that same bullet exiting the rear window.', 'RichardPortale: We actually introduced an anatomically correct doll with a dowel going in and out of the doll and out the hole in the window to show that it was certainly possible.', "And to further prove its point that someone else was in the car that night, the defense pointed out that investigators had found some male hair that didn't belong to Carlos in the back seat area of the Mitsubishi as well as other DNA they couldn't trace.", 'DennisMurphy: So this was a hitman who was hired, by a guy with a major beef against your client?', 'ChristopherMcClure: What we do know is Mr. Perez-Olivo represented a lot of people that are capable of such acts.', "But perhaps the most important point the defense wanted the jury to take away was that Carlos Perez-Olivo's family and friends believed that he was incapable of killing Peggy, the woman he loved, the mother of his three children.", 'In the courthouse, the case was now in the hands of the jury. District Attorney DiFore was confident it would be a guilty verdict.', 'JanetDifore: I think if anyone who sat through that trial that took place in this courthouse that there would be absolutely no doubt in their mind as to what happened that night on the side of the road. And absolutely no doubt that Carlos Perez-Olivo murdered his wife in cold blood.', 'But defense attorney McClure felt just as strongly there was no way a jury could convict based on the evidence.', "ChristopherMcClure: They speculated the entire trial as to what happened and you just can't convict somebody on speculation.", 'But, of course, the stakes were highest for Carlos Perez-Olivo. If the verdict was a gamble, his life was what was at stake. As a veteran criminal defense attorney, he knew exactly what he was up against.', "Dennis Murphy: You've waited for a lot of juries to come back. How strange was it for you to be waiting in the courtroom for the jury to come back and decide your fate?", 'But now a jury of 12 would decide his fate. They included an IT director, a customer service supervisor, a marketing project manager, a housewife, an auto mechanic, an IT manager a phone company worker, a retired executive, and an MRI technician.', 'In a circumstantial case with no eyewitnesses, no confession to the crime, the jury was going to have to work its way through the evidence piece by piece.', 'Martin: You got the sense that this is a family that was, despite was what appeared to be kind of a wealthy lifestyle, was really kind of one event away from being completely bankrupt.', "In addition to the family's money problems, Carlos had also carried on a decade-long affair, even sending the woman flowers for her birthday and calling her the night his wife was shot to see if she got them.", "Martin: He'd defended tough guys. He'd defended drug dealers and you know people who may have been in organized crime.", 'Dennis Murphy: Did you have to consider whether his practice, defending tough guys, might have come back to haunt him. ', "And remember, Peggy's own sister as well as her children had taken the stand to tell the jury there was no way Carlos had killed his Peggy.", 'But the jurors were also going to have take a hard look at the forensics of the case. The angle of the bullets. The size and shape of the Mitsubishi. Could the struggle in the car with the gun man have happened the way Carlos described it?', 'Dorothy: We felt a great sense of responsibility and we did go over every bit of evidence.', 'The jury deliberated late into the night. And the longer they were out the more confident the defense team was that they would find their client -- Carlos Perez-Olivo -- not guilty.', "Christopher McClure: I can just say that we're encouraged by the fact that they are looking at the case carefully which is what we could ask for them to do looking at the evidence and that they are...We think they'll come to the right decision of a not guilty verdict.", "Upstairs in the courthouse, the jurors were taking a hard look at the forensics in the case. Remember, the prosecution had argued the struggle in the Mitsubishi could not have happened the way Carlos said it did. They'd shown jurors this video demonstration to show how difficult it would have been for Carlos to end up in the back seat. He would have to go through the narrow opening of the SUV's console, end up in back with the gunman -- and all the while not wake up his sleeping wife. Then the prosecution argued, there were the angle of the bullets: Peggy shot level in the head, another gunshot fired at a 90-degree angle through the back window. All of this during a wild struggle.", "Theresa: They alluded to the fact that he's too tall, too big of a guy to be able to fit through such a small area between the driver's seat and the passenger's seat.", 'Theresa: I think it could be done based on the circumstances. It could have happened. Absolutely.', 'Tom: It was a narrow car. It was a very strenuous, tough job to get into that backseat. And then what was left in the backseat seemed to be in very orderly shape.', 'Carlos Perez-Olivo: Guilty. Yeah, to me it was a shock. I believe to the attorneys it was a shock. To my family it was shock.', 'He was so angry, he put his fist right through the plaster of the courthouse wall.', 'Merced Perez-Olivo: I broke the wall. I went ballistic. Just the rage was uncontrollable but it caught me just so off-guard because I was so sure they were to find him innocent.', 'But the jurors -- those with the beliefs that mattered -- were convinced that Carlos Perez-Olivo had indeed murdered his wife of three-decades.', 'Dorothy: It was like a puzzle. It was like all the pieces fit in. It was the money, the fact that he did have this other love interest and then the fact that he was a criminal attorney he elevated himself in his own mind that he can outfox all these policemen. And the fact that he shot himself, I think he thought that nobody would figure out that he would shoot himself.', 'Frank Furillo: Yes, anybody that knew them would not believe that this could have happened.', 'But District Attorney DiFore has no doubt that Carlos Perez-Olivo did indeed kill his wife in cold blood on that dark Westchester road.', 'JanetDifore: I believe that there are people who are willing to put their own selfish self-focused needs above all those around them including the people they are supposed to love and protect and care for.', 'Judge: The defendant is a master of deceit who contrived a diabolical plan to murder his wife for his own financial gain.', 'She sentenced Carlos to the maximum: twenty five years to life -- either way likely a life sentence for the 60-year-old former attorney.', "Carlos Perez-Olivo: I'll die in jail. I do believe we all have a destiny and there's nothing you can do to change it. I can put up with anything. I can put up with the humiliations people asking me questions if I killed my wife of not. I can put up with being in jail for the rest of my life maybe in part it's easier because I'm kind of half empty after she died. ", "But that's not what the jury thought about what happened on that dark Westchester road that November night. So the onetime criminal defense lawyer who used his skills to keep clients out of prison is now himself an inmate with a number and a jumpsuit."]
