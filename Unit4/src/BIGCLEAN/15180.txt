And we've seen how manhattan, ravaged by sandy. This morning, so much of the story is set in the outside of the island, in the outer boroughs. And that's where we're seeing, now. As we take a look, staten island, badly affected by flooding. One of the hardest-hit areas here, particularly on the south shore. Hundreds of reports of residents in at least two different neighborhoods being forced to head to rooftops of buildings to escape the rising floodwaters. One local official called this situation a scene out of a war zone. And information from staten island is only beginning to trickle in. We're going to update all of this as we learn more. There's also stuff here in queens. The breezy point area, the rockaways, where the residents had to deal with rain and wind as well as fires. A six-alarm fire. The new york fire department, saving some 60 homes. 200 firefighters battling this overnight. Overnight, something very difficult to fight because of the winds and the houses are closely packed together. Abc news' jim debrill was on the scene of the fire in queens. This is what he described. Reporter: This is a community that lost the most people during 9/11. The firefighters and cons during 9/11. This area was hit horribly tonight. Many expected there would be flooding. And then, the fire just erupted. We were in a home and fire was right across from us. As this fire just spread, we waited our way to another home. And then, realized, a parking lot we were next to, the cars started to blow up. And the fire continued to spread. My understanding, it has spread across about 12 blocks of breezy point, an area they call the wedge. We thought we would come here and see people that didn't want to leave. Now, they're being forced to leave. Not by water. Not by flood. Not by sandy. But by fire. Devastation in queens. You see the areas affected in greater new york.
