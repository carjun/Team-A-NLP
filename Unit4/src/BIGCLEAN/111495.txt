['Repubican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney boards a bus on his way to a campaign even in Fremont, Calif., on Thursday.', "Romney's campaign said Friday that his assets ranged between $190 million and $250 million, and a tally by The Associated Press put the figure at the high end of that range.", 'The new financial report from Romney describes sales over the past year of a large amount of stocks that had been managed through his blind trust.

"Governor and Mrs. Romney\'s assets are managed on a blind basis," Saul said. "They do not control the investment of these assets, which are under the control and overall management of a trustee."', 'The new financial disclosure shows that even after his stock sales, Romney still made millions of dollars over the past year in lucrative bank notes and investment funds, including nearly 40 different funds associated with his former company, Bain Capital.', 'Those assets include at least two investments that had not been previously disclosed in Romney\'s 2010 financial report.

The campaign did not explain the rationale behind the stock sales, but tax forms released by the Romney campaign earlier this year showed that both the blind trust overseeing his and his wife's investments began shedding many stocks in 2010, just before he geared up his presidential campaign.", "Among the stocks that Romney sold, according to Friday's disclosure, included Wal-Mart's Mexican operation, which has been roiled by payoff allegations, and British Sky Broadcasting, the television operation sought by media magnate Rupert Murdoch.", 'Other sold stocks included Komatsu and Schlumberger, firms that have been targeted in the past for doing business in Iran.
