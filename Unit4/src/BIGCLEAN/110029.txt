['Unions and Democrats renew criticism of Citizens United following Walker recall win - ABC News', 'Unions and Democrats renew criticism of Citizens United following Walker recall win', "Union groups and their supporters spent much of Wednesday castigating billionaire donors, Citizens United and corporate power in the wake of         Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's victory over the effort to recall him from office.", '"Citizens United has ushered in a new era of elections and it\'s not a pretty picture," Trumka said, referring to the 2010 Supreme Court ruling--Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission--which determined that independent political spending by corporations and unions is protected under the First Amendment. That ruling paved the way for the creation of super PACs and other groups with unlimited spending capacity, some of which are not required to report their donors.', "Trumka was one of many figures on the left expressing anger about the power of outside money in Walker's 53 to 46 percent win over Democrat Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee and Walker's 2010 challenger. National Education Association president Dennis Van Roeke released a statement Tuesday night which included similar criticism:", "Unfortunately, the biggest winner in tonight's recall election was the corporate cash that funded the campaign of Governor Scott Walker. These millionaire donors, empowered by the Supreme Court ruling on Citizens United, have made a mockery of democracy and nearly drowned out the voices of working families in Wisconsin.", 'Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\'s Chairman Steve Israel proclaimed that the election served as a warning to Democrats that they must wage "aggressive air campaigns" to compete with outside group spending from Republican supporters.', 'But Trumka downplayed the suggestion that the Wisconsin recall would significantly change their fundraising strategy. He said his group\'s emphasis will not be shifted to "raising money and ads," following the recall result. Rather, their focus will remain on "educating and mobilizing workers."', 'Trumka said Walker and Republicans "probably have the best program money could buy" compared to the Democrats\' all-volunteer ground game. Trumka noted that Walker and supporters spent an estimated $50 million on the race and he "lost control of the state Senate." "He didn\'t gain, he got to serve the rest of his term for $50 million dollars."', "Trumka and others championed the recall of one state senator Tuesday, which changed the legislature's balance of power: 17 Democrats to 16 Republican. It remained unclear Wednesday afternoon if the Democrat in that race, John Lehman, would be declared the official winner amid a close vote count and a potential recount.", 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
