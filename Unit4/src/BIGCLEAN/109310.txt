['Sex Differences: Men and Women Actually See Differently, Say Researchers - ABC News', 'Research shows men and women view the same objects differently.  (StockImage/Getty Images)', 'Researchers at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom used eye-tracking instruments to determine exactly where study participants looked when shown various photos of scenes ranging from a village street to heterosexual sex. They found a significant gender difference in where each participant looked while viewing the photos.', 'The difference was so clear, the researchers report in the current issue of the Public Library of Science, that they could be quite accurate in determining the gender of each participant just by studying where the eyes fixated, and how long they stayed there.  They were right two thirds of the time for both sexes, and even much more frequently if the participant was female.', '"The most striking" difference, the researchers conclude, "was that women looked away from and usually below many objects of interest," especially if the image was particularly "potent."', 'In other words, women were more likely to avert their eyes when faced with a powerful image.', 'StockImage/Getty ImagesResearch shows men and women view the same...

A male chauvinist might suggest that women are so conscious of their bodies that they are always eager to find fault in the figure of a potential competitor, but the scientists don't see that as the probable explanation.", 'My guess is most people would think we would all focus on the eyes, because the eyes are viewed as the window into the soul, and there\'s little doubt that the eyes are critical in evaluating someone else.  As the researchers note, though, "fixating on the eyes carries the highest reward, but also the highest risk."', "We've all heard that old warning not to make eye contact with the thug on the street, and maybe that's at least partly what's at work here.", '"Fixating on the nose or mouth brings less reward (than focusing on the eyes) but also avoids the associated potential threat," they add.
