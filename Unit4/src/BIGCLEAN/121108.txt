['He insists employees do not threaten or harass any customers, or do anything else illegal. ', 'For years, Karen Lyons of Federal Way, Wash., was a happy Rent-A-Center customer. She went there to get furniture and a big screen TV. She knew she would pay a lot more than the retail price, but she says it was the only way she could afford these things.', 'One month, Lyons realized she was going to be a day late on her payment. So she made arrangements with the store to pay the next day.', 'The collector told Lyons, in front of her 6-year old grandson, that she would be arrested and little Jermaine would be given to the state.', 'This is not an isolated incident. Mark Patrick of College Place, Wash., says if he was even a day late with his payment, employees would call and yell at him, using profane and derogatory language.', 'In a sworn statement to the Attorney General, Patrick says an employee nearly broke down his door when he was away from home. A neighbor saw it happen.', 'I agree with Magic Johnson. Every customer deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of economic status. From the sworn statements in this case, some Rent-A-Center customers clearly feel the company misses that mark.', "A judge will decide if the actions alleged in this lawsuit are illegal. If you feel you were harassed or unfairly treated by RAC, file a complaint to your state's Attorney General or Consumer Protection Office, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (http://www.ftc.gov/)."]
