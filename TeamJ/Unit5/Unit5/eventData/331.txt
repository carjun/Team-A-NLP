The majority of the other shootings happened in either a public place packed full of primarily at least high school or college students if not adults. Yesterdays shooting, on the other hand, involved a school packed full of kindergarteners to fourth graders. The even more shocking thing was that the shooter was a 20-year old kid, Adam Lanza. As far as what has been reported so far, the only connection Lanza even has to the school is that he once attended school in the same town, and his mother is a teacher at the school. However, Lanza even fatally shot his mother at their home before she headed off to school for the day.Law enforcement officials have finally released a few more details about the shooting, but the motive is still unknown. They say they recovered three firearms used during the shooting; all of which were considered to be some of the most powerful guns on the market. The guns were legally owned and registered to his mother. It has also been announced that Mr. Lanza somehow forced his way into the school and that he did not simply walk into the building as it was originally assumed. They have not released details regarding where or how he forced entry, though.Officials went on to say that all of the bodies have been positively identified, and they have been removed as of last night. It is speculated that the identities of the children so sadly killed during the shooting will be released later this afternoon (Saturday). They say it will take several days; if not weeks or months before an official motive is found, but it is noted that they are currently interviewing people who may have knowledge on why Adam would do something so horrible aside from an assumed mental illness.Police took Adams brother into custody yesterday for interviewing, and they plan to speak with his father, who lives in another city, and the lone survivor who was shot by Adam. They believe the one, wounded survivor will be able to provide a high level of detail regarding what the shooter did upon entering the classroom she was in. Adams dad and brother will, hopefully, be able to inform investigators about issues that could have driven Adam to commit the act.
