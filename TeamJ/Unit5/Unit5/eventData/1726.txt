If he doesn't want to be here and is after a big payout because of the fact BR chose to give Sterling a chance in the Prem then what kind of a player is he really? And I have to say he has dipped in form in terms of how he started to how he is playing now in recent games, perhaps that's because people know how to play against him now but I just wanted to raise a few points that I think deserve to be made. Downvote me if you like but I'd much rather hear why you disagree, cheers.permalinksavecontextfull commentsold Liverpool tribute video I found  by  IamHappinessin  soccer[+]the_weeknd 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]the_weeknd 7 points8 points9 points 1 day agoSome fantastic memories right there.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDamien Comolli - Only time will tell if Kenny and I were right.  by  SpottieOttieDopalisin  LiverpoolFC[+]the_weeknd 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]the_weeknd 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoRorySmithTimes seems to say this is true and he also said he tweeted about it at the time this was happening.

I hear they're expanding the capacity to the stadium to 8,500 for the match which is pretty good for a Non-League side but with that said tickets will go fast so if you want home tickets keep a look out for any annoncments on Mansfields website for when they are made available.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo my hometown Mansfield Town just beat Lincoln in The FA Cup third round, looks like a Mansfield Town vs Liverpool FC 4th round fixture, absolutely buzzing!  by  the_weekndin  LiverpoolFC[+]the_weeknd[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]the_weeknd[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoMy bad, I got a little excited lol.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo my hometown Mansfield Town just beat Lincoln in The FA Cup third round, looks like a Mansfield Town vs Liverpool FC 4th round fixture, absolutely buzzing!  by  the_weekndin  LiverpoolFC[+]the_weeknd[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]the_weeknd[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoIn fairness you were the better side and we were lucky in the end to win on the night.

Open discussion about the strongest performance as we near the Winter Break  by  WhosYourPapain  soccer[+]the_weeknd 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago*(0 children)[]the_weeknd 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago*Did you just say La Liga is competitive?And no, Bayern Munchen are not the strongest team in my eyes, it only takes 2 seconds to compare your squad with the likes of Barca and Real Madrid and you can see the difference. Hell even Manchester City have a better squad than yours, they just don't play like it.Edit- Reading some of your comments has made me laugh and question how bias you are towards your favored team, which is understandable as its a trap a lot of us fall into. If you are having a hard time comparing the best footballing side of our generation to your in form team then you definitely have no argument 'you lazy twat'. Edit, edit -What does that account for? The competitiveness of the league? The standard of opposition? You just contradicted yourself.You focus on the positives of your group finish yet overlook the opposition and upsets that came with it.How is it competitive if Bayern are so far ahead? I would elaborate if there were any logic or intelligence to your argument but there simply isn't.Downvote me all you like but that isn't going to prove anything..permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe top 6 goalscorers in Europe without penalties counted.
