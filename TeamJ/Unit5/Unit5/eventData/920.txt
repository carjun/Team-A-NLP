The media may continue to make mass murderers famous but I believe redditors can be better than that.  by  meandmyarrowin  PoliticalDiscussion[+]playpianoking -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]playpianoking -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoIf the shooter plans on killing others and himself because he doesn't care then he probably doesn't care about being famous because he's dead.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

I would like to hear your thoughts on both sides.  by  redddayin  PoliticalDiscussion[+]playpianoking 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]playpianoking 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI have questioned the basis of land ownership before - it sounds like you support the resource-based-economy as seen in the Zeitgeist films?  Unfortunately, while well intentioned, land is never taken care of with great care when it is socially owned compared to when a private owner has put in his/her own money and resources.  Slave owners is anti-freedom.  I am a libertarian - which assumes the non-aggression principle and that people own their own bodies.  Slave owners would be committing force on 'slaves' and I would support them trying to fight back.  There is always competition for workers.  What we have now is a glut of workers at the same educational level caused by the artificial demand for college due to government guaranteed loans.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]playpianoking 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]playpianoking 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agocans used to be 50 cents through vending machines; however 99% of voters support candidates that support the federal reserve to keep printing money and cause inflation as well as increased cost to keep up with regulations.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]playpianoking 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]playpianoking 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agothen create your own infrastructure and charge .00001 and make them go out of business...permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]playpianoking 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]playpianoking 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoBecause 99% of voters do not believe in freedom.
