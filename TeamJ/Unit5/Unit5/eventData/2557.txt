We use guns for self defence because it's easier to kill with a gun.

Unfortunately you didn't back that opinion up with facts but with a story you made up simply to make it sound plausible.    It's not a bad story. You string one plausible sounding horrible event to another and let the reader dig himself into a deep dark hole. And from that perspective you offer your opinion. I believe the offical term for that is "framing".permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe US Military Approves Bombing Children  by  caferrellin  EndlessWar[+]redrover 9 points10 points11 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]redrover 9 points10 points11 points 8 days agoStory telling is not the same thing as reporting.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday's Lesson  by  biscuitmapin  Libertarian[+]redrover 2 points3 points4 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]redrover 2 points3 points4 points 10 days agohand outs create dependence     Making people work for mere hand outs doesn't improve their situation either.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRachel Maddow's Blind Deference to Government Power | Reason.com  by  LibertarianSoupin  Libertarian[+]redrover 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]redrover 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoOh, you're such a frickin' redditor!

Libertarians using the word "statist" is like white people using the word "nigger".permalinksavecontextfull commentsRachel Maddow's Blind Deference to Government Power | Reason.com  by  LibertarianSoupin  Libertarian[+]redrover 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]redrover 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoWell, it's never a good idea to confuse a part with the whole.

Because some party proclaims to have a "mandate of the people"? The mere ability to bring change is not sufficient, it has to be the correct type of change. Finding that takes careful thought and discussion, something that is found quite easily in a government that has to navigate the viscous morass of coalition politics.    The fascination with using proportionalism in defence of victim groups     Well, god forbid people vote for a political party that actually represents them in government.    the institutionalisation of multitudinous identities, and the end of majority rule in favour of power sharing, all of these serve to break the network of trust that binds the citizen to their state    I would actually say the reverse is true. There is no way I could ever feel represented in a two party system, certainly not on a European scale.    The most important benefit of the FPTP system over PR is that it allows the electorate to punish failure, by kicking them out of office.     Typical binary thinking. I guess most Europeans have a more fluid idea of politics.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLand and air quadcopter.

It only requires (familial) connections. Sure, it's usually a tit for tat, which libertarianism doesn't have problem with, but it's also limited to a group (let's say the 100 monkeys or so that people can empatize with).permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy do Libertarians have so much faith in human nature?  by  MMSTINGRAYin  Libertarian[+]redrover -3 points-2 points-1 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]redrover -3 points-2 points-1 points 16 days agoSticks and stones, dude.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy do Libertarians have so much faith in human nature?  by  MMSTINGRAYin  Libertarian[+]redrover -1 points0 points1 point 17 days ago (0 children)[]redrover -1 points0 points1 point 17 days agoLuckily you don't have to pay for the right to life, liberty, and property if everyone agrees to uphold them.What does that even mean? Life costs money, liberty is meaningless without options and options cost money, property costs money. So rights cost money. Can I afford those rights? Maybe, maybe not.    They're long term goals.     It's sometime in the future... vague and abstract.... hard to see, it is...    Like paring down our out of control Federal Government     Meh, when has the Federal Government ever not been accused by someone of being "out of control"? And yet, "out of control" governement was re-elected a month ago.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
