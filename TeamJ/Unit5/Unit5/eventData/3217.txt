Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., author of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which lapsed in 2004.President Obama brushed away tears as he offered condolences to the families of the 26 victims, 20 of them children."We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics," the president said.The assault weapons ban outlawed 19 types of military-style rifles as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines. Feinstein has called for re-introduction of an "updated" assault weapons ban. And President Obama said during a presidential debate that he wants "a broader conversation" on gun violence that would include "seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced."But the ban, anathema to the National Rifle Association and many if not most gun owners, was not the focal point Friday of Feinstein, Obama or even stalwart gun-control organizations such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence."We're a better country than this," said Brian Malte, the Brady campaign's director of network mobilization. "We're optimistic the American public wants to have this conversation, that voices of Americans will be heard throughout the country after what happened today."Indeed, within hours of the Newtown shootings, six petitions appeared on the White House's website calling for the president to address issues related to mass shootings. All the petitions had at least 200 signatures, and one had garnered more than 5,000.Gun-rights advocates for the most part were mute. The NRA did not return a phone call seeking comment.The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade organization for U.S. gun manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retailers, has its headquarters in Newtown. It released a statement saying "our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this horrible tragedy in our community." But spokesman Michael Bazinet declined further comment "out of respect for the families, the community and the ongoing police investigation."The guns recovered at the scene, two pistols and a semi-automatic rifle, are the types that have become standard weapons of recent mass-shooting incidents. The two pistols, a Glock and a Sig Sauer, are popular with law enforcement officers and the military.The semi-automatic rifle, a variation of the AR-15 (which is itself modeled on the U.S. military's Vietnam-era standard M-16), is made by Bushmaster in Ilion, west of Albany. Capable of holding a 30-round magazine, it was the weapon of choice of the D.C. sniper, John Allen Muhammad, who was executed in Virginia for his reign of terror in 2002 in which he killed 10 victims at random along with his young accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo.Because the Connecticut shooter, Adam Lanza, killed so many people in such a short time, firearms experts wondered whether he used high-capacity magazines  the kind favored by James Holmes at his movie theater shooting spree in Aurora, Colo., last July, which killed 12 and wounded 57.Six states, including California and New York, either ban or limit the use of high-capacity magazines.Email: dan@hearstdc.com Printable Version Email ThisTweetWorld and national newsAs Conn. story unfolds, media struggle with factsA glimpse of victims of the Conn. school shootingConn. town mourns as police look for answersEgyptians take quarrel over charter to the polls2nd storm brings heavy snow, I-40 closureConservationists team up with ranchers, loggersMandela undergoes successful gallstone surgeryIsraeli election downplays Palestinian issueOwner of Rivera plane denies drug connectionsSoldier from Rochester dies of combat woundsUN court orders release of Argentine ship in GhanaPresident's pot comments prompt call for policyPhoto Galleries Local photos National photos Weather photosTop JobsThe Daughters of Charity Weare currently seeking caring, friendly individuals for the followi...moreMEDICAL PRACTICE PATIENTRUNNER Duties include: Rooming all the patients, able to weigh pat...moreMDS COORDINATOR - Full-timePosition available immediately.
