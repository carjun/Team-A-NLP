Paul Vance provides an update on the investigation of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, telling reporters that two adult survivors who suffered gunshot wounds at the school are recovering. By M. Alex Johnson and Becky Bratu, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:38 p.m. ET: Police said Monday that two adults were injured but survived the shootings at Sandy Hook  Elementary School in Connecticutand will be interviewed as soon as they're well enough to answer questions.Follow @NBCNewsUSConnecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance confirmed that a second adult was injured and survived, saying both were wounded in the "lower extremities."Initial reports last week suggested that only one person had been injured and survived.In the meantime, authorities were interviewing other witnesses and analyzing the evidence found at the school and the shooter's home. Among the physical evidence was a computer believed to belong to the gunman that had been heavily damaged.Advertise | AdChoices There are many, many witnesses, Vance said Monday, promising that any interviews with children would be handled "extremely delicately."Authorities say Adam Lanza, 20, shot  his mother in the head multiple times Friday at their home in Newtown, Conn., before heading to the school, where he fired hundreds of rounds and died with  hundreds more at his disposal. He killed 20 children and six women at the school, they said.At a news conference in Hartford, the state capital,Gov. Dan Malloy called for a statewide moment of silence and for churches to ring their bells on Friday precisely one week after the shootings.Newtown begins burying 'little souls' lost in school slaughterAn explanation still hasn't emerged for why Lanza killed  the 26 people at Sandy Hook.Malloy appeared to open a  window for speculation when he told NBC News on Sunday that Lanza attended Sandy Hook as a youngster. But Vance said Monday that police had discovered no connection between Lanza and the school. Earlier reports that his  mother, Nancy, may have taught there also haven't borne out.The children  12 girls and eight boys, all of  them 6 or 7 years old  were shot as many as 11 times, authorities said. It appeared that Lanza had enough weapons and ammunition with him to have killed many more.Obama reassures Newtown 'you are not alone' at vigil for victims of Connecticut school shootingsIn addition toan assault-style rifle and at least two handguns, he also had a shotgun in reserve in the car he drove to the school.And when he was found, Lanza still had hundreds of rounds of ammunition in multiple magazines, after having already fired hundreds of rounds inside the school, where he killed himself with a gunshot to the head as emergency crews arrived.Police said they were analyzing his the weaponry and checking out local gun ranges to learn whether he had ever been spotted at one of them.Investigators had had high hopes that they could learn more from Lanza's computer, which was found at the home he shared with his mother. But law enforcement sources told NBC News' Pete Williams on Monday that the computer was heavily damaged and that its hard drive had been removed.Conn. shooting suspect Adam Lanza's father: 'We too are asking why'Police said Monday that they had had no previous contact with Lanza, and officials atWestern Connecticut State University in Danbury  where Lanza enrolled at about 16 in 2008  said there was never any indication of trouble.Malloy declined to say whether any documented evidence had been uncovered that Lanza might have been mentally disturbed.But he said there were indications that Lanza had had a deeply troubled childhood.Lanza's parents were divorced, and he lived with his mother, who home-schooled him for part of his childhood, Malloy said.Connecticut school shooter was 'very nervous around people'"He never seemed to be a good  fit," Malloy said. "It was a very difficult time for him and his mother."Investigators have resolutely refused to go into detail about the timing of events Friday  during official briefings. But investigators have told NBC News that Lanza  first killed his mother, an avid gun enthusiast, with her own gun and then took multiple weapons with him as he drove to the school in her car.To  bypass security, Lanza smashed in a window, they said. He shot and  killed Principal Dawn Hochsprung, 47, and Mary Sherlach, 56, a school  psychologist, before proceeding to a classroom, where he found the door  locked.Advertise | AdChoices So he moved on to a second classroom, where he killed  everyone he found, before doing the same in a third classroom,  investigators believe. He then shot himself.Watch US News crime videos on NBCNews.comAlthough  he was carrying three weapons, he used only one of them in all of the  school killings  a Bushmaster .223-caliber assault-style rifle similar  to the one used by the snipers who terrorized the Washington, D.C., area  in 2002. It was purchased legally, they said. He used one of the  handguns to kill himself.Authorities haven't said how Nancy Lanza stored the weapons.Chief Justice Correspondent Pete Williams and Isolde Raftery of NBC Newscontributed to this report.More content from NBCNews.com: Conn. school victims all shot multiple times, chief medical officer  saysMom of suspected school shooter was avid gun enthusiast, friend  saysNewtown mourns: Candlelight vigils, Beanie Babies and a lot of  tearsVictims: Daring principal, fun-loving teacher, 6-year-old twin  brotherLives saved by teachers,  custodian and even kidsFollow US news from NBCNews.com on Twitter and Facebook344commentsExplore related topics: connecticut, shooting, school, sandy, hook, connecticut-school-shootingolder2daysagoSnow storms forecast for parts of New England, Northwestnewer2daysagoUmbrella, not gun, prompts Pennsylvania high school lockdownMost popular postsolder2daysagoSnow storms forecast for parts of New England, Northwestnewer2daysagoUmbrella, not gun, prompts Pennsylvania high school lockdownMost popular posts555Lone survivor in Connecticut classroom: 'Mommy, I'm OK, but all of my friends are dead'2daysago512Family: Newtown boy's favorite teacher died cradling him in her arms24hoursago1052Very heavily armed gunman shot mother multiple times before killing 26 at Connecticut school, police say3daysago1279Newtown gunman forced his way into school, police say4daysago879Authorities ID gunman who killed 27 in elementary school massacre5daysagoBrowsefeatured, crime, military, weather, environment, california, florida, shooting, education, us-news, new-york, gulf-oil-spill, texas, kari-huus, police, chicago, trayvon-martin, obama, afghanistan, sandy, los-angeles, murder, new-jersey, politics, barack-obama, george-zimmerman, colorado, gay, religion, school, hurricane, decision-2012, arizona, penn-state, veteransAlsoAdvertise | AdChoices Archives2012December (308)November (460)October (477)September (432)August (525)July (519)June (508)May (566)April (538)March (576)February (471)January (417)2011December (455)November (190)October (9)September (3)August (51)July (8)June (3)May (12)April (5)March (3)February (1)January (8)2010December (5)November (1)October (2)September (28)August (40)July (35)June (177)May (50)April (9)March (2)February (2)January (4)2009December (5)November (5)October (2)September (11)August (4)July (12)June (1)May (1)April (1)March (3)February (3)January (2)2008December (3)November (2)October (6)September (30)August (26)July (10)June (4)May (8)April (13)March (9)February (7)January (6)2007December (10)November (6)October (22)September (11)Most CommentedElementary school massacre: 20 children among 28 killed in Connecticut slaughter  (11329)EXCLUSIVE: Susan Rice drops out of running for secretary of state, cites 'very politicized' confirmation process (1970)Same-sex wife of Army officer banned from joining Fort Bragg spouses club (2300)Fierce debate after Newtown school shootings: Where was God?
