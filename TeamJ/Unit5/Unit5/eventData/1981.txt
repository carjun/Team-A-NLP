Oh wait, the NRA says that it is inappropriate to talk about gun control in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting, wait until the next news cycle. Maybe we should lower the legal age of gun ownership so that these toddlers could have defended themselves? Right, NRA?Mental health care should be able to be easier to get than a gun...permalinksaveparent[+]Patargh 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*(2 children)[]Patargh 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*Try and keep it a little more classier. I know it's horrific, but it really is no time to discuss policy during the incident.Edit: grammarpermalinksaveparent[+]MediocreJerk 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*(1 child)[]MediocreJerk 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*I completely disagree. Clearly we shouldn't use a crisis to push forward legislation, but how many mass shootings have you witnessed in your life? How many have led to any type of serious change in policy? If we don't talk about it now, while the issue is at the forefront, it will be buried by the subsequent news cycles. This happens every single time, gun-nuts say it's insensitive to discuss policy and bury the issue. Every single time. It's not disrespectful to the victims, on the contrary, I want to prevent anything like this from happening again. 31,347 people died from gun violence in the U.S. last year. This is absolute lunacy and something needs to be done about it. Edit: Ezra Klein puts it better than I ever could.

And you might want to check your source, those facts are for the year 2009 (which shouldn't change your stance, but you might want to quote it correctly.)permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
