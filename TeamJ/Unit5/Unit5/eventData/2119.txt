Intentionally, not because they were in the way. It's possible the kids were the only targets and all the adults killed were only shot because they tried to stop them. We know people go crazy and think slaughtering people indiscriminately is a good idea. We know people will kill people they think have wronged them. We even know people are nuts enough to do things like murdering their own children when faced with the prospect of losing them.But slaughtering a whole bunch of little school children? They didn't wrong you. They weren't just in the way. That's a special kind of sick. And somehow there were two that felt this way.permalinksaveparent[+]tha_snazzle 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]tha_snazzle 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours agoThat is an unfathomable kind of sick. Before today, I truly could not have imagined it was possible for even the sickest, most evil individual to do something like this. Trying to imagine a motive for this is like trying to comprehend the concept of infinity; my brain just won't do it.permalinksaveparent[+]Taniwha_NZ 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago*(3 children)[]Taniwha_NZ 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago*Really? I mean there have been several incidents involving mass shootings of tiny kids in school over the last few years in Europe. Some were terrorists, there was one 16-year-old who killed 16 kids a couple of years ago in Germany.I'm not trying to make light of anything happening today but unless you're Amish - i.e. cut off from the outside - you should have already known this happens.edit: I forgot somehow, this happened yesterday http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20723910 - Some nut enters a school in China and stabs 22 kids, killing 2.permalinksaveparent[+]tha_snazzle 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (1 child)[]tha_snazzle 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoMaybe I'm too idealistic.permalinksaveparent[+]StackOfFiveMarmots 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]StackOfFiveMarmots 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoThis is likely.  Check out the Bath School bombings.  That was in 1927.  History is rife with equally atrocious deeds.permalinksaveparent[+]emmeline_grangerford 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]emmeline_grangerford 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours agoA few years ago, a shooter broke into an Amish schoolhouse and shot five children dead. (Source). Even the Amish know that this happens, unfortunately. permalinksaveparent[+]TestAcctPlsIgnore 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]TestAcctPlsIgnore 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours agoMedia reports the suspect specifically came to kill his mother who was a kindergarten teacher.permalinksaveparent[+]katihathor 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]katihathor 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agolater reports indicate that he killed his mother first at their home, and then proceeded to go to the schoolpermalinksaveparent[+]cordoroy 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]cordoroy 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agothe news is reporting execution style...permalinksaveparent[+]Gyella 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Gyella 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoThis would make sense b/c if the guy was just spraying bullets, there would have been much higher injuries, not fatalities. The fact that they're reporting he was only in 2 classrooms and killed this many kids leads me to believe that it must have been execution style. There better be a special level of hell just for this guy. Absolutely disgusting, cowardly, etc...etc.. Words cannot describe the type of tragedy this is. Unfuckingbelievable.permalinksaveparent[+]KosherDill 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (1 child)[]KosherDill 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoWHAT?! What a son of a bitch, mother fuckin asshole. The last time I heard that happening was in Lancaster when the dickhead went into a one room Amish schoolhouse. What a total dick, I hope he's burning in hell. permalinksaveparent[+]devnaught 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]devnaught 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoIts times like these that I wish there was a hell for people like this to go to.permalinksaveparent[+]Waelsleahta 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (5 children)[]Waelsleahta 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoAnd since there were 2 shooters, not just a lone crazed gunman...it's as if a madness for cruelty has become contagious. permalinksaveparent[+]madethisinasecond 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (4 children)[]madethisinasecond 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoCan you link to information about there being two? I am only seeing reports of one. permalinksaveparent[+]Waelsleahta 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Waelsleahta 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoApparently the second person was not involved: http://www.examiner.com/article/school-shooting-connecticut-shooter-was-parent-of-a-child "They did get one other man out of the building, but he appears to not be involved at all in the shootings."The information I had before was wrong.permalinksaveparent[+]labienus 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]labienus 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoThere are always rumours about a second shooter when this stuff happens. There basically never is one. permalinksaveparent[+]skottdaman 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]skottdaman 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoExcept the Columbine High School massacrepermalinksaveparent[+]labienus 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]labienus 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoYes, but not the Aurora shooting, Utoya shooting, Winnenden shooting.. all of which had rumors about a mystery second shooter initially. This one definitely doesn't have one.permalinksaveparent[+]dtercz -3 points-2 points-1 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]dtercz -3 points-2 points-1 points 22 hours agoThat's a special kind of sick.That's a fucked up kind of sick.FTFYpermalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
