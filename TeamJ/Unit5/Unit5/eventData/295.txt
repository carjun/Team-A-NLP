(AP Photo/Newtown Bee, Shannon Hicks)  Elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn. gallery (30 photos)The alleged gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Adam Lanza, had an argument with four staff members at the school the day before the shooting, officials told NBC.NBC reports that on Dec. 13 Lanza went to the school and was in an altercation with four staff members, three of whom were killed in yesterday's shooting.The fourth person was not at the school the day of the shooting, NBC reports, and is being interviewed by investigators.State police said at a conference this morning that they found evidence at Lanza's mother's home that may determine a motive for the tragedy.NBC also reported that Lanza went to a sporting goods store in Danbury on Dec. 11 and tried to buy an assault rifle but was denied.Among the adults killed was the principal, Dawn Hochsprung; a school psychologist, Mary Sherlach, who has family ties to Gloucester County and first grade teacher, Victoria Soto.The Associated Press reported that the principal, Hochsprung was killed while lunging at the gunman as she tried to overtake him. Board of Education chairwoman Debbie Liedlien said administrators were coming out of a meeting when the gunman forced his way into the school and ran toward him. Jeff Capeci is chairman of the towns Legislative Council. Asked whether Hochsprung is a hero, he says, "From what we know, its hard to classify her as anything else." Hochsprung had worked at the school for two years. Both Liedlien and Capeci say she immediately became a beloved figure. Liedlien says "its so sad to lose somebody like her" and that residents are feeling "a deep sense of loss" over her death.Similar reports of heroism were reported about teachers throughout the day. Soto, the first grade teacher killed, was ushering students into a classroom closet when she came face to face with the gunman, Sotos cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told the Wall Street Journal.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Related StoriesConnecticut school shooting: Psychologist killed had family in South JerseyConnecticut school massacre shocks nation, leaves 27 deadCopyright 2012 NJ.com.
