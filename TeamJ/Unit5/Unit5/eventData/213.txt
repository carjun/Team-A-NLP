Serrano, Alana Semuels and Tina Susman, Los Angeles TimesDecember 14, 2012, 6:48 p.m.NEWTOWN, Conn.  A gunman massacred 20 children and six adults at a suburban elementary school here Friday morning before killing himself in what appeared to be the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, authorities said.Sources said Adam Lanza, 20, earlier killed his mother at home and then drove her Honda to Sandy Hook Elementary School equipped with firearms that were registered to one or both of his divorced parents.Clad in military fatigues and carrying two semiautomatic pistols, he entered the school, argued with someone in the hallway and then opened fire on staff members and children around 9:30 a.m., a law enforcement source said. He focused his gunfire on two rooms. Children huddled in closets and corners as the carnage unfolded.Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance said police searched "every nook and cranny" of the kindergarten-through-fourth-grade campus after receiving a 911 call. He said 18 children and seven adults were found dead at the school  including the shooter  and two other children died at the hospital. Victims' bodies remained inside the school into the evening as relatives were gathered at a nearby fire station.Vance did not officially identify the shooter or any of the dead. He said another adult had been killed elsewhere in Newtown, but he did not say whether it was Lanza's mother. Police are questioning Lanza's 24-year-old brother, Ryan, of Hoboken, N.J., the Associated Press reported.It was the deadliest school shooting since 32 were murdered in the 2007 Virginia Tech rampage."Evil visited this community today," Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said Friday evening. "It's too early to speak of recovery."Chris Manfredonia, whose 6-year-old daughter attends the school, was heading there Friday morning to help make gingerbread houses with first-graders when he heard popping sounds and smelled sulfur.He ran around the school trying to reach his daughter and was briefly handcuffed by police. He later found his child, who had been locked in a small room with a teacher."The whole reason we moved here a year ago is because when you drive down the subdivision, it's a happy place," said his wife, Georgeann Manfredonia. "There's a ton of children here and the families are very kind and supportive."Geneva Cunningham, 9, a fourth-grader, said she was in the library when the shooting erupted and she heard "a lot of screaming and yelling."She said the school loudspeaker came on, and through it came the sound of a scream and then "really deep breathing."A teacher ordered her and other students into a closet. "They told us it was a drill and that it was for our own safety," she said. "When it was happening there was a lot of glass shattering." At first, she said, some students thought an animal was loose. She said she heard about seven muted gunshots.A fourth-grade boy told CNN that he was in the gym when he heard pops and bangs."We thought it was the custodian knocking stuff down," the boy said. "We heard screaming ... and then the police came in and said, 'Is he in here?'"When it was deemed safe, students were led out of the school. They were told to close their eyes. Some were taken to a nearby fire station. Some ran. Some walked single-file, hands on each other's shoulders.Parents rushed to collect their children. Others waited in anguish for news of their kids' fate. People trickled out of the school throughout the day.The school sits at the end of a two-lane road, lined with barns converted to houses, in an affluent town of about 28,000 people about 60 miles from New York City. The scene quickly bore the hallmarks of other mass casualties, with whirling news helicopters and masses of reporters, law enforcement and rescue personnel.The street leading to the school, cut off to most cars Friday, became a pathway for people running to the school to find out what happened to loved ones.Susan Birge, a mental health disaster counselor, spent Friday afternoon in the fire station down the road from the school, huddling with grieving families.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Times12next|  single pageComments49Comments (49)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQPink-Views at 11:39 AM December 15, 2012                2 mass killings within 2 weeks:Oregon mall shooterConn schooterSome people can't cope with this bad economy.

Too many Americans are stressing out.jopsjennings at 9:53 AM December 15, 2012                Gun control might be a good thing, but it has little to do with how or whether this massacre took place. At heart, ours is a bloodthirsty society full of a-holes, which is given to glorifying violence in entertainment and in the individuals who are chosen to receive the most respect and honor.Was this murderer even capable of making a full distinction between his planned massacre and the video games he probably played regularly?It will be easy to pass a couple of laws against guns, and might even help. But what will we do in terms of confronting the thirst for blood in our American hearts that truly drives these kinds of mass-slayings? Are we willing to dial the violence of our movies and video games down a notch? Are we willing to discontinue the death penalty? What about cage fighting? We are so full of frustration and hatred, that some of these most violent activities have become cathartic and sacred to us. And when hatred is that pervasive, destructive weapons will be made available one way or another.LouieOfWaikiki at 9:50 AM December 15, 2012                "Evil visited this community today," Gov.Dannel P. Malloysaid Friday evening. The real evil that visited is the blood money that is so cherished in our society, and the cowardice of the poiticians who ignore these heinous outcomes. The second amendment says that we have the right to a well regulated militia, and to keep and bear arms. That's it. It does specify that we can have semi-automatics and no one can argue that semi automatics belong in a private citizens hands for any constructive purpose. If you have a driver's license, it does not give license to drive a Formula 1 race cars on public roadways, and for good reason. Background checks are all well and good, and should be in place for the purchase of "useful" firearms (e.g. hunting rifles), but a nation-wide ban on weapons of mass killing with no grandfather clause is what's needed now, before it's too late again.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
