Over the weekends I sometimes went to Galata bridge for fishing. This was very common. You would've seen a ton of people doing the same. (Not sure if that's the case today). There I found this old guy whom I ended up having long chats as we enjoyed the nice spring sun and reeled in our catch. Everyone is a bit worried about talking negative about Ataturk in Turkey. There is a law against defaming his name and legacy so it's understandable. Towards end of 80s and 90s, turkish intelligence also tried to dupe people into talking negative about Ataturk. So I was a little concerned when he brought up the subject. He asked me if I knew about Kilic Ali. I was clueless. It turns out Kilic Ali was the head of "Istiklal Mahkemeleri" at some point. He pointed at the base of the bridge towards the inlet (towards Eyp and Kasmpaa) then he claimed as a kid he saw that the water was covered with cut off heads all thanks to Kilic Ali and his swift executions. He said that the majority of the executions were due to people not wearing western hats. Also my grandfather(a veteran of War of Independence) was severely beaten by Ismet Inon's gendarmerie in the early 40s for not wearing a western hat. They only stopped when he stopped moving and he was bedridden for months.(He was a farmer, him wearing a western hat would have been absurd) Many couldn't afford these hats which were imported by corrupt government officials from Europe and forced upon people.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter Earth (2013) Trailer  by  ddelrymplein  movies[+]cold_rush 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]cold_rush 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoNot so much with death...I heard a deaf...permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan City supporter who ran on Etihad Stadium pitch apologises: "I would like to apologise to all those affected by my actions yesterday, particularly Mr Ferdinand..
