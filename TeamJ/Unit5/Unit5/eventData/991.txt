Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Pedobear_Slayer 19 points20 points21 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Pedobear_Slayer 19 points20 points21 points 20 hours agoSo Fox news is reporting that Adam Lanza woke up and shot his mom in the face, at home, then went to her school and killed her class of kids. The dad is alive and being questioned by Hoboken LE in NJ, and Ryan is being questioned by them as well. There are also reports of a person being pulled out of the woods near the school by police, and reports that Adam Lanza's girlfriend and another friend are missing, who knows how much truth will be found in those reports will be seen since everything has been one big ball of confusion by the media so far.permalinksavecontextfull commentsYou can just hear the NFL Follies music  by  cubedGin  nfl[+]Pedobear_Slayer 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Pedobear_Slayer 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours agoIt could be worse.permalinksavecontextfull commentsYes, that dress does makes your ass look awesome. {SEMI-NSFW}  by  cycophukin  pics[+]Pedobear_Slayer 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Pedobear_Slayer 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoDave Chappelle - "You may not be a whore but you are definitely wearing a whore's uniform" permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm excited to have Braylon back, but this is the guy I miss the most.

At least 27 dead, 14 children.  by  EthicalReasoningin  politics[+]Pedobear_Slayer 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago*(0 children)[]Pedobear_Slayer 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago*This shit is not about gun control anymore than putting in more policies to keep them out of the hands of the mentally ill, it's about mental health, it's about cost of care that goes with mental health and any other kind of health care, it's about our culture and about lack of parenting or lack of quality parent/child relationships, lack of family relationships, lack of friendships, it's about the stresses put upon each and every one of us in the US to succeed by a culture dominated by labeling, and it's about the lack of community we feel for one another as a society in a face to face way, people aren't real to some people anymore, we've become so invested with being online and just wanting to be left alone that sometimes we forget that with a little bit of effort we can help someone that feels alone that shouldn't be alone, we need to show a little bit more of our humanity and compassion to one another and form better relationships with each other.At this point the core of the motive is Adam Lanza traveled from NJ after killing his girlfriend, to kill his mom who is a teacher at this school in CT, yes more obviously was included in this but he wanted to kill his mom, that says a lot about him, her, and their relationship, almost all of these incidents could be avoided if better relationships existed in their lives in one aspect or another, we as people depend on one another, it's our nature, we depend on our parents and mentors to mold and shape us, we depend on family and friends to keep us strong, we depend on people we meet through our journey in life to not make it a nightmare for us, whether that be our boss, co-workers, fellow students, or some stranger on the street, is it so hard to not be a prick and to put our best foot forward even if the person we attempt to be nice to is a complete prick? After all that is said though we can only be early warning systems against people with mental illness, getting them the care they need, putting better safeguards in the gun purchase process to prevent them from getting one. However also some people are just mean evil pricks and we can't help against that. permalinksavecontextfull comments8012I know it's probably a dumb question but Brady or Josh Freeman for week 15?

I also blame the parenting as well, most of these kids come from a seeming to be good home but who knows what goes on behind closed doors, and if parents don't know their kids the way they should things like these changes in mental states go unnoticed. A lot of people of course will want to blame the availability of guns, you can go into the guns don't kill people, people kill people view but in my opinion it's the mystery and stigma attached to guns, knives, and other forms of weaponry that causes the fringe types to become interested in them or to use them, if there was more education on the proper handling of weapons readily available or even as part of the basic curriculum it would take away most of the accidental gun deaths and some of these deaths because it would take on a "been there, done that" mentality that most of us fall into after experiencing something. Ultimately I think that if someone has it in their heads to kill someone they will use whatever they can, so if guns were not available the murder weapon would be a knife, bomb, sword, bare hands, cars, etc. People are going to kill people, it's just the way it is, before guns existed we did it, before swords existed we did, before bows and arrows existed we did it, one of our oldest biblical stories is about a brother killing a brother in jealous rage, why would anything change now? permalinksavecontextfull commentsESPN Week 15 Power Rankings: "The Falcons were in playoff form against the Panthers in Week 14."

Jets fans, not so much most other Jets fans want everything now and unless it is all sunshine and roses they will bitch and complain and eat up every piece of bullshit the media feeds them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL ...
