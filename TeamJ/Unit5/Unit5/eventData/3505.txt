See More A few moments ago I spoke with bill hart, a spokesperson for the newtown, connecticut board of education. Here's what he had to say. The plan is to re-open the schools on tuesday. Why is it so important to get things moving again. Well, all the mental health experts we talked to and the state has done a wonderful job of bringing in some help tell us it's the best thing to do to get back to normal operations as soon as possible. Best for the children and for the staff and for the complupts. What do you do with the students who are enrolled at this elementary school? Well, this school here, we're clearly not going to be in this building any time in the foreseeable future but close to a plan to move the community to -- the school community to another location. Those details will probably come out today. I'm not really prepared to really say but we know it'll work. Do you think you can ever re-open this school and what would you say to parents who say I never want to send my child -- I would probably feel very much the same way. My three daughters went to this school and we have many memories there. I think trying to understand what we're going to do with that is a long process and, you know, we're not anywhere prepared to make those decisions now. You talked about importance of re-establishing routine but it's going to be hard to do in this atmosphere. What kind of special allowances will you take for the staff and students who are really hurting as you try to establish -- we brought in mental health professionals from all over the state and have special training for people and know some of the teachers might not be prepared to come back and be prepared with substitutes and counseling for all the people. We've prepared to do whatever we have to do to help all of our community. We keep hearing these stories of the valor displayed by the principal at this elementary school and also some of the teachers. What are your though that. Well, I think we had -- that's really the big story here. There's some incredible heroes and I think what they did moving to move all the children to safe locations and going through our lockdown location saved countless more lives. Those teachers, the taff that were there, the first responders who came in, they're the people who are the real heroes. Bill hart, you so a difficult job and I wish you the best. Thank you, dan. 0Comment on this videoABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSshows:GMAGMA LIVE!GMA Recipes GMA Concert SeriesWorld NewsWorld News with David MuirNightline20/20Most Fascinating People Primetime NightlineDiane Sawyer SpecialsPrimetimeThis WeekWhat Would You Do?World News NowABC News NowPlaylist:GMA: 12/18/12GMA: 12/17/12GMA: 12/16/12GMA: 12/15/12GMA: 12/14/12GMA: 12/12/12GMA Birthday WishesGMA Backstage PassAround the WatercoolerHome > Video > GMA > GMA: 12/16/12Watch the Full EpisodeGMA 12/16: Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting Triggers Gun Control DebatePastor Explains How Girl Played Dead to Survive; Adam Lanza Got Guns From Mother Pastor Explains How Girl Played Dead to Survive Pastor Explains How Girl Played Dead to SurviveLara Spencer gets firsthand account of a little girl's tale of survival.Newtown Board of Education Spokesperson Speaks About the TragedyNewtown Board of Education Spokesperson Speaks About the TragedyBill Hart has the latest information from Sandy Hook Elementary school.Adam Lanza Got Guns From Gun Owning MotherAdam Lanza Got Guns From Gun Owning MotherBrian Ross investigates Sandy Hook gunman's access to deadly weapons.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Remembering the VictimsSandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Remembering the VictimsAmy Robach describes the impact of the tragedy on the local community.Connecticut Shooting: Churches Services Honor VictimsConnecticut Shooting: Churches Services Honor VictimsJuju Chang details the emotional candlelight vigil in Newtown, Conn.Hillary Clinton Suffers Concussion After FaintingHillary Clinton Suffers Concussion After FaintingDavid Kerley reports the latest on the Secretary of State's health scare.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Americans and GunsSandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Americans and GunsPierre Thomas looks into the spotlight the Connecticut shooting has placed on America's thriving gun community.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Explaining the TragedySandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Explaining the TragedyWillow Bay explains how to answer children's questions about the shooting.1 of 1External links are provided for reference purposes.
