My mother is aging and I would like to get to know who she is, get to know my sisters.Scanlon and her partner of 38 years, 68-year-old Lia de Bruyn, are caught in the DOMA trap.Even if Maines same-sex marriage bill had been voted into law in November 2011 instead of last month, the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples, would still force the two to spend six months a year out of the country, Scanlon said.The two were legally married in Holland in 1999, but in our situation, nothing will change, Scanlon said. We can register our marriage in Maine, but our problem is basically the federal law and immigration and the DOMA law, which says a marriage is between a man and a woman.Still, the two are heartened by the recent efforts of U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to effectively repeal DOMA. Collins is the sole Republican co-sponsor of a bill to give binational same-sex couples equal rights to petition for immigrant visas.Jewelry as exquisite as peek-show @ city drawersImpress your TSA agentWorcesters Wild BlueberriesSpiced Blueberry JellySalvage your low pitch roofBVD gift-givingVera Bradley Sale!Pyramid Studios Midnight Madness Mens Night Sale.
