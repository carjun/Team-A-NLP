It is just a shame that it did sound like that. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

There are still so many good people out there. We can create the change in society we claim to want if we decide today to do more than just getting sad. We need to come together as a planet. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

They are in a tough spot. I am just reacting emotionally but it is such a senseless thing to say. I just am sad that I get the sense that some members of the media are licking their chops on what would otherwise be a slow news day :Spermalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

He was a monster. What could we do to prevent this from happening as often as it does? Gun control. Helping people learn to deal with their psychological and emotional problems is the long term project. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I just heard reporters say that this killing just "set the standard for school killings. It used to be Columbine but that was just 12 kids" Just 12 kids? The standard for school shootingS? How are they allowed to fucking say these things? Even if it was just one death today it would be too much. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]strokesy 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]strokesy 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoHearing news that the shooter's mother was a teacher or the principle in the school. WTF has to be wrong that you would go on a shooting spree like that not only hitting little kids who are innocent but your own mother too?

If you pay attention to the plot and the side quests, by the end of the game he has embraced everything the assassins stand for. He doesn't start out as a true assassin at the beginning of the game but once he's killed Lee and gotten his personal vengeance, he realizes that the Assassins are the best thing he has. permalinksavecontextfull comments[Possible Spoiler] An idea about E.  by  PPohlusin  assassinscreed[+]strokesy 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]strokesy 11 points12 points13 points 1 day agoGiovanni + John + Juan1+1+1 = 3Half life 3 confirmed. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey Reddit, have you ever hit on a celebrity?  by  strokesyin  AskReddit[+]strokesy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]strokesy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThat's where it ended?
