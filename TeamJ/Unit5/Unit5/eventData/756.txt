Gun control is perhaps important to talk about, mental health is perhaps important to talk about ... but when you plaster the name of who did it EVERYWHERE, and their picture, and videos of them as a kid, and them playing spots, and etc. etc. and play audio of sirens, and talk about nothing but the person who did it ... then what you do is you create INFAMY for the criminal.  Talk about the issue, but do so in a way that does not bring notariety to the person committing the act. You want people to discuss how to prevent tragedy. You don't want people saying "hey, look how much ATTENTION that guy got!"permalinksavecontextfull commentsEnd of 2012 Discussions - Fez  by  GamingBotin  Games[+]Barcode_Account 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Barcode_Account 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoTHE best!

They seem like they have a lot of fun.  Phil seems like a guy you'd get along with in small amounts or social settings, but wouldn't be friends with. He seemed like a passionate guy who was mixed up in some drama that was a bit out of his control by the point the movie was made. He was at a tipping point of great success or total life failure, and it wasn't even his decision which way he would fall.  Jonathan Blow. Definitely neurotic. Possibly slightly autistic. He's smart, but he knows it. Can't accept success. Behaves like a typical famous successful artist (seriously, compare his actions to some of Mark Rothko's, a famous modern artist who was at times very angry with his success because people didn't "get" his work), and I just can't see him as a joy to be around.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan slashes 22 children near China school  by  rolmosin  worldnews[+]Barcode_Account -3 points-2 points-1 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Barcode_Account -3 points-2 points-1 points 21 hours agoBout the same I'd wager, just faster.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

What burden do civilians have to seek out and attack people? If it WERE him, he'll be dealt with by the law and posting things to his social networks won't bring anyone back (he's actually dead, but if he wasn't). If it ISN'T him, but he gets the societal attacks for it, an innocent life could change in a very real way for a while.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

There's a message in that video everyone is missing. He's not saying DON'T TALK ABOUT THE BAD THING!  He's saying talk about THE THING THAT HAPPENED and not THE GUY THAT DID IT. Don't turn that jerk into someone infamous. Don't give him that attention. Don't make him a poster child.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

The way you put it made it sound like Siri is listening in when you don't have it activated. Siri sends whatever you SPECIFICALLY TELL SIRI to Apple's servers. If you don't explicitly tell Siri about all your sketchy behavior, Siri won't hear about what you do in your free time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsVerizon files patent for a DVR that can watch and listen to what is going on in your living room so it can give targeted advertisements.  by  philhouse64in  technology[+]Barcode_Account 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Barcode_Account 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoI just got an iPhone, what info would this be?
