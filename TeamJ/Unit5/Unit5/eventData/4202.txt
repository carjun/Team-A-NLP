I don't know what to think of this.  by  jesuslover1in  mormon[+]3lilmonsters -1 points0 points1 point 5 hours ago (0 children)[]3lilmonsters -1 points0 points1 point 5 hours agoBeing LDS and not living in Utah this is my stance... If pants is your nicest attire, wear it! Wear whatever is nicest. Church if where you want to look your best, if pants are that, so be it. That being said, these women that are doing it are doing it because they don't think that women are looked as equal in the Church. They are feminist (nothing wrong with that) But they are doing this for the wrong reasons that I don't agree with. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo ladies, do you shave your ass hair?  by  cactusbutt69in  AskWomen[+]3lilmonsters 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]3lilmonsters 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI had the same problem.

It will be better for your credit score to leave them open. When you get out of debt it looks good on your credit seeing you have open accounts but no balance on it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWealthy, successful, and financially independent Redditors, if you were $15,000 in debt, worked a low paying job, and had no degrees or familial support, what would you do to improve your situation?  by  [deleted]in  AskReddit[+]3lilmonsters 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago*(0 children)[]3lilmonsters 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago*We were in that same situation but it was $60,000 of debt. We consolidated our loans into one payment. It lowered our interest rates from the highest 19% to now 3%. We worked our tails off and now only (3 years later) have $17,000 worth of debt and will have it paid off in a year. Talk to the companies you have the debt with they will work with you.EDIT: We also, go rid of TV, internet, and had basic phone needs. Never went out. Lived a very basic life style. Now we are in a better financial position where we don't have to live that extreme. We still don't have TV and we have the slowest internet and hardly go out. permalinksavecontextfull commentsLPT: Get free sexy times for your winter facial hair.  by  Syrelein  LifeProTips[+]3lilmonsters 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]3lilmonsters 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoUmm..

He has had it for 8 years and shaved maybe 3 times, and  the last time was over 3 years ago. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDreaming of a White Christmas?

I was engaged before my now husband. I loved him very much, things were great when they weren't. We were young and it just didn't work out. I haven't seen or talked to him in over 8 years, but still love him. But I am in love and adore my now husband. I think if two people want to make it work and work on your relationship it will be amazing as anyone elses. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlbum of my dog's puppies!  by  Beginning_With_Min  aww[+]3lilmonsters 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]3lilmonsters 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoAww!!

What crucial advice do you think you should've ignored?  by  TROPiCALRUBiin  AskReddit[+]3lilmonsters 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]3lilmonsters 2 points3 points4 points 4 days agoMy Dad always put it in our heads that people judge you on what you wear. And although I can see that to a point, but don't agree with it. I can't get it out of my head and I find my self doing it without realizing it ALL the time. I wish I was smarter when I was younger and didn't judge people by their looks, but now as I am older it is hard to stop. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the most ridiculous thing someone has ever tried to convince you is true? (Keeping religion and politics out of it)  by  Washain  AskReddit[+]3lilmonsters 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]3lilmonsters 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoI grew up in Utah and there were a lot of signs that said Watch For Falling Rock. My brothers told me a story about a native princess named Falling Rock that had gone missing and those signs were there to remind you to watch for her to help bring her home. They said they put them up when ever there was a sighting for her. I was totally 100% convinced. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWomen of reddit, guys always describe a woman as "wife material" when they do laundry or cook well.
