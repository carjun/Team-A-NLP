It hurts me so much because I do love where I live and where I've come from, but it's all so fucked up. I can't think of another peacetime country that has so many random mass murder cases in one year. Hell, in one WEEK. We can't keep it together for ONE STUPID WEEK.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]behn12 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]behn12 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoIn both Seattle (where I live) and Hartford, they're reporting 27 dead including 18 kids. ...un-fucking-believable. I can stomach a lot, but this is just the most detestable act.

We have a huge sliding wood door between the drive way in our backyard and the alley. To prevent the dogs getting out, we have a bungee cord to make it harder for them to open. Well, our dog managed to unlatch the bungee cord, get out of the backyard and walk to my dad's workplace several miles away. It scared the shit out of me, but I was impressed. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
