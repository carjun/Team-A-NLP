Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI will grant you that a bat isn't a good mass murder tool. I of course agree that this scene is a tragic one no matter if it is an elementary school or a crowded theatre. No one deserves to be shot up while just trying to live life.Your mind and emotions are being manipulated by powerful imagery. This stuff isn't supposed to happen in the good ol' USA! It makes us confront a part of humanity we wish to ignore: we are still just fancy animals. No matter the tool, there are those among us that will kill. They ignore the very basic law that says, "Thou shalt not kill." They ignore the inner voice that tells them it's wrong to take a life. What makes us think they will obey a law that says they cannot own/possess a firearm? I understand the sentiment, but it's not the answer. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

You have trained haven't you? If you are in contact with the shooter, move laterally toward cover while drawing your weapon. Once your weapon is drawn, square your shoulders toward the assailant, continue to side-step, assess your target and what's behind it. If there is a daycare behind your target, hold your fire and continue toward cover. If you can take a shot, take it. This will put the shooter on the defensive instead of just walking through a mall killing innocents. Aiming for center mass is the traditional method and has its merits, but in light of today's maniac, aiming for the head may be the better choice. Many of these kooks don body armor so hits scored to the torso can be ineffective. In reality,  any hit in a shootout scenario is a good hit. A headshot is more likely to disable potentially armored assailants, however. Or, if you prefer the gun-grabber method, let the guy that believes in God and guns handle it.permalinksavecontextfull comments11000Why you no charge you laptop?!

Couple that with possibly a heavy hand on the right lever and...well you know the rest. Street compounds are designed to be sticky-ish at the onset. They tend to become loose when they are very hot (track in hot conditions on a liter bike). If you have your heart set on the Q2(great street tire), I would bump my pressure up to at least 31 cold. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy latest track day crash. Would appreciate views as to how exactly this happened.  by  Ashifyerin  motorcycles[+]RogerShakenbak -1 points0 points1 point 6 days ago (0 children)[]RogerShakenbak -1 points0 points1 point 6 days agoBeing that the tires were Q2s and half way through the session and also that they were at what I would consider a low pressure for that tire on that bike on a track, it is entirely possible the tire had over heated and become greasy. Street tires have been known to do that on track.What was the air temp? Was it sunny out? It would be my guess that you stabbed the brake on an over heated street compound. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI never understood this.  by  fatdinosaurin  funny[+]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoAnd not one fuck is given.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOh, how times change.  by  beacon_in  apple[+]RogerShakenbak 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]RogerShakenbak 1 point2 points3 points 13 days agoVHS and Beta were both still being used into the late 80s/early 90s.

With the advent of cameras everywhere, it may just have been that up until now, incidents were successfully covered up. The business of policing attracts some really great people, but it also attracts some seriously deranged sociopaths that can do a lot to destroy the image of the thin blue line in short order. permalinksavecontextfull commentsStripped a hex screw on carbs.

They are JIS phillips screws and are very easy to strip with a standard phillips screwdriver. If any of them give you trouble, it is best to use a manual impact driver (if you don't have a JIS driver) to get them out.
