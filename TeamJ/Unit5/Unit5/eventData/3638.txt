While a still-stunned community tried to cope with the horror of Friday's school shooting which killed more than two dozen people, federal agents planned to fan out to dozens of gun stores and shooting ranges across Connecticut, chasing leads they hoped would cast light on the life of school shooter Adam Lanza.  Among the questions: Why did his mother, a well-to-do suburban divorcee, keep a cache of high-power weapons in the house? What experience did Lanza have with those guns?  Play VideoGrief at every corner in NewtownPlay Video48 Hours: Newtown And, above all, what set him on a path to shoot and kill 20 children, along with the adults who tried to stop him?  WCBS Station CBS reports that police say evidence found at the bloody scene points to a motive, but they will not discuss it yet. According to correspondent Lou Young, the police have no note from the killer. Lanza shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, to death at the home they shared Friday, then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School in her car with four of her guns, forced his way in by breaking a window and opened fire, authorities said.   Within minutes, he killed 20 children, six adults and himself.  All the victims at the school were shot with a rifle, at least some of them up close, and all were apparently shot more than once, Chief Medical Examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver said. There were as many as 11 shots on the bodies he examined.  All six adults killed at the school were women. Of the 20 children, eight were boys and 12 were girls.  Asked whether the children suffered, Carver said, "If so, not for very long." Asked how many bullets were fired, Carver said, "I'm lucky if I can tell you how many I found."  Parents identified the children through photos to spare them some shock, Carver said.  The terrible details about the last moments of young innocents emerged as authorities released their names and ages  the youngest 6 and 7, the oldest 56. They included Ana Marquez-Greene, a little girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada; Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils; and principal Dawn Hochsprung, who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him.  The tragedy has plunged Newtown into mourning and added the picturesque New England community of 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change.  Residents and faith leaders were sure to reflect Sunday on the mass shooting and what meaning, if any, to find in it. President Barack Obama planned to attend an interfaith vigil  the fourth time he will have traveled to a city after a mass shooting.

The Rev. Richard Scinto, a deacon, gave a homily. "In the past 48 hours I've said the phrase 'I don't know' about 1,000 times," he said. "That not knowing has got to be the worst part of this whole thing."19 PhotosVictims of Conn. school shooting At St. John's Episcopal Church, 54-year-old Donna Denner, an art teacher at an elementary school in nearby Danbury whose classroom was locked down after the shooting, said she feels the same way she did after 9/11 but isn't sure the rest of the country does."I don't know if the rest of the country is struggling to understand it the same way we are here," she said. "Life goes on, but you're not the same. Is the rest of the country  are they going about their regular activities? Is it just another news story to them?" The gunman's father, Peter Lanza, issued a statement Saturday relating his own family's anguish in the aftermath."Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express how heartbroken we are," he said. "We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can. We too are asking why. ... Like so many of you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has transpired."  Conn. gunman broke in, shot kids multiple times"Always smiling": Portraits of Conn. victimsCT. shooter's relatives express "heartfelt sorrow"Teachers risked, lost their lives to protect Sandy Hook children The rifle used was a Bushmaster .223-caliber, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to speak about it and talked on condition of anonymity. The gun is commonly seen at competitions and was the type used in the 2002 sniper killings in the Washington, D.C., area. Also found in the school were two handguns, a Glock 10 mm and a Sig Sauer 9 mm.  A law enforcement official said Saturday that authorities were investigating fresh leads that could reveal more about the lead-up to the shooting. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  Ginger Colbrun, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said earlier there was no evidence Lanza was involved in gun clubs or had trained for the shooting. When reached later in the day and asked whether that was still true, she said, "We're following any and all leads related to this individual and firearms."  Dean Price, director of the Wooster Mountain State Range  a shooting range in Danbury  said two ATF agents visited the range Friday night and stayed into the early morning looking through thousands of names on sign-in logs.  He said that he had never seen Adam or Nancy Lanza there and that agents told him they did not find their names on the sign-in sheets.       no previous page     next    1/2    2012 CBS Interactive Inc.

Machine guns should not be sold to the public. The GOP are fanatic about the "right to bear arms" and will not want to go along with curbing gun rights, despite the fact that there have been many shootings within the past years. The second amendment is quickly becoming obsolete in civilized society, because it was written at a time when the only way of getting meat to eat was by hunting and there were very little laws that offered protection to people, especially if they lived in desolated areas of the country. Many people that insist on the right to own guns are either hunters or people who fear some sort of invasion to the motherland and think theyll need to be armed. Leave the machine guns to the military and the police, but don't sell them to the public.     reply        Ratified_1791 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  The purpose of guns in the 2nd Amendment is to PROTECT YOURSELF from tyranny of government first, harm from others second, hunting for food for your family third.

While all the new media and government figures harp on gun control and what the government has/has not done to prevent the horrific events, NO ONE talks about the true underlying cause. The Governor of CT stated clearly this morning , " IT IS MENTAL ILLNESS DRESSED UP AS EVIL'. Why is addressing mental illness as the root cause of the majority of these mass killings not openly discussed on the weekend news shows????? Why is it so TABOO???? The new media has NO GUTS when dealing with the obvious and are so quick to take the easy out, GUNS. So lets think for a moment..if one wants to kill ( whether sane or not), they WILL find the MEANS ( guns, cars, trucks full of diesel fuel and fertilizer) to carry out their plan. So, why isn't the government/news media focusing on stricter fuel access, stricter fertilizer access and stricter car access???.

See all 4 Replies         linkicon reporticon emailicon  LarryMoniz says: Authorities said all of the guns were legally purchased by Mrs. Lanza. Why then are the feds visiting all the guns shops in the state? Apparently federal authorities needed an excuse to practice the time-honored police tradition of "rousting" and hassling everyone just to remind them who's boss. Gun stores frequented by the mother are highly unlikely to produce and "motive" for such a heinous crime. Oh yes, the other reason is so the feds can look like they're actually doing something when all they're accomplishing is misdirection and wasting taxpayer monies. Just another knee-jerk reaction to an unpreventable incident.     reply     See all 108 Comments     Add a Comment      Submit Comment          Click here to add another comment.
