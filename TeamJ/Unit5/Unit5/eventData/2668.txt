It quickly devolves as I realize how different our worlds are and how much there is to cover, and I just end up musing on all the crazy awesome things we have and try to guess what's coming in the future. Then I realize I've been washing a cup for ten minutes. permalinksavecontextfull commentsA fireplace on Netfixs, for the holidays with and with out generic holiday music.  by  iamnotafurryin  NetflixBestOf[+]Oatybar 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Oatybar 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoAs someone with bandwidth caps, meh. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter 5 years of successfully hiding, my students found me on Facebook  by  metropolis_noirin  funny[+]Oatybar 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Oatybar 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agobut he couldn't tell if I actually knew or not.Yeah, he knew. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood evening Detroit...view from my 15th floor apartment [3264  2448]  by  neznarfin  CityPorn[+]Oatybar 27 points28 points29 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Oatybar 27 points28 points29 points 2 days agoThat describes quite a lot of American cities.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter 5 years of successfully hiding, my students found me on Facebook  by  metropolis_noirin  funny[+]Oatybar 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Oatybar 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoAs someone who finished school before the arrival of the Internet, the thing that baffles me is why. Why in the hell do you want to know anything about your teachers' personal lives? Thinking back to the kid I was, I can't imagine something that would have concerned me less. Now, the girl two rows in front of me who smiled at me once, that's another matter. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt's a Kia Party.

The right's irrational hatred of Hilary could surpass that of Obama, with all the history there. If she does win in 2016, it would be hard fought against the loudest, craziest vitriol they can throw at her. Which, come to think of it, might help her with swing voters. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBridge explosion  by  PhoneDojoin  gifs[+]Oatybar 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]Oatybar 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoNo, quite simple. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHDR Shot of the USS COD  by  ThaddeusJPin  Cleveland[+]Oatybar 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Oatybar 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoAt first glance it looks like we've just been hit by a pair of nukes. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNext Time Someone Asks You For A Memory Verse  by  Im_just_sayingin  Christianity[+]Oatybar 9 points10 points11 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Oatybar 9 points10 points11 points 9 days agoBack in college, an apartment full of christian girls wrote their names on their mailbox, followed by John 3:16 in flowery lettering.
