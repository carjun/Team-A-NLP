Washington : DC : USA                    | Dec 15, 2012 at 12:03 PM PST                        By Stephanie Ealy40                        Views: 2,048 A knife, rope, rock and broken glass are all things that can kill people. Will it be possible to ban them, get rid of them? Of course not! In the wake of the horrific Connecticut school shooting tragedy comes the hotly debated topicgun control.   Will creating more laws against guns help our country if someone loses it and contemplates a rampage? Personally, I am not fond of guns because of a bad experience as a child, but I know how to use one and would not hesitate to follow through if put in a situation where it was needed for protection, or if I was hunting for food.  Also, I am not at all against people owning firearms with plenty of ammunition, and do not believe any new laws banning them will help someone who has made a decision to use them for terroristic purposes. But surely we can all hear the buzz and negative commenters yelling, BAN GUNS! CREATE MORE LAWS AGAINST THEM! TAKE EVERYONES GUNS AWAY!  In David Kopel and Jarret B. Wollsteins article Will You Be Safer If Guns Are Banned? they point out that the US has areas that have already attempted this strategy: If banning guns worked, Washington, DC and New York City would be the safest cities in the country. Since 1976, it's been illegal in Washington, DC to own any handguns or to keep any type of gun in your home unlocked and fully assembled. However, Washington, DC is the murder capital of the United States.  Lets just break it down a bit. Going back to the rock, rope and knife, we all know you cant do as much damage as quickly with any of those items, but you get my point. The same is true for gunshow can they be banned? Big Brother would have to do a thorough sweep of every citizens household, and then what? Put everyone in an orange suit who owns them or doesnt hand them over to the feds? American laws have already proven the war on drugs and the war in Afghanistan are unwinnable. What next, the war on guns?  Cant you hear the inmates amongst each other?  What are you in for?   I owned a gun, and you?   Same.  Hmmmm, sounds similar to conversations in jail about marijuana possession, huh?   There are so many guns out there, could anyone come up with an accurate count? Sure, we can find out how many people own them legally, but what about all those weapons out there that are unlawfully owned? Too many to count, Im sure!   Not to mention sales of guns have shot off the charts since President Obama was re-elected in November. This may be related to who won the election, or it may not  how do we know the same wouldnt have happened if Mitt Romney was crowned? We dont! It was such a tight race; we could have the same gun-sales stats if it would have gone in the Republicans favor. Of course, unless you believe only red-necked Republicans carry guns  that was a good one!  So now what, America? As we grieve over the lives lost this week, perhaps we can contemplate a solution together. Could video games be a simulation tool teaching kids and adults how to use them? After all, the Barefoot Bandit said he learned how to fly planes playing them, as pointed out in, Barefoot Bandit has travel cred. We could use the same argument: games, guns and knives dont cause stable people to commit crimes, or do they?

The first question, before getting into guns, is whether we should not have laws, or more laws, because they are not perfect. They won't catch everyone. I don't think you believe that for a moment.2. Why does anyone need a semi-automatic weapon or automatic weapon?3. Why does anyone need a magazine that can hold up to 100 bullets? That eliminates the need to reload. Of course during the reload process nearby citizens could jump the killer.4. Why with hundreds of thousands of people having carry conceal permits has not one, not one, massacre been stopped by a good citizen who had a gun available to kill the murderer?5. No one can seriously think that someone could kill 27 people in a public place with a knife, baseball bat, whatever.6. And even if they could that would not mean we shouldn't do what we can now to reduce the number of the deaths that will occur.

ReplyPosted ByJamesStotter        |        about 5 hours        ago        Good article, Steph! The deterrent power of laws is highly questionable. The main power of laws is in punishing the ones made criminals by the laws--not in keeping them from becoming criminals. Those who think gun control laws will prevent another Connecticut should remember Oklahoma City. As the adage goes, "Where there's a will there is a way." And that's true whether the the will is for "good" or for "bad."Rated up!
