We most certainly had the conversation after every one of those shootings. Perhaps Congress didn't (there were bills debated after VT, at least), if that's what you mean, but the news certainly did.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Not every factor in preventing a shooting is related to gun control. Regardless, it's just too soon to get into politics. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]OHhokie1 -3 points-2 points-1 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 -3 points-2 points-1 points 13 minutes agoI think we can all agree that the trauma endured by the literally thousands of people immediately connected to this tragedy is a little different than a ganbanger in east LA getting shot. Tragedies of this scale happen very rarely, though still too much, and these tragedies are the ones I'm referring to, not every single shooting.Of course, don't take this to mean that every shooting is not tragic, but frankly, some tragic things are more tragic than others, and this is up there with Virginia Tech, Columbine, and the Aurora shootings as a tragic event that will literally traumatize an entire community. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]OHhokie1 6 points7 points8 points 26 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 6 points7 points8 points 26 minutes agoI have no idea but I just find it sickening when people use a tragedy to push political goals while the bodies are still warm. To me it just says, "I don't give a damn that these people are dead, I want to talk about how my politics were right and your's were wrong."The 3 days were arbitrary, and perhaps too long, but I'm just saying to the people in this thread now that are already bickering over this: just chill the fuck out for a bit.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]OHhokie1 185 points186 points187 points 40 minutes ago*(0 children)[]OHhokie1 185 points186 points187 points 40 minutes ago*I'm just gonna say this right now, as a Virginia Tech student who has dealt with this bullshit before (wasn't there for 2007, but was for the shooting of a police officer last year).Please, both sides of the gun-control debate: there are 27 people dead. No one gives a shit right now about your politics. I'm very, very political (if you must know what side, my comment history in the subs I frequent will tell you) on this issue and I'm not going to say a word about it. Why? Because I've seen people after such incidents crying, in real pain, and I know that they don't want to talk about politics right now. Give it 3 fucking days before you start saying what would have prevented this tragedy. 3 days, that's it, then we can duke out politics. For now, let people grieve, and shut the fuck up.I just wish I could tell this to the news media as well, but oh well.edit: yes, I realize 3 days is a completely arbitrary number and may be excessive to some. I was just throwing out a number. My only point was that you should give the families and the town to grieve, and your first thought when something tragic happens shouldn't be political, but rather it should be respect and empathy. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPenn and Teller expose people who talk to the dead - full episode.  by  SutekhRisingin  skeptic[+]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 49 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 49 minutes agoI'm not going to argue with you on this anymore. It was clearly an opinion, despite however I worded it, since politics of that nature is always an opinion.And yet corrupt businesses abound, which are killing people, stealing from people, destroying the environment, and generally behaving reprehensibly all in the name of profit, and you think giving them more freedom from regulation will magically improve this?I wasn't aware that corporations in the U.S. were murdering people in the streets and robbing them at home, but thanks for your input. For one, nearly every massive, mega-corporation in America which you likely deem as evil has gotten where they are through government collusion and using the government to stifle competition (everything from the tax code to intellectual property laws). For two, most of the crime committed by corporations, and white-collar crime in general, would be perfectly dealt with through the court system without excessive legislative regulation... through private property rights and punishment for fraud. I'm really done with this conversation though, as it has nothing to do with this thread/sub, so goodbye. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAirguns to be Licenced in Scotland and "plinking" Banned.  by  sbwebqerbin  guns[+]OHhokie1 3 points4 points5 points 55 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 3 points4 points5 points 55 minutes agothe best is the butthurt in that sub when someone posts a gun and all the brits/europeans flip shit. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAirguns to be Licenced in Scotland and "plinking" Banned.  by  sbwebqerbin  guns[+]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 57 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 57 minutes agoI had a guy in /r/worldnews last night tell me that he was in favor of Britain's proposal for knife points to be banned. Yes, that's right, it was actually proposed that all kitchen blades be blunt at the tip. He said he couldn't figure out why anyone would need a tip on their blade other than to stab someone.I mean, for one, that's some scary nanny-state shit right there, for two, how in the fuck does he think points on knives are useless? Clearly the guy has never butchered meat, or even cleaned fish/poultry at home. permalinksavecontextfull commentsLovely looking clouds...  by  wskerrin  conspiracy[+]OHhokie1 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour agoSorry, I refuse to read anything from site called "chemtrailsplanet", for reasons that should be obvious when trying to focus on objective, non-biased, and factual information.Do you have any data from anywhere else, preferably more reputable, supporting this claim? I do not for a second dismiss the idea that chemtrails could be a reality, I do only dismiss (as do you, per your comment) that all contrails that linger are chemtrails. That said, I'm still gonna need a better source. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWow, I lost patience just watching this video of the UTS-15.  by  HighSpeed556in  guns[+]OHhokie1 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoyeah, probably a dud.

I just think that if that's the case, then make that argument, don't make the argument that the world's going to end tomorrow... because when it doesn't, then people are going to think the whole thing is complete bullshit and the subject won't get the attention it deserves. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPenn and Teller expose people who talk to the dead - full episode.  by  SutekhRisingin  skeptic[+]OHhokie1 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoUm, fuck off?

I just actually got done taking a geology course where we covered the topic in some detail... to be honest though it's not related to my major (engineering, I was just filling a requirement) so I didn't pay attention all that much.What I gathered from my limited studies of the subject is this: there is global warming and it's likely that humans are contributing significantly to it, if not completely. However, most of the "doomsday" scenarios, like Al Gore and the creators of The Day after Tomorrow would have us believe, are complete bullshit as well. In other words, it's a serious concern, but we're far from shit hitting the fan. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPenn and Teller expose people who talk to the dead - full episode.  by  SutekhRisingin  skeptic[+]OHhokie1 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoProve what? Capitalism in America, while certainly not anything close to true free-market, pure capitalism, has still created the wealthiest nation on earth. I simply think if we had more capitalism and less statism/corporatism (state/corporate collusion) that the market would be able to provide consumers and producers with the best possible outcome, considering the alternatives. There are no real world examples of true free-market capitalism in today's society. Besides, it's an opinion, just as communists think that pure communism would be the most successful model for society... neither are factual since neither can be conclusively proven with current real world data. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWow, I lost patience just watching this video of the UTS-15.  by  HighSpeed556in  guns[+]OHhokie1 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agooh okay, then it's just genuinely a piece of shit then... at least this one, who knows if it was just a dud though. permalinksavecontextfull commentsLovely looking clouds...  by  wskerrin  conspiracy[+]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoRather than approaching the subject with an open and unprejudiced mind, it's apparently more acceptable to label the person a loony or conspiracy theorist.Because you are the one making an outlandish claim, with no evidence other than "look here's something I don't understand, so the government has to be spraying shit in the air". Then someone like me, an engineering student, debunks this in this sub 10,000 times and gets aggravated when it still shows up daily.

Contrails can form from plane wing-tips and such in the right atmospheric conditions. But yes, you are right about contrails, and the chemtrail conspiracy stuff is bogus. I mean, perhaps the government is spraying us with stuff or involved in geo-engineering... I don't know. I do know that contrails are a natural phenomenon and that their "lingering" has nothing to do with whether or not they are "chemtrails" but rather the conditions present in the air.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsPenn and Teller expose people who talk to the dead - full episode.  by  SutekhRisingin  skeptic[+]OHhokie1 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour agoI used to be pretty much an-cap, and I would have agreed with you, but now I'm much more just a very strong libertarian and I'd have to disagree. The free market can correct almost anything and is the most fair and beneficial system to everyone involved in the long-run. However, with things such as the environment, there is no "correction" down the line if it is destroyed. I agree with you that most regulations we currently have are created by lobbyists and are centered in corruption rather than science, but ideally we could have limited regulations that would focus on the science instead. We'd likely both agree that strong private property laws and allowing more environmental lawsuits based upon property rights would also be a step in the right direction. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWow, I lost patience just watching this video of the UTS-15.  by  HighSpeed556in  guns[+]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agothose look like 3" shells...

Self-videoed Whitetail Deer Hunt 12 Ga Pump  by  jaggazzin  Hunting[+]OHhokie1 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours agoNot gonna argue with you about the sloppy part, because I agree. I'm not gonna lie, I took 3 does in roughly 10 seconds one year from my cousins farm. Last day of the season and I had no venison to show for it, and there were more than enough deer on the property to do it. That was with my .270 though... they were out in a field out about 100 yards. Took the first one, the other two ran. Then they stopped once to look around, took a second one, then the last one stopped right before going into the woods at about 200 yards, took her too. Dropped all of them on the spot with shoulder shots.I took one deer, gave one to my cousin, and gave one to my dad. All the meat was eaten. And yes, from my previous comment, it may have been technically illegal since I didn't wait until after calling each one in, but I did have tags for all of them.permalinksavecontextfull comments4 DEER in 9 SECONDS. Self-videoed Whitetail Deer Hunt 12 Ga Pump  by  jaggazzin  Hunting[+]OHhokie1 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoIn my state you can have multiple doe tags, I think up to 5, but after shooting a deer you must check it in (can be done over the phone, but still must be done) before shooting another one. Either way, not the biggest deal in the world I suppose. As long as this guy is planning on eating all that meat (or sharing with family) I don't care. permalinksavecontextfull comments4 DEER in 9 SECONDS. Self-videoed Whitetail Deer Hunt 12 Ga Pump  by  jaggazzin  Hunting[+]OHhokie1 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours agoI know a lot of people who kill 4-5 deer a year and eat literally every ounce it. Country folk like their venison.I don't care as long as the animal is utilized and they are not taking more than the local population can handle, which, usually corresponds to keeping within state/local season dates and bag limits. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPenn and Teller expose people who talk to the dead - full episode.  by  SutekhRisingin  skeptic[+]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoI agree with the market-based approach either way (with a few exceptions and reasonable regulations), personally.
