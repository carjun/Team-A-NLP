That's the issue here. You went straight on the defensive about me trying to take away your rights. Well, I'm not trying to.You said "That doesn't mean it's not a problem" about the 2nd amendment. Clarify your statements instead of doing this pussy footing, fake moderate double speak. Gun safety training I'm fairly certain the guys doing the shooting know what a gun does and how it works and how to safely use it. They choose not to. and mental evaluations Will these catch everyone? permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

It is not as if we are calling up the families to get their statements. Of course our hearts go out to them. I disagree that we should let idiots in the ghetto determine what law abiding citizens do. I also feel sickos will find a way to harm others if they really wanted to. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

A gun is protection, that is why it is enshrined in the 2nd amendment. There are horrible horrible shootings like this every 6 months to a year, and tons of ghetto gun violence, but I don't feel either justify removing all guns from the table. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
