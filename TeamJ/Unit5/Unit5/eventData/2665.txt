I have a two yr old son and this shit is incomprehensible.  Yes knives are deadly but to insinuate that they are as deadly as guns in terms of the number of people you can kill quickly and indiscriminately is ludicrous.  btw the kid and adults who died as a result of this shooters random firing don't give a damn about the fact that 70% of shooting victims survive   permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]beatyatoit 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago*(0 children)[]beatyatoit 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago*I'd much rather go up against someone with a knife or fists over someone with a fucking gun who could kill me before I even know he's there.  this is a really stupid argument, and one that I'm tired of seeing every time there's some asswipe with a gun taking out unarmed people with no defense against a bullet.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSoledad Blasts Sen. Sessions On Air for Balancing The Budget On The Empty Stomachs Of Poor Children  by  ampratherin  politics[+]beatyatoit 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]beatyatoit 5 points6 points7 points 2 days agoSomething about Sessions...not sure what it is; his smirk, the drawl, the beady eyes. but he just looks and sounds like one of those old-school racists.  I don't think I would be one bit surprised if one day we found out that he was a hood-wearing klansmen.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsMassachusetts man raped, abused 13 infants, children and videotaped attacks - victims ranged in age from 8 days to 3 years old  by  videogameboy76in  news[+]beatyatoit 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]beatyatoit 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agowhat in thee fucking fuck...this is probably the most disturbing thing I have read in a long time.  I hope he goes to jail and gets to experience what he did to these children. Damn I just read this story again; if I had a kid in that daycare, I would have been in court with the sole, premeditated intent of doing major harm to this POS. permalinksavecontextfull commentsUltra biceps  by  DextroTripin  WTF[+]beatyatoit 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]beatyatoit 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agothis guy's arms have been posted on Reddit a number of times recently, but I have to say that every time I see them, I can't help but laugh at how utterly ridiculous those arms look.  The asymmetry between the forearms and bi's/tri's.  The fact that they look like they're inflated with air.  The lack of any discernible muscle tone.

Do you spank or plan to spank your kids when you have them?  by  por_que_noin  AskReddit[+]beatyatoit 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]beatyatoit 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoI was spanked as a child as well, and I too and grateful that I got then consistently when I was out of bounds.  The only proof I need of this is the fact that very few of my friends from childhood received them, and most of them are in dire straits or not barely doing anything now.  Every time I go home and see my friends and what they have become, I thank my parents.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsCounter-protesters disrupt Nazi rally with clown costumes, squeaky toys and white flour  by  homewestin  politics[+]beatyatoit 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]beatyatoit 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoDamn, that was great!

I really try to give then the benefit of the doubt, but they are never funny.  Never.  It's like they are always simply trying to cover up their true feelings or beliefs with what they see as jokes, but it's always very obvious.  Gutfeld is on another level.  The way he raises his eyebrow and smirks when he things he says something funny is just....irritating.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsRepublican Desperation Grows as Benghazi Backfires and Scandal Talk Fizzles  by  mr_majorlyin  politics[+]beatyatoit 6 points7 points8 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]beatyatoit 6 points7 points8 points 28 days agoas a former member of the military who had friends fighting in both Afghanistan and Iraq, I am fucking disgusted that they are knowingly  and willingly going down this road, fully aware that they are lying through their teeth, just to take a stab at Obama.  This tells me that they never gave a fuck about the nem and women losing their lives over what amounted to a lie.  That they are using this as a way to create controversy, while ignoring the lies that got is into two wars, is appalling. Graham and McCain are now, in my eyes, two of the lowest forms of life on this planet.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Mind-blowing Hypocrisy of John McCain: WMD Lie is Good, Repeating Intelligence is Bad  by  maxwellhillin  politics[+]beatyatoit 10 points11 points12 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]beatyatoit 10 points11 points12 points 29 days agoI used to think this too, but I think the "honor" and "maverick" thing he used to channel were just, well, political.

This is the type of person that will be seen in 20 yrs or so as the same type of person that did/does rail against interracial marriage as a sin against God.  Someone that's it's better to simply ignore and wait out their ignorance.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsgirl gets acid on face for looking at a boy  by  WhoPostsThisStuffin  WTF[+]beatyatoit 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]beatyatoit 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoold news, yes, but doesn't diminish the horrible nature of the act.  When I first read it, how they let her anguish before even taking her to a hospital, I couldn't even wrap my head around it.  First time seeing these pics though, and seeing the father hug his children when he killed another in the way that they did is really mind-numbing.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsArm raised in a Nazi-style salute, the leader of Greece's fastest-rising political party surveyed hundreds of young men in black T-shirts as they exploded into cheers.

I know what you're saying, but being of color kind of makes you look at things a little differently.
