During her time in Newtown, Sherlach kept busy as a member of numerous groups such as the district conflict resolution committee, safe school climate committee, crisis intervention team and student instructional team."I ... am always ready to assist in problem-solving, intervention and prevention," she wrote.In the "About Me" section of her website, Sherlach also spoke extensively about her family."My husband Bill and I have been married 31 years and are the proud parents of two beautiful daughters, ages 25 and 28," she said.Comforting survivors: 'Hug them' and 'cry with them'Sherlach then went into detail about each of her children, one a high school chorus teacher in southern New Jersey and the other a Ph.D. candidate in chemistry at Georgetown University.Sherlach listed her interests as gardening, reading and going to the theater. She and her husband lived in Trumbull, Connecticut, and "enjoy traveling and spending time at our lake home" in upstate New York's Finger Lakes region.Her sudden death prompted Jeanne Stocker to write an emotional tribute on Facebook, saying she was "beyond numb as I lost a good childhood friend.""She gave her life protecting these children," Stocker said.
