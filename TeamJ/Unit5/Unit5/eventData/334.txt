A quiet community in northern Fairfield County about 60 miles from New York, its a place where tragedies like Fridays massacre just dont happen, residents said.I just went to counseling before I came here, said Ray Horvath, who works for a group called Education Connection. Horvath said he knew about 60 of the roughly 680 students at Sandy Hook, and broke down in tears outside the church after speaking with a colleague and learning the identity of a victim.I saw kids I know by name looking horrified. Newtown, the second worst school massacre in U.S. history? Its not possible. I cant wait to ask God when I see him, Horvath said.A media horde descended upon the church Friday, which remained open all night for people to pray privately. As the pews quickly filled up with mourners, people stood by windows to take part, and a large circle formed on the front lawn, where people sang hymns and comforted one another.Several people, like Sheila Maher, of Newtown, and Robert Morehouse, of Southbury, lit candles and wept.Morehouse said he walked five miles to Friday nights service to show his support for the families of those who lost loved ones.Next 1 | 2Copyright 2012 MPNnow.
