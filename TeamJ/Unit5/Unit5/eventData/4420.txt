Texting, Twitter, and Facebook have been the news outlets around school.Trending on Twitter: #prayersfornewtown.Im literally crying right now, Erin Kenning, a Newtown High School senior posted on Facebook. Kenning is a lacrosse friend of at least one Staples student, Deanna Schreiber 13.Nathan Francis 14 said he searched for news on Facebook through his camp friend, Maddie Mae. His friend, he found, had posted, This is horrible. Never in my life would I have thought we would be living through a school shooting.Staples student Jordyn Patterson 14 is still in shock from a forwarded text she received from a Newtown student. According to the text, there were rumors among students that various administrators and faculty were killed, along with a number of elementary school children; however, this has not been verified by news sources or by the Newtown police department.What has been confirmed by Danbury Hospitalwhich is also currently under lockdownis that three patients have been transported to the hospital. Regardless, this is upsetting news to Patterson.Its horrifying, Patterson said. Its so close to home. Youd never think of something like this happening here.Also written in the message was report that the elementary school had to be evacuated, while all other Newtown schools were on lockdown for two hours.However, not all Staples students are as connected. Some, like Mrinal Kumar 14, are concerned of the lack of information.Its surprising and crazy that its so close, Kumar said. Its closer to home than any other shooting in recent memory. I hope everything is OK.Eric Hawes 15 is also worried.Im scared its going to happen to Staples, Hawes said. I dont want to even think about it.While Hawes is worried for the future, Hannah Lewis 14 focuses on looking at the past.Ive always felt detached from school shootings, but this one is all of asudden so real, Lewis said. Its terrifying.CommentsFeel free to leave a comment... and oh, if you want a pic to show with your comment, go get a gravatar!Name (required)Email Address (required)WebsiteSpeak your mindCAPTCHA Code *Click to cancel replyRecent Sports ScoresSunday, December 2FootballStaples High School 28  - Norwich Free Academy 30Tuesday, November 27FootballStaples High School 42  - West Haven 20Thursday, November 22FootballStaples High School 48  - Greenwich 30#Inklings: 140 Characters at a TimeTop 5 Most ReadLocked Down Newtown Student Home Safe (10,723)Administrators Respond to School Shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School (708)Staples Students React to Newtown Elementary School Shooting (563)Deadly School Shooting in Newtown Elementary School (198)Dec. 13, 2012 | Gilespies Little Helpers (164) The Latest IssueOpen publication - Free publishing - More newsEmail UpdatesEnter your email address below to receive our daily email updatesCopyright 2012  Inklings  Responsive SNO FLEX WordPress Platform Created and Hosted by School Newspapers Online  Log in
