Serrano, Los Angeles TimesDecember 15, 2012, 10:32 p.m.NEWTOWN, Conn.  On the outside, Nancy Lanza was the picture of contented motherhood: volunteering at her sons' school, gardening, keeping a picture-perfect home so well-ordered a neighbor described it as pristine.Outside public view, say some who knew her, she had a struggle on her hands, and that was her son Adam: a brilliant but sometimes difficult boy.Lanza battled with the school district over Adam and eventually quit her job, pulled him out of school and educated him at home, said her sister-in-law, Marsha Lanza."I know she had issues with the school.  In what capacity, I'm not 100% certain if it was behavior, if it was learning disabilities, I really don't know," Marsha Lanza told reporters. The investigation widened Saturday into the still-baffling shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., with police releasing the identities of the 26 students and teachers they say Adam Lanza shot before turning the gun on himself.His mother, police said, was shot at the family home before her son set out on his deadly rampage through the school."Adam, he was  definitely the challenge to the family in that house," Marsha Lanza said. "Every family has one. I have one. They have one.  But he was a very bright boy, he was smart."Jim Leff, who knew Nancy Lanza casually through a friend, said he had been put off by an impression that she was high-strung, until he came to understand what she was trying to cope with as Adam's mother."Now that I've been filled in by friends about how difficult her troubled son  was making things for her, I understand that it wasn't that Nancy was overwrought about the trivialities of everyday life, but that she was handling a very difficult situation with uncommon grace," he wrote in a testimonial to her on his blog.Neighbors said the Lanzas moved several years ago into the hilly neighborhood of graceful houses and pastoral views and immediately fit into the social scene, attending the picnic after the annual Labor Day parade and a rotating ladies' night at several homes.By the accounts of some who knew her, Nancy Lanza, who grew up in rural New Hampshire, was comfortable using guns and kept several in the house.Landscaper Dan Holmes said Lanza often talked about her gun collection, and about taking her sons target practicing. "One thing I will note is that she was a big, big gun fan," Leff wrote on his blog.Police have said the three weapons found near Adam Lanza's body inside the school were legally purchased and registered to his mother.Yet it appears that Adam may have tried to buy a weapon of his own before Friday's shootings. Just days before, two federal law enforcement officials say, the 20-year-old attempted to purchase a single "long gun" rifle from a Dick's Sporting Goods store in Canton, Conn., but was turned away because he did not want to wait for a required background check."He didn't want to wait the 14 days," said one source, declining to be identified because the case was still under review. "The sale did not take place."Marsha Lanza, whose husband is the brother of Adam's father, Peter Lanza, said the entire family was trying to understand what happened. She said her sister-in-law never talked of being threatened by her son, or about any violence he had committed."And if he did, I know she wouldn't tolerate it," she said. "If he needed help, I know they would have gotten it for him."Because they were the type of parents  when they were married, as well as being separated  if the kids had a need, they would definitely fulfill it."She said Nancy Lanza divorced in 2009 and was awarded the house and enough money  up to $12,450 a month in alimony, according to local news outlets that reviewed the divorce files  that she didn't have to work.A law enforcement source said the couple were ordered to undergo parental counseling as a condition of their divorce, but another source familiar with the case said that is a standard condition of divorces in Connecticut involving a minor child.Other Lanza family members emerged from seclusion Saturday, and, like Marsha Lanza, expressed disbelief."The family of Nancy Lanza shares the grief of a community and nation as we struggle to  comprehend the loss that we all share. ... On behalf of Nancy's mother and siblings, we reach out to the community and express our heartfelt sorrow for their incomprehensible tragedy and loss of innocence that has affected so many," the family said in a statement.It was read at a news conference by the sheriff of Rockingham County, N.H., where Nancy Lanza's brother is employed as a law enforcement officer.Adam Lanza's father, Peter, also issued a statement."Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express how heartbroken we are," it said. "We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can. We too are asking why."molly.hennessy-fiske@latimes.comkim.murphy@latimes.comrichard.serrano@latimes.comHennessy-Fiske reported from Newtown, Murphy from Seattle and Serrano from Washington, D.C.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles TimesComments91Comments (91)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQalex009 at 5:39 PM December 17, 2012                The one element that is lost is the "FAMILY".As An OLD MAN I grew up with Ozzie and Harriet and Leave it to Beaver those days are long gone as is the Family Circle. Mom's and Dad's who were home each night and with their children ate dinner together and talked about theri day, Also gone is a School enviorment were teachers had a say in discipline and what students caused disturbences. Even a prayer in school was something that identifyed a higher being who watched over all. Now 30 years fast forward and the ACLU and othelawyers who said little Johnnny or peggy could wear therir hair green or wear provocative clothing and all of a sudden the educational rules I had were changed. Now a days there are more single parent Families and now a days Teachers are so frustrated with their hands tied on discipline that we are moving backwards and have been for the last 30 years.This Nation has been at WAR for over the past 11 years so how are we to teach peace?astrochicks at 5:03 PM December 16, 2012                Thoughts and prayers to the families who lost loved ones. It's obvious, Adam Lanza was a troubled soul and I'm disturbed by the fact his mother had an arsenal of weapons. Why does a single mom, with a son who has a personality disorder, need to have enough weapons to be Rambo. That's irresponsible and so tragic. Why wasn't Adam getting therapy? Surely, living at home with your mom who has no job, you have no job, and you're a troubled kid is a recipe for disaster.Police officers and military personnel are responsible for their weapons, if they lose them or they are used in a crime, there is swift punishment and possible termination.I understand that right to bear arms but no one needs 600 rounds of amunition, 2 semi automatic guns, semi automatic rifle, and a bullet proof vest. That to me screams, I'm mentally unstable.If we expect others to be responsible with drinking and driving, you should be responsible for your weapons.I'm so sad, that 20 tiny little angels, and several adults had to lose their life because of this troubled family.abby0802 at 4:07 PM December 16, 2012                I have read in articles and heard on television news that the mother complained about her troubled son. And I truly feel sorry that she had problems with him. But, if you have a troubled child at home why in the world would you have a gun at home even if you are a gun enthusiast and the child never seemed violent? (And not just one gun, but more than one gun including a semi-automatic weapon and all those rounds of ammo!) One never ever knows another human being, even your own child. So, why take the risk?That said: our deepest condolences to the families of the victims, including the shooter's family. Prayers that peace and comfort will eventually come to them all ...Comments are filtered for language and registration is required. The Times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy.
