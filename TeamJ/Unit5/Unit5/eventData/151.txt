Yes it Bloody Well Is...Arianna Huffington: Newtown Massacre: What We Don't Need Is a 'National Conversation' -- We Need ActionOn Sunday night, President Obama spoke at an interfaith service for the victims of the horrific elementary school shooting. Not surprisingly, it was a poignant and moving speech. But the sad, horrible, tragic fact is that none of what we are witnessing is surprising. Shocking, yes, but not surprising. Mass shootings have become a defining feature of modern America. Yet on the issue of gun violence, President Obama has shown a gift for eloquent rhetoric but no follow-through. What we need now is not another national conversation but action -- starting with a ban on the sale of weapons that are only good for mass murder. Will the president lead the way? Will Congress act? Or will we succumb to the fatalistic conventional wisdom that says we'll never be able to prevent this from happening again -- and again and again?                            Lisa Belkin: After Newtown, There Is No Place For Parents To Hide                        Parents can't hide anymore either. There is nothing left to conjure from our desperate imaginations that separates our children from the ones who were dropped off for just another day of school Friday morning. There is no way to blame their parents here. So we have to blame ourselves.        Patricia McGuire: Protecting Other People's Children                        Few professional endeavors are more fraught with anxiety and danger than the work that makes us responsible for other people's children.  Sandy Hook Elementary School is the latest scene of every educator's nightmare.        Kash Heed: No Place For Ambiguity In Aftermath Of School Shooting                        The politician in me understands that in crafting policy, factors such as social conditions, supports available for mental illness, and the protection in place at children's schools, must all be considered. I am well aware of how important comprehensive consideration, investment, and ultimately prevention can be in avoiding incidents like Friday's shooting.The cop in me, however, is an unyielding proponent of strict gun control after witnessing firsthand the devastation gun violence causes society. It also makes me intolerant of playing the politics of re-election and courting public support on issues of this magnitude.
