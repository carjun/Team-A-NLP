He and some friends got a cab to do some sight seeing and then decide to go somewhere drinking.  They were riding down a semi dark, not very travelled road when the police pull over the cab driver, drag him out of the cab and commence to whipping his ass.  My husband and his friends stand in stunned shock as the cab driver is arrested and hauled away and they are left in the dark desert.  All but one police car leaves.  The remaining policeman explains - sort of - in broken English that someone will come to get them.  Not knowing if this is going to be a cab or a paddy wagon they nervously wait.  Eventually, thankfully, another cab arrives and they decide to call it a night when they get back to town.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat professions would be the most valuable in an apocalyptic world?  by  lets_be_truantin  AskReddit[+]Maxwyfe 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]Maxwyfe 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoI disagree.  Most attorneys think they are good leaders, but they are not.  They exist in a synchophantic environment where their staff agrees with them and does what they say without question due to the particular political structure of the office.  Their people skills are generally limited to eliciting information from others and crafting solid arguments.  Those are valuable skills in a social setting for sure; but when it comes down to do we eat or do we not, I don't want someone debating for 20 minutes, I want someone who will go out there and shoot a freaking deer.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, what is the most disturbing creature you have ever seen or heard of?  by  Neukemin  AskReddit[+]Maxwyfe 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]Maxwyfe 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours agohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_spiderWolf Spider.

I focused only on happy thoughts and eschewed the negative. I limited my contact and interaction with negative people. I sometimes had to force myself to look on the bright side and remain optimistic. Often it was difficult, but it paid off. My positivity returned rewards in improved relationships and my overall health and satisfaction with my life.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRedditors with a SO, how did you guys meet?  by  andersennavyin  AskReddit[+]Maxwyfe 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Maxwyfe 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoWe worked the same shift, but in different departments.

There were leftovers, which I placed on the backseat of the car.  When we finished dinner, my friends called needing a ride home from a bar.  We swung by the bar to pick them up.  One ended up sitting on my chicken in cashew sauce in the backseat and in the melee of four drunk people trying to get out of the backseat of  a 2 door hatchback we forgot about the cashew chicken and left it overnight.  In the summer.In Florida.  The stench of that car the next day was unbearable!  We hosed it out, we used Pine Sol and every sort of air freshner available, but nothing would rid the car of the smell of rotted cashew chicken.  We began to call the car the "Ghost Chicken" because of the lingering stench.  From then on every bad car smell is "Ghost Chicken".  permalinksavecontextfull commentsAt what moment did you lose faith in humanity?  by  duck__manin  AskReddit[+]Maxwyfe -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Maxwyfe -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day agoWhen the planes hit the towerspermalinksavecontextfull commentsA buddy of mine is trying to leave his wife, who attempted suicide last night.

Especially to your lawyer.  1.  We always find out, or already know.  2.  A lawyer's job is to represent YOUR point of view and your side of the story.  That is impossible to do if you haven't told us everything.  You are paying your lawyer a lot of money to do this - why would you make this job more difficult and thus, more expensive by witholding important facts?For example:  You signed a contract and now want out of it.  Don't tell us that isn't your signature.  If you just didn't read the darn thing or simply changed your mind after signing it we can make a more effective argument.    permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's one food you have tried and will NOT ever touch again?  by  pinkwaff1ein  AskReddit[+]Maxwyfe 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Maxwyfe 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoPart of it is a phobia.
