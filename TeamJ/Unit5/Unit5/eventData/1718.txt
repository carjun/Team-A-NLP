No one should be ashamed of sex (that they wanted to have.)EDIT: I realize my comment makes it sound like people should be ashamed of sex they didn't want to have, I.E. rape. I do NOT think people should be ashamed if they're raped. I just meant that if anyone decided to have sex, they should walk proud about it. If they didn't choose to have sex, it's not that simplistic. But still not shameful. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]menomenaa 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours agoHaha okay. So my suggestion that we could donate money to help ALL the kids in the community (therefore benefitting the kids that you're talking about, who aren't that wealthy) THAT suggestion really pissed you off? My point was that direct monetary charity isn't as beneficial in wealthy towns, generally. Please don't call me a fuckwit. You're assuming things about me, while asserting that I've made too many assumptions. I really hope berating people gets you super far in life. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]menomenaa 2 points3 points4 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 2 points3 points4 points 19 hours agoTo live in an area with such a great public school system, you do generally need to be in a very specific tax bracket. Newtown is one of those places. Also, he said "wealthy people don't have $10k in cash." I was saying they do. They don't have to be from Connecticut, I was just refuting that fact. I drew the parallel that the wealthy people I know happened to be from CT just to make it more relevant. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]menomenaa 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours agoI have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. I don't really feel like talking about it anymore. You think a family that just lost their child to murder needs the "healing power" of giving to charity? And if nice strangers did something good for the community they would somehow be derailed from this magical power you've asserted exists? Whatever. I kind of think you're just disagreeing to disagree. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]menomenaa 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoWait..what? You think wealthy families don't have $10,000 in savings? I'm sorry but...what?It feels crass talking about this detail, especially in the given thread, but I know people from similar towns in Connecticut that get more than that as allowance per month. I think it's spoiled and disgusting, but I know people that have hundreds out of thousands in savings. To say that "wealthy families don't have 10k" is a bit odd. Also, funerals have longer-term payment options. Why do you think funerals are the only industry that require cash, in-full?And how do feel so confident stating complete lies as fact? You're entire comment is bullshit and you're touting it as if everything you've said is a given. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAdam has a doppelganger on TLC  by  BloodFartsin  workaholics[+]menomenaa 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago...what?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I'm saying it's a gesture that might not end up having a benefactor because the money isn't needed. If a millionaire is given 20 dollars, who cares? If a homeless man is given 20 dollars, that means a A LOT. I know that's a really hyperbolic analogy, but what if the same amount of money could afford hiring a second child psychologist at the school for a couple of years? Or a grief counselor? My point is that that money can have a significant impact on a wide range of people in the community, much more so than the money sitting in a bank account of people who don't really need to touch it. Yes, it's "appropriate" to give money. I was commenting on the logic of it, and suggesting another idea. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]menomenaa 250 points251 points252 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 250 points251 points252 points 22 hours agoI hope this comes across very sensitively and not as a criticism to your idea, whatsoever:Newtown is a very wealthy town. I think most of the parents can afford it. I'm not saying "oh fuck, they can afford the funeral" because I know your intention was about alleviating the stress and heartache and not just the financial. BUT, in that regard, maybe a fund for a cause that directly benefits children would be appropriate? In the name of those that died. Or even to set up a memorial. Or a donation to the school. Or possibly a fund to help with the mental health of the students who are alive, to cope? I don't know. Instead of putting it into individual's hands who may not need it, I can see it being used towards a greater awareness and communal good. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, what musicians do you think are gonna blow up in 2013?  by  TheeColmin  AskReddit[+]menomenaa 26 points27 points28 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 26 points27 points28 points 22 hours agoThis is my favorite answer.

The older woman is the owner of the company. She's here part of the week, and her main goal is to maintain relationships with our editors and authors, but really doesn't do a lot of the daily office-related tasks. She's well into her 70's --beyond retirement age but still passionate about the company enough to work when she can. There is a boss below her that is THE boss in a truer sense of the word. permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust a pic of tonight's sunset over the East River  by  RealHollandaisein  nyc[+]menomenaa 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoHellgate will always be my favorite.

Obviously a more maximum security prison so it's not a perfect comparison, but do inmates try to hurt themselves in the hopes of going to a hospital?

Kind, but stern and serious, especially at the office. For my job, among other things, I manage a twitter account that deals with a lot of women's studies and feminist issues (it's for a journal that is related to the topic). I was looking on the internet for something interesting to tweet, and ended up on an article discussing reality television and gender. They mentioned a girl named Courtney Stodden, who I didn't know much about. I decided to google HER, and ended up at her twitter. I don't know if everyone knows who she is, but she's an oversexualized child-bride who was 17 at the time I googled her and only 16 when she married the 51-year-old actor Doug Hutchison. My boss walks by, and Courtney Stodden's twitter background is her completely naked in a tub with only a couple of bubbles covering her nips. This picture is repeated all over the background. My boss walks by, does a double-take, and I look back at my computer, back at her, absolutely horrified. She doesn't really know what twitter is so the tweets didn't clue her in to what I was doing. I remember stammering out "OH. HA- HA- HA. THIS IS FOR WORK. LET ME EXPLAIN. HA. HAHAH." She chalked it up to how weird twitter is and got over it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDear reddit, do you think it is more difficult to be an Unattractive woman or an Unattractive man?  by  gillyskein  AskReddit[+]menomenaa 26 points27 points28 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 26 points27 points28 points 1 day agoI'm a girl that can sometimes get intimidated by how anti-women some reddit threads become. I have to say I'm very pleasantly surprised that so many men are discussing how difficult it is for women and their relationships to being attractive or unattractive. I unfairly assumed the thread would be full of comments saying that guys have it the worst and women walk all over them no matter what they look like. I feel like it always gets pointed out when reddit is being particularly misogynist, so I just wanted to say this was refreshing to read and I'm glad a lot of guys recognize how hard some women have it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, what musicians do you think are gonna blow up in 2013?  by  TheeColmin  AskReddit[+]menomenaa 26 points27 points28 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 26 points27 points28 points 1 day agoRadical Face?

I like the way I look right now. I'm 23. I just like it. The one thing that I'd change about my body is the fact that it's aging. I think that's a fear of most women, unfortunately. I wish I didn't care. Women are constantly made aware of their relation to "peaking." 21 year olds are ideal. From then on it's all downhill. I know men suffer from the media's scrutiny and persuasive body ideals, but I think when it comes to aging, they have it a bit easier. Men will be hot well into their 40's, 50's. Women aren't as physically valued during those years, I'm afraid.My upper arms are maybe a tiny bit too big, or least untoned. Right now they look fine, but I can imagine in 10 years they won't look as great. 20 it'll be worse. THAT'S what I don't like thinking about. But for now? Can't complain. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are good ideas for (harmless) office pranks?  by  1mariannin  AskReddit[+]menomenaa 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoI had an idea for one. It's pretty mild, but we're a boring office. We have an office fish. Move him into another bowl, and hide that somewhere. I figure this can't be too stressful for the fish, since that's what we do when we clean his bowl anyway, right? I don't want to be flippant towards the little guy's safety, but I'll clean the tank during the prank so it's less cruel. Okay so when someone notices the fish is gone, let everyone sort of freak out, realize it's a prank. And then I'll laugh and say "got you guys!" Then I'll lead them to another fishbowl that I've hid and I'll say, holy shit. The fish is gone. I'll explain that I was trying to prank everyone and put it into this other fishbowl, but it's not there. Have people look around the floor, around their desks. I'll be really upset and keep apologizing saying how dumb it was. When everyone has kind of resigned themselves to believing the fish is gone, I'll discreetly put it back into the original tank. Really boring. But we're nerds. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's something about you that would make Reddit hate you?  by  TheBastardTrollin  AskReddit[+]menomenaa 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]menomenaa 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThey're anti-fashion. That sounds snobby, but it's just the most mass-marketed, bland and impersonal shoe you can put on your foot. Impersonal in the sense that it doesn't really indicate your sense of style, they've just become almost uniform-like. To some people, that's something to at least strongly dislike about them. They perpetuate a very conformist, boring self-expression, and at an expensive price to boot.
