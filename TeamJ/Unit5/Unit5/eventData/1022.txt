For other families with students at sandy hook elementary, what happened Friday morning is a story of survival and sacrifice.  Diana Licatta: "Like any other day, we got them off to school and had holiday activities planned. At 9:45 we got a call of unconfirmed shooting."  Diana and Robert Licatta had two children inside Sandy Hook Elementary School  Diana said she "would drive by their school and see what's happening." "60 Minutes" reports: Tragedy in NewtownHundreds of bullets, multiple 30-round clips at Conn. schoolNewtown, Conn., school staffers hailed as heroes Their 6-year-old son is in first grade. His teacher was Vicky Soto. Known for her dedication to her students, Vicky had just turned 27.   "She was an absolutely amazing teacher," Diana said. "She loved what she did... so full of life and educating got her so excited and teaching those children is what she loved to do."  The Licatta's 7-year-old daughter is in the second grade. Her classroom is just down the hall from her brother's. (CBS News was asked not to reveal the childrens' names.)  "I saw my daughter's teacher and asked about my daughter and she said she didn't' know where she was because they...were separated," Diana said.  Then, suddenly, she spotted her daughter.  "She just said: 'Mommy what's happening?' and I said, 'Just stay with your class.' I waited for (my) son to come out, and he never came out," Diana said.  Her son later told his parents a remarkable story of the nightmare unfolding inside his classroom. When the shooting began inside Sandy Point Elementary, teacher Vicky Soto moved the children in the classroom against a wall, away from the door, and that's when she came face-to-face with the gunman.  Robert Licatta: "They heard the noises. Somehow was able to burst through door - that's when they witness his teacher be shot, and she fell to the ground. Ran right by the shooter right by the doorway. How they escaped...we'll never really know...how they escaped him."  The children got out, but the young teacher who had apparently shielded her students, was left dead.  Diana: "She is truly a hero. Very likely because of her that our son is with us today." 34 PhotosVictims of Conn. school shootingView the Full Gallery     2012 CBS Interactive Inc.

Americans are not known as a helpless, hopeless people. So why do we stand before the garbage of hopelessness and believe that we can't have the bravery and moral courage of the Australians and knock back the gun culture. If we can make it to the moon, we can also set a high goal that goes beyond gun culture to addressing the causes of a fear culture and how to heal it.

And there are more difficult but equally necessary moves that need to happen in the care given to mentally disturbed young people.

This is not about Pakistan and Afghan.                      by djseavy December 17, 2012 4:55 AM EST  Why don't you put your political (and mostly nonsensical) blather aside for a moment and think about the families in Connecticut? This horrific scene has nothing to do with Obama or the mid-east.                         by GOP-R--Con-Men December 16, 2012 11:43 PM EST  President Obama very touching speech and I am proud to have you as our president. Now maintain your resolve and push aside the NRA and republicans if they stand in the way of what the nation wants and what you know in your heart America needs.Get out of the way republicans and NRA. It's a new day, deal with it!     Reply to this comment            by scottedowner December 16, 2012 11:28 PM EST  When we Give up our Rights to Think they will Stop evil . "Then Evil will Win " ..And what we dont see will Kill and many more . Evil gets smarter when completion gets tougher .. Kill the NCLB act and Hold parents and Teachers Responsible and Look at the Student not the Schools as a baby sitter .. Guns dont have a Brain "People do .. Putting a Blanket on Guns dont stop Evil . Evil wants Prestige and fame . Education and Protection saves lives . Take the Politics out of Schools.. when Obama -Care kicks i You will see more evil ..more kids on prescription drugs for entitlements and Much more this will effect there future .. Responsibility will bring Education back to the Schools.. End the NCLB law and the unions out of the Schools . each kid is Different and some more active then others . This they drug kids for and lets not get me started on Disability Fraud for Entitlements giving to kids because of it ..

Give it a rest for once in your life!                        Add a comment     Subscribe to this comment thread by email  SUBMIT         Click here to add another comment.
