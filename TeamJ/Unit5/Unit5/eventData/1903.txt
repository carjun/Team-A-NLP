His face has been on CNN and Fox News.  Anyone looking remotely like him or named Ryan Lanza anywhere on the East coast is in incredible danger right now.    This guy should be suing CNN and Fox News and whatever other networks shared the photo because his life could be seriously damaged from all of this.  permalinksaveparent[+]Goldenboy451 30 points31 points32 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]Goldenboy451 30 points31 points32 points 22 hours agoLawyer Redditor needed: Can he actually sue?

Libel, slander, defamation, and even emotional distress are all valid reasons to lawyer up against a news agency using his photo without first confirming the identity.permalinksaveparent[+]skediddlehopper 5 points6 points7 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]skediddlehopper 5 points6 points7 points 13 hours agosee: Richard Jewellpermalinksaveparent[+]nanotek 2 points3 points4 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]nanotek 2 points3 points4 points 13 hours agoShort answer. Yes. permalinksaveparent[+]enjee 12 points13 points14 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]enjee 12 points13 points14 points 20 hours agoYou would think that a major network like CNN or Fox would wait for confirmation of the shooter's identity before airing a name and photo nationwide. Hell, fucking worldwide.permalinksaveparent[+]docmedic 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours ago (7 children)[]docmedic 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours agoAnyone looking remotely like him or named Ryan Lanza anywhere on the East coast is in incredible danger right now.But isn't the shooter dead?  On the other hand, if people think it was him, they'd probably run in fear.permalinksaveparent[+]JarasM 13 points14 points15 points 21 hours ago (5 children)[]JarasM 13 points14 points15 points 21 hours agoIf by "run in fear" you mean "lynch", then yes.permalinksaveparent[+]docmedic 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago (4 children)[]docmedic 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours agoBut that doesn't make any sense, the shooter of the same name is dead.  If he was reported as on the run, then yes, they would lynch either of them.permalinksaveparent[+]JarasM 10 points11 points12 points 21 hours ago*(3 children)[]JarasM 10 points11 points12 points 21 hours ago*Tell me when angry mobs will start following common sense. Look for a Ryan Lanza on Facebook. Dunno what accounts are legit right now, if any, but there's like a ton of death threats. To a guy that's supposedly dead.It might be a smart move for him to go to the police for the time being, at least until it cools down a bit. It is stupid, but stupid people might get stupid ideas if they see him in the street after seeing his picture on the TV with a "child mass killer" caption.permalinksaveparent[+]alphanovember 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (2 children)[]alphanovember 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoHis FB page was taken down now, apparently. permalinksaveparent[+]lizlegit000 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]lizlegit000 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours agoits not taken down. its still uppermalinksaveparent[+]JarasM 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago*(0 children)[]JarasM 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago*Yeah, but a lot of fakes sprung up, as well as numerous 'fanpages' - with, surprise, death threats and insults, mostly. https://www.facebook.com/search/results.php?q=ryan%20lanza&type=pagesEven more on searching for Adam Lanza: https://www.facebook.com/search/results.php?q=adam%20lanza&type=pagespermalinksaveparent[+]princesskiki 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]princesskiki 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours agoAt the time of the confusion, yes.

That time will come when the dust settles and that screencap is actually legit.  Because, legit or not, his picture will surely be attached to the killings on the internet for a long time to come.permalinksaveparent[+]fratgirl 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]fratgirl 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agohe's the shooter's brother and is being questioned by policepermalinksaveparent[+]manufactured_narwhal 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (2 children)[]manufactured_narwhal 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoWhy would he be in incredible danger? The shooter killed himself. He should be fine.permalinksaveparent[+]OkonkwoJones 3 points4 points5 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]OkonkwoJones 3 points4 points5 points 17 hours agoYou assume everyone is informed completely as well as behave rationally to these sorts of situations.permalinksaveparent[+]princesskiki 2 points3 points4 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]princesskiki 2 points3 points4 points 11 hours agoBecause people are idiots, everyone was all emotionally charged, and angry mobs don't use logic.permalinksaveparent[+]lizlegit000  comment score below threshold (2 children)[]lizlegit000 -11 points-10 points-9 points 18 hours agohow do you know his face has been in CNN? I dont think CNN would do that, i believe Fox News would do that but not CNN. Source?permalinksaveparent[+]Tumorseal 5 points6 points7 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]Tumorseal 5 points6 points7 points 18 hours agoThe source is anyone watching CNN. I don't have a screencap, but all the major networks had his pic on TV and on the websites.permalinksaveparent[+]princesskiki 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]princesskiki 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours agoI named the two I knew of, but there were many others.  Once one got ahold of the info getting tossed around, they were all trying to be the first with the information.  permalinksaveparent[+]Kheten 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]Kheten 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoHe needs to defend himself from a retarded witch huntHurr fucking durr. It shouldn't have happened. The media SHOULD NOT HAVE RELEASED THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER AT ALL. This guy needs to lawyer up and sue some fuckers for libel, defamation, and slander.permalinksaveparent[+]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoI never said it should have happened, nor implied it is acceptable.  But when shit goes down and I'm on bad/wrong end of it, I try my damnedest to mitigate the effects instead of letting it all pour on.  He wanted it to stop, so make a comment public and that would help make it stop.I wasn't 'victim blaming', it was a suggestion to get it to stop.  Whether he attempts to mitigate or he doesn't, he has a civil case for libel against the media, and IMO he should pursue it.permalinksaveparent[+]I_PISS_HAIR  comment score below threshold (11 children)[]I_PISS_HAIR -19 points-18 points-17 points 23 hours agoAgreed. I made the same mistake and posted the info. I took the links down when someone pointed out it was the wrong guy. Maybe he doesn't realize those comments aren't public?permalinksaveparent[+]bennybuckethead 21 points22 points23 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]bennybuckethead 21 points22 points23 points 23 hours agoI'm glad you took the links down, but you should not have posted them at all. This is the exact reason why we have that rule on Reddit. permalinksaveparent[+]the_anj 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours ago (9 children)[]the_anj 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours agoI wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't.  But someone close to him should send him a message... seriously one comment being made public will be the best way to get people off his ass.permalinksaveparent[+]FleshyMeatCreature 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours ago (8 children)[]FleshyMeatCreature 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours agoHow are none of you comtemplating the idea that this account is fake? You're letting me down, redditpermalinksaveparent[+]JesusHRChrist 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (6 children)[]JesusHRChrist 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoI went to the profile before the boom of hits, it's been a profile for at least 2 years.permalinksaveparent[+]FleshyMeatCreature -3 points-2 points-1 points 22 hours ago*(5 children)[]FleshyMeatCreature -3 points-2 points-1 points 22 hours ago*Right. You went to the real profile (which has now been pulled, by the way) of the shooter. Not some private, screen shot fake. Edit: "real" shooter turned out to be the brother of the actual shooter. Give me downvotes, please. permalinksaveparent[+]JesusHRChrist 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]JesusHRChrist 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoyes. The actual profile. The moment a name was released, I checked it out. The main profile picture had a comment from someone saying he needed a coat like Neo from the Matrix.permalinksaveparent[+]FleshyMeatCreature 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]FleshyMeatCreature 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoThen we're on the same page. I initally thought you were saying the screenshot was of the legitimate profile. permalinksaveparent[+]JesusHRChrist 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]JesusHRChrist 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoIt's understandable. Same page fist bump.permalinksaveparent[+]Tumorseal 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (1 child)[]Tumorseal 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoIn case you haven't heard by now (your comment is 3 hours old) He was NOT the shooter. CNN and Fox and the others fucked up big time and this guy is going through some shit right now.permalinksaveparent[+]FleshyMeatCreature 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]FleshyMeatCreature 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoYea, I was wrong about who the shooter was. I'm still not convinced that screenshot was a shot from the actual profile of the brother of the shooter, though. But it's a moot point. Thanks for the update.  permalinksaveparent[+]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoYou're right.  I kept it in consideration, albeit the perspective of my comments; my comments (in my mind) were both to call the bluff (on the fake) and to also give advice on how to get people off his ass if the s/s img was legit.Since then, the profile has gone completely private, though (gives the same response as it does if you tried to go to my fb profile.)  That's not to say that this particular Ryan Lanza did that himself or if LEOs did or whatnot.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
