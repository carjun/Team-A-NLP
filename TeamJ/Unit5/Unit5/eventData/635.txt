All donations to this fund will go directly to those affected.The Red Cross has also been on the ground, offering food and water to first responders, and providing more than 50 units of blood to Danbury hospital where some of the victims were transported. They have set up a center for emergency grief counseling.In addition, the nonprofit mental health clinic Newtown Youth and Family Services will be open all weekend from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. for grief counseling. They say all donations made at this time will go to helping those impacted.The Newtown Parent Connection has also pledged to try and bring in extra counselors to help parents cope.Some private funds have also been set up in the wake of the tragedy to help victims. The Newtown Memorial fund is taking donations for the families and community affected, and is also actively recruiting volunteers and offers of help of all kinds.

For ways to help her family you can visit the funds Facebook page.The band One Republic has also started a fund to raise money for those affected.
