I use mine similarly to /u/misterceejay -- pack them in a bag and forget about 'em -- they're super durable and lightweight. It's awesome to have decent cans anywhere I go. However, I would comment that I don't often wear these on the street/subway/bus because they don't isolate very much. A lot of bass rumble can be heard with these on, so if you're listening on transit your sound will be muddled. I much prefer my etymotic in-ears for that reason when out and about. The ATH-M50s  really shine in a quiet space.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMusic nerds: Let's show off our collections! Here's some of my post-rock vinyl collection.

My understanding is that the intent here is to create a "global" best of 2012 awards, whereas /r/bestof2012 is about subreddit-specific awards. Which is awesome!permalinksavecontextfull commentstuna.js: Web Audio API Effects Library  by  c_coniglioin  javascript[+]chromakode 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]chromakode 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoI believe nativeNode is any type of node implemented by the Web Audio API. They're denoted as native because they're implemented by the browser rather than in JS.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCommunity Best of 2012 Awards  by  chromakodein  modnews[+]chromakode[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]chromakode[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 days agoThat would be hilarious!

We got the announcement out early so you would have lots of time to scheme and plan what you'd like to do. I think that community best-ofs would benefit from being done around the same time. I was thinking the week between Christmas and New Year's would be a good time to do awards, since a lot of people will be home for the holidays.Also, like I said I run a few subreddits (/r/cringe, /r/rage) - so would I get 5 creddits for each subreddit?Yes. Each subreddit that does its own best-of ceremonies will be considered independently.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGreetings!  by  chromakodein  bestof2012[+]chromakode[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]chromakode[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoPlease see my reply here.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGreetings!  by  chromakodein  bestof2012[+]chromakode[S] 4 points5 points6 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]chromakode[S] 4 points5 points6 points 8 days agoA whole-site bestof is awesome. However, it's something that becomes less and less useful as the site grows larger and less homogeneous. reddit is so scattered at this point that whole-site vote won't possibly cover all of the noteworthy things, and will bias towards only things with really mass / average appeal. Voting is so much more interesting when it's done by specific communities -- it's the same reason we don't just have one big subreddit.There's also the problem of communities having different sizes, so if we put certain awards to a global vote, it would bias towards which communities are composed of more people.By splitting the best-ofs into a federated per-community part and a stats-based global section, we're reaching for the best of both worlds: the depth and breadth of featuring stuff from as many subreddits as possible, and objective "bests" based on stats rather than a popularity contest.this sounds like the admins are being less invested in redditHonestly? This requires a lot more attention and personal effort than rolling out a little best-of voting code and firing up comment threads for voting. Trying something new almost always takes a greater investment than doing the same thing as the past 4 years. On the contrary, trying to pull off a best-of awards of this sort is a huge investment to communicate with mods and communities to bring a disparate set of stuff together, and it's a big bet of faith in our communities to create awesome awards ceremonies in ways that we can't predict or control.The goal is to make the "best of 2012" really true to what reddit is today -- its varied communities -- and it's going to take a lot more distributed effort to make it great. This effort will have to not just come from admins, but all sorts of moderators and redditors who want to celebrate the past year's greats. I think that will be worth it when it leads redditors to discover great communities they hadn't heard of before, and sets the example that reddit is all about its deep and varied communities, not just the front page.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCommunity Best of 2012 Awards  by  chromakodein  modnews[+]chromakode[S] 40 points41 points42 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]chromakode[S] 40 points41 points42 points 8 days agoYou should suggest that to /r/mylittlepony!permalinksavecontextfull commentsCommunity Best of 2012 Awards  by  chromakodein  modnews[+]chromakode[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]chromakode[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoThe intent is to recognize the best content / activity of the year.
