It was AWFUL. HTC Amaze. I went everywhere for advice on fixing its myriad issues, including r/Android, and even got a replacement from the company. I'm not trolling - I've lived with iPhones, Blackberrys and Android devices.It was a hilariously terrible POS that died every day at around 4:30 pm, was full of bullshit bloatware and needed extensive work to just be a basic fucking phone.It is a pale imitation.Mind boggling.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThey'd be a hit.  by  Mycooljamin  funny[+]snarketeer 8 points9 points10 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]snarketeer 8 points9 points10 points 2 days agoDear OP, here's to you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI live in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

AMA  by  ianmgullin  IAmA[+]snarketeer 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]snarketeer 3 points4 points5 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI own a recording studio,and get a lot of interns from schools like yours. I think the number of students who will get and maintain jobs on graduation is closer to the 15% range. Their gear knowledge tends to be overtly specific (not a lot of contingency planning), and the actual job is 10% dorkery and 90% human interaction anyway. Which is harder to teach. These are 18 year old kids just coming out of high school who would be fucking around and getting drunk at a four year college, but doing it at a two year trade school. Most of them are pretty doomed. The ones who would have gotten jobs in the industry anyway most likely didn't need the school to begin with, just some gear and an internship. Teach them post and they have a chance, but outside of NYC, LA and Nashville there aren't that many studios left, and schools like Full Sail and Berkley are producing plenty of potentials for those markets. And, the industry is MASSIVELY over-saturated. permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: Difference between C++ and C++0x  by  Joz314in  explainlikeimfive[+]snarketeer -2 points-1 points0 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]snarketeer -2 points-1 points0 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onELI5: This question.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBirthday  by  aakritiajmera65in  funny[+]snarketeer 12 points13 points14 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]snarketeer 12 points13 points14 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onrarr rarr rarr merriment rarr wishing me happiness dickbastard snotbabies rarr rarr also assholes outta my chimney at xmas fuck'em rarr rarr trick or suck my dick you cumwallet motherfuckers rarr rarr rarr cheer rarr offa my lawnpermalinksavecontextfull commentsIAmA military bomb squad technician (EOD).
