What people don't immediately think about is that villains are people before they are "villains". For example, the Joker is a bad guy, but he has legitimate desires, motivations, and feelings. It is these desires that make him evil, not his evilness that make his desires.Treat your character in the same way. Figure out what Harry Roat Jr. wants from scene to scene/in his life. Figure out what characterizes him as a person. Try to find some connections between how he feels and how you have felt or would feel in a similar situation. Once you understand him, then you can project him.The scariest kind of villain is one that the audience can believe is real. I'm not saying that you shouldn't exaggerate the character a bit, but make sure that you keep him believable.(By the way, I'd love to hear a follow up on whether or not you get the part)permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL a sociopathic 10 year old girl killed two boys. One of the crime scenes was described by the inspector as "There was a terrible playfulness about it...and somehow the playfulness of it made it more, rather than less, terrifying". She was convicted and then released at the age of 23.  by  lexanin  todayilearned[+]copperbell 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]copperbell 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago"I am a murderer.""I murder so that I may come back."If you've ever read "Crime & Punishment", this story is ten times more fucking terrifying.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKubrickian Masquerade Ball Wednesday in L.A.  by  GambitOfDesiresin  StanleyKubrick[+]copperbell 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]copperbell 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoWhere are they holding the post-party orgy?permalinksavecontextfull commentsMr Torrance  by  MrPrestigein  StanleyKubrick[+]copperbell 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]copperbell 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoThanks for posting; awesome find.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMr Torrance  by  MrPrestigein  StanleyKubrick[+]copperbell 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]copperbell 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoHoly carp, did you make this?permalinksavecontextfull commentsI Am Andrew Simmons, correspondent for Al Jazeera English, and fresh out of Syria.

I haven't seen very many animated shorts (or animated pants for that matter), but I still consider "Everything Will Be OK" to be one of the greatest animations, if not one of the greatest films ever.Your Wikipedia article says that Stanley Kubrick is one of your "influences". Is this true? If it is, what is it about his work that you find meaningful, and how has his work/the man influenced you and your own work?Also, can you draw me a picture of a camel?

Also a good choice for your voice. Your pitch is just fine and it sounds like you even have a little vibrato.Probably the most noticeable thing that you need to improve is "where you sing from". Your sound is a little nasally; you can solve this by supporting your sound from your diaphragm. There are tons of videos on YouTube that teach diaphragmatic breathing. Look one up and start practicing!permalinksavecontextfull commentsaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
