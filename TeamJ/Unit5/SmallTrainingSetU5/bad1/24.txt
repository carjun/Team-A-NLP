Albums or "packs" of related gifs may only be submitted by a moderator. If you would like to become a mod to (among other things) help create & maintain official packs, message us.

A reaction gif is a physical or emotional response that is captured in a gif which you can link in response to someone or something on the Internet. Read this for more information.
Please link directly to the gif and use a reliable host such as:

imgur
minus
picsarus
picasa
gifsoup
postimage
reactiongifs
gifbin
reactionclips
replygif
imgflip
forgifs

Your gif must actually contain some sort of reaction.
If you resubmit anything in the Top 100 of all time it will be removed.

Create some [OC] (Original Content) that gained over 500 karma points in this subreddit? Message the mods and we'll design some custom flair tailored specifically for you. POSTS MUST HAVE AN [OC] TAG TO QUALIFY FOR FLAIR
MORE INFORMATION
Note: If you did not create the gif yourself, you are not eligible for OC flair! Please remember to use the [OC] tag on your original creations if you want to receive custom flair.


Official Packs:

#001: Look at all the fucks I give.
#002: Gangnam Style!
