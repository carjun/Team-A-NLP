Want a flair from Gen III-V? Go here!
The old flair bot is down at the moment. For now, you may select your flair using the (edit) button above, next to your username. Currently, there are only enough slots for the first two generations of pokémon, from Bulbasaur to Celebi. 
(Column 1: #1-84, Column 2: #85-168, Column 3: #169-251)
A place for all things Pokemon. TV shows, videogames, toys, trading cards, you name it.
