A good-natured drink with CNN’s Lila King (who I once had the pleasure of working at CNN with) and Katie Hawkins-Gaar quickly turned to competitive hometown pride as we argued about Atlanta vs. New York pizza. They insisted we travel to Ammazza despite the danger of walkers. Natan and I begrudging had to admit it was actually great pizza despite not being in NYC. Lila and Katie proceeded to celebrate their victory this round, but it’s not over yet…

This work date was well timed with our joint assignment with Travel + Leisure. We would nominate Ammazza for best pizza in Atlanta. What’s your favorite place to eat like a local?

We’ve taken over the Empire State Building.
Seriously. Watch the height of the red (Romney) and blue (Obama) lights for CNN’s electoral vote projections. If you take a photo, tag it #cnnelection and you could be part of our coverage!

“Where you at, Hawaii?” After you vote, take a photo of yourself with an “I Voted” sticker (homemade or otherwise) and upload it to iReport, Instagram or Twitter. Tag it #ivotedcnn and it could end up on this CNN map. We want the Aloha State to be included in the project. And thanks for voting!

If voter turnout stayed exactly as it did in 2008 (impossible, I know, but hear me out) then 11,000-some new voters would push Hawaii out of last place for voter participation. There are plenty of caveats, since turnout obviously won’t be the same as it was, thanks to Superstorm Sandy and a host of other factors. But my takeaway is this: Hawaii is really close. That’s an attainable goal.
Read the full story on CNN.com.

come on, hawaii!

John’s home never lost power during Katrina, but a block down they did - he was lucky.  But he did evacuate to just north of Baton Rouge for the storm.  When he came back, he said all the leaves off the Oak in his front yard were ripped off, but the garbage cans didn’t even move.  

katrina survivors share their advice for post-sandy new york. this is amazing.

CNN’s Change the List is trying to boost voter participation in Hawaii, the state with the lowest turnout rate. It starts with one person. Nani Teruya says Hawaii shouldn’t be part of the United States. She doesn’t vote because she believes the government is illigitimate. Still, a member of the Hawaiian royal family urged her to use her vote to push for change. Help convince Nani to vote by tweeting messages or videos to her with the hashtag #CTL3.

Check it: We’ve teamed up with CNN’s political unit on a new Tumblr! The idea is to bring you the big stories of the 2012 election (and, later, other stuff) in super-simple, easy to understand, highly visual posts. Go give it a look.

Michael Remen, a sous-chef in Hilo, Hawaii, spent an hour and a half trying to vote in the primary. The polling places were such a mess, he said, that he doesn’t plan to vote in November. Before this year, he always looked forward to going to his polling place. Help us convince him to vote again. Post a message or video and tag it #CTL2. This is part of CNN’s Change the List — an effort to boost voter participation in Hawaii, the state that had the lowest voter turnout rate in 2008. I’ll report back on whether or not it works. Thanks for your help. — John

Send an iReport and convince Remen to vote!

Convince Paul Hewlett to vote! Send him a message on YouTube or Twitter with the hashtag #CTL1. “I’ve never voted in my life,” Hewlett told me when I met him on a beach in Hawaii. “I don’t think my one vote is going to make any difference.” You could convince him otherwise. This project is part of CNN’s Change the List. Our goal is to boost Hawaii off the bottom of the voter turnout ranking. #changethelist

Did you know that Hawaii has the lowest voter turnout in the United States? We’re trying to change that, one voter at a time. You can convince Paul Hewlett to vote by sending him a message at #CTL1 on various social networks, or uploading a video to iReport.

Check out this cool project by our friends at CNN Digital called Change the List. It spotlights the state of Hawaii, currently ranked number 50 when it comes to voter turnout. Through their reporting, interviews and related social media efforts, they’re hoping their experiment can lift Hawaii in November’s election.
