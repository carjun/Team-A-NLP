Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]XeroGeez 5 points6 points7 points 12 hours ago  (0 children)[–]XeroGeez 5 points6 points7 points 12 hours agoNo, its fine. I didn't actually expect that though. haha. Anyway, my father did did a little murder suicide dance involving him, my mother, and my grandmother. But the spotlights not on me. I was just saying that these reporters are ruthless much of the time.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]XeroGeez 27 points28 points29 points 20 hours ago  (0 children)[–]XeroGeez 27 points28 points29 points 20 hours agoReporters are trained to have no moral compass. When my parents were killed, not 10 minutes after police arrived, a local news reporter was shoving her microphone in my face trying to get me to talk. I understand that people deserve to know what happened, but there are ways to get the facts without brutal interviews that are way too soon. The police almost always know more of whats going on anyway.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsthe walking dead game...by bethesda:)  by  manofthenerdsin  thewalkingdead[+]XeroGeez 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]XeroGeez 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoI Bethesda zombie game wouldn't really have the feel of TWD that makes it so great. The whole sense of community would be shot in a Bethesda game because they focus on a personal experience. You can walk around far and wide on your own and gut radscorpions without anyone getting in your way, or slay draugr in solitude. They don't do groups very well.

Let them make it TV-MA. Lord knows it is gory enough.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsIts all about Carl!  by  DoTheWhopin  thewalkingdead[+]XeroGeez 6 points7 points8 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]XeroGeez 6 points7 points8 points 4 days agoMy point is that the world's population is already far below what you would need to have more herd inducing outbreaks. The most action people will see will be like...the flu killing two people in the same season and making them become walkers.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsIts all about Carl!  by  DoTheWhopin  thewalkingdead[+]XeroGeez 7 points8 points9 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]XeroGeez 7 points8 points9 points 4 days agoI don't think a decades later thing would be interesting at all. If the series ends that way then it will be completely boring. You see, we've been told that zombies do starve, just a lot slower than humans do, so ten years from now they will certainly all be dead. You know what threat that leaves? not many people really. So a flash forward would look a lot like Woodbury but with less crazy.
