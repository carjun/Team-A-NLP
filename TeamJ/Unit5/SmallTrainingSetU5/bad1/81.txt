And to top off his new lady love's special day, apparently Harry took her on a drive through the English Countryside, taking her to his local golf club for a look around, and then to a quaint town called Great Budworth. The pair stopped for a bite to eat at a cute pub, George & Dragon!Not only that but, Taylor even met the most important lady in Harry's life — his mother! Seems like things are getting a bit serious between these two!Alright so what do you think about Taylor's 23 cupcakes! Best present ever, or are you not impressed? Also, let's continue chatting about Haylor! Seems like they're moving pretty fast, but its it too fast? Tell me!!

I just want Harry to be happy but I'm freaking out cause Taylor swift mostly﻿ writes songs about break ups and if the break up Taylor swift has a new song about a break up which might be called the wrong direction
