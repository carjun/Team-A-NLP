CNN iReport (a group admin) says:
16 Nov 10 - Hi iReporters! The Leonid meteor shower will be at its peak two to three hours before dawn on Wednesday and Thursday and, according to Stardate magazine, at least 20 meteors will be visible per hour. 

If you plan to take photos of the spectacular sight, upload them here. We can't wait to see what you capture!

About CNN iReport
Lots of people argue about what constitutes news. But, really, it's just something that happens someplace to someone. Whether that something is newsworthy mostly depends on who it affects -- and who's making the decision. On iReport.com, that is you!

iReport is a place for you to submit your photos of breaking news and other events happening around the world -- or just day-to-day shots that capture something interesting.

You can also submit your top shots here. From time to time, we'll pick some amazing photos and video to highlight on CNN.

Submitting a photo to the group pool or tagging it "iReport" does not constitute an agreement to iReport.com's Terms of Use.
