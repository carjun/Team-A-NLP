Tired of the bias and hyperbole over at /r/politics and /r/worldnews? You've come to the right place.
/r/news - real news articles only

See a submission that violates the rules below? Report it or message us before complaining in the comments!

Please post news items only. 
The only exception is posts maturely discussing the /r/news community. Self-posts aggregating news data and "independent reporting" each count as "news items," but are not an excuse for editorialization.
Your post may be deleted if: 

it is an editorial, opinion, petition, solicitation, poll or advocacy article.
it uses an editorialised title. The headline should not include your opinion of the news, nor any exhortation to action.
it links to a paywall site, or a site that steals content.
it is inane or of overly limited interest.
it is contrived political news. Latest poll numbers or political back-and-forth etc to /r/politics please.
it is a repost of a story that has been posted multiple times.


If your post doesn't fit here, consider:
/r/inthenews - all news-related content
/r/politics - for shouting about politics
/r/moderatepolitics - similar, but less shouting
/r/politicaldiscussion - also with less shouting
/r/worldnews  - news from outside the USA
/r/entertainment - Justin Bieber updates, etc.
/r/FoodForThought - discussion-worthy items
/r/pastnews - news from 10+ yrs ago
/r/AnythingGoesNews for unrestricted news
/r/UpliftingNews - uplifting news
/r/newsporn - cool news-related images
/r/misc for none of the above

"The foolish and wicked practice of profane cursing and swearing is a vice so mean and low that every person of sense and character detests and despises it." - George Washington

Thanks to Newdles for the header image.

Please post all election news, opinion, analysis etc. to /r/inthenews instead

When my parents were killed, not 10 minutes after police arrived, a local news reporter was shoving her microphone in my face trying to get me to talk. I understand that people deserve to know what happened, but there are ways to get the facts without brutal interviews that are way too soon. The police almost always know more of whats going on anyway.

permalinksaveparent[+]Genetycs 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours ago  (2 children)[–]Genetycs 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours agoThis may come off as a little insensitive and I apologize, but do you mind explaining what happened to your parents? I totally understand if you don't want to.

permalinksaveparent[+]XeroGeez 5 points6 points7 points 12 hours ago  (1 child)[–]XeroGeez 5 points6 points7 points 12 hours agoNo, its fine. I didn't actually expect that though. haha. Anyway, my father did did a little murder suicide dance involving him, my mother, and my grandmother. But the spotlights not on me. I was just saying that these reporters are ruthless much of the time.

permalinksaveparent[+]dem358 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago  (0 children)[–]dem358 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours agoShit, how old were you? When was this? How is your life now? Do you have any siblings? I hope you are okay, if that is even possible after such an experience, I wish you all the best as a stranger from the internet.

I understand that people deserve to know what happened

Unfortunately, letting people know what's happening has nothing to do with shoving microphones into the faces of traumatised individuals; that's to do with ratings.
The public could as easily be informed by one newscaster, sitting behind a desk.
Sorry you had to go through that!
