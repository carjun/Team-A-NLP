Connecticut school shooting: follow the latest coverage 

Lt. Paul Vance says the gunman was not voluntarily let into Sandy Hook 
  Elementary School in Newtown. 


Audio from radio calls made by the first officers on the scene suggests that 
  he may have forced his way in by either breaking the glass doors or shooting 
  his way past the security system. 


Authorities confirmed the shooter, believed to be 20-year-old Adam Lanza, shot 
  a relative before driving to the school. 


Unconfirmed reports suggest he had killed his mother at their family ome 
  before then drove her car to Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday morning 
  and shot 20 children, six adults and himself.
