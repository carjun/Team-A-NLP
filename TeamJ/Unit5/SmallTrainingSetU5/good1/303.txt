Police are looking for a motive after Friday's elementary school shooting in Connecticut that left more than two dozen people dead, many of them students. The alleged shooter has been identified as Adam Lanza.Connecticut state police countered many rumors that Lanza had been let in the building, saying he forced his way in.Among those killed were 20 children, all between 5 and 10 years old. Six adults were killed, including the school's principal.The victims have been identified and law enforcement officials said the names should be released later today.




Politicians React To Shooting



Several local politicians responded to the Connecticut shooting with immediate calls for more gun control.



A law enforcement official tells the Associated Press some of the guns used are the same models of guns owned by his parents. The alleged shooter and his mother, Nancy Lanza, are also dead. Nancy Lanza's body was found in her home Friday morning. The shooter took his own life inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown after the shootings."My music teacher tells us to get in the closet, at first I thought it was just practice but then I realized everything was real," student Matthew Hoekenga said.

MaryAnn Jacob, a library clerk at the school, described the horrifying ordeal she endured.âIt was a lot of really scared parents looking for their kids. A lot of grateful people, neighbors and friends," Jacob said. "It was surreal. I don't know how to describe it."Jacob said she barricaded students in a room by jamming file cabinets in front of the door.They later heard pounding on the door -- announcing it was the police.

Newtown is located about 60 miles away from New York City.
