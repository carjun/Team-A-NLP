NEWTOWN, CT (WFSB) -
			It was one of the most tragic days in Connecticut history, and investigations continue into why - and how - a man could walk into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown and kill 20 children and six adults.
According to Connecticut State Police, 20-year-old Adam Lanza was not voluntarily let into the building, and may have shot out a window near the locked front door in order to make his way inside.
Officials said Lanza then opened fire inside the school, killing children and adults before killing himself.
The horrific incident began around 9:30 a.m. after police were alerted that someone was inside Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting people.
Inside the school, the Associated Press is reporting that a custodian ran through the halls of the school, warning of a gunman, and someone inside the school's office switched on the intercom, perhaps saving dozens of lives by letting them hear what was unfolding inside the office.
Screams were heard, just for a few moments, but they gave teachers enough time to realize what was unfolding from within the building and immediately locking doors and getting students away from windows and doors.
Some teachers even grabbed students and hid inside bathrooms and closets, praying the gunfire would stop and police would move in.
Police eventually did move in, moving classroom to classroom, rescuing anyone that needed to be.
Police said they found Lanza's body inside a classroom.
"This is the worst we've ever seen," said Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance at a news conference Friday afternoon.
Horrified students were hurried out of the building and were told to cover their eyes and run as they were led past the office at the front of the building.
Police said before going on his rampage inside Sandy Hook Elementary School, Lanza killed his mother, Nancy, inside her Newtown home.
According to the Associated Press, three guns were found at the scene - a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols, inside the school, and a .223-caliber rifle in the back of a car Lanza drove to the scene. A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said some of the guns used in the attack may have belonged to Lanza's family. 
His mother had legally registered three weapons. His father two.
Gov. Dannel Malloy rushed to the scene after getting word of the tragedy that was unfolding in Newtown.
"Evil visited this community today, and it's too early to speak of recovery, but each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that Connecticut - we're all in this together. We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event," Malloy said.
Pres. Barack Obama addressed the nation from the White House on Friday as well.
The visibly emotional Obama fought back tears and he began to speak of all of the children that had their lives taken so tragically.
"The majority of those who died were children - beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old," Obama said. "Our hearts are broken today."
On Friday night, residents of the tight-knit community packed St. Rose of Lima Church and stood outside for a vigil for all of the victims.
Those residents held hands, lit candles, sang songs and spoke of the day's events.
Now with so many questions and so many of them still left unanswered, emotions are running high not only in Newtown, but across Connecticut, the United States and around the world.
"An investigation like this is a lot like a puzzle," Vance said. "Put it all together to get a complete picture so that everyone, without a doubt, can understand what occurred."
The main question - why?
State police said those that have died were removed from the school overnight and have since been brought to the Office of the Chief State's Medical Examiner where autopsies will be conducted to determine the manner and cause of death.
The scene at the school is still being investigated, and Vance said that process could take up to two days to complete. He said every corner of the building will be searched as well as the exterior of the building.
Vance said the outside of the building is just as important as what evidence is inside. He said every vehicle in the parking lot is part of the tragic investigation.
