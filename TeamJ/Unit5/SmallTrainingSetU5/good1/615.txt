			We're learning more about the gunman Adam Lanza and his family Saturday. 
Lone, shy, strange, awkward – those are just some of the words people who knew Adam describe him. 
We are now learning that while he didn't like people, he did like guns. Reportedly he went to shooting ranges with his mother. A loner turned mass murderer overnight. 
20-year-old Adam Lanza is described by those who knew him as a shy, awkward strange kid – yet intelligent. 
His aunt, Marsha Lanza, says his mother wouldn't have hesitated to get Adam mental help if she knew he was in trouble. 
"I know she had trouble with schools. She eventually wound up home schooling him because she battled with the school district in what capacity I'm not 100 percent certain if it was behavior if it was learning disabilities I really don't know. He was a very, very bright boy – he was smart," said Marsha Lanza. 
Although reports are now surfacing that he probably had emotional issues, no one ever dreamed he would kill his mother, Nancy Lanza. Then head to Sandy Hook elementary where he would massacre 20 children and six adults before turning one of his guns on himself. 
On behalf of Nancy's mother and siblings, we reach out to the community of Newtown and express our heartfelt sorrow for the incomprehensible and profound loss of innocence that has affected so many," said Mike Downing, Rockingham County Sheriff. 
Adam Lanza lived in an idyllic, well to do neighborhood in Sandy Hook. His mother was a teacher's aide at the school where the massacre took place.  
One of his young victims even lived on the same street, the same street now blocked off by police. 
Although strange, there are no reports that Lanza was ever violent. 
"Nice kid, good kid, he was definitely the challenge of the family in that house," said Marsha Lanza. "Every family has one. I have one. They have one but never in trouble with the law and never in trouble with anything."  
According to the New York Post, his mother took him to shooting ranges and sources say her firearms were used in the horrific killings of the children who ranged in age from five to 10-years-old. Sources say her guns were the ones used in the horrific killings.
Adam Lanza's parents divorced in 2009.
His father, Peter Lanza, was reportedly paying Lanza's mother a quarter of a million dollars in alimony. 
The father now resides in Stamford, Connecticut where neighbors there too are in shock.
