The White House said in a statement Obama will speak at a 7 p.m. EST Sunday interfaith vigil for families of the victims and other students from Sandy Hook Elementary School, which was attacked on Friday by a heavily armed gunman.


 In his weekly radio and internet address earlier on Saturday, Obama said it was time to "take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this." But he stopped short of specifically calling for tighter gun-control laws. (Reporting By David Alexander; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Eric Walsh)
