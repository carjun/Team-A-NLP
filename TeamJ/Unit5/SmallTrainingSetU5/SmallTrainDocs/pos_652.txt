New information on the Conn. school shooter is coming out of the shooter’s mother’s house. This is the home where she lived with her son, Adam Lanza, who killed 27 people on Friday including her, before taking his own life. Nancy Lanza was a survivalist and had stockpiled food and other survival supplies, as she believed the end of civilized society was near. According to the Daily Mail on Sunday, Dec. 16, 2012, Nancy Lanza thought the world’s financial economy was on the brink of collapse, leaving the world in a state of chaos.
It's reported that her obsession with guns was passed down to her son, Adam Lanza, and she taught him how to shoot. The bizarre findings of apocalypse preparations in their Newtown home leads to the possibility that Adam shared her same views, passed down to him from his mother, suggests Daily Mail today.
The Mayan Calendar is ending this week on Dec. 21, 2012, has many people preparing for  predictions of doomsday. Adam’s aunt was interviewed by the media this weekend and the Daily Mail describes what the aunt said in that interview. The website writes that the aunt said “Nancy Lanza was 'self-reliant' and indicated she was a 'prepper', or a person who prepares for Doomsday by learning essential survival skills - like how to shoot a gun.”
It sounds as if Adam was living in surroundings where his mother’s beliefs that doomsday is on the world’s doorstep had caused the two to prepare for this. Did this horrific shooting have something to do with the belief that doomsday is looming? The Mayan Calendar ends on Dec. 21, which the ancient Mayan people believed was the start of the apocalypse marking the end of the world. While the doomsday buzz online has some people getting ready for the Dec. 21 date, the Daily Mail is reporting that it is not clear if “Adam thought this was the case.”
