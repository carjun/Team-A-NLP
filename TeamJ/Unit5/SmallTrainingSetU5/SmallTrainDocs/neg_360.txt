NFL Network has learned the New York Giants will wear a decal on their helmets Sunday in memory of the lives lost in the tragic mass shooting at a Newtown, Conn. elementary school on Friday morning.
All Giants players will have the initials S.H.E.S. (Sandy Hook Elementary School) on the back of their helmets for their Week 15 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons.
The NFL has asked home teams to observe a moment of silent reflection prior to the national anthem before this weekend's games.
A gunman murdered 20 students and six adults before apparently killing himself at the elementary school in Newtown, a town approximately 60 miles northeast of New York City.
