Conn. school shooting victims identified










United Press International




Victims of the Connecticut grade school massacre have been positively identified by the state medical examiner, state police said.
State police spokesman Paul Vance said detectives likely will remain at the elementary school crime scene for the next couple of days and that investigators found "some very good evidence" that will help provide a fuller picture about the tragedy occurred Friday morning, CNN reported.
Police said the suspect, Adam Lanza, entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and killed 26 people -- 20 children and six adults -- then shot himself.
The body of Lanza's mother was found Friday in the home they shared. Investigators said they believe he shot her in the face and then went to Sandy Hook Elementary School.
Vance, during a morning news briefing Saturday, said the assailant "forced his way into the school."
Vance said investigators found valuable information at Lanza's home that they hope "will paint a complete picture of how and why."
Only one of the shooting victims survived, Vance said.
That person, who was shot in the foot, was in the hospital and would be interviewed by police Saturday, The New York Times reported.
"She will be instrumental in this investigation," Lieutenant Vance said.
The victims' bodies have been transported to the Office of the Chief State's Medical Examiner, where they will be examined to determine manner and cause of death, the Connecticut State Police said in release.
Lanza may have had access to at least five guns, a law enforcement official told CNN Saturday. Officials said previously three weapons were recovered from the school -- a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle in a car in the school parking lot, and two pistols found by Lanza's body.
CNN reported a member of Lanza's family told investigators he had a form of autism.
Also, a kindergarten teacher at Sandy Hook said the suspect's mother, Nancy Lanza, was not a teacher at the school, despite earlier reports that she was.
Former classmates describe Lanza as a shy child and teenager.
Kateleen Soy told the Hartford Courant she knew Lanza as a seventh-grader at St. Rose of Lima School in Newtown and later saw him in the halls at Newtown High School. She described him as "really painfully shy."
"I wanted people to know he wasn't always a monster," Soy said. "He became one, but he wasn't always that way."
Andrew Lapple said he was on the same Little League team and also sat next to Lanza in homeroom at the high school. He called Lanza a "tech-geek" with little talent for baseball.
"He was always carrying around his laptop holding onto it real tight," Lapple said. "He walked down the halls against the wall almost like he was afraid of people. He was definitely kind of strange, but you'd never think he'd do something like this."
The Newtown shooting is believed to be the second most deadly school shooting in U.S. history. In 2007, a student at Virginia Tech, Seung-hui Cho, killed 32 students and teachers and then killed himself.
VTV Family Outreach Foundation, in a statement, offered any help it could give to families in Newtown.
"The immediate concern we have is for those families in Newtown whose lives are now altered, forever," Joe Samaha, the foundation's president said. "From our VTV experience, as families of the victims and survivors of the April 16, 2007, massacre at Virginia Tech, we know that their loss is incredible. Helping all to deal with the aftermath will take a lifetime of love and dedication."
