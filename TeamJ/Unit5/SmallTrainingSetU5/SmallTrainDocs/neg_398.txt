						This tragedy is reverberating around the country on social media. Bianna golodryga has been tracking the latest. People are debating everything from possible motives from this madman to gun control. That's right. Good morning, elizabeth. There's no way to prepare yourself for suc a horrific tragedy. Especially when the victims are the most innocent and precious members of our society. As americans begin the painful conversation, trying to make sense of all of this, many taking to social media sites like facebook and twitter. From sorrow to outrage to complete shock. This morning, the massacre in newtown, connecticut, is sparking an impassioned dialogue across the country. It's horrible that such evil exists. But that's the nature of the world we live in, I guess. ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ Reporter: While americans clutched each other at candlelight vigils overnight, many celebrities took to social media to express their condolences. Among them maya angelou, who tweeted, our country is grieving, each child who has been slaughtered belongs to each of us. And each slain adult is a member of our family. It is impossible to explain the horror to ourselves and to our survivors. We need to hold each other's hands and to look into each other's eyes and say, I am sorry. In the wake of this tragedy, the american conversation also turned to gun control. How many more kids have to die before you guys say we w less guns not more? Reporter: Also speaking out is astronaut mark kelly, whose own wife, former congresswoman, gabrielle giffords was criticacritic critically wounded in a mass shooting two years ago. He posted on facebook, quote, the children of sandy hook elementary school and all victims of gun violence, deserve to have leaders who have the courage to engage in a meaningful conversation about gun laws. As a country, we can't wait. These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods. And these children are our children. Reporter: And michael bloomberg, who has long been outspoken about the need for stricter gun control laws also issued a statement. Saying, with all the carnage from gun violence in our country, it's almost impossible to believe that a mass shooting in a kindergarten class can ppen. It's come to that. Not even kindergartens learning THEIR As, Bs AND Cs, ARE SAFE. I'm sure this debate will continue. Right now, of course, obviously, the focus on the morning.
