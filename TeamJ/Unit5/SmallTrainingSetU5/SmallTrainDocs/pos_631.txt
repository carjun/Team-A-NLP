NEWTOWN, Conn. Dec 16 (Reuters) - The children who survived
Friday's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School will not have
to return to the scene of the massacre when school reopens later
this week and instead will attend classes in a neighboring
Connecticut town, Newtown school officials said on Sunday.It remains unclear when the 436 surviving students at Sandy
Hook will return to class, but when they do it will be in an
unused school about 7 miles (11 km) to the south in Monroe,
Newtown School Superintendent Janet Robinson said."The Town of Monroe has graciously offered their Chalk Hill
School," Robinson said in a statement. "This facility, which is
currently not being used, is in excellent condition and will
accommodate all of the Sandy Hill School students and staff."It is located just across the border from Newtown and
should be ready for occupancy in just a few days."All seven of Newtown's public schools, which serve more than
5,100 students, as well as private schools in the district, will
be closed on Monday, school officials said late on Saturday.Officials were scrambling for ways to accommodate surviving
students from what had been the town's largest elementary
school, serving 5- to 10-year-olds in kindergarten through
fourth grade. The public school remains an active crime scene.A Newtown police officer expressed doubt the school could
ever be used again."At this time it's too early to say. But I would find it
very difficult for them to do that. Certainly that's one of the
things they're going to have to look into," Lieutenant George
Sinko of the Newtown police said at a news conference on Sunday.Twenty Sandy Hook first graders were killed on Friday when a
20-year-old man armed with an assault weapon and two hand guns
shot his way into the school and opened fire.Six adults, including the school principal, were also killed
at the school. The gunman killed his mother and himself for a
total death toll of 28 people.In place of school on Monday, town officials said children
would be able to attend a day of recreational activities hosted
by local sports organizations at the Newtown Youth Academy, a
private athletic facility in town.All schools in the town other than Sandy Hook School will
reopen on Tuesday.

I think it would be in everyone’s best interest to not have school until the beginning of the year.  That way it gives parents the chance to get their children professional help to deal with this tragedy.
