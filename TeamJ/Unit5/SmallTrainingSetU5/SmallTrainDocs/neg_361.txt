It may not absolutely perfect for some tastes, but it's FREE. I use this everyday, especially at night when I use the sleep function and fall asleep to Sky's Relaxation or SmoothJazz stations for example. Only thing I'd like changed, is the favourites put into alphabetical order. Nothing more!! 4 stars, because there's maybe a little room for a more attractive interface. This of course will always be subjective. A Google User - November 24, 2012 - Samsung Galaxy S2 with version 6.7Stopped workingI love Tune In and never had a problem until now.

Does not work on samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0 or iphone 4 A Google User - November 23, 2012 - HTC Evo 4G with version 6.7Updates have made this app unreliable!This used to be a great app but within a year I have noticed stations dropping and about 75% of the time I listen to dead air instead of the station program. When browsing for stations I keep getting an error. Really disappointed with the updates. Used on an HTC EVO. A Google User - November 22, 2012 - EeePad Transformer TF300 with version 6.7Great appWell done guys great app. I use this for listening to radio 1 at night also good for listening to local radio due to the vast number of local stations bbc wm being my local. Only downside is the bbc do not allow you to listen to local football live matches online, nothing you can do about that. Great work!! Works on jelly bean. M Cervantes - November 30, 2012 - Version 6.7The Best Radio AppI have tried all the radio apps and this one is by far the best -- more variety, free international radio, and even "scanner" type channels.  Nobex is a very distant second to this app.  So far, no buffering problems, and no cut-offs.  I wish the timer was more than 2 hours, but that's my only criticism so far. Hank Du - December 7, 2012 - Version 6.7radio stops when screen offPlease fix the screen off radio would stop bug for jeally bean 4.2. I love this app on ios but the Android version clearly has not received equal amount of attention. A Google User - November 20, 2012 - Motorola Droid X with version 6.7Problems still!!!!!!After years of having this app the same complaint continues. If I select a fav. local station it constantly bounces me to what it thinks is a similar station. Come on already....why do I have to keep on going back and selecting "my" station for it to stay locked on???? Fix this and you get more stars. TuneIn Inc replied on November 20, 2012We're sorry the station you'd like to hear is doing this.  Our app is finding a similar station because the station you're trying to listen to is not available on our mobile applications due to the broadcaster's request.  We're always trying to improve the station forwarding features.A Google User - December 7, 2012 - Version 6.7Xoom 2Great app easy to use was really suprised with the great amount of content that can be accessed from this app, audio books, radio stations worldwide, talkshows and loads more a perfect app to have, small footprint and good interface Alex Saavedra - December 4, 2012 - Version 6.7INTERNAL DECODER ERROREvery time I load a station I get "internal decoder error." Worked fine, now it doesn't. What's NewWhat's in this version:* Sports fans rejoice. TuneIn has all Barclays Premier League games in English, Spanish and Mandarin.* Most college football bowl games, including the National Championship Game, are available. Just browse under “Sports” during game time.* We've made several minor updates to improve your everyday TuneIn experience.PermissionsThis application has access to the following:Your locationapproximate location (network-based)Allows the app to get your approximate location.
