Oakland school district issues community letter in response to Connecticut school shooting









 


CommentsComments(1)Comments()

|    E-mail|     PrintThe Oakland Unified School District has issued a letter to the school community, offering information to parents and teachers about how to talk to children about the school shooting that took place in Connecticut on December 14, and how to help children cope with anxiety and fear. The letter also addresses safety protocols within the school district here. With the district’s permission, Oakland North is reprinting it, with links at the end to resources geared for parents, students, teachers and other community members available on the school district’s website.
December 14, 2012
Dear Oakland Unified School District Parents and Staff,
We know that most of you heard about the tragic events which took place at a Connecticut school on Friday, December 14. Like you, we are devastated to learn of the many lives lost in this horrific shooting. We send our thoughts and condolences to the victims and their families and are sobered by the thought that so many children have been torn from their parents and this world in such a violent manner.
Our thoughts also turn inward as we reflect on the safety of our children here in Oakland and the violence that pervades many parts of this community. The massacre in Connecticut has aroused fears and questions about our readiness for such an event and our ability to counsel children as they cope with senseless death. Some parents have also requested advice on how to speak with children about this frightening development.
Please click through to Oakland North to read the rest of the letter.
