NEWTOWN, CT -- NBC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pete Williams is reporting that the alleged gunman in the shooting at a Connecticut elementary school had an altercation with staff members the day before the shooting. 
According to Williams, the alleged gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, argued with four staff members at the elementary school on Thursday. On Friday, Lanza forced his way into the school and opened fire, killing 26 people including 20 children. 
Among the dead, Williams says were three of the four staff members who confronted Lanza on Thursday. The four staff member was not at work on Friday at the time of the shootings. Police are now interviewing that person to try and gain more insight into the shooting.
