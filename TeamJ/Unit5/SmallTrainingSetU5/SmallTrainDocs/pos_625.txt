Coroner: Lanza Killed by Single Shot


Adam Lanza, the man who allegedly shot and killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, died from a single self-inflicted gunshot to the head, the coroner said Sunday. The govenor said Lanza committed suicide as the first responders closed in on the Newtown, Conn., elementary school—causing speculation Lanza had an even more deadly rampage planned. His mother, who was found dead at her Newtown home nearby, died from multiple gunshot wounds, the coroner said. The weapons found at the school were legally registered to Lanza’s mother, Nancy Lanza.
