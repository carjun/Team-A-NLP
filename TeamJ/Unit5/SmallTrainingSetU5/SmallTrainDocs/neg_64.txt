Huckabee: "We have systematically removed God from our
schools."

Sandy Hook School Shooting
Gun Control

Gun Rights
Second Amendment
Barack Obama




The former governor of Arkansas, Republican hopeful for
president, and Fox News host says we've got no reason to be
surprised when adult gunmen shoot up educational
establishments.

"We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we have
systematically removed God from our schools," Huckabee said on Fox
News, discussing the murder spree that took the lives of 20
children and 6 adults in Newtown, CT that morning. "Should we be so
surprised that schools would become a place of carnage?"


More here.
I don't doubt the governor's sincerity, but among other things,
he might want to think about the declining rate of school violence.
According to data compiled by the National Center for Education
Statistics, schools have been getting safer and less violent at
least over the past couple of decades - despite what Huckabee would
doubtless consider a period of rising godlessness. During the
school year of 1992-93, for instance, the number of on-location
murders of students and staff at 
K-12 public schools was 47 (out of population of millions). In
2009-2010 (the latest year for which data is listed), the number
was 25. Over the same period, 
the rate on victimizations per 1,000 students for theft dropped
from 101 to 18. For violent crimes, the rate dropped from 53 to 14.
And for "serious violent" crimes, the rate dropped from 8 to 4.
Next: It's never too late to blame George W.
Bush...

Can't they find a damn picture of the killer that isn't 7 years
old and makes him look like everybody's emotionally troubled young
nephew or cousin? This smacks of the Trayvon narrative framing.
Also,I've been repeatedly "scolded" by several people for
suggesting responsibility lies with the killer rather than our lack
of mental health funding and too strict civil commitment
procedures. I can't recall seeing so much sympathy for a profoundly
malevolent individual before. Acknowledging the existence of evil
is now somewhere between politically incorrect and socially
irresponsible.

I must note that directly ties into the left-wing conciet that
people can be programmed, with the proper amount of coercion, to be
'better' and that thus there must always be something the
all-knowing Leviathan could have done to stop this. These people
just hate acknowledging the fact that they are powerless in this
instance, it goes against everything they believe.

I think they only posted the Hit and Run teaser for the article
at first, so our comments were deleted when they removed it and
linked again to the main article.

I almost want to scream: Society and Our Nation didn't shoot Mom
in the face, drive to it's primary school alma mater and
deliberately, methodically and precisely* slaughter it's former
psychologist, 5 other faculty members, and 20 perfectly innocent
small children. Adam Lanza did.
(*Note how there are almost no non-fatal injuries)

What's the over/under on days for Obama to come out with some
"Executive Order" circumventing the Constitution and setting rigid
guidelines on handgun purchases? My guess is it's gonna come on the
21st and he'll call it something like a "Christmas Present for
America's Children" or some other such bullshit.

He could ban imports of any firearm by executive order. The ATF
can,at his urging, change some regulations administratively. I'm
not sure what all else can be done but I'm sure they are working on
it.
I'm much more concerned by the attempt of seemingly everyone
across the political and cultural spectrum to lay the
responsibility on anything and everything other than the
killer.

Yeah, and the courts defer to the legislative branch to pass a
remedy first.

For the few of you that took Nevada in the Reason Hit & Run
College Bowl Pick-Em, things are looking pretty good.
Oh, well Arizona finally got on the board. My hope is somewhat
restored.

Holy shit. That stadium they're playing in looks about as big as
some high school stadiums I've seen in SW Ohio.
Pathetic.
