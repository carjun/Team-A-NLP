'A well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state...' Please name the militia you belong to, and direct me to a website where I can see the regulations which define how you were licenced to carry a gun, how often you train, and how you ensure﻿ that the gun does not make its way into the hands of the untrained, the unlicenced, the unregulated or the mentally unwell.

Even trained police and military personnel panic in﻿ situations like that. Anyone who has seen any legitimate war footage would realise that instantly.

What the hell are you talking about? Any﻿ part of the United States constitution bar equal state suffrage in the Senate can be repealed or modified via amendment. I'm British and even I know about.

You don't care if psychopaths are armed? That's fucking stupid mate. This isn't the fucking matrix. You aren't some﻿ top shit cowboy. If a guy bursts into the room and opens fire it could very well be too late for you to do anything. People like you utterly fail to comprehend how intensely chaotic these situations are. The idea that some rambo type will just whip out a gun and kill the bad guys no problem is ridiculous. I don't know whether gun ownership is good or bad but your argument is trash.

unfortunately though, the news channels take advantage of it because they will get a spike in their ratings, which﻿ unfortunately is more important to them than actually fixing the problem, or at least trying to :(

Nope, he only used a form that you aren't familiar with. Check Wiki if you don't﻿ believe it.

I was just sitting in the lobby at Firestone while my tires were inspected. I had to endure CNN coverage﻿ of the CT shooting for nearly an hour, with no way to change the channel and nowhere else I could sit. In that span of time, CNN broke every single of the guidelines laid out in this video, and they were still doing it when I was finally allowed to leave.
