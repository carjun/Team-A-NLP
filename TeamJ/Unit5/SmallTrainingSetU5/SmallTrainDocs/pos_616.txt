President Obama will be attending an evening vigil in Newtown, CT., to honor the memories of those lost in the Sandy Hook shootings.
Obama's visit comes two days after Adam Lanza opened fire inside Sandy Hook, killing 26 people, including 20 children between the ages of five and nine and six adults.
Lanza was reported to have mental illness, including personality disorders, prior to the shooting. Lanza's mother, a substitute teacher at Sandy Hook, was among the first to be killed by Lanza. It was reported that Lanza knew prior to the shooting that he was going to do it and which classrooms he was going to enter, according to police
Sandy Hook recently underwent an upgrade to its security procedures in the months prior to the shooting that required that every visitor to the school register with the administration office and be buzzed in.
Obama's visit to Connecticut, which will be private, will include the families of the victims and emergency personnel who responded to the shootings. The vigil will be an interfaith vigil.

Obama previously made an emotional speech Friday regarding the shootings, speaking as both a parent and president. In Obama's weekly radio address, he declared that "every parent in America has a heavy heart with hurt" and that "it is time to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this."
For Obama, this is the fourth trip of his presidency to a community within the United States that was still grieving over a shooting in their area.
Last summer, Obama went to Aurora, Colorado, to console with people who went to a movie theater for a midnight showing of "The Dark Night", only to have some of them wind up killed over a crazed and violent shooter that dressed up as the Joker.
Not too long ago, a mall out in California experienced a crazed madman shooting up their mall. There were injuries in that incident, but investigators are calling it "a minor incident."
Lanza's parents owned four guns. Two of them were registered to the mother, who was among those killed at the school, and two were registered to the father.
Reporters initially reported that Adam Lanza's brother, Ryan Lanza, was the shooter. This was because Adam Lanza was carrying his brother's identification at the time of the shooting. Ryan Lanza was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.
The Sandy Hook shooting was the worst K-12 (grade school) tragedy in the nation's history, surpassing the Columbine tragedy. The worst school related tragedy (with respect to all types of schools) was the Virginia Tech tragedy, which killed 33 people in 2007, including the gunman.
The investigation into this matter is ongoing.
