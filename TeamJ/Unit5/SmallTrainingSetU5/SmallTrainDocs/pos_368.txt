Among the 26 victims are 7-year-old Ana Marquez-Green, the daughter of a well-known saxophone player; Emilie Parker; and Chase Kowalski, survived by his parents Rebecca and Steve.  Fifty-six-year-old school psychologist Mary Sherlach, 22-year-old first grade teacher Vicki Soto, and 47-year-old Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung are also among the dead. Erica Canfield, the parent of a fourth grader at Sandy Hook elementary school, spoke about Hochsprung's work with her children, who attended Sandy Hook elementary school.   "She was wonderful, she loved all the kids, always had a smile on her face, always in a good mood, made you feel at home when you were there," Canfield told Brennan. Connecticut state police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance confirmed that all of the victims were identified -- and their families notified -- by early Saturday morning.   © 2012 CBS Interactive Inc.
