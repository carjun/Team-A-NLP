NEWTOWN -- The mother of suspected Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza was shot multiple times in the head, the state's Chief Medical Examiner said Sunday.
An autopsy on Nancy Lanza was finished Sunday morning and her death has been classified as a homicide, said H. Wayne Carver II.
Sources have said Nancy Lanza was killed by her son Adam inside the home they shared in Newtown before the mass shooting at the school.
Carver said an autopsy was also completed Sunday on Adam Lanza, who died of a gunshot wound to the head. His death has been ruled as suicide.
Autopsies on the 26 victims who died inside the school -- six adults and 20 children -- were completed by Saturday. All died of gunshot wounds and their deaths have all been ruled as homicides. Carver said each of the victims were shot multiple times by a rifle.
State police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said  Sunday morning that investigators have found useful evidence as they attempt to understand why a heavily armed Lanza forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School, guns blazing, Friday morning.
"Our goal is to paint a picture so we all know and the public knows, what happened here," Vance told reporters. Vance said the "best of the best" federal, state and local investigators are working the case.
He also said that a number of social media hoaxes have been created, purporting to represent the shooter's views or to mimic the crime scene. Vance warned that the creators of those hoaxes may be criminally prosecuted.
Vance declined to release a timeline of the shooting or to detail what authorities know regarding the weapons used. He did say that the shooting scene was limited to "two classrooms and a hallway" in the school.
He also said that, contrary to earlier reports that only one person had been injured in the shooting and had survived, two individuals were injured.
