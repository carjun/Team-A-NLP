 EVERYWHERE guns have been banned, the crime rates go up and more innocent people die. All of these massacres are occurring where there are BANS on guns. This gives the evil person free range to commit murder. When guns are banned, the law abiding citizens turn them in and criminals keep them. This is a FACT. Do your research before you go around﻿ touting such nonsense based on nothing but your emotions.
Better yet, read More Guns Less Crime by John Lott, or just listen to him on YT.

Guns kill people the same way pencils misspell words. Get ready for the coming onslaught of knee-jerk,﻿ reactionary gun-grabbers who are never afraid to use a tragedy like this to blame guns as the cause, not the people who use them.

Being a teacher myself I feel so heartsore﻿ about the shooting, I wonder how I would handle it if it happened to me. Kaitlin you are an inspiration and you have real courage! My thoughts and prayers are for all the teachers, children and parents.

I'm wondering the same thing - that photo was gut-wrenching. If anyone has an update on the status of her sister, please post.﻿
