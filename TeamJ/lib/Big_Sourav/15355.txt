Spiders do not have moveable mouth parts. Defenestration is the act of throwing someone or something out of a window- see Defenestrations of Prague. These are just a few of the thousands of factoids that remain firmly lodged in the Liberry Lady section of my brain.When I retired in 2009, I had spent twenty five years working at the Information Desk of the City Of San Diegos Central Library. I was hired in the 1980s as an assistant librarian. I do not have a Masters in Library Science, which is required for librarian status- hence Liberry Lady or Ms.Information. The old card catalogs were being phased out and it would be close to a decade before computers became available to staff and patrons. That means that I had the good fortune of initially learning to use print resources to answer your questions and that I was there when the first wave of computer technology- no world wide web, no email- was introduced to staff and patrons.6 commentsRead the full article Annas Video Pick  Tyger!January 2, 2011Check out this tyger on the prowl through the nighttime streets and hillsides of Sao Paulo. His roars awaken the teeming natural world that exists unseen beneath the surface of the city.

D in November. Also throw in reduced Fire and Police services, which also concerns us, if D doesnt pass.Last month Mayor Sanders announced that the City was facing a $72Million budget deficit in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011. As you all know, yearly and sometimes twice a year budget reductions have been going on for a long time- four years in fact. 10 commentsRead the full article Are we there yet? The long road to equality for women..September 29, 2010Feminism is doomed to failure because it is based on an attempt to repeal and restructure human nature.  What I am defending is the real rights of women. A woman should have the right to be in the home as a wife and mother. Phyllis SchlaflySchlaflys discussion reveals a paradox. She was able to have it all: family and career. And she did it by fighting those who said they were trying to get it all for her.

On hand for us as witnesses were Anna Daniels- a former City librarian  and her hubby Rich Kacmar toting a camera. Anna filed the following observations:_________To be honest, I never thought Id live long enough to see a much needed new central library in this city. The City Council gave the green light last month to its construction but it wasnt until we were all invited to this mornings groundbreaking that I felt it was truly going to happen.22 commentsRead the full article Want to talk outrage? Heres how Halliburton screwed my brother.July 17, 2010You want to talk outrage? How about this one: My brother Jack showed me a letter he received from Halliburton via his lawyer. Yes- that Halliburton. It appears that Halliburton has declared bankruptcy. And because they have declared bankruptcy, they will only be required to pay out pennies on the dollar in the settlement of my brothers suit.Two years ago my brother was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare and deadly kind of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos.6 commentsRead the full article Youve got to be kidding Mayor Sanders called me at home and left me a personal message! Oh, by the way  No on Prop D!June 1, 2010I started listening to the messages on the answer machine and whose voice did I hear but Mayor Jerry Sanders, asking me to Vote yes on Proposition D, that personable, avuncular voice reminding me that the Strong Mayor form of government in San Diego is the only hope for digging us out of our financial mess and righting all the wrongs of City Hall over the past decades. Really?Number 1, I hate robo-calls. Number 2, the Strong Mayor from of government sucks, and I say that having lived through a less than perfect City Manager form of government for most of the thirty years that I have resided in San Diego.17 commentsRead the full article Listening to Nina Simone After Listening to Rand PaulMay 23, 2010Last performance today  Sunday at 4pm.A few nights ago I saw a premiere presentation of Nina: A Portrayal of the Life and Music of Nina Simone in an intimate theater setting in North Park.

Arizona wants to be as bad-ass as secessionist threatening Texas, although the Zonies themselves are smart enough to not want to actually spend time in Texas, preferring to use their get out of hell card to hang out on a California beach during the summer. Arizonas approach to comprehensive immigration reform in all of its reducto ad absurdum is a mere two words- racial profiling. Keep it classy, Arizona!Racial profiling is as American as apple pie and throughout the history of this great country of ours, 12 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
