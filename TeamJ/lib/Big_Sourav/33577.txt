Cons: Dark, morose, depressing music.  The Bottom Line: Lets hope Breakaway is a phase, and not the direction all of Kellys music will take in the future.  There are two over-riding themes on Kelly Clarksons latest album Breakaway: agonizing heartbreak and heavy metal, both of which should be taken in small doses. Now I like Kelly oh-so-cute Clarkson, and I love her voice, I just wish I could have heard more of it on this album. After listening to this album in its entirety I came away depressed and with a splitting head ache.   Its not the lyrics in the songs that I take umbrage with; indeed most of the tracks (some written by Ms. Clarkson, most notably Hear Me) on Breakaway are wonderful expressions of human angst, and I do appreciate angst. Its more the gloomy, pounding, shrieking, electric guitar-laden, in-your-face music that accompanied these lyrics that I have a problem with. Almost every track on this very dark album screams at the top of its musical lungs: look at me; Im hurting, my heart has been shattered, broken, callously tossed aside and I want the whole world to know!   One reviewer on Amazon.com wrote of Breakaway: Kelly Clarkson could have played her American Idol-propelled career much differently, languishing in the role of dippy ingnue or shunting her musical development by leaning too heavily on overnight stardom. Instead she dug in her heels and allowed good sense (or a good manager) to steer, and somewhere Simon Fuller and the rest of the TV gang ought to be smiling. Credit Breakaway, which couldn't be more aptly titled--the sophomore effort represents a seismic split from the thin if pretty debut, Thankful.  While I agree that in Breakaway Kelly Clarkson makes a seismic split from her previous debut album, I do not agree that the 180 degree turn was a course she should have plotted willingly. Throughout most of Breakaway Kellys voice is lost in the thunder of heavy metal tom-toms that accompanies it. And the human voice for some is an instrument onto itself and deserves to be nurtured and heard in all of its beautiful renditions. After listening to Breakaway I have to wonder, is this really Kelly Clarkson, or is this the record companys attempt to brand her, to cast her in a mold far different from her contemporaries?   Breakaway begins beautifullyand promisingenough with the title track Breakaway penned in part by angst filled rocker Avril Lavigne. This track however, is but the calm before the musical maelstrom that is about to overtake the listener. The very next track, Since U Been Gone begins the hard rock inspired racket that lasts for pretty much the rest of the album. Ms. Clarkson proceeds to belt out song after torturous song about broken hearts and barren souls accompanied by music that would no doubt make Vincent Price smile if he were alive; the mood is dark and the overall effect, miserable and smothered in layers of gloom.   That is not to say that I did not enjoy some of the songs, but those where Kellys voice was allowed to take center stage are few and regretfully far between. Ms. Clarkson is at her best when the musical duet is a decibel or two lower then her very powerful and beautiful voice. Track no. 4 Because of You shines in this regard. The words will no doubt resonate with many women who feel diminished by a relationship with a person content to them feel small in order to be fulfilled. Another song in this vain is track no. 7, Where is Your Heart.   Track No. 11 Hear Me is a beautifully penned ballad about the emptiness of loneliness, partially written by Ms. Clarkson herself. In reading the words one has to wonder if this deeply spiritual woman is speaking to God, or some would be suitor. Whatever the case the lyrics lose some of their appeal because of the musical cloths they are forced to wear; i.e. more of the same hard rock wrappings that bury some many of the songs on this album in harshness. I cant help but think that this song who be so much more meaningful to me if the word had been given more of the stage.   But perhaps I am missing the central point of the music; and that is to punctuate the lyrics with the darkness only this type hard rock can convey. I understand the direction, but I do not want to follow, not on every song. Music should (occasionally) uplift.   Breakaway concludes with a gorgeous live rendition of Beautiful Disaster from Kellys first album. On this live recording Kellys voice is at its best, infused as it is with emotive soul and accompanied by just a piano. This is music at it finest, but it does not make up for the dismal nature of the rest of the CD. Hopefully, Kelly Clarksons next album will be more balanced, more nuanced, more neutral, because I am still a fan, and I want to worship at the alter of Kellys voice. Lets hope Breakaway is a phase, and not the direction all of Kellys music will take in the future.

I'm so glad I bought this one.We all know Kelly has a powerhouse voice, but this CD shows that her talent has staying power. I have only listened to the CD all the way through 2 or 3 times so far, but I have liked nearly everything I have heard, and I like that there is some variety in the tempo.

Her debut 'Thankful' is good, but her follow-up is even better. On her first C.D. she showed she could master a variety of pop forms, but in some ways it was still a try-out. Here she showcases her ability to perform pop music fluidly and with great power. The singles are her best material, but the other songs, while usually not as great, are never filler.

She solely deserves all those awards she had rack up last year. Kelly has a lot of honesty on this album. She really put herself out there on songs like "Because Of You." I thought this album would be fill with typical ballads but Kelly has managed to do what I thought was impossible. She's impressed me and made me love her voice even more! Kelly had more than proven her vocal capabilities  more                                Comment                                Compliments (12)                review by MichaelN.March 04, 2006posted in Music MattersExcellent!I usually hate the contest shows on tv and do not watch them at all. Kelly Clarkson has gone way beyond anything that I thought could come out of one of those shows. The tracks Since You've Been Gone and Breakaway make the CD worth getting. The rest of the CD is excellent and shows that Kelly is probably one of the top female performers that will have staying power.

"Breakaway" is just that, a new direction for a very talented artist. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of stuff here for fans of her days on "American Idol" and her "Thankful" album. Clarkson provides for this in tunes like "Because Of You," "Where Is Your Heart" and "Beautiful Disaster." But the real gems here are her edgier tunes like "Breakaway," "Addicted" and "I Hate Myself For Losing You."

Most of these on the songs on this album are about different aspects of falling in love or breaking up with someone, but I enjoyed it anyway. My favorite song is the title track. It is a great song about asserting your own independence and living your own life. I have loved this song ever since it appeared on Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack this past summer. The other hit on this album is the song Since You Been Gone. It is a song about moving on with  more                                Comment                                Compliments (12)                review by brittpinkie.March 22, 2005Kelly Breaks Away From Idol With Her Sophomore ReleasePros: The songwriting is a lot better here than on Thankful, the material is more mature Cons: The album can come off as depressing at times (read review) The Bottom Line: Breakaway is a great departure from Thankful, but a good one.

CreditBreakaway, which couldn't be more aptly titled--the sophomore effort represents a seismic split from the thin if pretty debut,Thankful. Here we encounter Clarkson as superstar, with the humility that made her likable on the first disc tucked tightly under her arm. First single and leadoff track "Breakaway" topped the pop charts on arrival, and its rock-friendly thumps, dips, and rolls don't wear out their welcome. Instead,they blend into the firestorm of beats and guitars that is "Since U Been Gone," another shout-it-out rocker. Those songs set the tone for the rest of the disc in all its fury: The innocence is long gone, "Addicted" and "Hear Me" say. The big, expressive voice ringed by the occasional high-pitch trill--the one that prompted millions to get behind her onIdol--doesn't dip entirely off the radar, though. On "Where Is Your Heart" and the stunning live closer "Beautiful Disaster," it's there in full force--a hint, maybe, that despite the wide, smart career stepBreakawayrepresents, her fans come first.-Tammy La Gorce            view wiki  TagsMusic, Pop, Rock And Pop, Albums, 2000s, Kelly Clarksonsee all  DetailsLabel:                               RCAArtist:                               Kelly ClarksonGenre:                               PopRelease Date:                               November 30, 2004First to ReviewRobertYokoyama"Breakaway is an excellent CD"MoviesBooksMusicFoodTv ShowsTechnologyPoliticsVideo GamesParentingFashionGreen LivingAll TagsAbout LunchPressFAQsContact UsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySitemapReport Abuse 2011 Lunch.com, LLC All Rights ReservedLunch.com - The Best Consumer Reviews Online()Follow MeThis is you!
