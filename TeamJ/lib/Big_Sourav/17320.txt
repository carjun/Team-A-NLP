Since 1983, VFW Outpost 1392 at 4944 Newport Avenue has served as a refuge.  Its not much.  Its a small storefront facing an alley.  The inside is not fancy; a big screen HDTV, a pool table, and your usual assortment of stools and tables (all handmade by Outpost members).There is nothing fancy about the dcor.  .24 commentsRead the full article OB Town Council Report: Further Fire Department and Lifeguard Cutbacks LoomOctober 28, 2010Representatives from the San Diego Fire Department appeared at the OB Town Council meeting last night to give their grim report on the state of San Diegos emergency service providers.  And for the first time San Diegans will start to see noticeable cuts in the departments ability to serve the community.San Diego Fire Chief Jeff Carle and Lifeguard Chief Rick Wurts delivered the bad news in a detailed report describing exactly how we got here, what further cuts are likely in the near future, and how it will affect Ocean Beach and beyond.9 commentsRead the full article The Scary Thing About the Tea PartyOctober 25, 2010by Andy Cohen / The Politics of Football / October 22, 2010Allow me to start off this post by rehashing a little thing called the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assmeble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.15 commentsRead the full article Busby and Bilbray Square Off in Raucous DebateOctober 19, 2010Democratic and Republican candidates dominate debateDemocratic challenger Francine Busby took to the stage last night to take a few proverbial swings at Republican incumbent Congressman Brian Bilbray for their first and only scheduled debate.  A standing room only, bitterly partisan crowd gathered in the Del Norte High School Performing Arts Center in 4S Ranch to see the event and cheer on their candidate.  It was a scene more befitting a highly charged college basketball game than a political debate, with only slightly less decorum than a kindergarten classroom.It was a microcosm of just how sharply divided this county, and country, really are.6 commentsRead the full article The Agenda of NoOctober 8, 2010Strange are the times we live in. Never has this nation been in more desperate need of cooperation, but never before has this nation been so completely and totally divided (at least not in my lifetime). The November 2nd midterm elections are upon us, and they are sure to profoundly shape the immediate future of the United States, both politically and economically.So what can we expect to see if the Republicans manage a coup?18 commentsRead the full article Independent Steve Gronke could knock longtime County Supervisor Bill Horn offSeptember 28, 2010by Andy CohenSteve Gronke wants your vote, North County.  The 10 year veteran of the Vista City Council has changed course and mounted a thus far successful challenge to 16 year incumbent, Bill Horn, for the 5th District seat on the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.  The once dark horse candidate surprised the experts in last Junes primary and forced a runoff for November 2.But the race isnt over yet.  And Gronke hopes to finish the job and bring some new blood and ideas to the County government.  Gronke is the rarest of political figures in todays hyper-partisan environment. 10 commentsRead the full article Boxer and Fiorina Square Off in Debate for Senate SeatSeptember 2, 2010Last night (9/01/10)  California got its firstand onlyscheduled chance to see its 2010 Senatorial candidates square off in a debate.  Incumbent Barbara Boxer, seeking a fourth term as the Junior Senator from California, met her Republican opponent and harsh critic, millionaire Carly Fiorina at St. Marys College in Moraga.  It was our first, and likely our last, opportunity to compare the two candidates positions on the issues that will matter most to Californians now, in these deeply turbulent economic times, and well into the future.7 commentsRead the full article More Observations from the Doctors Tea PartyAugust 11, 2010Editor: Here are Andys observations and more photos of the doctors tea party held last Saturday  (08/07/10) at Spanish Landing near downtown San Diego. He did find that the Birther movement is still alive here in San Diego.by Andy Cohen / The Politics of Football / August 10, 2010Im not sure what I expected to see when I dared to venture into enemy territory. I mean, I knew that, generally speaking, the Tea Partiers vision of America was not firmly based in reality; that they typically harbor a longing for a simpler time, and the old days, and their theories on the economy and politics and health care tend to be more theory and less actual, workable policy. And I know unequivocally that should the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party gain any real power in America then were all in for a long, slow descent into third world status.32 commentsRead the full article Ocean Beach Planning Board refuses to loosen building restrictionsAugust 5, 2010by Andy Cohen / Special to the OB RagIt was a setup. The city planners sent a somewhat green representative to the packed Ocean Beach Planning Board meeting to discuss the easing of building restrictions in Ocean Beach. The poor woman was apparently not aware of the voracity with which residents of OB are willing to protect the unique character and lifestyle they have enjoyed for decades in the rather eclectic neighborhood.  The room was filled with such residents.Amanda was sent in to discuss the City of San Diego Planners proposal to raise the floor area ratio (FAR) from the current standard of .7 in Ocean Beach to .9, or the current San Diego city standard of 1.2.Floor area ratio is defined as the total covered area of all floors of all buildings on a particular plot of land. 3 commentsRead the full article Playing Politics With Deficits and DebtAugust 2, 2010by Andy Cohen / The Politics of Football / July 30, 2010So according to unconventional wisdom, when a Republican resides in the White House, deficits dont matter one iota. But the instant a Democrat moves in, the budget deficit becomes the single greatest threat to American society since the War of Independence; the absolute bane of our existence.How strange, then, that Republican economic policies have the effect of increasing the budget deficit, while Democratic policies have tended to decrease the level of deficit, or even result in a budget surplus. Yet Republicans in Congress would like us to believe that they have just the remedies necessary to stamp down that pesky deficit and cut our national debt!So with the 2010 midterm elections fast approaching, lets try to get an idea of what might happen should Republicans retake majorities in the House and Senate, and what they would do to change our economic course.10 commentsRead the full article FAIR and Arizona SB 1070July 7, 2010by Andy Cohen/ The Politics of FootballAttorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice on Tuesday announced their intentions to file suit against the State of Arizona and Governor Jan Brewer over SB 1070 that Brewer signed into law in April. Setting immigration policy and enforcing immigration laws is a national responsibility. Seeking to address the issue through a patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than it solves, Holder cited as among the many reasons to overturn the state law.But SB 1070 isnt just a bad law; its a racist law with distinctly racist roots. SB 1070 was written and promoted with an enormous helping hand from FAIR (Federation for American Immigration Reform), an anti-immigration lobbying organization with a far right-wing agenda that has been deemed an immigration hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.10 commentsRead the full article Credibility: Darrell Issas ProblemJune 29, 2010by Andy Cohen/ The Politics of FootballIf you would like to know just exactly whats wrong with Washington these days, look no further than Darrell Issa, the Representative of the 49th district in North San Diego County.
