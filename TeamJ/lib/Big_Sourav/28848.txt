The ancient Greeks and Romans mentions them as the 'fruit of the gods' or Diospyros and mostly displayed on ancient mosaic floors in temples, synagogues, and in private homes.It was written that the Jewish scholars believes it was the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden, is it truly the 'Fruit of the Gods' or Diospyros? The word Diospyros means 'the fruit of the gods' in ancient Greek.Pomegranate is a perennial tree and grows best in torrid places. In ancient times, it was cultivated throughout Armenia or in the Caucasus or Caucas, Azerbaijan, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and North India and in some parts of Southeast Asia, tropical Africa and in Malaysia. Believed origin is from the Middle East and Asia. The pomegranate fruit is also known by the name Granada or the Chinese apple. According to reports, Spanish settlers introduced the pomegranates in Latin America and in California in the 17th century. Today, the fruit is mostly grown in India, Africa and the United States: California and Arizona.The Pomegranate fruit is round in shape. Inside the fruit are edible seeds bright-red, pink or purple in color, beautifully and heavily arranged inside its hard, leatherette outer cover or shell. The size can be as big as 6-10 cm in diameter and weighs about 200gm a fruit, tallest height of the tree is 8m high.Certain race believes, Pomegranate is a symbol of abundance, fertility and good luck. In some parts of Asia, bringing some pomegranates as gift during House blessing or new house warming brings fortune, wealth and happiness to its owners. To them, pomegranates continue to be a motif for prosperity and affluence. Motif means a decorative applique design or figure. Theme or motive, the synonyms. An acquaintance of mine who reads the Qur'an, has said that the Qur'an mentions pomegranates twice as examples of good things. God creates and grows in the gardens of paradise.Different nations or countries embrace the fruit differently for instance Vietnam, they called thch lu and the pomegranate flower is the symbol of summer. The Spaniards, pomegranate is the symbol and heraldic device of the city of Granada in Andalusia. It represents fertility and abundance in marriage in Armenia . In Turkey, it is the official logo of many cities. Mexico, pomegranate seeds is an essential ingredient of chiles en nogada, a food that symbolizes the red component of its national flag.UK, London, history reveals that from 1485 to1536, the pomegranate fruit was an emblem in the coat of arms of Catherine of Aragon  widow of Prince Arthur and King Henry VIII's first wife. Catherine of Aragon from Spain, has two marriages. She married Prince Arthur on 14 November 1501 at Old St. Paul's Cathedral, London. When Arthur died, married to King Henry VIII on June 11,1509 at Franciscan Church, Greenwich and was dissolved in 1533, due to her failure not having a son or a male heir for England. So Henry, the King married Anne Boleyn and made her the Queen. Anne Boleyn's first decree designates a new coat of arms, showing a white falcon pecking at a pomegranate. Catherine died on January 7, 1536, as Princess Dowager, not Queen of England. She was buried at Peterborough Abbey or Peterborough Cathedral.In Kandahr or Qandahr, second largest city of Afgahnistan, with 450,000 populations and the capital of Kandahar province has been famous for its high quality pomegranates.Today,s world market, pomegranates are highly respected for its nutrition values.
