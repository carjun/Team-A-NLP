The American Renaissance group is a pro white publication. Jared Loughner, who is accused of killing six people and shooting at Congresswoman Gabrielle Gliffords, injuring 12 others, is reported to be linked (directly or indirectly) to the American Renaissance group. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the American Renaissance group is a "white nationalist" group that is led by "a kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old". The American Renaissance group's ideology is formed around anti-government, anti-immigration, anti-Semitic and anti-ZOG (Zionist Occupational Government) sentiments and values. The Department of Homeland Security memo states that there is "no direct connection" between Loughner, but strong suspicion is directed at the American Renaissance group.        1 of 14         Renaissance Group      Claire87 is based in San Francisco, California, United States of America,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (87.7%) Canada (4.7%) United Kingdom (2.8%) Pakistan (1.9%) 2 other countries (0.9%)           READ MORE: American Renaissance, Arizona shooter, Jared Loughner, disasters-news, Seattle, Nationalism, white nationalism, Zionism, Zionist Occupation Government, antisemitism, sociology, Racism, ethics, political-news, social issues, Renaissance Group, Gabrielle Gliffords   More News From: Seattle :  WA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Arizona gunman Jared Loughners yearbook photo By: carltonbanks      Alleged gunman Jared Loughner who shot Rep.
