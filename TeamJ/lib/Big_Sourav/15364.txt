He is crazy and evil  a word not used enough, Mr. Erickson writes. The guy is very clearly not of the tea party movement, not a Dittohead, not led by Sarah Palin, me, or anyone else on the right.He adds: But the media, at least as of this morning and its accumulated coverage so far on this matter, could not care less. The media is intent on yet again exploring right-wing rhetoric and tea party hate. Left-wingers yesterday were falling all over themselves to blame everyone on the right for the horrific shooting.Jack Shafer, writing in Slate, agrees with Mr. Erickson that the political rhetoric is not to blame.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Media, Other Things, Politics, Updates, Womena leading conservative blogger, conservatives, Erick Erickson, RedState.com, Shooter being tied to the political right, Tucson shooting rhetoricRead moreRep.

Michele Bachmann (R-MN)Report: Bachmann Considering Run For President!Could it be  could Rep.Michele Bachmann (R-MN), the darling of the Tea Party right who has claimed to get her political marching orders directly from God, emerge as a sensational new entry into the presidential race?ABC News reports:A source close to the three-term congresswoman said Bachmann will travel to Iowa this month for multiple meetings to seek advice from political forces there and party elders close to the caucus process before coming to a final decision regarding a potential presidential run. Bachmann, a native of Waterloo, Iowa, also is set to deliver a keynote speech at an Iowans for Tax Relief PAC fundraiser Jan. 21 in Des Moines, Iowa.Nothing is off the table, Bachmann chief of staff Andy Parrish told ABC News when asked whether the Iowa trip signaled Bachmanns intent to run for president.

When a story in one of these subject areas creeps to the top of my Twitter feed, Im pretty much ready to shut the Internet off, go out for a long walk, and call it a day. Subjects like these are prone to hyperbole and hysteria, and it may be next to impossible to have a rational political conversation until the news cycle has run its course.We pretty much never write about Israel  I mean, literally, weve never published an article on it. We do sometimes address media bias  an interesting subject that people say mostly uninteresting things about  but its not our main beat. Race, on the other hand, is a subject thats a little more central to understanding the behavior of the electorate, and so we cant entirely avoid it.Nevertheless, the race conversation is often counterproductive. Its not that the issuecantbe talked about intelligently  but as a matter of fact, it usually isnt; none of us were made any the wiser by the Shirley Sherrod incident, certainly.I therefore thought it was worth doing some investigation into just who is responsible for driving the obsession with race and racism. Is the new media primarily responsible for propagating the conversation, as opposed to traditional news outlets? Are partisan sites more responsible than non-partisan ones?The basis of my study is a count of how many times various websites mentioned the terms racism, racial or racist in the past 30 days, out of the fraction of all articles they published, according to a search onGoogle News. For instance, 132 of 5752 stories in the Los Angeles Times used one of the three terms above, or 2.3 percent.A site was included in the analysis if (i) it is currently in theMemeorandum Top 100  these are the sites that drive the coverage in the political blogosphere; (ii) its contents are contained in Google News; (iii) it had published at least 100 articles in the past 30 days, and (iv) the Google News hits did not consist disproportionately of wire stories which had been republished, which knocked out a few otherwise-eligible websites like the Washington Examiner and Salon. This left me with a sample size of 59.I then classified the websites according to three criteria:New Media versus Old Media.Politics Focus.Liberal, Conservative or Neutral.More( You know Nate.. the piece IS LONG)Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Politics, Updatesconservatives, Liberals and racism 'conversations', Media, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight, PoliticsRead moreSE on RedStateagain..Part 5..February 15, 2010jamesb101No commentsFrom SERedStates Erick Erickson Opens His Big MouthAGAIN-Part 5Not one day goes by where Erickson doesnt show us his false-Conservatism. This time, throughthe most idiotic post Ive seen yet:Another day another story about Oxedine that should give voters pause.Last May, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that two Rome, Ga. insurance companies  State Mutual Insurance Co. and Admiral Life Insurance Co.  sent checks to the 10 PACS. The insurance companies are both headed by the same CEO, Delos Dee Yancey III. The PACs are administered by the son of Donald V. Watkins, the head of the bank who also sits on the board of both insurance companies. The bank also once was co-owned by Yanceys father.Most of the PACs had little or no money in their accounts before the infusion of cash.Once the payments were made from the insurance companies, the PACs each sent $12,000  a total of $120,000  to Oxendines campaign. The money was all sent in the same amounts and on the same dates from all the PACs.The banks that handled the accounts have been subpoenaed by the State Ethics Commission, but as they are in Alabama, they are refusing to honor the subpoenas. Now the Attorney General will probably get involved and ask a court in Alabama to have the banks honor the subpoena request.This will just keep this story alive to keep clubbing the Ox.I get that Georgia Primary voters know Ox more than most of the other candidates because hes been kissing their butts since 1994. Its not them Im worried about. Its the non-primary voters who can quickly see through the pandering veneer into what a reckless politician he is.Hopefully primary voters will be smart enough to see the danger and reject Oxendine. The best thing that could happen to the Georgia GOP is to see the end of Oxendines political career.Unless a subpoena comes from the same state as the Insurance Companies are in, they dont have to turn over any information. And I dont see the problem in Businesses giving money to the PACs of their choice. This is just nonsense manufactured by the radical left and neo-cons like Erickson. I am comforted that Georgia Primary voters know Ox more than most of the other candidates because of his selfless public service since 1994. Its not them Im worried about. Its the non-primary voters who can quickly be influenced by Lefties and Neo-Cons that they dont see what an honorable politician he is. Hopefully, primary voters will be smart enough to see the BS the progressives are manufacturing and vote Oxendine. The best thing that could happen to the Georgia GOP is to see Oxendines election to the Governorship.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Media, Men, Politics, Updatesconservatives, Erick Erickson, PoliticalDogs SE posts, RedState, SE @ PoliticalDogRead moreSE on RedStateand false Conservatives.February 14, 2010jamesb101No commentsFrom SEMany Republicans are outraged following the discussion ban of the eligibility question imposed yesterday by the Editor-in-Chief of Redstate.com, a leading Republican News Blog published from Washington, D.C.Eric Erickson justified his action in a post entitled, Vigilance: Im Banning Birfers, Truthers, and Groups Affiliated Therewith for the following reasons:We must be vigilant. We must be willing to draw a line in the sand and stand against fatuous nonsense that opens up the right to attacks by a left-leaning media intent on embarrassing the good people who have developed through the tea party movement a renewed sense of civic involvement.Birfers and Truthers have no place among us. And they are most decidedly not welcome at RedState.Erickson is evidently that kind of Republican who believes politics needs a sort of Inquisition-like approach, ever- vigilant for political heretics, and sees his duty as requiring him to ban them from exercising their free speech on constitutional issues.While Im not a Truther or even a Birther by any stretch of the imagination, I think this shit is outrageous because this is a blatant violation of free speech rights. They can disagree with them, but banning them for what they think is pretty much no different than the old German Regime. Alas, knowing RedState, theyre going to start banning Libertarians, Oxendine supporters, etc because they disagree with them. I heard one person say that she tried to post her opinion on RedState, but it was removed because Erick disagreed with it. WTF!!!??? I think the false Conservatives totalitarian bigots at Redstate need to be starved of attention. Of course, in doing this, these false Conservatives, along with the Liberals, are sinking their own ship in the process, and if it brings about civil debate and real Conservative values to the table, Im happy.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Other Things, Politics, Updatesconservatives, Erick Erickson, PoliticalDogs SE posts, RedState, SE @ PoliticalDog, sensorshipRead moreGOP Litmus test?What Litmus Test?January 30, 2010jamesb101No commentsFrom PolticalWire.Republicans Dismiss Purity ResolutionThe RNC avoided a potentially embarrassing resolution that would have given the party an ability to impose sanctions on candidates who do not follow key elements of the GOP platform, a move that would have shone a spotlight on some of the partys best recruits, according to The Hotline.GOPers meeting in Honolulu this week unanimously said the party is in good shape to make big electoral gains this year, but many worried that the proposed resolution could highlight differences between conservatives and several more moderate contenders.
