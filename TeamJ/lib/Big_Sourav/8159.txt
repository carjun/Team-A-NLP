Quagmires dont just go away. However, the signs are everywhere that the American course in that nation is doomed, that those directing this forlorn attempt at occupation of a country that has never tolerated occupation know there is no positive end in sight, and that the locals from President Hamid Karzai to the competing warlords and the Taliban are cutting their own deals on the assumption that our wishes no longer matter.0 commentsRead the full article Aging with the University of ArizonaOctober 29, 2010I recently enjoyed the honor of a lifetime: addressing the University of Arizonas Class of 60 with my take on our times at our alma mater. My classmates and I showed up brimming with youth and Rhythm and Blues and Rock and Roll, more than ready to Go! Go! Wildcats!

NoI am looking for the elusive all nighter. You know, the full night sleep without the blasted helicopters waking me up as they search the seas for drug runners, or illegals.I mean a full night sleep without someones security alarm beeping when they go out to their car to retrieve something at 2:00am. I dont understand why the bartender neighbor down the street MUST have his stereo blaring when he comes home from work night  no morning  after morning.19 commentsRead the full article Homeless Task Force: 8.6% increase in County HomelessnessOctober 28, 20108.6% increase in County Homelessness and additional regional homeless trends discussedSan Diego, CA  The Regional Task Force on the Homeless (RTFH) released its annual Regional Homeless Profile on Tuesday, October 26.

The first was the outrageous shooting death of a gay hired dancer  Steven Hirschfield  by Harbor Patrol cops in July 2008.   He was shot in the back by officers when they tried pulling in out of the water after he had jumped into the Bay from the cruise ship he was on.The second settlement stems from an incident that occurred at a Francine Busby fund-raiser in North County in June of 2009 when a deputy sheriff, supposedly responding to a noise complaint, ended up pepper-spraying a number of guests.1 commentRead the full article Watch Terriers while you still can  5 more reasons to see it October 27, 2010Its an unfortunate fact that often the most creative, highest-quality shows on TV struggle to find enough viewers to survive. Thats whats happening right now with FXs new private-eye series, Terriers. Its hands-down the best new series of the fall, yet no ones watching. That has to change  come on people, dont let this be one of those shows you discover on DVD a year from now and go Huh, this is great, why didnt I watch this back before it got canceled?Cancellation is where Terriers is headed unless it can show improvement in the ratings by seasons end.

I talked with literally thousands of new and infrequent voters over the phone and knocked on hundreds of doors in neighborhood that usually get taken for granted during electoral campaigns. Multiply those numbers by the dozens of volunteer and paid campaigners who have opted to follow the path less traveled and what emerges is a campaign strategy full of possibilities not included in the conventional approaches to electioneering.1 commentRead the full article With President Obama on his show and rally set for Saturday, Jon Stewart takes center stage.October 27, 2010Editor: With President Barack Obama scheduled to appear on Jon Stewarts Daily Show tonight  Wednesday, Oct. 27th (PDT: 11:00 pm Channel 48) and with Stewart and Stephen Colberts rally set for this Saturday, Oct. 30th in Washington, DC  where tens of thousands are expected to gather, many eyes are focusing on the Comedy Show Duo and their Rally for Sanity / Fear.
