Both the New Orleans Saints, who spanked freshmen quarterback Josh FreemanJosh Freeman and the Indianapolis Colts lead by dusty old pro Peyton ManningPeyton Manning, who needed his defense's help to preserve from any mark in the L column.  New Orleans knicked up Tampa Bay Buccaneers 38-9. The Colts eked by the Baltimore Ravens by 2 points in a low scoring affair, ultimately prevailing 17-15.  Brett FavreBrett Favre, 40, however scored and scored and scored as he completed 22 of 25 passes, connecting on 4 for touchdowns and lead the Minnesota Vikings, now 9-1, to an easy 35-9 victory hosting the Seattle Seahawks.  Favre accounted for one of the best performances in his life by remembering the beginning of his career.  "Getting back to that confidence that I had when I didn't know any better, that was pretty good. The ex-Green Bay Packer said. And I'm feeling more confident. I'm more of a realist at this age, but that doesn't mean you can't go out there and turn it loose." For all the celebrating going on in New Orleans, the players have been measured in their jubilation.  "Let's face it, these are not the Jon GrudenJon Gruden-coached Tampa Bay Buccaneers that we're used to," New Orleans tight end Jeremy ShockeyJeremy Shockey said after the game. "No offense to Tampa. They're going to be good in time. But we know we can play better than we did." The SaintsThe Saints next march against a visiting New England Patriot team. Tom BradyTom Brady is sure to bring his own brand of the Bourbon Street two-step. The Patriots beat the NY Jets on Sunday 31-14. "It only makes it harder because every team we face now would love to give us that first loss," quarterback Drew BreesDrew Brees said. "We're building something special this year. In order to get there, we have to win games like the one coming up."        1 of 2         Tipping his cap to an appreciative crowd      Nathaniel Hines is based in Florianpolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United Kingdom (23.8%) France (22.0%) Canada (16.6%) United States of America (10.2%) 14 other countries (18.7%)           READ MORE: NFL, football, Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, sports-news, Brazil, Florianopolis, Tom Brady, The Saints (band), Jon Gruden, Jeremy Shockey, American football, Green Bay Packers season, Josh Freeman, FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week, New Orleans Saints   More News From: Florianpolis :  Brazil     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 22            Reply  Posted By     Adrian Holman|about 1 yearagoI am glad that the Saints and the Colts are still undefeated.
