Its too small to capture the scale, the size, the horror of whats happening here. Its a very tiny little camera lens, and no matter where you point it something is happening.Cooper was closely involved in his networks coverage of Hurricane Katrina and CNN and others seem to be relying on a bank of knowledge garnered during coverage of some past disasters, like Katrina or the 2004 tsunami, in covering the earthquake.Coverage this week has been informed by those experiences, writes THRs Paul Gough. TV journalism learned during Katrina that prepositioning everything from TV equipment to trucks to meals-ready-to-eat was crucial. Networks drew upon their stores in the early hours of the Haitian earthquake, and established connection points in Miami and the Dominican Republic as well as Port-au-Prince.Gough also estimates that costs for all of the networks combined could be in the range of $5 million or more to cover the Haiti issue.CommentsShareFNC, Fox NewsBill Hemmer in Haiti: If Your Heart Doesnt Break for Them, You Dont Have a HeartbeatBy Chris Ariens on January 14, 2010 6:40 PMWe have the opportunity to tell the world the story of Haiti, says Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer. TVNewser talked with Hemmer between live reports late this afternoon. He and his crew are currently at the airport waiting for cargo to be offloaded from relief flights so it can be distributed, to people who need it more and more by the hour, says Hemmer.Its awful, says the Americas Newsroom anchor. I just met a woman a half hour ago, pushing her husband in a wheelchair with a young boy. She had this massive bandage on her face, eyes and nose. She just started bawling, she was from France and they were trying to get back to Paris. When the quake hit, they went back inside, where they remained trapped for two days.Even on a good day, its pretty tough here.We asked Hemmer about his colleague Steve Harrigan who got choked up during a liveshot earlier today. Hemmer was nearby, getting ready for his own liveshot. If your heart doesnt break for them, you dont have a heartbeat, he said.Eating and sleeping arent much on his mind right now. Before they crossed the border from the Dominican Republic into Haiti, Hemmer and his crew stopped at a gas station for supplies. We stocked up on a bunch of water. Pototao Chips, gum, that kind of thing. And today some MREs (meals ready-to-eat) had shipped in.Hemmer says just reporting the story for TV is a challenge. There is no electricity and were able to provide live reports. Thats a tremendous tribute to our staff and crew and colleagues here.Hemmer isnt sure how long hell be covering the aftermath but says the story will move to the U.S. military. Theyre going to have a pretty big role here, he predicts.CommentsShareGeneralitiesNewser Notes from HaitiBy Chris Ariens on January 14, 2010 4:33 PM Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan, whos covered wars and other international conflict, was overcome with emotion telling the story of a woman who lost 4 of her children in the quake, and her fifth child at a hospital: That kind of loss is hoffific in any culture. But when youre in a culture where . where youre alone . it just makes it all the more difficult. (VIDEO HERE) CNNs Ivan Watson has been reporting from the scene of a rescue attempt of an 11-year-old girl. Shes crying, shes in a lot of pain right now and shes terribly scared. This little girl  its kind of heartbreaking to hear this  because shes pinned there. The right leg is underneath the concrete  her hands are free and her leg is free and shes talking to us. They only discovered her today. Theyre thinking about trying to cut her leg. They dont know what to do right now. (VIDEO HERE) CNNs Anderson Cooper was #1 at 10pm in the A25-54 demo last night.
