Dear friends, please don't be mad at me." He also posted a YouTube video of written slides called My Final Thoughts. In it, he wrote: "Jared Loughner is in need of sleep."In a series of videos, he gave a rambling account of obsessions and paranoias that appeared to be troubling him with increasing intensity up to the catastrophe. They included references to conscious dreaming, or "conscience dreaming" as he called it, a process of directing one's own dreams that he is thought to have practised. Another was a belief in the gold and silver standard of currency  a favourite topic of the rightwing of American politics that is regularly propounded by the Fox News commentator Glenn Beck.The tone of Loughner's rantings is almost exclusively conservative and anti-government, with echoes of the populist campaigning of the Tea Party movement. "Don't trust the government listener!" he said in one video, accusing Washington of mind control and brainwashing.More: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/09/jared-lee-l... ...so, yeah, any and all Right-wing fuckbags who try to argue that this guy wasn't a member of their happy little band of dimwits can kiss my ass.Twice.On both cheeks.I'll even spring for the ChapStick.Refresh|+116 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadI knew the Guardian would come through.AspenRoseJan-09-11 04:31 PM#1"We the Living" is one of his favorite books.

They deregulate to the point it's communism for the rich,disaster capitalism for the rest of us.Every point the right wing uses they DO.Brainwashing is a true phenomena, abusive relationships are all about controlling others,So remember that when the GOP, marketers, lobbyists and hate TV/radio(NLP) and churches do it for  are experts at it. Most people believe they are immune to brainwashing& thought control but ironically people who believe  they are immune  to such mind fucks renders their minds open targets for manipulators.The thing is it is the corporations and the ad-men the tools of the rich republicans.Corporations are the biggest manipulators of public perception engineering out there.They instill fear in the ignorant,to fight the compassionate who understand the true definition of liberal,freedom & justice against those who rabble rouse .Rabble rousing is very effective the Nazis got power that way,exploiting the poor person's fears and ignorant bigotries.I think the old rich white males know their kind of hierarchy and  "culture" is a hollow imposition. They know corporations never served society,and the 'leaders' of the conservative on the outside, decadent&fascist behind closed doors old boys club are going to die and have to give up control with the last of these greedy sociopath obscenely wealthy groups of corporate pigs.They  want a "new generation" to keep their hypocrite 'culture' alive. So they use tools like coultergiest,O'Reilly,Faux, CBN,and Savage to spew hate and a false certainty to incite one part of the population,to hate the 'other' parts. The rhetoric  they use makes it so we remain divided  and cannot find solidarity  with each other .That along with the atomization of society into cul-de-sacs and 'nuclear families'the scared and isolated can more easily believe in the  hateful rhetoric as true, and ignore These mega-rich creeps manipulating politics,playing good cop/bad cop and other such games with people hoping for resonance that makes a believer act and thus the bullies can claim it was not their fault..The right wing cult leaders want to dupe and upset the emotionally vulnerable, strike fears in the minds of the powerless & narcissistic and power starved people,while striking fear in the good-hearted liberally inclined people twords the brainwashed followers of authoritarians on the right and direct that hate by implying..than when a brick lands in a Dem's office with a threat,or a congress member is killed,by the few who are so scared but too narcissistic to ADMIT it...they are tools.  The GOP,fascist,eugenicist, corporate old boy network get what they want..power over& control of society to inch the nation forward in feudal sort of a slave/master fascism.The sickening culture that sociopaths THRIVE in and desire to impose  .The gun nuts  and militias don't want to realize they are outgunned. Left and Right is a false division.Why? because the people are being pitted against each other& fears over things the right wing joe cannot comprehend because they have made ignorance a virtue..Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topladym55      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:19 PMResponse to Original message19.Hooray for the GuardianAs I anticipated, NBC and David Gregory made SURE we ALL understood that no one could TELL Loughner's political leanings. This was the act of someone mentally unstable. (Really???) And as good ol' David led the round table of (including a new Tea Party rep from Idaho), all the reps provided mea culpas on holding civil discourse in Congress. Only Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Raul Grijalva mentioned the role of media ... and Gregory cut off Grijalva.We need to address the elephant in the room ... the hate spewings of Beck, Limbaugh, Savage, Palin, and on and on. We cannot conflate the left with the right here. And it's time we recognize that irresponsible speech + mental instability = disaster.
