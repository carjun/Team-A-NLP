A desolate plain, littered with stones, unfolding to all horizons. A vast and ancient stillness. And in this wilderness of dust, the tiny footprints of a child."Himba," said Alfredo Tchimbuembue, a ranger sweating along a remote trail in Iona National Park, one of war-weary Angola's derelict nature reserves.Tchimbuembue crouched to touch the print, shaking his head in wonder."They travel alone for days, herding goats," he said. "They need nothing. They don't need us."Tchimbuembue would know. Trekking through his sprawling park only a few hours earlier, he had stumbled across a band of tough, proud Himba nomads who had never met an Angolan government official, despite having roots in the parched landscape that stretched back 400 years.Chicago Shopping Overwhelming Offers: Always 50% off or more from your favorite brands >>                                    One bearded elder, smeared in red ochre pigment and puffing on an antelope-bone pipe, had asked to see an Angolan bank note. Unimpressed, he fingered the bill with mild curiosity. Two Western journalists hiking with Tchimbuembue had sparked more interest. The puzzled tribesmen tugged at blonde hair, mistaking it for a wig of horse fur. Then, with admirable tact, they asked one of the strangers if she was a man or woman.When it comes to so-called "lost tribes," the jungles of Brazil or New Guinea spring quickest to mind, not the outback of Angola. To most of the world, Angola is a war, not a country: a distant killing field packed with land mines and "blood diamonds," where the weapon of choice is neither spear nor arrow, but a thoroughly modern AK-47 assault rifle.Yet here in Angola's empty quarter, a moonscape of bare rock and sand just north of the Namibian border, one of Africa's longest and ugliest conflicts has wrought a fragile miracle at the turn of the millennium: the preservation of a forgotten, Iron-Age tribe of herders who anthropologists say are the most culturally intact on the continent.Cut off by 25 years of fighting between Angolan troops and UNITA rebels, buffered to the south by the nearly roadless wastes of the Namib, as few as 1,000 nomadic Himba still wander Angola's remote southwestern corner, driving their goats and long-horned cattle between precious water holes, and conducting feasts for their ancestors as they have for centuries.A recent journey into the lonesome region, perhaps the first such trip by Western journalists in many years, revealed a self-sufficient people who are far more traditional than their cousins in neighboring Namibia, where Westernized Himba are becoming a tourist attraction to match Kenya's famous Masai herders. Camping under the stars of an older Africa, Angola's nomads have thrived in isolation. Their children and livestock are fat and healthy. And ironically, as forgotten as the Himba are, it is the Angolan government, mired in a dehumanizing and impoverishing war, that seems "lost" by comparison."Two things have kept these people as amazingly unchanged as they are," said Francisco Giner Abati, a Spanish anthropologist who has visited Angola during lulls in the country's civil war."The first is that they have nothing the government and rebels can fight over--no oil, no diamonds. The second is that Angola's reputation is so terrible that nobody ever goes there to bother them."The paradox of this time warp Abati need hardly mention: With every shaky step Angola takes toward peace and normalcy, the Himba's long isolation crumbles further.At the moment, for example, Angola's diehard UNITA rebels are cowed by powerful government offensives. The brutal war, fueled by diamonds and oil, is ebbing. And the Angolan government, capitalizing on this period of relative peace, is hoping to launch an ecotourism industry that will rock the nomad's world.A moribund national park near Luanda, the slum-ringed capital, is being revived for visitors. Its poached savannas will be restocked with elephants from Botswana later this month.Iona National Park, a spectacular chunk of the Namib Desert encompassing 5,000 square miles of the Himba's homeland, is next on the agenda."It is our biggest and best park," said Lucas Miranda, the chief of the National Office of Protected Areas in Luanda. "Even today it is very safe. It was never mined. And it still has lots of animals."Miranda, a Czech-trained forester, said his government is eager to create a trans-boundary park joining Iona with the famed Skeleton Coast Park in Namibia--a nation that earns $500 million from tourism every year. Iona, the thinking goes, would funnel some of that bonanza across the border."We want to show the world Angola's beauty," Miranda said.Nobody, of course, has consulted the Himba about these extravagant plans. Nobody, for that matter, has taken the trouble to even find the nomads.12next|  single pageGet the Chicago Tribune delivered to your home for only $1 a week >Copyright  2011, Chicago Tribune E-mail PrintReprint Digg Twitter Facebook Home deliveryComments (0)Add comments | Discussion FAQCurrently there are no comments.
