Its not surprisingthen that domestic violence and abuse is often overlooked or excused. Contrary to what many people think abusive behavior rarely occurs as aresult of the abuser's inability to control his behavior. Abusivebehavior is a deliberate action that the abuser chooses to perform inorder to manipulate  and control another person.Why abuse is a choice and not uncontrollable rage:The abuser does not batter other people  - he only batters his victim in the privacy of his own home.He can stop the abuse if interrupted by a knock on the door or a phone call.The abuser directs his hitting and punching to places that can easily be concealed.  Stop The Abuse.........Stop The InsanityThey found her body ina rubbish dumpAll mangled andcovered in dirt A lovers quarrel ,one drink too manySomething said thatmade him hurtHe pleaded insanity iswhat the newsman saidHe was insane   does that make her less dead?Im pretty sure she hadheard that excuse beforeWas that how he tricked her to stay for more?When he said he wassorry for all the bruises and painDid she really believeit would never happen againDid he say hed gocrazy if she went away"Temporary insanity"  news headlines todayNow she is one morestatistic in a police report fileAnd she'll make newsheadlines for a  little whileBut when all is overand people forget she is goneThere will be otherswho suffer because of this wrongNot only because"temporary insanity" caused her to dieBut because they chose to ignore one more black eyeAccepted last minute cancellations of appointments she madesuspecting it was to hide the punches he had laidregretting they had not told her  what they knew feeling guilty about something they did not doThey gambled with herlife for fear of rejectionTheir priority should have been her protection.For all mothers of daughtersin a similar plightWhatever you do standup and fightOr you may hear on thenews one day"Temporary insanity" hastaken her away.                                                                        -     Laura du Toit 2009 -Denial by the AbusedMany people in an abusive relationship deny that they are being abused.Many of them don't even want to admit it to themselves and commonly usethe following excuses:-It's not nearly as bad as what yousee on TV or read about - he just hit out at me or shoved me its not asif he hits me all the time - it could be worse. Physical abuse is neverbetter or worse : No matter how minor it may seem abuse is neverexcusable, acceptable or normal.It only happened once ortwice, maybe three times at the most. Studies show that abusers rarelystop abusing someone - in fact invariably the abusetends to become more frequent and more violent over time.Hedoesn't assault me if I keep quiet and do what he wants me to. If yougive up your right to make decisions, see your friends and family, gowhere you wish then not only is this person guilty of physical abuse heis now guilty of emotional abuse which could prove to be much morestressful in the long run.He only shouts at me andbelittles me - he would never lift his hand to me. Don't be fooled intothinking emotional abuse is any less frightening than physical abuse. Tactics Used By the AbuserHumiliation - Abusers humiliate their victims in order tolower their self-esteem and make them feel worthless. They believe ifthe victim feels worthless they are less likely to leave. They eitherinsult them, call them names or shame them in public (sometimes acombination of all of these) to break down their victim's self respect.Threats - Abusers often use threats in an attempt to keeptheir victims from leaving them. These typically can includethreatening to kill either the victims or themselves or threaten tocause bodily harm to the victim should they try to leave.Isolation- In order to gain complete control over the victim's life an abusermay attempt to isolate them from the outside world. He may try to  keep them from visiting their friends and family and will expect to becontinuously updated on who they see and who they speak to.Control- Abusers dominate their victims as they are control freaks. They makeall the decisions on behalf of their victims who are then expected tohonor and obey them without any questions. They tend to treat their victims asif they were a possession or a child.Intimidation- To scaretheir victims into submission abusers may use a variety of intimidationtactics. These include destroying of property, placing weapons ondisplay, threatening looks or gestures and hitting or kicking things. Blameand denial - A bad childhood, a bad day at the office, or the victimthemselves are the most common excuses that abusers give for theirinexcusable behavior. They may even deny that it ever took place orminimize the abuse. Their favorite tactic is however to shift the blameon to their victim. .Cycle of Abusive BehaviorThe cycle of domestic abuse has a repetitive pattern. It will startwith the abusive partner displaying aggressive, belittling or violentbehavior towards the victim. The purpose of this behavior is todemonstrate the dominant role of the abuser in the relationship.Shortly after the abuse has taken place the abuser will feel guilty ,mainly out of fear of having to face consequences for his abusivebehavior. The next step in the cycle is when he attempts to regaincontrol over his victim by either becoming extremely charming or byjust pretending the incident never occurred. During this phase manyvictims fall into the trap of believing the abuser has really changedand that the abuse will stop. Unfortunately this phase tends to lastfor a shorter period of time in each subsequent cycle and the abuserwill eventually start planning his next bout of abuse. Abusers areknown to fantasize about abusing their victims and when the "honeymoon"phase is over they will spend time fabricating reasons for the nextattack. They then set their victims up to carry out their premeditatedplans by creating a situation in which he can justify abusing theirvictim. And so the cycle has gone full circle and starts all over again.Inbetween episodes the abuser tries to make it as difficult as possiblefor his victim to leave. He leads the person to believe that they arethe only person who understands and can help him and that he haschanged. He also leads his victim to believe that he truly loves themand that he could not live without them.Beware : the dangers of staying are very real and could result in permanent bodily harm or death.Link to National Domestic Violence HotlineNational Domestic Violence Hotline If You Suspect Someone You Know is Being AbusedIf you suspect that anyone you know may be a victim of domesticviolence take the matter seriously.
