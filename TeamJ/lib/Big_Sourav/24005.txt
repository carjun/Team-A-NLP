Uncle Bill with Rothstein aide Ingrid Sahdala Remember that Scandiffio was one of two close Scott Rothstein associates whom he invited to Morocco. The other was Bill Boockvor, who is better-known as Bill Brock and even better as just "Uncle Bill." There's been a lot of speculation, including on this blog, about the role Uncle Bill may haveplayed in Rothstein's felonious financial life. He was known, after all, as the guy whose role at RRA was to watch the money.Rothstein, though, told me when I interviewed him at the Captial Grille that Uncle Bill accompanied him to Casablanca for innocent reasons. "He only came with me to provide moral support,"Rothstein said. "That was all. He has nothing to do with this." Scandiffio says that, this time anyway, he believes Rothstein is telling the truth. The bodyguard says that he wasn't privy to the Ponzi either but that his former boss left Uncle Bill in the dark on just about everything."Uncle Bill had  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendPulp Researcher Moves OnBy Bob Norman,                                                            Fri., Feb. 26 2010 @ 3:28PMWell, I said it wasn't a problem until it was a problem, andit becamea problem. So Lyn Evans is no longer doing part-time research work for the Pulp. Earlier today, I gave her the choice to either keep working for New Timespart-time for peanuts or to continue working as well-paid investigator for attorney Bill Scherer.I not only expected her decision but respected it. Thismove reflects absolutely nothingregardingmy opinion of Evans. She's hard-workingand a true corruption fighter.And she was loyalto the Pulp. Think about it: If she were doing Scherer's bidding while working for me,do you think she wouldhave had the confrontation with State Attorney Michael Satzcaptured above? Satz,remember, isa friend of Scherer's and employs hisdaughter as a high-ranking prosecutor.How about this one with Sheriff Al Lamberti? More recently, she tracked Mayor Ken Keechl down in a county parking lot, and he refused to comment on his controversial campaign spending, saying something about how low people would go to sell newspapers. Unfortunately, her Fliphad a technical problem and we didn't catch it onvideo. These were tests by fire and are just a few examples of Evans' workduring the  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendFiller Friday: Some Classic Keechl and Ritter Radio By Bob Norman,                                                            Fri., Feb. 26 2010 @ 8:59AMOn a slow morning, here's a blast from the past. It's a segment from Broward County Commissioner Stacy Ritter's old radio show during which she and Mayor Ken Keechl talk about investigations and gift bans. Keechl says he doesn't like the idea of a gift ban because it might-- say it ain't so -- put an end to Ritter's Mayor's Ball that year, which, of course, was sponsored with $50,000from Scott Rothstein. Here, listen to the April tape, and then we'll talk a little more about it. Did you hear Ritter? She said a rule to live by in politics is "do your best not to make your colleagues uncomfortable." Could you imagine if Sheila Alu followed that idiot maxim? Sunrise would probably have a  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendIn Rothstein Fiasco, Fraud Begets FraudBy Bob Norman,                                                            Thu., Feb. 25 2010 @ 10:56AMWhen Scott Rothstein was spending millions in his bid to take over Fort Lauderdale, his many doubters strongly suspected that the money couldn't possibly be legitimate. And the question heard 'round the city was: Where is this guy getting his money? There was talk of Russian Mob connections and computer porn. Some suspected the Italian Mafia.Now we know a whole lot of itcame from a similarly dubious source, New York hedge funds.Hedge fund owner George Levin was the key money source, with his Banyon fund pumping hundreds of millionsinto Rothstein's scheme.WhenRothstein's Ponzi scheme imploded and he fled to Morocco, Levinheld a major meeting ofinvestors at his office across from the Galleria Mall on Sunrise Boulevard.Many of them,we have since learned, have dubious histories. Levin himself ran a model car company that was hit with a federal fraud conviction. His right-hand man at Banyon, Frank Preve, is a convicted felon. Mel Lifshitz is a disbarred attorney and convicted tax evader.Then you havehedge fund owner Murray Huberfeld, a serial SEC violator whom I wrote about last week. Now let me introduce you to the reported $50 million man, Meir "Mark" Nordlicht,who has businessties to Huberfeld and whohas alsobeen alleged to have been involved in a previous fraud. A big one. Nordlicht, remember, was reportedly present at that meeting of panicked Rothsteininvestors on November 1.Nordlicht runs a $500 million New York hedge fund called Platinum Management and, like Huberfeld, put his money into Rothstein's scheme via loans to Levin's Banyon fund. Levin told me earlier this week that he was introduced to both  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendThe Showdown at SunriseBy Bob Norman,                                                            Wed., Feb. 24 2010 @ 6:42PMSo I watched the end of last night's Sunrise Commission meeting and thought it was prettyinteresting drama. SoI asked Chaz Stevens to jimmy up a synopsis vid, and here's what he put together (I could have had it done but would have had to go through a guy in Kansas City or something, so I stayed local): Commissioner Sheila Alu first goes after Don Rosen hard-core, saying that he sold out the city for his business associate Jim Feeley and the garbage transfer station and that he shouldn't be a commissioner at all. Rosen comes backto  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendThe Seidlin Family CircusBy Bob Norman,                                                            Wed., Feb. 24 2010 @ 9:54AMOn one side, you have the politically connected Bill Scherer and his law firm, and on the other, you have Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler, former state Sen. Skip Campbell, and Florida Bar President-Elect Scott Hawkins. Welcome to the civil suit involving former Judge Larry Seidlin, who became a national celebrity/clown during his tearful handling of the Anna Nicole Smith case, and the elderly neighbor who is claiming that Seidlin exploited her to take a sizable chunk of her multimillion-dollar fortune. Hawkins, Seiler, and Campbell form the core of Seidlin's defense team, representing the judge; his in-laws, Oren and Barbara Ray; and family friend Dorothy "Danni" Coletto, respectively. Hawkins just took over for Russ Adler, who was knocked out after his law partner, Scott Rothstein, was implicated in a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme. Scherer is representing the widow, Barbara Kasler. Also involved is Lyn Evans, who has been working with the Kasler family for some time and has most recently been working as an investigatorforScherer in his suit. Evans is also a part-time researcher for the Daily Pulp and provided the video.When Evans videotaped the wild proceedings at a deposition Friday at the Marine Tower in Fort Lauderdale -- where Seidlin and Kasler are neighbors -- Seidlin seized onherworkfor New Timesin the video above. His blond wife, Belinda, chimes in, andit ends with Mayor Seiler's client, Coletto, flipping the bird.Last night, WSVN reporter Carmel Cafieroaired a report on the depo and the case. You can see it here.Coletto is an intriguing character in the case. After I broke the initial story about Seidlin's alleged exploitation of Kasler, Coletto contacted me and told me that she had direct knowledge that Seidlin plotted toget named as an heir in the widow's will. She originally voiced contempt for Seidlin. The next videoshows Seidlin, Belinda (a former investigator in the PublicDefender'sOffice), and their daughter standing by the elevator.Scherer's team claims the family is waiting forBarbara Kasler to arrive for an emotional "ambush."

Rosenfeldt with Kim Rothstein. Rosenfeldt, who is now the subject of a $9 million-plus clawback lawsuit filed bybankrupcty trustee Herb Stettin,didn't want to talk. "I'm not going to say anything," he said. "I just want to go forward with my life and get past it." I asked Rosenfeldt if he wouldhelp clear up the information coming from the bankruptcy court that he purchased 72 pieces of jewelry from J.R. Dunn Jewelers from December 2008 to July 2009 alone. It sure sounds like a lot. "That was the total of jewelry that I bought for my two daughters and my wife since 2002," he said. "I think that's where they got that number. I bought plenty of jewelry.I bought for myself, my daughters, andit included gifts for other people, including male friends. But that was everything I've purchased since2002." DidRosenfeldt purchase it all on the law firm's AmericanExpress cards? "Not all of it,"Rosenfeldt answered."Some of it was bought on  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendUPDATED: Florida Ethics Commission OKs Political Graft  By Bob Norman,                                                            Tue., Feb. 23 2010 @ 8:02AMAgarbage executive named James Feeley wants to build a giant garbage transfer station in Sunrise that the people don't want and the city doesn't need. It's so unpopular that neighboring Tamarac is sending busloads of angry residents to protest it tonight. Wishner and RosenBut Feeley, who hashad extensive business tieswith Wayne Huizenga,might not have to worry about those things. After all, he has a commissioner in his pocket, a buddy in the mayor, and a weak and unfathomably stupid Florida Ethics Commission looking over the situation at the moment. Feeley's plan -- which is called "Green Now" and is deceptivelybilled as a recycling center -- isn't allowed under the city's current garbage contract and will do nothing for the city except make sure there are a whole lot more stinky trucks full of garbage from other towns, not to mention the 26,000-square-foot facility itself. One commissioner, Sheila Alu, is fighting it hard.Yet the aforementionedmayor, Roger Wishner, and his chief ally on the commission, Don Rosen, are fervently backing Feeley and trying to push through his proposal. One reason for this is that Wishner, who used to be in the medical wastebusiness himself, is a longtimefriend and colleague of Feeley's. Another is that Feeley contributed $5,000 to an electioneering communications organization -- or legalized political slush fund -- called Liberty and Justice for All that funded attack ads against  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendGeorge Levin Speaks (Sort Of); Keechl's Irony By Bob Norman,                                                            Mon., Feb. 22 2010 @ 12:38PMKim's mom Cheryl Lynn Shaffer, cigar man Moe Sohail, Kim's dad Bill Wendell, and Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein at running back Ricky Williams' old house Slow news day, working on a couple things that aren't ripe yet. One thing: Just got George Levin, Scott Rothstein's largest investor, on the phone. I told him I thought it would be great for everyone if he told me his story. "I don't have a problem with that," he said. "Let me talk to my lawyers to see what they think." I began to ask him some questions, and he said he needed to get off the phone. I got one small answer out of him, but it wasn't much. Won't be holding my breath for him to get back to me, though I really do think it would be interesting and beneficial to hear his story. One other thing: It's true that the constituent who sent Broward Mayor Ken Keechl the email that spurred his  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendMayor Keechl: Paying Myself Rent From Campaign Fund Is "Fair"By Bob Norman,                                                            Sun., Feb. 21 2010 @ 9:03AMThe following is an email that Broward Mayor Ken Keechl sent Friday to a constituent who had inquired about his Scott Rothstein contributions and was "dismayed" over his campaign spending. Keechl In it, he seems to have provided corruption investigators a motive for why he's paying himself so much money in rent for the campaign headquarters he owns.Remember that Godfather 3 filed a criminal complaint with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the FBI a few weeks ago (reprinted at the end of this post). Here's an original post that first explored Keechl's excessive spending. "I will admit that some people don't like that I rented from my partner and me," he wrote, "but its legitimate (and I never got the original 180,000 back that I spent last time so on balance I thought it was fair.)" See? He's saying that since he put $180,000 ofhis own money inhis first race, he deserves to get a little something back in the second.As forhis lavish campaign spending onexpensive lunches and bottles of wine,Keechl writes,"You don't ask people to raise you 50,000 in one night and then take them to McDonalds." I don't know what kind of aversion Keechl has to dollar signs.
