Just Flow. Haku Maki - Poem 70 - 73See all 8 photosFlow - by Katsunori HamanishiBreaking up... positively.OurDifferent Dreams: Amazing Poems of Hope: Life Circles: About Letting Go Aftera Relationship Ends; by Pearldiver, is about breaking up and letting go, when arelationship ends, the end of a life circle.Our different dreams may have been written to demonstrate how changing apersonal perspective to one of finding positive aspects in your ex and in thepast relationship; can actually help you move on far easier, than dwelling onnegative events. It may have beenwritten, merely to illustrate how hard it must be to a drip, in a world ofdrops. It was written to be inspiringand to say, Dont be sad or down about breaking up. We are not always able to plot our courses inlife and though we may feel, or believe that we are meant to be with someonewhom we consider is special, sometimes, in fact more often than not, we aredestined to flow in different directions.In understanding that, then it may be a little easier to be positiveabout the time that you did spend with the other person and always be thankfulthat in many ways, that the flow of that relationship has helped to bring youto where you are today. Irrespective ofhow you may feel, you are today in a better place and you are here, to commencea new life circle.If you take twoleaves and place them together in the center of a stream, you will see how verydifferent the flows of each will be; even though they both move downstream. Our lives share a similar journey, from theday we are born until we reach the heart of our sea, or perhaps are lost alongthe way. Please enjoy: Our DifferentDreams, by Pearldiver.

River Tanzaku - Ando Hiroshige.The Images Honor The Artists..* Katsunori Hamanishi *Katsunori Hamanishi wasborn in Hokkaidoin 1949.  He is the foremost mezzotintartist in the world today and has held that position for thirty years.  His works are unique and on style andcomposition alone, display his amazing talents; but in adding his specialdepths of colors and textures gained by burnishing of his printing plates,foils and masterly application of dimensional form, makes his works trulyspectacular.  Katsunori Hamanishiscollective works hang permanently in Osaka, Taipei, Krakow, New York, Washington, Chicago and San  Francisco.  Hisworks are potentially great investment pieces; but overall, KatsunoriHamanishis works show his personality and demonstrate how far the oldmasters have allowed traditional Japanese Woodblock Printing to develop, whileretaining its distinctive origins.       -------------------------* Ando (Utagawa) Hiroshige *AndoHiroshige was born in Edo in1797 and duringhis life he created more than 8000 individual works of art.  He studied different styles under the mastersOkajime Rinsai, Utagawa Toyohiro and Ooka Umpo, from whom he became interestedin Western art.  Ando Hiroshiges printsand sketches provided 19th Century Western artists including:Whistler, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Cezanne, a dramatic new viewof nature that clearly influenced art long after his death in 1858.Two Great Masters of the Art of Wood Block Printing.

Thanks again for being the first off the rank to read this work... I was going to call it Flow.. but my words would not have done justice to Katsunori Hamanishi's Work.Wow... what can I say in response to your words? Well I am Unique and I am unique because I am just me.. uninfluenced by the negativity of others that they have tried to have me wear in my life. I have never before written or created poetry and certainly could never have seen myself doing so on a world stage. I achieve because I believe and I can fail from not believing in me and the great power of Pearl Jam's music!Oh yeah... my ring size?? Hahaha.. I Refuse To Measure My Nose!!! Thanks for caring SOH..

Great hub. :o))Pearldiver4 weeks ago Hi kirutaye, thanks for taking the time to read this work and for your compliment. You have mentioned that I paint mental pictures and pull heartstrings with my poetry.. Is that not the objective of any poem? I am asking so that I can understand how, as a novice poet.. I can do that? If I do so, clearly I must choose my subjects well in future. Cheers for that... Take Care.Micky Dee4 weeks ago Awesomely beautiful! Thank you PD. The words can be applied to many.

Take Care.always exploring4 weeks ago This is truly beautiful.Thank you.CheersPearldiver4 weeks ago Hi always exploring, thanks you reading this work and you are most welcome..glad that you enjoyed it.. take care.MartieCoetser4 weeks ago Pearldiver  Im all the way with you: Looking at life (and love) from this positive perspective makes it so much easier. Unfortunately one does not easily get this perspective  during at least the first quarter of ones life, one tends to WANT everything and everybody to be ones personal will/way/flow. Or at least in full harmony with ones own. One needs a certain amount of painful disappointments or wide-awakenings to finally get this positive perspective. Your poem is excellent. Ive bookmarked this one, because I find it a very likeable reflection of my own believes regarding the issue. Best wishes from me to you and yours :)PS.: You avatar sends shivers down my spine! It is such a metaphor of being the victim of the swallow and debauched.Pearldiver4 weeks ago Hi Martie, thank you for reading this work and your positive comments. You are quite right Martie... I believe that we may be conditioned to be that way in our lives. I feel that any relationship that we have experienced must have some positive aspects to it... It takes a 'strange' person to enter into a relationship for negative reasons, doesn't it? Yet when we relate to past relationships, people tend to have conditioned themselves to only remember the bad aspects. This current avatar really does say a lot doesn't it? Right down to the 'One Eyed' perspective that I have been said to portray :) Cheers Martie.. Take Care and have a Christmas.sofs4 weeks ago Beautiful flow, imagery and emotion. Don't different  dreams cause different flows, I am just wondering.. yet once loved is always loved. Love is such wonderful thing that lasts and lasts even if the flow separates people.Best wishes to you PD, take care!Pearldiver4 weeks ago Hi Sofs, thank you for taking the time to read this work and your comment.  Don't different dreams cause different flows? Yes Sofs.. but this a poem about circumstance and how those circumstances flow towards merging and separation (different dreams).. hahaha I did mention deep in there somewhere didn't I? Yes.. love should always last, but in reality and as people, we often destroy it's ability to do that; by finding fault or being negative. You sure do have to ride it wildly for longer than the 8 second rodeo recommendations! Cheers.. you have a great holiday period and take care sofs.Money Glitch2 weeks ago Awesome, PD! This hub is full of so much wisdom that will help anyone that's open to the truth about how love works.  Human kind wants love to last a life time with just one person, however thats not always the way it can be because of the human will.Ive learned that sometimes love is placed in our life just for a season to be enjoyed; then it's time to let go and move on to another portion of lifes journey.  Rating awesome and beautiful, and bookmarking to share with others that might be struggling with letting go. Thanks for sharing! :)Pearldiver2 weeks ago Hi MG, thanks for taking the time to read this poem that I really found special to write. I can't explain what I mean by that, other than to say that the flow was already there, but it just needed the right words for each bend in it's life stream. We are complex creatures aren't we? We have a life that we often waste and never seem to take enough time to explore, perhaps we fear wonderment and cling to secure things and places; like subterranean life pools, instead of moving on. I'm really pleased that you appreciated this work MG.
