The Eagles v Cowboys match will determine if the Saints have to play the Eagles, Cardinals or Packer on January 16th.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoI hated scrambling around trying to figure things out on the internet. A cheat sheet will help me tremendously.            Reply  Posted By     Adrian Holman|about 1 yearagoThis has to be the weirdest set of Wild Card Playoff games ever because of three of the games in which they just played each other on Sunday and that all of the teams played each other this season.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoI think the Dallas vs. Philly match will be a thriller. How Dallas managed December without a stumble is big news down there. I agree. Stange occurences. Jets and Cincy will also be interesting.            Reply  Posted By     bigghigg|about 1 yearagoThanks for putting up the schedule. I'm looking forward to the postseason.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoI probably should have added their records in there too. I guess the slate is clean right now and it's do or die for each team.            Reply  Posted By     mmoownage|about 1 yearagoLets so who makes it in the superbowl this year...lots of good teams            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoI have a feeling that its Chargers vs. Saints. What other procrastinators out there want to take a shot?            Reply  Posted By     InspectorGadget|about 1 yearagoThanks for summing it all up. The upcoming schedule looks very exciting. Definitely some great match ups there. We're now really getting close to the Super Bowl. The anticipation is building up. Let's see what happens. Hopefully it's a good one. I'm going for the Chargers.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoCome on now. Show your stuff. Who do you desire?            Reply  Posted By     roykantari|about 1 yearagothanks alot.. this rlly helps            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoCan't come in this deal without telling me who you want. Give me a clue.            Reply  Posted By     mo3ty|about 1 yearagothnx so much....its very helpfull            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoNeed to know who you pick.

I need participants. Not just readers.            Reply  Posted By     Delilah Jean Williams|about 1 yearagoNathaniel, thanks for taking the time to put this schedule together. Without my team, the Seattle Seahawks involved, I won't pay much attention until Super Bowl, then I will root for the under dog.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoThis is getting closer, but not nearly clear enough. Otherwise, I will peg you at the Jets??            Reply  Posted By     Punditty|about 1 yearagoWell, since you asked...here are my Wild Card weekend predictions:AFCPhilly over JetsRavens over PatsNFCDallas over PhillyPackers over Cardinals            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoYeah baby!!
