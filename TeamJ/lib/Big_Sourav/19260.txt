  JONATHAN ALTER AND EARLAND LILLYS VIEW OF BARACK OBAMA: RECOVERY ACT | worldwide hippiesworldwide hippies Changing the world, one mind at a time.HomeAboutStoreEventsFashionMusicNewsOpinionJONATHAN ALTER AND EARLAND LILLYS VIEW OF BARACK OBAMA: RECOVERY ACT2010 August 15tags: BARACK OBAMA, EARLAND LILLY, RECOVERY ACTby Earland LillyThis year marks the Anniversary of the U.S. Governments decision to drop the Atom Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Every President has continued to deny that it was anything but necessary to save millions of American Lives at the expense of around 200,000 Japanese Lives, who were mostly women and children.  Historians abound that disagree, along with most of Western Europe, especially after Russia had finally entered the War against Japan.For the FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY SINCE WW II, the U.S. sends and Envoy to Hiroshima, even though the use of the Atomic Bomb, then and now, remains unchallenged, at this point.John Lewis, who marched in Selma, Alabama with MLK and others, reminds us that this is the 45th Anniversary of the Votings Rights Bill.  This came about 100 years after the Civil War which freed the Slaves.President Abe Lincoln did not issue the Emancipation Proclamation until he was sure, not to do so would mean the South would prevail over the North.  General Grant was in favor of Emancipation from the beginning, whereas, President Lincoln was more of a PRAGMATIST.  He chose not to do so earlier for fear of losing some of the Border States to the South.America is slowing erasing another embarrassing Black mark against us Morally, when a Lower Court through out Californias Proposition 8 that Bans Gay Marriage.  President Obama has directed the Military and the Pentagon to figure out a way to eliminate DONT ASK, DONT TELL.  Homosexuality was even considered as a DISEASE by some Psychiatrist during the 19th Century.  Gay and Lesbians People will someday be regarded as just merely HUMANS, just like you and me, though with a different sexual preference.Anything that changes in America does so BEGRUDGINGLY, INCREMENTALLY AND WITH THE LEADERSHIP WHICH IS PRAGMATIC AND PERSISTENT.UNIFORMED and FEARFUL Americans change their Morality ONLY with the Prodding Leadership of such a person as is President Barack Obama, who is Authentic, Pragmatic, Persistent and accepts INCREMENTAL CHANGE. Her has proved that again and again his first 18 months in office, both Nationally and Internationally.He did it with China and Russia to get them united against Iran.  He did it with Iran, when their Mullahs stole the election from the more Moderate PRESIDENT TO BE.  President Obama did not take their bait.  Instead he waited for their own Police and Troops who opened fire on INNOCENT AND PEACEFULDEMONSTRATORS.  One young woman was filmed on camera being gunned down, for ALL THE WORLD TO SEE.Because of President Obamas IMPECCABLE timing, Irans Mullahs Could not point at the U.S. as Satan Incarnate, but rather their OWN PEOPLE saw that it was their OWN GOVERNMENT which was Satanic.President Obama stormed into a Climate Change Meeting, when he discovered what a Chaotic Mess everything was in.  He used his Intellect, Persuasive Style and Mutual Common Ground  to at least get a crack in the door so that the Copenhagen  Confeence would not be a total waste.  It was the first meeting that got some sort of ACCOUNTABILITY from China and set the tone for the next meeting.President Obama does NOT DO BUSINESS AS USUAL, just as he cautiously took on the Teachers Unions across the Nation in his Educational Reform Bill in his Race to the Top Federal Monetary Lending Process, he will do the same thing in Health Care, to be addressed later, as will be his Foreign Policy Abrupt Changes, he does the same thing in the RECOVERY ACT.Now, it would have been FAR MORE POPULAR, had resident Obama attacked the Unemployment issue FIRST.  However, just as his FOREIGN Policy changes remindedthe World, this is NOT ABOUT USA BUT RATHER IT IS ABOUT THEM.Had he chosen the Popular Path and went for Jobs First, THEIR MAY HAVE BEEN NO ECONOMY IN WHICH THE JOBS COULD TAKE HOLD.  His Recovery Act was NOT about His Popularity but SAVING OUR COUNTRY FROM ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION.  That was why the Banks and Wall Street had to be given TARP and Stimulus Monies.Now President Obama would not have had as clear a picture about just How Big the Mess was with the Economy, had the then President Bush not kept Barack obama so fully informed and early on at that.  Mr. Alter calls this ONE OF THE SMOOTHEST PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITIONS OF POWER EVER TO TAKE PLACE IN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS.Now for sure, Alter reminds us Barack Obama inherited from President Bush THE MESS HE LEFT BEHIND.  The mess was so bad that Alter uses the former Ronald Reagan chief of staff, who got canned for his candor, Donald Regan, LIKE ASHOVEL BRIGADE!         A Shovel Brigadefollows a paradecleaning up after         the Elephants.terrible pile of problemsbedevil         Obamas Administration throughout!         determined NOT let the CLEANUP Overwhelm Other Initiatives.         Contrary to Fox News chatter, Obama had NO TASTE for         SOCIALISM.What he wanted to do was to PUT CAPITALISM BACK ON A MORE SOLID FOUNDATION.He would dothis first with TARP, Stimulus and The Recovery Act.  He would stablize Wall Street, the Banks and the Auto Industry.  The Auto Industry and saving Teachers Jobs in his Educational Revamping would save many jobs, but the real Jobs Issue would  have to come later.It was easier for We the People to understand getting the Auto Industry back on its feet because thousands of Jobs would be saved.  Getting some help with the Foreclosure Nightmare was also close to We the People.  However, Alter rightly points out that We the People had a harder time wrapping our minds around the salvaging of Wall Street and the Banking system:          Banking was wildly complicated (even for the Bankers).          When the CEOs of the Auto Industry let quality slip,          had unsustainable Health Care for its workers and FAILED          TO CHANGE THEIR INSULAR CORPORATE CULTURESgm WAS BOTH          bloated and dysfunctionalOnly Fordwas capable of          surviving          When the CEOs, in OBLIVIOUS SYMBOLISM, flew their Corporate          Jets from Detroit to WashingtonPublic Anger Boiled over          next trip to Washington D.C., they made a point of driving          their HYBRIDS all the way.  But it was too late;  THEIR          CREDIBILITY WAS SHOT.When the Auto CEOs saw the Banks get their big Stimulus monies, they thoughtthe same would happen to them.  President Obama had other ideas for the Auto Industry.  Alter observes:          Nancy Pelosi and Congressional Leaders found that the          Auto CEOs were CLUELESSworst group of Executives          ever assembled in their officeswalking hazards for          what Economists called Moral Hazard!The last thing President Obama wanted to send to Wall Street Banks and the Auto Industry  or other ailing companies, to use Alters words: THAT THEY COULDTAKE HUGE RISKS WITHOUT SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES.The Recovery Act was NOT as accountable with the Banks and Wall Street, as it was with the Auto Industry.  President Obama knew that the Greed and Corruption of Corporate Culture was no better on Wall Street or with the Banks.  It was that THE ECONOMIC TIMES WERE IN DIRE STRAITS.  He would need to wait until the Reform of the Financial Regulations Act would be later passed to get Wall Street and the Banks to become MORE ACCOUNTABLE.With the Auto Industry, their time of REFORM IS NOW!  Again, Alter calls them COMICALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.  They had no plan!  Alter quotes Nancy Pelosi:          After hearing an Old Narrative based on a Car Market          that NO Longer Existed.Pelosi was blunt with the          Executives:  When you show us a plan that is real, well          Show You the Money!Alter goes on:          Neither the Auto Makers nor President Bush had come up with          a REALISTIC PLAN.Bush merely KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD.          From the beginning, President Obama was determined that          the U.S. Government WOULD NOT RUN THE AUTO INDUSTRY, but          Washington WOULD DECIDE who from the PRIVATE SECTOR would          run them          The decision to FIRE WAGONER as Chairman and CEO of GM.          was assumedPaulson had already pushed CEOs around          and Fired head of AIGWagoner was stunned.What President Obama had done was to form a TASK FORCE, which worked aroundthe clock.  As Alter reports:          None of these men had any experience with th4e Auto          Industry;  NO CONFLICTS.But the fates of fates of          hundreds of thousands of workers were in the hands of          NEOPHYTES!Yet, allowing the Auto Industry to fail was never even debatable!  Letting itcollapse and evaporate more than 1 Million Jobs would have sent the countryinto a DEPRESSION, writes Alter.The same would b e true for Chrysler.  Alter writes, As many as 300,000 Jobs were on the line.  A writer from Michigan, Gene Sterling writes that IT IS ALMOST A MORAL QUESTION!  I would strike out ALMOST!No one could know what a MORAL SHOCK such sudden Unemployment might do to our Country.President Obama did not get involved with the Auto Task Force, except when they would get at LOGGER HEADS with each other.  Then it wold be the President who would chair a meeting; hear all perspectives and points of view; be sure that EVERYONE HAD BEEN HEARD; AND then Make the Decision.  Alter describes both theBrain Power of the Task Force, as well as the DECISIVENESS of the President, as well as the RESPECT each Task Force Member had for the President.  He also conducts business with a sense of HUMOR:          At 9pm that Sunday, Obama and Team Auto HUDDLED          around a Speaker Phone in the Oval Officewhen          the Speaker Phone Malfunctioned, the President Joked          that it was probably from a Government Contractor.          When President Obama called the Michigan Governor,          Jennifer Granholm, Dingell and the rest of the Michigan          Delegation, it was NOT to Brief Them but rather to tell          THEM  WHAT HE HAD DECIDED          President Obama disliked cleaning up after Bush but his          meeting with the Auto Task Force and then Michigan Delegation          was a PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT:  Confront          Problems rather than PAPER THEM OVER!          It was a Big Leadership for President ObamaYet          even some members of his own party did not grasp the full          Nature of the CHRYSLER AND GM MOMENTenraged many          business peopleaccusing President Obama of trampling          on the HARD AND FAST RULES OF CAPITALISM.However, Alter goes on to remind just how in touch Obama was with our Economic Mess, which had been allowed to happen because EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE RONALD REAGAN HAD STRIPPED AWAY REGULATION AFTER REGULATION ON THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.It was that Brand of Capitalism, so called FREE MARKETS that had failed WE THE PEOPLE so miserably!  Even as the Fat Cats were getting Fatter, except for those who wold certainly go under had it not been for TARP, Stimulus and The Recovery Act.The Corporate Culture of greed and Corruption wants its cake without ANY SUPERVISION of how it distributes its profits!Alter writes that President Obama had NOT ASSAULTED THE RULE OF LAWwhilehad Had His FOOT ON THEIR NECKS, Obama moved AGGRESSIVELYto force Auto Companies to Adopt Fuel Economy StandardTHAT THEY HAD RESISTED FOR DECADES.President Obama knew what President Carter knew in the mid-1970s:  that Reducing Dependency on Foreign Oil TO BE A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE!  Alter alsosays that President Obama did NOT USE HIS LEVERAGE to tell Detroit HOW TO BUILD CARS; he left that up to the CEOS.Alter summarizes President Obamas Magnificent Effort to Present the Next Great Depression with the TARP, Stimulus and Recovery Act, even though his own POPULARITY HAS SLIPPED because he did NOT FOCUS ON JOBS FIRST:         So it was Good News/Bad News Year in the Economy. Obama         and his Economic Team had Prevented a DEPRESSIONno small         accomplishment.  The Recession was Officially Ending.  All         but $80 Billion of the $700 Billion in TARP spending had been         paid back and in 2010 A PRO[POSED NEW FEE ON BANKS WAS EN-         ACTED.  The Governments Rescue Plan would actually go INTO         THE BLACK!         After 6 Major Federal Interventions, Housing Prices, which had         expected to drop another 20%, were up 5% in 2009.  That still         left millions of Home Owners under water but in Early 2010         Administration responded with more assistance for those facing         FORECLOSURE.         WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, Warren Buffett         Concluded, If wed had a Group that behaved like a Deer         in the HEADLIGHTS:  that DEER WOULD BE DEAD!Even though the Jobs Problem lies ahead for President Obama to continue to work with CEOs and the find ways to Create Jobs, the President does not have as much control over the Creation of Jobs, as he does over the4 REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, as he has just done in the Regulation of the Financial System Act.In the meantime, Ill put my trust in Warren Buffetts Assessment.  He has a track record of usually knowing what he is talking about.Earland___________________________________________________________________________________________________The opinions of contributors are wholly the authors, and are not endorsed by worldwidehippies.Want to write your own article?
