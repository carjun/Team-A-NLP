Perfect days seems to be the common commodity in Florianpolis neighborhood of Lagoa da Conceiao, located a javelin throw from the mighty Atlantic. My friend Eric decided to stop by and chit-chat about business, a horse and teaching me a bit more of the Brasilian culture. We decided to take a stroll to Centrinho in search of his latest project  the peteca. In any event as we walked, and walked and walked, my hydrogen level evaporated. Mr. Duval kindly suggested we also find a vendor dispensing authentic Coconut water or agua de coco. As I explained my resistance to experiment exotic things, he extolled the virtues of a natural and healthy drink. If you were stuck on a deserted island with nothing else, Eric said. Coconut water has been proven to provide all the nutrients a person needs to survive. It didnt take much convincing because my throat started to resemble the Sahara. Ultimately after some seven kilometers, we tracked down a mom-and-pop operation between the surfing mecca of Praia (beach) Mole and Praia da Joaquina. The English name coconut, first mentioned in English print in 1555, comes from Spanish and Portuguese word coco, which means "monkey face." Spanish and Portuguese explorers found a resemblance to a monkey's face in the three round indented markings or "eyes" found at the base of the coconut. On the Nicobar Islands of the Indian Ocean, whole coconuts were used as currency for the purchase of goods until the early part of the twentieth century. According to knowledgebase, "coconuts are the fruit of the coconut palm, botanically known as cocos nucifera, with nucifera meaning "nut-bearing." The fruit-bearing palms are native to Malaysia, Polynesia and southern Asia, and are now also prolific in South America, India , the Pacific Islands , Hawaii and Florida. The light, fibrous husk allowed it to easily drift on the oceans to other areas to propagate. In Sanskrit, the coconut palm is known as kalpa vriksha, meaning "tree which gives all that is necessary for living," since nearly all parts of the tree can be used in some manner or another. The coconut itself has many food uses, including milk, meat, sugar and oil as well as functioning as its own dish and cup. The husk was also burned for fuel by natives, but today a seed fiber called coir is taken from the husk and used to make brushes, mats, fishnets, and rope. A very potent fermented toddy or drink is also made from the coconut palm's sap. Coconut oil, a saturated fat made from dried coconut meat, is used for commercial frying and in candies and margarines, as well as in non-edible products such as soaps and cosmetics." It turns out that coconut water is a natural isotonic beverage, with the same level of electrolytic balance as we have in our blood. During the Pacific War of 1941-45, both sides in the conflict regularly used coconut water - siphoned directly from the nut - to give emergency plasma transfusions to wounded soldiers. The experience made my day and we found the peteca we were after. I will have to explain that whole thing later. If you get the chance, give it a try  its good fresh, cold and healthy. Coconut water isn't the the only thing that is a bit different here. Driving is a different experience.        1 of 1         Seeing the World from a Different Perspective     Nathaniel Hines is based in Florianpolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (58.5%) Brazil (20.0%) India (4.2%) Canada (2.2%) 32 other countries (13.6%)           READ MORE: coconut, water, Brazil, exotic, fresh, healthy, Duval, coconut palm, Brazilian, your-story, Florianopolis, Flora, Tropics, Flora of India, Arecaceae, Flora of Pakistan, Hospitality Recreation, Coir, Tropical agriculture, coconut water, Botany   More News From: Florianpolis :  Brazil     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 18            Reply  Posted By     Andy Mathisen|4 monthsagoHA..So Nate goes Cuckoo for coconuts!

Reply  Posted By     solarp|4 monthsagoEnjoyed your article, Got some better knowledge.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|4 monthsagoIt was everything that Eric promised without the analysis. It was something that surprised me.            Reply  Posted By     paretta|4 monthsagoI am intrigued and now interested in trying coconut water. Thanks for the report!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|4 monthsagoDig in then. There is some good stuff on the internet. I imagine all the analysis means crap compared to how it worked for me.            Reply  Posted By     Mick Jerome|4 monthsagoNathaniel, Thanks for another great story! Coconut water is incredibly healthy and one of the best drinks to hydrate the body. Besides helping to remove toxins from the body and aiding digestion, coconuts have amazing anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-microbial properties that help to cure all that ails us. - jongleur            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|4 monthsagoI am trying to learn new things. This was a surprise to me.            Reply  Posted By     dunite|4 monthsagothanks nathanielinbrazil..old folks here in my country say coconut "water" also help revitalize if not cure-whatever ailments our kidneys may have if we drink a glass or two the first intake to have as we wake up in the morning..and i've been doing that whenever i can ever since..hehe            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|4 monthsagoThat was the recommendation of Eric. He said the best thing is to have one every morning.            Reply  Posted By     AjayChadha|4 monthsagoThe link to the benefits of coconut water in your article needs to be changed to http://www.knowledgebase-script.com/demo/article-320.html            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|4 monthsagoThank you for the note. I believe I will do a hyperlink.            Reply  Posted By     Punditty|4 monthsago"...Put the lime in the coconut, drink them both up..." - Harry NilssonGood stuff, Nathaniel!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|4 monthsagoGreat song too. Did you hear it in the Reservoir Dogs flick?            Reply  Reply By     Punditty|4 monthsagoActually, my memory of that song extends to when it was an AM single by Nilsson. Yes, I spend a lot of time listening to the radio as a child :-)             Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|4 monthsagoGood movie. I would recommend. The song "stuck in the middle with you" represents a lot in my life.            Reply  Posted By     lynspace|4 monthsagoIn my native village, people use coconut water as a diuretic agent to heal the kidney and the urinary bladder. It is believed to flash out kidney stones. My own experience with coconut water is always worth remembering. It is a refreshing drink even straight from the unhusked fruit.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|4 monthsagoSounds like another great benefit. Thanks for the information.
