He is a known member of the "Tango Blast" gang, and was apparently targeting the driver of the minivan in which the infant was riding.The victim was with his mother and two siblings in the van driven by 22-year-old Juan Gomez when, police said, a maroon Dodge four-door sedan approached their vehicle in the 1600 block of Cheyenne Road around 11:40 p.m. and opened fire.The victims told police they sped away from the scene and headed to their destination in South Dallas near Fair Park  not realizing that a bullet had fractured one of the infant's legs.Esther Chavez, 22, only found her son had been wounded when they started to get out of the van.The child, whose name was not available, was rushed first to Parkland Memorial Hospital and later to Children's Medical Center for surgery. He was reported to be in good condition.Cordova will face four counts of aggravated assault and one count of injury to a child. Bond was set at $50,000.E-mail cvega@wfaa.com Share this article:39 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Officer's brother kills himself after trying to rob Dallas bankNext article Dallas pastor is Christmas Eve theft suspectTo add a comment, please register or login.Add another commentLeave your comment1000 characters remainingSubmitWe welcome your comments on this story's topic.

I along with many family and friends knew Carlos when he was growing up in the Garland area. All of us are in shock. We cannot seem to understand why the teenager athlete turned into a man of drugs and crime.58099904Flag this commentluky2 said on December 30, 2010 at 12:54 PM@photo0907 @tjk1965 NO ONE IS SAYING THAT WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG HE TOOK A WRONG PATH IN LIFE LIKE I SAID BEFORE HE MAID HIS BED HE HAS TO LAY IN IT ..

He was born in the US and isn't a border jumper. I played little league ball with him and his cousin Sean on a team his uncle coached  and he started at QB our 8th grade year at Hudson Middle School.  He was smart , popular , and somebody I looked up too. All the girls wanted to date him and the guys wanted to be his homie. After 8th grade he moved to Pleasant Grove and that's when being a G and getting caught up in gang life took over . After that every time I saw him he looked worse then the time before. There is no justification for his actions. I write this not to convince anyone he is or once was a good guy but only to say : Carlos Cordova was on track to becoming a respectful and possibly successful young adult  but he was moved from a quiet small town like Sachse to a gang riddled and crime filled spot like Pleasant Grove and grew into the man in the mug shot you see today. Such a shame on how his life turned out.58064982Flag this commentphoto0907 said on December 29, 2010 at 7:26 PMOK, the guy is scum.  It doesn't matter why the mother had her children out that late at night - that is her business.  She should not have to worry about some scumbag shooting at her and her children.  It is the Christmas season so maybe they were coming home from a family get together,  who knows.  If Carlos had a problem with her or the driver of the car he could have settled it when he was certain no one else was in danger.  What kind of coward just drives up and starts shooting?  He deserves whatever he gets and I hope it will be a long stay in the prison system. This man has children of his own, would he want someone shooting at the mother of his children and the children themslves?  No, he wouldn't but he is so self-involved that he probably didn't even think of that.  Good riddance Carlos!!!58063082Flag this commentphoto0907 said on December 29, 2010 at 9:18 AMThat name was supposed to say Arya not Aniya.  You know, the tattoo that's on his neck!

He looks like he has no soul and wouldn't care at all if the baby had been killed.  @seajay - Seriously, find someone else to love.  There are many more deserving people out there.  But this guy looks like he'd as soon cut your throat than listen to you tell him how much you love him... And I agree with the many who have mentioned how low the bond was.  That is very ridiculous.  I'd be surprised if he's not already out and looking for the next victim.57994356Flag this commentkeithstone said on December 28, 2010 at 1:07 PM@Treesnow.

Bond is set, will be paid with blood money, and he'll be in Mexico in the morning only to come back with a new ID, soon to move into your neighborhood.  Seven out of ten of the most wanted violent criminals in this country are now coming from south of our borders and have multiple IDs.  Research this and find out for yourself the truth.   It is time to wake up and crack down on this invasion of vermin.57983364Flag this commentrjs123 said on December 28, 2010 at 9:55 AMCordova will face four counts of aggravated assault and one count of injury to a child.

What is the purpose for gangs when you drive around alone and shoot people.  Why didn't this lady check all of her kids when the shooting happened. That would have been the 1st thing for me.57980034Flag this commenttruetexan said on December 28, 2010 at 9:03 AMIs the judge afraid of retaliation if he doesn't set bond on this man which he should not? This guy almost killed a baby. And yet, we keep putting up with this. I bet it frustrates the police for sure.  They do their job and the justice system lets them off.57979332Flag this commenttruetexan said on December 28, 2010 at 9:01 AM"Only found her son had been wounded"? How about the guy tried to kill someone? What a reckless mean man.  I see a post here about the last happy time for Carlos.  Do you know how many people shoot and kill people and am sure they had a horrid life also. That does not give them an EXCUSE to shoot anyone.  It would be better to say this man got mixed up with the wrong people and began a life of crime. It should be attempted murder.57979243Flag this commentheino said on December 28, 2010 at 8:33 AMThere's a face only a mother could love.

Earlier today before I even knew what he had done, I found pics of him when he was just a teenager.  We were at Disney World.  I thought to myself "This was probably the last happy times Carlos ever had."  Then an hour later I see his mug shot on TV and what he was accused of.  My heart goes out to the family of the precious little boy, but my love and prayers also go out to Carlos.  Unlike most of you, I know the real story behind that ugly mug shot.  I don't know if Carlos will ever know that there are people out here who still love him too.57968054Flag this commenttjk1965 said on December 28, 2010 at 12:20 AMHe apparently knew there was a small child in this car,what a scumbag.Love the tattoo on the neck,it helps identify scum like this everytime they get stopped by the police.57967909Flag this commenttreesnow said on December 28, 2010 at 12:03 AMgummby7804043586 and keithstone  - There are lots of reasons to have young kids out late. Just off the top of my head  * they could have been returning from an emergency doctor's appointment * they could have been returning home late after visiting out of town relatives for the holidays. Or, like me, it could be part of his schedule. My graduate classes end at 10pm. This is standard in most of the universities in the metroplex (so we can teach undergrads during the afternoon). I am therefore driving home from the babysitter's with my toddler around 11:30pm 2 nights a week. Does going to school at night to get my PhD make me a bad mom deserving of having my children shot? How about judging them for something else than just having the kids out late.57967522Flag this commentgummby7804043586 said on December 27, 2010 at 11:09 PMthis people were not playing with good cards,,, there was something very wrong. they knew each other. but the question is ,,, why was this family out on the streets with the kids and in a cold night, there has to be a vadetta between this people...

They need to step up and raise men that don't follow the gang culture. That is where the real reason for the shooting, bad parenting. If anyone in my family presented this much of a threat to a child I'd turn them in. Oh wait, I did. At least the baby is doing a well as could be expected. I just hope it's mother has learned a lesson about the company she keeps.57937348Flag this commentlp1111 said on December 27, 2010 at 8:39 AMI agree that this wrong.  It is also very sad.

It is bad enough for someone to  just be doing drive by shooting or just shooting at someone's car, but when you involve innocent children that  has gone just too far. People must have lost their minds or just have no common sense anymore.
