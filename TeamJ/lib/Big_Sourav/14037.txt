Information may change rapidly as the event progresses.[edit] Case Reporting in the United States[edit] Case ClassificationThe CDC has defined three classifications for investigations of Swine-Origin Influenza A H1N1 Cases (S-OIV).[2]Confirmed: a person with an acute febrile respiratory illness with laboratory confirmed S-OIV infection by one or more of the following tests:real-time RT-PCRviral cultureProbable: a person with an acute febrile respiratory illness who is positive for influenza A, but negative for H1 and H3 by influenza RT-PCRSuspected: a person with acute febrile respiratory illness with onsetwithin 7 days of close contact with a person who is a confirmed case of S-OIV infection, orwithin 7 days of travel to community either within the United States or internationally where there are one or more confirmed cases of S-OIV infection, orresides in a community where there are one or more confirmed cases of S-OIV infection.[edit] Daily ReportingThe CDC releases a daily update on confirmed cases by state at 11:00 am ET. Many state departments of health release updates on confirmed and probable cases throughout the day. Several states have developed dedicated websites for information on the flu outbreak. Others release numbers on their department of health website or though daily press reports.All U.S. States and Puerto Rico have received testing kits and training from the CDC that permits them to do local confirmation of samples. Previously all samples had to be sent to CDC headquarters in Atlanta, causing considerable delay in reporting.The numbers from state authorities are often out of synch with those in the CDC daily report, primarily because the CDC updates its figures less frequently. For instance, the Illinois Department of Public Health updated the number of confirmed cases in Illinois to 225 at 10 a.m. CT on May 6, 2009,[50] while the CDC update at 11:00 AM ET that day showed only 122 confirmed cases in Illinois.[1] The CDC report also currently lists one trans-state case. A Kentucky woman who had returned home from Mexico later traveled to Georgia where she was diagnosed and treated for swine flu. Both Georgia and Kentucky record the case on their websites; the CDC notes the case for Kentucky.Some states, including Michigan, Massachusetts, Tennessee, have stopped reporting probable numbers since receiving their CDC testing kits. Others, such as Texas, never regularly reported probable cases.On May 14th the CDC changed its daily report from only confirmed cases to 'Confirmed and Probable cases'.^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al am an ao ap aq ar as at au av aw ax ay az ba "CDC H1N1 Flu Update: U.S. Human Cases of H1N1 Flu Infection".
