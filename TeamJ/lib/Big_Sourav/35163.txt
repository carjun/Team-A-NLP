What is the real issue? It has been argued that stricter gun laws will somehow curb the level of violent crime in America. This is, of coarse, wishful thinking from some, and a gross misrepresentation with an ulterior motive to others. So what is the real   issue? IGNORANCE... Ignorance in its classical sense describes the actions of the gun-toting criminal who walks into a restaurant or school and opens fire on the innocent, capturing the attention of a nation. Ignorance also describes the mass media who irresponsibly capitalizes on the fears of their viewers during these times of crisis, turning fear into ratings... Ignorance is the knee jerk action of the huddled masses who quickly scribble out new, fear-based legislation in the wake of tragedy, just to appease the fears of their more skittish constituents, rather than thinking through, with a calm and rational mind, the best way to serve and protect the people and   the constitution.  We are not so cold as to suggest that nothing should be done to combat the problem of violent crime, but let us take a look at the problem a little closer before blaming the tool. What exactly is ignorance? Ignorance, put simply, means "to ignore." When we ignore the deeper problems brewing in our desensitized society... when we ignore our own children and rely on TV, movies, and video games to be the sole educators of our next generation, we get Columbine. When we ignore common sense and reason, and simply lash out with PC rhetoric in a vain attempt to combat a giant weed by hacking at its branches, we get Michael Moore. Put the two spawns of ignorance together and we get a media frenzy, a myriad of knee jerk policy formation, and a highly profitable box office smash! But still, NOTHING CHANGES! We all want basically the same thing, but many of us, as usual, are fighting in the wrong field... The answer is neither easy, nor all encompassing, but it is a change that any family not already plugged in to this way of thinking needs to take more seriously than any other business in your lives! The sad fact of the matter is that most parents have almost NO IDEA what kind of world their kids are living in EVERY DAY!! In fact, most parents couldn't even tell you what their child's favorite color is... We have become so busy, as a society, that we have lost touch with our own families. Family values? Right. Most families are lucky if they can find time to share dinner together on a consistent basis. Blaming the tool accomplishes NOTHING! The only hope we have at instilling positive change in the face of this sociological mess we are creating, is EDUCATION. Put simply, education is the enemy of ignorance, not oppression.  Education of our children by us   , not just by their environment; education of the parents as to what our children are thinking.   Don't know what your child is thinking? ASK. And listen... Kid's are   a product of their environment, so instead of using this as a cop out, be the loudest part of your child's environment! This may not be easy, but it is your job! Treat it like one!  I am absolutely sick of hearing people talk about how criminals are just a product of society... a product of poverty... picked on as a child... etc.... I was raised not 30 minutes from Columbine. I was a black sheep myself. I was picked on in school, had arguments with my parents, rebelled against society, ran away from home, and was as full of angst, uncertainty, and idealism as any other kid around. I had unfettered access to numerous firearms, including a couple hunting rifles of my own... but not even once did I consider the idea of killing anyone. So what was the primary difference? EDUCATION! Instead of fearing guns, and being simultaneously fascinated with something that I wasn't allowed to touch, yet saw all the time on TV, I was shown, first hand, the destructive power of a gun. I shot my first high powered rifle when I was only five years old! I was simultaneously taught every aspect of gun safety, so that it became instinct to me to be constantly aware of which direction the barrel was pointed, keeping my finger off the trigger, keeping the safety on, etc.... I was able to get the fascination out of my system with BB guns and air rifles like many other red blooded American boys, enabling me to reserve firearms for the hunting and target practicing "tool" that they were, never losing respect for their destructive power. This practice also became a common bond between me and both my parents, which, as we all know, are all too few these days.  I am now 40 years old and have two children of my own, both of which are being raised with the very same values and education. The primary thing that lawmakers, politicians or even celebrities that voice their lofty opinions and inadvertently influence many of their fans need to keep solidly in mind is that the only real   way to combat any problem, and enjoy any measure of success, is to go straight after the root. Attacking the branches accomplishes nothing, and in many cases, actually makes matters worse! It has been said, "If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will own guns." This is absolutely true! It is naive to think that it will curb the availability of guns to criminals one bit! A felon doesn't register his weapon nor does he buy it from a store... He couldn't care less, in fact, by taking away guns from households and business owners, the prospect of robbery or home invasion just got a lot safer and easier! Career criminals would love nothing more than to see a disarmed nation! So would the government, but that's another article...  Lawmakers and slingers of PC liberal propaganda need to rethink the gravity of their present agenda. It is obvious that our country is in peril from within, but blaming the tool will not stop it from accelerating. They need to be shut down flat by ALL  Americans before hacking apart the second amendment. The ramifications stemming from the precedence it sets would be catastrophic! Surely even the strongest "Gun Control" advocate can understand that part of the argument... It is simply not in their power to do that... FOR A REASON! They need to stop wasting everyone's time and money and go after the criminals with tougher legislation until they   are the ones who are afraid! ...Afraid to commit a crime involving a firearm for fear of ruthless punishment!! Afraid to invade someone's home for fear of getting shot in the process! Afraid to approach someone at night in an attempt to rape or mug them! Afraid to attempt a carjacking!   Get the idea?  You seldom hear of the many cases of successful defense where a crime was stopped or a life was saved by a brave individual with a gun, but one that certainly caught my attention was the story of an 80 year old veteran of the Korean War who refused to be a victim and shot an armed assailant, probably saving his life, as well as the lives of his wife and 12 year old great-grandson. He decided to go against Chicago's handgun ban, and the result is that he is still alive, and there is now one less armed criminal on the streets. For his trouble, the city of Chicago is currently debating whether or not to prosecute him for unlawful carrying of a handgun within city limits. He obtained his firearm in violation of the ban after another incident where he and his wife were actually robbed at gunpoint by three assailants, so when parolee Anthony Nelson tried to break into thier home, firing two shots through a window, the 80 year old didn't hesitate, dropping the man with a single shot to the chest. THIS IS GUN CONTROL! Yet instead of being hailed as a hero, it's the homeowner who's being considered a threat and the armed predator a victim of gun violence. DO NOT give in to fearmongering or any of the PC rhetoric tearing at the fabric of our Nation's Constitution. The government was only intended for a limited purpose... for our childrens' sake, let's keep it that way!

Very Interesting!nature'sgirl7 weeks ago I am a liberal in many ways, and also think through my stance on things. I have to agree with you on gun control. The problem lies with the media and what a person is raised to believe. My father is a hunter, and I also was taught deep respect for guns.I am not a hunter myself, but I hike on the same turf as hunters and respect their space. I am a US forest service volunteer, and educate fellow outdoor enthusiasts on how to travel safely in the woods during hunting season. I want my kids to learn respect for the subject. "Teach our children well" is our duty in society. Not to be taken lightly...Jeremey2 months ago Here is one thing AR and I see eye to eye on! Nice hub shape shifter. I myself had an idea for a hub on this topic, I'll put it on the back burner, as you've made a great presentation here which I don't wish to "compete" with!lol. Gun control is one of those issues that seems as simple as you have put it but gets twisted and toyed with until its purpose and intent is lost. You've done a fine job in taking the ability of that happening way from the idea of this writing. Thanks for your support of our constitution!Coming of Age2 months ago Great article Shape Shifter.........Gun violence frequently rises when bans go into effect, the UK statistics prove this.

They neutralize power through entropy.Chaos is only bad once someone tries to order it.Thanks,DanJoey Bennett2 months ago If you are going to make the decision of owning a gun, it is important to make sure that you take courses and practice how to use it. As C.C said, it is also important to take safety courses. If you have a gun in your home, keep you gun a a locked safe where people/kids can not access it easily. It is important to have a gun for self defense, just make sure you know what you are doing before firing away.C. C.3 months ago Nice article! I agree that to many people fear guns. They should take a gun safety course and then they will be more comfortable with them and realize that MOST people with them know what they are doing.shape_shifter3 months ago I recently published this article with an exerpt about an 11 year old girl shooting two assailants during a botched home invasion. I apologise for not checking out my sources, as it turns out that this particular story is probably just an urban legend, as there is no record either way of it happening. As these types of courageous incidents actually do take place with astounding frequency, it was not hard to find another one, equally compelling, to replace it with. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, as it is my goal to promote only the facts.American Romance3 months ago The more people carry guns the safer we will all be!Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sitesCast your vote!Do you believe President Obama is representing your best interest as an American Citizen?
