While Negeri Sembilan state police declined to comment on the number of reports, it was learnt that so far, reports have been lodged by members of a non-governmental organisation, Solidariti Anak Muda Malaysia (SAMM). The reports were lodged on Wednesday by SAMM co-ordinator, Badrul Hisham Shaharin in relation to several blog postings alleging the Cabinet Minister had raped his Indonesian maid. The blog posting recently appeared on Wikileaks and local blogs. SAMM urged the police to investigate the allegations, to authenticate them or to clear the minister's reputation. Badrul said, "A person is innocent until proven guilty. However, if the police do not investigate this case, it could cause questions to arise that Ministers are protected against certain crimes." The minister in question has refuted the allegations, calling them "wild allegations" and describing them as libellious lies and awful, ugly and wicked lies. He said that he and his family would full co-operate with police in their investigations and would accept the outcome of the probe. Meanwhile, police sources say they will not decide on whether to seek the assistance of their Indonesian counterparts and Interpol, until they have studied all the reports. The maid has since returned to her country and is avoiding the media.        1 of 12         Police report lodged over allegations of rape by minister      Kenneth Ang is based in Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (46.9%) Canada (12.5%) India (12.5%) Malaysia (11.5%) 6 other countries (8.3%)           READ MORE: maid, indonesian maid, Rape, cabinet minister, Rais Yatim, badrul hisham, Najib, Bukit Aman, Chong Wei, Misbun Sidek, SAMM, solidariti anak muda malaysia, solidariti, Wikileaks, Interpol, NGO, blogs, bloggers, Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Espionage, internet censorship, Web 2.0, Whistleblowing, security, law crime, World Wide Web, Hisham Shaharin, national security, political-news   More News From: Kuala Lumpur :  Malaysia     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 4            Reply  Posted By     solarp|2 daysagoHe had gone crazy...thanks for sharing            Reply  Reply By     Kenneth Ang|1 dayagoThanks for commenting, Solarp!

Reply  Reply By     Kenneth Ang|1 dayagoThere are many possibilities but I can't speculate. It would not be fair for anyone.
