Well not to all of us, but to those of us who could use some sweetness and kindness. Certainly not to those who would, piece by piece, through lies, fear-mongering, and greed, allow this questionably honorable Senate to disassemble the very foundations of a great democracy. You may think I actually have something to say. Well, I dont. I simply want to obstruct the free flow of debate by talking continually so as to possibly stop the bill in progress which I think is totally unacceptable, and by not giving any of my worthy opponents an opportunity to discuss the matter or bring it to a vote, I might possibly stop its passage into law and wouldnt that be a hoot because all I have to do is keep talking or yield the floor to one of my like-minded colleagues. I did bring the White pages into the chamber with me just in case I cant think of anything to say. I can read names from the telephone book because what you incessantly talk about does not need to be germane to the topic in any way whatsoever, though it does in other governments of the world which employ the filibuster. Oh, yes, did you not know that the filibuster goes all the way back to Cato and the Roman Senate in 60BC. You find that surprising, dont you? This is not a new political procedural device made up by mean-spirited politicians to thwart the will of the people. Though I can easily say that it has been most egregiously used by Republicans to stop the nation from moving forward. Oh, no, the filibuster has been in existence since before Christ ever started causing trouble. Its just that in other nations there seem to be more rational rules concerning the filibuster, like you have to keep on topic, which is why one of the longest filibusters ever outside the U.S. was more than 12 hours, but here in the Greatest Country in the World, a filibuster may last much longer. Strom Thurmond spoke nonstop for 24 hours and 18 minutes, trying to prevent passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Act. Way to go Strom, god bless ya or not. The point is both democrats and republicans use this procedural tactic to stall or block the passage of a bill and whoever uses it is really being very undemocratic. Yes, you heard me, it is completely undemocratic! But, I good sirs and madams, have the floor, and Ill be damned if I will give it up until the rules for filibustering are changed or the procedure of the filibuster is banned altogether. And I warn you that should you bring to the floor a bill to amend the rules of filibustering, I can filibuster that as well! And even if the Senate should get the 3/5 vote it needs to stop the debate and bring the filibuster to cloture, I have managed to waste your hard earned tax money, and really, isnt that why we are all here? By the way, isnt that a strange little word, cloture? Why dont they just say closure which would be understood by everyone? When I was a junior senator, I actually had my staff correct all the instances used of the word cloture to closure, thinking it was a spelling or typographical error! Needless to say, I felt very stupid when I discovered it was a real word someone had made up just for the Senates use. But the oppositions bluster obviously cannot muster the 60 votes needed to bring my filibuster to a halt, so while I do have the floor, with no intention of giving it up, I may as well hint at some of the things I am going to talk about in the future. But first I have to bring to your attention how I have used bluster, muster and filibuster in the same sentence most creatively, dont you think? Now before I lose my train of thought, I have to say that during the Weeks of Denial oh, for you who do not worship the same non-god that I do, the Weeks of Denial are those between Thanksgiving and New Years Day, when one feels allowed to let the burden of the worlds problems drop from his or her shoulders. The Weeks of Denial give us a chance to take a deep breath and pretend there is nothing bad happening in the world. Nothing to worry about. Dont worry, be happy! There is no hunger, or homelessness in the world, no rape, war, diseases. There is no part of the world where there is suffering and anguish, hopelessness, fear and insecurity. None of these things exist during the Weeks of Denial. Well, they dont exist for everyone except those who are starving, homeless, traumatized by murder and rape, trying to avoid being in the crossfire of war, to shiver with fear at night, or to stare with vacant eyes into the darkness. Yes, folks, the Weeks of Denial are over and once again we can acknowledge, if we wish to, the millions upon millions of people who suffer while a very few are not touched at all or ever bother to notice. Earlier I used the phrase, the Greatest Country in the World because during those Weeks of Denial I started hearing Republicans the big wigs like Romney using the phrase American Exceptionalism, (which by the way is a word Colbert may have made up) and like copy cat killings, his republican underlings trying to start a movement of American is the Greatest Country in the World and anyone who will not speak those words out loud with meaning, is thereby not an American! Well, let me tell you right now, we are not the greatest country in the world by any stretch of the imagination. We have our share of majestic purple mountains hovering over fruited plains and maybe parts of our country are prettier than places like the Western Sahara, but by most any other metric, such as education, health care, social services, quality of life) we are far from the greatest country in the world. Simply ask yourself, do you think America is a greater country than Holland? If so, why? Do you think America is a better country than Finland? If so, why? We can argue day and night if you wish. Well, actually we will not, because I have the floor, remember? You may say nothing unless I yield the floor to you and Ill be drawn and quartered before I do that my good sir or madam from the opposition! And behind me I have members of my staff writing as fast as I am speaking and handing me notes about what to say, which topic is next, so get used to it, for I have just begun to mouth off! I intend to rant and rave over this dastardly trade off between Obama and the Repugs over the Bush tax cut extensions. I intend to challenge Obama to a duel of words because I want some answers as to how and why he reneged on some pre-2008 campaign promises like shutting down Gitmo. I am giving him the widest berth upon which rests all the valid excuses like the mess he inherited. I only want him to answer to me, and through me, the rest of the progressives in this country, why he could or would not keep his promise to close Guantanemo, why he did not use his executive power to get rid of DADT two years ago, why he signed a health care bill that did not begin to provide universal health care coverage with a public option, but caved before he had even begun to wheel and deal. And speaking of wheeling and dealing, he had to agree to an unemployment insurance extension for one measly year in trade for extending the Bush tax cuts for two more years? He couldnt have bargained a little? You only need a few days in an Indian bazaar to learn how to bargain! He couldnt have said, OK, how about the Bush tax cuts expire only for those people who make more than $2 million a year? But noooooo! The mainstream media everywhere seemed to praise his many accomplishments in the lame duck, or rather plain lame session of Cogress. Obama was praised for his compromise tax bill, which I still see as total capitulation. He received such great kudos for passing the repeal of DADT when in reality, he told Harry Reid to give it the lowest priority and put it last on the agenda in case Congress never got to it. Instead, good ol Harry slipped it first thing into the agenda and Reid deserves the credit, not Obama! Next thing the Republicans will tell him to heel. Or worse yet, Obama will announce that he is switching parties. I also want to talk about the redistricting that will now occur that we have completed the 2010 census. This is a very complicated issue. It is called Gerrymandering, which is actually named after a governor Gerry and a salamander. Go figure. And I want to talk about open primaries, partisan primaries, and the modified open primary, all of which have their pros and cons. Something to seriously consider is that an open primary just about puts the kibosh on the possibility for any viable third party in this country, let alone a truly representative government of multi-parties ala Europe. Denied the possibility of a third party, the only option left is to run progressives for office as democrats. But those topics are for another day well, maybe hours depending on whether or not enough of you from the opposition will leave, so we can ask the President of the Senate to call for a vote to end debate and vote on the bill before us, in which case my obstructionist tactics will have succeeded, but as far as I know, that scenario has never occurred. Now before I continue, I wish to read to you a letter from a little old lady from Pasadena, and though she is not from my state, I think her words are heart felt enough for a cold body as such sits in boredom before me to hear. She writes, Honorable Gentlemen and Women of the Senate, A few of you are good people, well intentioned, and reasonable. But for the most part the rest of you are rich, greedy, self-serving sycophants who serve the corporations to whom you are mere slaves. You heard me, slaves! The corporations, now that they have been conferred the same status as people, will see to it you continue doing their bidding if you want to keep winning. They will keep you enslaved to your wealth and sense of power, rather than enslaved to principles which serve the common good. And why is it that none of you can say or write my name correctly. For the umpteenth time, it is B-A-R-B- R-A, not B-A-R-B-A-R-A! And it is STRY-SAND ya know, hard S, like in sand at the beach? Repeat after me: BAR-BRA STRY-SAND! There! That wasnt so hard now, was it? You goofy, little, immature, teenagers, you! Grow up, and do it fast, please! I am a very wealthy woman, and I think it is ludicrous that I do not pay more taxes than those who are not as fortunate as I have been. You could easily increase my taxes and I wouldnt even notice. It would not be an inconvenience for a moment! I promise you, it would not be so much as a bother! If Gates and Buffet and those progressive rich people were truly patriotic, in addition to getting the wealthy to pledge monies to charities, they would get their filthy rich friends to lobby Congress to do what is fairest to all, to the common good, and that is to insist that the very rich pay more taxes! Very seriously yours, Ms. Barbra Streisand. Bar-bra Strei-sand, fellow senators! She is to me, like a Jewish Buddhist priestess. Like the Buddha, she says what does it matter if one person be happy and the holder of all wealth, whilst he stands surrounded by masses of suffering and sad people who have little or nothing? Is it not better for the one who is happy to share what he has so he may be surrounded by laughter and joy? Oh, I see one of my esteemed colleagues from the opposition is about to ask Biden to call for an end to this debate. I will understand if publishers of my words wish to cut me off for the obvious limitations of the space of a sheet of paper. I will not get angry. But for the rest of you, most cherished and distinguished colleagues of mine sitting in the grandeur of this hallowed room, if you think for a moment that you can stop, impede, or slow down the number of words I wish to spout at you in hopes you may finally realize the folly of your ways, I think you have another think coming. I intend to pursue.
