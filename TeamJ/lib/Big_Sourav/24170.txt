I'll have a poston the interviewslater tonight or tomorrow morning at the latest. She opened up about a lot of things, providing revealing details about her courtship with Scott, her nearly overnight transformationfroma successful and busy bartender to ridiculously wealthy socialite in Fort Lauderdale, her breakup with Scott when she tried to start a new life in North Carolina, her often lonely life beforeher husband'sfall, and a glimpse into her life now at the $6 million home she says is like a "tomb."  Write Comment Email to FriendNew Emails Emerge From Rothstein Ponzi ImplosionBy Bob Norman,                                                            Fri., Jan. 29 2010 @ 1:46PMSources are saying that WSFL/Sun-Sentinel reporter Jack Hambrick has filed a misdemeanor complaint against Kim Rothstein bodyguard Joe Alu alleging battery over their courthouse scuffle on Wednesday. I haven't been able to reach Hambrick, but Alu says he hasn't heard anything about it, and Fort Lauderdale Police Department spokesman Frank Sousa says they haven't received a complaint on it. I'm checking with theState Attorney's Office, but for now it remains arumor. There'smuchmore interesting informationcomingfrom attorney Bill Scherer in hislegal battle withMichael Szafranski, the "independent verifier" onScott Rothstein'sbogus settlement deals and head of a feeder fund that put millions into the scheme.Scherer yesterdayfileda new response to Szafranski's motion todisqualify the lawyer from the case.You can see the extraordinary filinghere (scroll down to the bottom of the document to read the emails in their entirety). In it, Schererincludes numerous emailsthat went back and forth between Szafranski andScott Rothstein asthe Ponzi scheme unraveled in late October.The emails provide a wealth of information and insight into the scandal, including key financial informationof some of those involved. Rothstein comes across as cocky and blustering even as his empire is collapsing before his eyes.He's clearly the alpha male in the close relationship with Szafranski (both men routinely end their emails with variations of "love you," and at one point, Szafranski, or "Mikey," as he calls himself,refers to Rothsteinas "master"). Szafranski is clearly panicked byRothstein's erraticbehavior and disappearance, though he doesn't realize that his close friend was fleeing the country."[C]an you plz call me so I know bob norman didn't steal your bbery [Blackberry] and start answering ur email," Szafranski joked in an email onOctober 27, just a few hours before Rothstein boardedaGulfstream V jetand flew to Morocco.As Szafranski takes flack from Rothstein investors like Mel Lifshitz, Ira Sochet, and someone called "Barrie" (it's not clear if that's Barry Bekkedam or another investor, but he has ties to Rothstein funder Coquina Investments of Corpus Christi, Texas), Rothstein repeatedly calls them  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendBehind the Rothstein Auction: Artists and Political OperatorsBy Bob Norman,                                                            Fri., Jan. 29 2010 @ 6:00AMRemember this Godfather 3 painting that Scott Rothstein kept at his doorway in the administrative corridor outside the inner sanctum? Of course you do, especially since it was the inspiration behind the moniker ofa hall-of-fame Pulp presence (Godfather 3). But guess who painted it... ah, you'll never get it. It was Patti Morse, wife of car dealer Ted Morse, who was both Rothstein's best friend and apparent victim, him and his family (including dad Ed, who actually made the money) having been defrauded out of more than $100 million.I like Patti's painting. When I saw it during Kendall Coffey's tour of the office, I searched for it, expecting it to have come from a known artist. But no, it's the work of Patti, who is also somehow connected to a small Christian book publishing company. UPDATED: The Godfather painting, I learned, sold for$500, not quite as muchas the works of New York artist Charles Fazzino, an apparent Rothstein favorite, fetched at the auction. The Ponzi schemer had two pieces commemorating Yankee Stadium by Fazzino that went for $1,600 and $3,500, respectively.The more interesting action, though, came on the political stuff. For instance, dark and devious Republican campaign operative Randy Nielsen was there bidding up on the Crist photos and other Republican-related memorabilia. I'm told he snapped up several items of that ilk. Nielsen is an attack-ad specialist with  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendAlu Video/Comment Cleaner By Bob Norman,                                                            Thu., Jan. 28 2010 @ 4:48PMIt's not much, but it's what we got.

Szafranski's job was to work as an "independent verifier" for investors to make sure money put in Rothstein's settlement deals was safe. Szafranski was supposed to have not only verified Rothstein bank account information but also to have met the defendants and plaintiffs in Rothstein's fake settlements, right down to inspecting their driver's licenses. He also allegedly had full access to the TD Bank trust accounts tied to the scheme. In addition to serving as verifier,Szafranskialsoformed a feeder fund for Rothstein's scheme called ABS Capital Funding that is now claiming $31 million in losses in the bankruptcy.Considering his deep involvement, it's not surprising that onOctober 30, as the scheme collapsed and Rothstein had already secretly fled to Morocco,Szafranski was panicking. According to a groundbreaking affidavit by attorney Bill Scherer that was filed in civil court yesterday, Szafranski sent Rothstein the following "frantic" email regarding an investor Szafranski called "Melly" (it's not clear whether he's referring to apparent investor Mel Lifshitz). The email:From: Michael SzafranskiTo: Scott Rothstein Subject: Plz read. Banyon mellyDate: Friday, October 30, 2009 6:00:52 PMI have spokent to melly.

Then a fight broke out between Kim Rothstein's body guard and a TV reporter. In other words, it was just another eventful day in the Rothstein scandal."Guilty," Rothstein said when federal Judge James Cohn asked for his plea. A subdued and shackled Rothstein didn't have to say much more to the judge before he walked out of the courtroom. He glanced at least onceat his wife but they didn't appear to communicate.Kim Rothstein was accompanied by herattorneys, Frank Rubino and Scott Saidel, her friend Stacie Weissman, and bodyguard Alu. Also in attendance wereScott's parents, Gay and Harvey Rothstein, there to support their son. After Rothstein pleaded guilty the judge set his sentencing for May 6. For the diehards, here's a link to the Rothstein plea agreement. Outside the courthouse Kim Rothstein addressed the media. "Today is the saddest day of my life," she began. Then she said that her life had been  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendKim Rothstein Making Post-Ponzi Public SplashBy Bob Norman,                                                            Wed., Jan. 27 2010 @ 9:04AMKim with anotherRRA wife.So Scott Rothstein pleads guilty this morningand his wife, Kim, will be there to stand by his side. Or at least behind him, in the gallery with the media. He'll be shackled before the judge, after all. Yesterday, as you know, the woman called Kimmie gave a brief and somewhat strange interview to Rothstein favorite Rosh Lowe of Channel 7. Today she'll be at the 9:30 a.m. court hearing. She's even got a P.R. person, one Valerie Zucker, who owns Zucker Public Relations in Fort Lauderdale, doing work for her. She didn't have an exactly auspicious start yesterday in the TV interview. She was defiant and seemingly evasive, deflecting questions about her marriage with Rothstein by saying, "The truth is that people don't know anything about me. That's that." She said she still loves Scott, adding that she thinks he "returned to do the right thing." That sounds a whole lot like Rothstein himself. And she said that she had no way to know her husband was a crook. "He was the CEO of a major law firm, the rainmaker," she answered. "We had at least ten other businesses; what wouldhave me suspect anything? What?"Suffice it to say that it looks like thoseodd-looking blue contact lenses affected her vision. I'll be updating this post after the court hearing.

Stiles)Ritter supported Chait's controversial housing project in Tamarac and voted as a commissioner to approve iton August 22, 2006 2008. Chait's firm, Prestige Homes, which he owns with son Shawn, who has also been criminally charged, won the county's approval for the project, which was to be built on two golf courses, Monterrey and Sabal Palms. Before her vote to approve the project, Ritter didn't disclose that she had received the cart, which she claimed to me in a phone call today was worth less than $500. Her father, Ed Portner, was[Corrected] VICE mayor of Tamarac at the time and was also a crucial supporter of the project.After I asked her about the golf cart allegation, Ritter confirmed Chait had given her a golfcart from one of the golf courses he'd purchased to build townhomes. She initially indicated that the cartwas an in-kind contribution from Chait when she was running for office, but thensaid she couldn't remember if it was a contribution or if she paid for it. "It might have been an in-kind contribution, it might have been a personal check, but it was under $500,"Ritter saidduring a lunch break at today's county commission meeting.

He raked inabout $1 million from the tiny town, including $429,000 inone 14-month period.What did he do? He wrote grant proposals, many of them to the county. Critics said he was paid the big money because he had the pull on the commission with his wife to guarantee a windfall from the county. I first reported in 2005that Wasserman-Rubin had voted onher husband's grants. Oneof the votesleddirectly to at least $15,000 in bonuses for her husband. Wasserman-Rubin was part of a clique of politically connected profiteers who raked inwindfalls by gaining virtual control over the town and exploitingits large swaths of open land, some of the last remaining in the county.

Just to give you an idea ...About 6 a.m., a 2007 Ford Explorer carrying at least two joyriding youthswent off the road and became stuck on the tracks. Broward Sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene to find the youths, 20-year-old Archibald Ryan IV and Bryan Rogers, whose 20th birthday was that very day.While it's not mentioned on the police report, BSO sourcessay bothhad beendrinking and were in no shape to drive. The Explorer was owned by Rogers' family, but hetold deputies he wasn't driving.Rogers said the driver had taken off on foot.At some point after the Explorer crashed on the tracks,a rocktrain with 164 cars came rumbling south down the tracks and struck the Explorer,demolishing it. Nobody was injured.The value of the totaled Explorer was estimated at $20,000."Both passengers could not give me any information about the driver or how the vehicle became stuck on the tracks," wrote Dep. Terry Hanstein in a short, two-paragraph accident report.And that was that.Hanstein and his fellow deputiesconcluded the investigation on the spot and never determined the identity of the driver. There is no indication that either youth was given a Breathalyzer (underaged drinking is a crime in Florida). To this day, information is sparse since BSO refuses to answer any questions about it. "The report speaks for itself," said BSO spokeswoman Dani Moschella.Perhaps, butit doesn't say much.The reportdoesn't mention, for instance, thatBryan Rogers'father arrived on scene that morning.Nor does it specify that Rogers'father is BSO Maj.
