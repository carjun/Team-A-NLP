In the collective unconscious of the individual, history prepares itself; and when the archetypes are activated in a number of individuals and come to the surface, we are in the middle of history, as we are at present. The archetypal image which the moment requires gets into life, and everybody is seized by it. That is what we see today. I saw it coming: I said in 1918 that the 'blond beast' is stirring in its sleep, and something will happen in Germany. ...C. G. Jung; Lecture 5; 1935.The gunman is an archetypal image in American history. It is an image that has been resurfacing in American political culture, especially since 2008.  Tea Party activists in particular are the agents of this image  wearing side-arms to political events; holding signs that call for blood to nurture the tree of democracy; and with politicians using the code words of violence in their speeches.This violent urging has been fertilized by the feces fanning of rabid right-wing journalists. Over and over, they deliver a steady message of violence. If these coded messages were hidden, we would call them subliminal. However, they are open and obvious in their appeal to the subconscious fears and hatreds of their audience.When discussing levels of consciousness, I combine Jung and Ouspensky: we have a population in the United States that includes a significant number of undeveloped people who inhabit the lower levels of human consciousness. They appear awake in most visually measurable ways (with the exceptions of those with tea bags pinned on their hats), but are actually as unconscious as a robot, an electric can-opener, or a lawn-mower. Their behaviors are programmed entirely by way of outside stimuli: they believe, for example, in the lies of Glenn Beck. They are convinced that Obama was born anywhere but the USA and is a racist; while worrying that non-white Mexican and Muslim people threaten their very existence. When one takes measure of the sum total of all the highly energized low-level consciousness of thousands of Tea Party robots, supported in part by not only the amoral and immoral energies of the larger economic/political system, the sad fact is that our nation risks more of the mindless, destructive violence that took place in Tucson yesterday. For when a society has been fed a steady diet of fear and hatred, what is rooted soon blooms into the paranoid violence that killed  among others  a nine year old girl. Yet some question why is the USA feared and hated. It is because it is channeling the fear and hatred that finds expression in mass shootings, at home and abroad.It is harder to view a picture correctly, when you are inside the frame. We see that the on-going divide on this forum finds expression in the examination of this tragic shooting. Some people say that they are not able, for example, to see any connection between the violent rhetoric of Tea Party politicians, and this shooting. I believe that they are sincere. But their vision is limited by blind spots.There are also good people here, who question if this deadly act will help wake up Americans to the dangers posed by the violent imagery that has saturated the political-social discourse. We do need to wake America up. Yet that cannot be accomplished by way of the sleeping aides that are routinely administered by the media, or the social novocaine that Washington injects into society daily.While the fog of unconsciousness can happen to groups, consciousness takes place one individual at a time. It can only begin to spread at the local, grass-roots level. But it can happen, if we all do our part.Thanks,H2O ManRefresh|+20 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadthey are not able to see ...CountAllVotesJan-09-11 01:17 PM#1I hate to admit that you are right on.rgbeckerJan-09-11 01:20 PM#2it just proves one thingCountAllVotesJan-09-11 01:23 PM#4I really don't believe in a literal Hell!LongTomHJan-09-11 01:32 PM#6fair enoughCountAllVotesJan-09-11 01:37 PM#7krelenyJan-09-11 01:21 PM#3Hate and fear are emotions and have little to do with conscious thinkinglunaticaJan-09-11 01:26 PM#5Those who have produced the imagery andTsiyuJan-09-11 01:38 PM#8domo arigato Mr. RobotohfojvtJan-09-11 02:16 PM#9I agree 100%H2O ManJan-09-11 02:37 PM#10Awakening of consciousness often requires a crisis, yet such crisis may push people to deeper sleepkgnu_fanJan-09-11 02:41 PM#11I agree.H2O ManJan-09-11 04:44 PM#12.kgnu_fanJan-09-11 06:04 PM#14We must defeat themmonkJan-09-11 05:13 PM#13Willful blindness is no longer tolerableupi402Jan-09-11 06:15 PM#15If I thought thatH2O ManJan-09-11 06:44 PM#16Sometimes that is related to life experiences.mmonkJan-09-11 06:55 PM#17Definitely.H2O ManJan-09-11 06:56 PM#18Youupi402Jan-09-11 07:00 PM#19CountAllVotes      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:17 PMResponse to Original message1.they are not able to see ...Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 01:18 PM by CountAllVotesThey see it alright it and they are enjoying every second of this.This is their wet dream come true.

And a steady diet of this energy creates an addiction to it which in turn leads to more seeking of hate and fear.The addiction and the delivery of the 'drug' of negative emotion needs to be addressed.I agree with you.  But I think it is incidents like this terrorist act that cause many to expand their consciousness a little more.

They need to encourage their followers to have respect.But how can they do this, when Fox and the Koch Bros have spent billions to frame everything in terms of War? Battle? Lock and Load? Aim high and RELOAD? Next time we bring the guns? These people are traitors and enemies? Water the tree of liberty (with the blood of a nine-year-old baby)?"The only hope is that the Palins and Becks and Hannity's and O'Rielly's realize how vulnerable they become if political sentiment reverses among the sleep-walking and their brainwashed, crazed followers turn on them.This is what keeps Limbaugh spinning the Hate Plates over his head every day. He knows if his dozen or so delusional listeners ever feel betrayed by him, he's toast.So they will keep pumping the hate.No matter what we say. No matter how wrong it is.The American Dream indeed....Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Tophfojvt      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:16 PMResponse to Original message9.domo arigato Mr. RobotoAre there really lots of robots?  I have never met one that I know of. I have known some people with what I consider to be strange ideas. The goofy guy on the bus in Utah in 1986 talking about Jesus coming back "and I mean real soon", the young lady working in the soup kitchen with me babbling about Nostradamus, the unbalanced but fairly smart fellow going on about the Privacy Act of 1974 and Copernicus, and even John, the quasi-homeless guy on mental disability who also made a whole bunch of anti-bush bumpersickers, but none that I would consider completely programmed.I think the majority probably live unexamined lives, just sorta doing what is expected of them - getting the job, working the job, buying the toys and the latest 'must have' and just sort of eating, drinking, and working their way through life. To a degree, we probably all do that. We certainly all have to eat and drink.The average tea-partier, though, sorta goes beyond that. They are trying to figure out what is going on. Sure, maybe for some of them they believe a conspiracy where there is a cover-up to hide the fact that Obama was not born in the United States. But then on our side are people who believe that John Hinckley was somehow programmed by Bush Sr. to shoot at Reagan so that Bush could become President seven years early, and where JR Bush's National Guard record was altered or destroyed to cover up the fact that he was AWOL back in the 1970s.If one is possible, then why not the others? If some believe one after doing a little bit of reading (and some do an astounding amount of digging into these things) then why are others who believe different theories after reading or hearing about them somehow reduced to the level of robots?Something that I think is dangerous and un-called for, is to dehumanize political enemies. Back when Bush was President, some in the media and in letters to the editor claimed that those protesting the President were somehow evil, they were haters of the President and of America, or those who were good people were just being used by some shadowy groups with nefarious goals.Since the election of Obama, I see the same type of rhetoric used by the left. Makes me feel like there are clowns to the left of me and jokers to the right. Each side determined to hate and dehumanize the other.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopH2O Man      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:37 PMResponse to Reply #910.I agree 100%that you are unaware of if you interact with them or not.

We have so many things we can not talk about. In such an environment, it is not safe to "wake up". It is dangerous, in fact. It is much easier and simpler to dream a dream.To be awake, you are basically alone, unless, you are lucky enough to find someone in your community who is already awake, unafraid and skillful. For most of us in the current situation, we are forced to support and adhere to this official version of "American Dream", a fantasy built on unspeakable bloodshed, hidden history of tremendous suffering imposed on "invisible people". Yes, this "dark knowledge" will never leave our consciousness, yet we can not find a safe environment to talk about them and to develop them into a social dialogue. We can not easily allow them to come into the surface of our awareness, due to this powerful taboo called "American Dream". When we briefly awake from this stupor, and if we decide to elaborate on it, but if you do not want to be excluded or banned from your own community, we have to speak carefully, using "coded" language to communicate this knowledge or share our insight. Many of us have not learn to be skillful code talkers....Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopH2O Man      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 04:44 PMResponse to Reply #1112.I agree.Well said.

But I believe that they are sincere, though blind in regard to the dynamics going on around them. (There are, obviously, a few people who "visit" just to stir shit. Their contributions here are utterly meaningless.)But the people that I have the most respect for on this forum -- many of whom I have friendships with -- recognize what is going on in America today. And it can be almost frustrating to have some of our fellow DUers insist that because they can't "see" something, it doesn't exist .... unless we remember that they are no different that infasnts who believe that the only things that exist are those that happen to be in the same room with them at that exact moment.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmmonk      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:55 PMResponse to Reply #1617.Sometimes that is related to life experiences.That is, to be able to see.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopH2O Man      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:56 PMResponse to Reply #1718.Definitely.Environmental factors play a large role.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topupi402      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 07:00 PMResponse to Reply #1619.Youcalm me.Thanks to you parents or whatever it was that formed you into what and who you are.I'm grateful for a lot in this life.
