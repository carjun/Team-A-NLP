James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, to brief lawmakers in a last-moment bid to secure GOP support for the treaty. The aides cautioned that Clappers appearance is not yet confirmed.Senate Democrats hope to ratify the treaty by Wednesday at the latest. They then plan to pass a 9/11 healthcare bill and confirm a group of judicial and executive appointments that could keep the Senate in session right up until Christmas Eve..In Sunday-evening surprise, Senate passes food safety legislationThe Senate passed the Food Safety and Modernization Act on Nov. 30 by a vote of 73-25. But the bill was later invalidated by a technical objection because it was a revenue-raising measure that did not originate in the House  Senate staff had failed to substitute the food safety language into a House-originated bill.***Democrats first attempted to attach the food safety bill to the two-and-a-half-month spending measure but Republicans balked because they wanted to keep that measure clean, according to Senate aides.Republicans, however, later agreed to pass it by voice vote.Reid announced he would send the legislation  this time properly attached to a House-originated measure  back to the lower chamber for final approvalSenate expected to vote Tuesday on funding measureThe Senate is expected to cast a key procedural vote Tuesday on a spending measure freezing federal worker pay.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Sunday evening filed a cloture motion to end debate on a continuing resolution, which would fund the government through March 4. A spokesman for the Senate Appropriations Committee said the vote on that motion would be Tuesday.Sixty votes are required to end debate. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Sunday said he and Reid had a deal on the funding measure, though a Senate Democratic aide said there are still some outstanding issues.The 36-page measure provides a small increase of $1.16 billion over fiscal 2010 levels, according to a summary produced by the Senate Appropriations Committee late Sunday. It also includes the two-year freeze on federal civilian worker pay proposed this month by President Obama..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Law, Media, Military, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesFood Safety Bill, Legislation passed, Senate Majority Leader Reid, Spending Budget for the Government, STARTRead moreWelcome to the NEW Senator John McCainDecember 20, 2010jamesb1018 commentsThe New York Newspapers have gone to calling him McWeasel for his stance against the 9/11 Healthbill..The Bitter Fall of John McCainJoe Klein: I used to know a different John McCain, the guy who proposed comprehensive immigration reform with Ted Kennedy, the guy  a conservative, to be sure, but an honorable one  who refused to indulge in the hateful strictures of his partys extremists. His public fall has been spectacular, a consequence of politics  he needed to be reelected  and personal pique. Hes a bitter man now, who can barely tolerate the fact that he lost to Barack Obama.McCains new role: GOP agitatorAfter Democrats scrapped a massive $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill Thursday, McCain gloated about its defeat  and Democrats fumed. When he took a whack at efforts to bring up a bill aimed at helping Sept. 11 first-responders, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reacted fiercely. And as he went down fighting Saturday on the repeal of the militarys dont ask, dont tell policy, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was baffled, saying, I dont understand it.Power playerFresh from a whopping electoral victory Nov. 2, McCain is inserting himself into the biggest issues of the day, acting as a power player in the Senate and angering Democrats. And while Mitch McConnell may be the Senate GOP leader, McCain has embraced a role as the leading Republican agitator against PresidentBarack Obama, who defeated him in the 2008 presidential election.Its kind of expected,Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said of McCains approach. Its sort of the John McCain of 2010.At least one senator isnt very forgiving of the straight-shooting, hot-tempered McCain. In October, McCain rippedSen. Barbara Boxer on the campaign trail for being the most anti-defense senator and accused her of endangering national security  and the California Democrat is still ticked off.He makes things up. He loses control. That was an example, she said in an interview.When asked whether he still believes what he said about Boxer, McCain said, Sure.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesA bitter man, Anti-Defense, Obstinate, Partisan, Power player, Senator John MCain (R-Arz)Read moreThe Senate may make another try at the 9/11 Health Bill.December 18, 2010jamesb101No commentsLets see if the Republicans can do the right thing for 9/11 heros who are suffering.Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)9/11 Health Bill Wins Support From G.O.P.Following the Senates vote to repeal the ban on gays serving in the military, Ms. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said Democrats intended to resurrect the health initiative in the coming days after falling three votes short of breaking afilibuster against it earlier this month.We have the votes we need, Ms. Gillibrand said. We have indications from several Republicans that they very much want to vote for this bill.The$7.4 billion measure is intended to provide medical care to workers and others who had become ill as a result of being exposed to toxic debris and fumes at the site of the World Trade Center attack in 2001.Republicans have raised concerns about how to pay for the program, and Ms. Gillibrand said the bills authors have identified ways to cover the costs through new federal fees that are acceptable to enough Republicans to advance the measure. It stalled on a party line vote of 57 to 42 when 60 votes were required.She said the Senate could consider the measure after it concludes debate over a nuclear weapons treaty..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Health, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updates, WomenAfter START vote, James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, Sen.

Extra air turbulence likely speeds up this heat exchange, so crops stay slightly cooler during hot days. On cold nights, turbulence stirs the lower atmosphere and keeps nighttime temperatures around the crops warmer.In this case, we anticipate turbines effects are good in the spring and fall because they would keep the crop a little warmer and help prevent a frost, said Takle. Wind turbines could possibly ward off early fall frosts and extend the growing season.Other benefits of wind turbines could result from their effects on crop moisture levels. Extra turbulence may help dry the dew that settles on plants beginning in late afternoon, minimizing the amount of time fungi and toxins can grow on plant leaves. Additionally, drier crops at harvest help farmers reduce the cost of artificially drying corn or soybeans.Another potential benefit to crops is that increased airflows could enable corn and soybean plants to more readily extract atmospheric CO2, a needed fuel for crops. The extra turbulence might also pump extra CO2 from the soil. Both results could facilitate the crops ability to perform photosynthesis.Takles wind turbine predictions are based on years of research on so-called agricultural shelter belts, which are the rows of trees in a field, designed to slow high-speed natural winds.In a simplistic sense, a wind turbine is nothing more than a tall tree with a well-pruned stem. For a starting point for this research, we adapted a computational fluid model that we use to understand trees, said Takle. But we plan to develop a new model specific to wind turbines as we gather more data.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Media, UpdatesC02 exchange, Mimicking trees, Warm the crops marginally, Wind Mills aiding crops in growthRead moreObama Signs Child Nutrition Bill, Kids Michelle About Sleeping on the Couch.December 13, 2010jamesb101No commentsPresident Obama signed anutrition bill on Monday with funding to improve food choices for children, a central element of First Lady Michelle Obamas anti-obesity crusade. Obama joked that getting Congress to pass it was a priority for him.Not only am I very proud of the bill, but had I not been able to get this passed, I would be sleeping on the couch, the president said as he introduced his wife at the bill signing event at a Washington, D.C., elementary school.Mrs. Obama seemed to take the inference about their home life in stride, replying, And all kidding aside, my husband worked very hard to make sure that this bill was a priority in this session, and I am grateful to you.Because I would have been sleeping on the couch, the president repeated..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updates, WomenChild Nutrition Bill sent to Obama, Men...Sleeping on the couch, Michele Obama sponsoredRead moreRepublicans Block U.S. Health Aid for 9/11 WorkersScrewing the Everyday Heros of 9/11.December 9, 2010jamesb10118 commentsIn a Thank You Heres the finger.To all those that responded selfishly to aid and assist the more than 2,000 killed on 9/11.The Republicans have blocked the passage of a bill that would those in medical need pay for their ills.While holding fast to their pledge to secure tax relieve for those who dont need it trumped theirparties goals.These brave people will have to assume the cost of continued medical treatment on their own should the Republicans choose to block the measure again.Atta boy GOP!Good frigging job!Screw some more Americans who are everyday heros.In a vote largely along party lines, the Senate rejected a procedural move by Democrats to end debate on the 9/11 health bill and to bring it to a vote; 60 yes votes were needed, but the move received 57, with 42 votes against.Republicans have been raising concerns about how to pay for the $7.4 billion measure, while Democrats, led by SenatorKirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, have argued that there was a moral obligation to assist those who put their lives at risk during rescue and cleanup operations at ground zero.The bill is formally known as theJames Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, named after a New York police detective who participated in the rescue efforts at ground zero. He later developed breathing complications that were common to first responders at the site, and he died in January 2006. The cause of his death became a source of debate after the citys medical examiner concluded that it was not directly related to the attacks.After the vote, RepresentativeCarolyn B. Maloney of New York, a chief sponsor of the bill in the House, argued that Democrats should include the 9/11 health bill in the larger tax-cut legislation and, in the process, dare Republicans to oppose it in that context. Ms. Maloney added that the tax bill was the one piece of legislation that Republicans wont leave this town without passing.As the day wore on, it appeared increasingly unlikely that the Senate would include a provision providing health care for ground zero workers in any tax package it brought to the floor, according to senior Capitol Hill officials. But supporters of the 9/11 legislation said there was a possibility they could persuade Democratic leaders in the House to include it in any tax-cut plan that the chamber approved and win Senate approval during negotiations over differences in measures passed by the two chambers.The Senate action was a blow to sponsors of the bill, who mobilized a network of allies across the political spectrum to lobby on its behalf, including the New York City police commissioner,Raymond W. Kelly, and MayorMichael R. Bloomberg. Ms. Gillibrand, the chief sponsor in the Senate, even reached out to former PresidentGeorge W. Bush.
