Colonel Philip Aguer said soldiers fought with fighters loyal to rebel leader Gatluak Gai in the south's Unity State. It was not immediately clear if the victims were members of the army or militants. The attack comes ahead of a referendum in southern Sudan that gives the voters a choice between staying united with the rest of Sudan or breaking away to form an independent country. The region is widely expected to choose independence. The week-long poll, beginning Sunday, was promised in the 2005 peace agreement that ended Sudan's civil war between the Muslim majority north and the mainly Christian and animist south. The U.N. Security Council has expressed deep concern about the lack of an agreement on the future of the oil-producing Abyei region. Abyei was scheduled to hold a separate referendum Sunday to decide whether to join the north or the south, but the poll was put off because of disputes over who would be eligible to vote. The disputes have sparked fears that regardless of the outcome of the balloting, Sudan may plunge back into civil war. Sudanese President Omar al-BashirOmar al-Bashir has made comments to allay fears of war, saying the north will celebrate the south's independence if that is what voters choose. The U.S. Carter Center has dispatched 100 observers to monitor the vote in Sudan and at overseas polls. The U.N. refugee agency said an average of 2,000 people per day have been heading south for the referendum. Nearly 4 million southern Sudanese are registered to vote in the week-long poll.        1 of 12         Southern IDPs children look at students from southern Abyei oil region demonstrating outside the South Sudan coordinator office against the delays of the Abyei referendum in Khartoum      mfaisalrafique is based in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (51.7%) United Arab Emirates (30.0%) Pakistan (5.0%) United Kingdom (3.3%) 4 other countries (5.0%)           READ MORE: political-news, Sudan Peoples Liberation Army, War Conflict, political-news, Gatluak Gai, Sudan, Philip Aguer, Umm Durmn, Omar al-Bashir, Second Sudanese Civil War, Politics of Sudan, referendum, Abyei, Southern Sudanese independence referendum, independence referendum, Comprehensive Peace Agreement, South Sudan Ahead, geography   More News From: Umm Durmn :  Sudan     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Sudan: an unidentified armed group kills civilians in Abyei By: abeeralmadawy      An unidentified armed group has killed civilians in Abyei, according to what was said by Agence of France-Press , knew from Deng Arup Cool is a senior administrators of this region said"unidentified armed group attacked the civilians in the area Macaire, 20 km north of Abyei.
