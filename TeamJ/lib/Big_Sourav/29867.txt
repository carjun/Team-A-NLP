'There has been an incredible increase in death threats against Mrs Palin since the tragedy in Arizona, since she's been accused of having the blood of those victims on her hands,' aide Rebecca Mansour told USA Today. A strong advocate for the second amendment - the right to bear arms - Sarah Palin will speak about her hunting experiences experiences and how politics affect the current state of hunting and fishingA nation mourning: President Barack Obama comforts astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as he arrives at the memorial service for the shooting victims in Tucson on January 12 'When you start to accuse people of having the blood of innocent people on their hands, it incites violence,' she was quoted as saying.The former vice presidential candidate became a lightning rod for criticism after the Tucson massacre over her aggressive political posturing.Just three days ago President Barack Obama pleaded for an end to bitter political recriminations over the Arizona massacre as he honoured those killed and injured in the shootings.More...'This is my genocide school': The creepy YouTube video filmed by Arizona gunman as he roamed campus at nightPolice find bizarre photos of Arizona gunman wearing red G-string while posing with his firearm... developed on the morning of massacreThe President chose a highly charged memorial service in Tucson on Wednesday as the moment to enter the debate over whether a climate of political 'vitriol' motivated the gunmanHe told the 30,000-strong crowd: 'The forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us.'In a 35-minute speech which was one of the toughest tests of his presidency, Mr Obama urged the nation to overcome its divisions and behave in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Tragedy: Gabrielle Giffords is rushed to the hospital with a gunshot wound to the head one week ago today. Aide Daniel Hernandez, who may have saved her life by pressing his hands to her wound, is at her sideMiracle survival: Miss Giffords, left, survived the shooting, astounding doctors - though six others died at the gunman's hands. Right, Jared Loughner, who is accused of the shootingsI believe we can be better, he told a capacity crowd at Arizona Universitys sports arena. Those who died here, those who saved lives here  they help me believe. We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another is entirely up to us.'Using carefully chosen words, Mr Obama was clearly seeking a turning point in the raw debate that has dominated national politics over the past week.Both sides have accused one another of political point-scoring over the massacre even as the sheriff investigating the killings, Clarence Dupnik, said the atmosphere of political 'vitriol' had pushed the gunman over the edge in the first place.Polls have shown that the majority of Americans reject that claim, believing in the words of Daily Show host Jon Stewart that 'you can't outsmart crazy'. Jon Stewart has said that 'vitriolic rhetoric' is not to blame for last Saturday's shooting in ArizonaThe satirical news host voiced the opinions of many when he said on his first show after the shootings: 'We live in a complex ecosystem of influences and motivations and I wouldn't blame our political rhetoric any more than I would blame heavy metal music for Columbine.'However, he added that it was important for politicians to watch how they spoke to each other on TV and not to whip up a poisonous political atmosphere.'I do think that its important for us to watch our rhetoric. I do think that its a worthwhile goal not to conflate our political opponents with our enemies if for no other reason than to draw a better distinction between the manifesto of paranoid mad men and what passes for acceptable political pundit speak,' he said.Palin will be watched closely to see if she mentions the Tuscon shootings that left six people deadBut Sarah Palin has shrugged off suggestions that she should tone down her rhetoric by going ahead with her planned sell-out speech at a marquee gun rights event in Reno, Nevada later this month. The Safari Club International, a group that calls itself the leader in protecting the freedom to hunt and promoting wildlife conservation worldwide, runs the annual conference.Mrs Palin is an outspoken advocate of the Second Amendment.She will address a sold-out crowd of 20,000 people with as speech based on her past hunting experiences and how politics affect the current state of hunting and fishing.The former Alaska governor will be closely watched to see if she mentions the Tucson shooting that left six dead and fourteen injured, including Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.She defended herself after coming under fire following the tragedy because she used an illustration of gun sights on her website to target Democrat districts  including Giffords  that were vulnerable to challenges from Republicans during the mid-term elections last November.She was also blasted for using the phrase Dont retreat  reload afterPresident Obamas healthcare reforms were passed in Congress.Under fire: Palin defended herself after using this illustration of gun sights on her website to target Democrat districts, including Gabrielle Giffords', vulnerable to mid-term election challenges.Attacking critics who said the vitriolic political climate contributed to the killings, she spurred more controversy by branding the medias treatment of her as a blood libel.'After this shocking tragedy, I listened at first puzzled, then with concern, and now with sadness, to the irresponsible statements from people attempting to apportion blame for this terrible event,' she said in a video posted on her Facebook page on Wednesday.Fox News host Glenn Beck has already called on Mrs Palin to increase her security in light of the anger against her.'An attempt on you could bring the Republic down,' he said. Mrs Palin has made no secret of her support for the right to bear arms. She was filmed on a hunt for her TLC reality show, Sarah Palins America.Some liberal lawmakers are trying to promote gun control legislation in the wake of the shootings. But few analysts give them any chance of succeeding.

Lola, where have you been? She does indeed retreat - had you not noticed that she's a quitter? She left office before her term was over, which you seem to have conveniently forgotten. There's nothing inspiring about being a loser.- Caroline, Hamilton, Canada, 15/1/2011 15:26Click to rateRating36Report abuseThough I am far from a supporter of Sarah Palin and would work hard against any political nomination she may seek, she is not responsible for the violent acts of Jared Loughner. He is obviously a mentally disturbed person. Now she should have been more careful in the wording of her response but can be said of most of what she says. Though she has a great appeal to her base I do believe that the general American public is intelligent enough to keep her out of the Presidents office... hopefully. That is a scary thought!- Judy Jones, Fort Worth, Texas, USA, 15/1/2011 15:20Click to rateRating52Report abuseNo More Gun Control Laws are needed. The Idiots that have passed our current laws are not enforcing all of the gun laws we currently have in the USA. It's the criminal element that need to be dealt with and the law abiding citizens are the only group that will follow the law. - lakotahope, Virginia, United States, 15/1/2011 14:53Click to rateRating131Report abuseThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.Add your commentName:Town & Country:Your name and location will appear next to your comment.You have 1000 characters left.We welcome your opinions.
