Victoria Beckham thinks fake tan looks "a bit footballer's wife". The 36 yrs old former Spice Girls singer who is married to soccer star David Beckham admits she has formerly experimented with giving herself a bronzed glow but has now realised it is not a good look for her. She said: "I don't wear fake tan anymore. Sometimes I've been turned orange but that's certainly a look from my past. "Being excessively tanned is very ageing and, dare I say it, a bit footballer's wife. I'm a little tanned from being in Los Angeles but I don't use self-tan. Embrace your natural colour!" Though she hates fake tan, Victoria has a lot of beauty products she uses frequently and she admits one of the reasons she joined twitter was to share her tips with her fans. She said: "I love sharing my favourite beauty finds, I'm not one to keep beauty secrets. "I love Chanel, Stila and Armani. I'm obsessed with the new Burberry Lip Gloss Nos. 9 and 10. I tweeted about it - everyone has to get one."        1 of 6         Victoria Beckham hates fake tan      luvanil is based in Kathmandu, Kathmandu, Nepal,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (56.1%) Belgium (5.1%) United Kingdom (4.1%) Nepal (4.1%) 17 other countries (26.5%)           READ MORE: Victoria Beckham, hates fake, entertainment-news, United Kingdom, london, David Beckham, WAGs, British people, Spice Girls, Football in England, W, English people, fake tanned, human interest   More News From: London :  United Kingdom     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 3            Reply  Posted By     solarp|about 1 monthagoWhy the world is driven towards fake ?
