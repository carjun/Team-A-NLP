I've heard this kid was a left-wing pothead and also heard he was a Tea party extremist. At this point, it's all speculation.  It's irresponsible for anybody to say they know who this kid is, what he was thinking or the motivations behind his actions. The one thing that is a fact, is that this guy was a f**king nutjob with obvious mental issues.Reply3 Replies - Top reply has 17 diggsgvoakes9 days ago-24 diggs+3 / -27Show Hidden CommentReportDiggBurywats a potheadi like pokemonReplytakamalak8 days ago-1 diggs+12 / -13Show Hidden CommentReportDiggBuryHe was a registered republican dontcha knowhttp://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y163/zappaisfrank/jllrsc.jpgReply3 Repliesageofmastery8 days ago+1 diggs+7 / -6Show Buried CommentReportDiggBuryI've also read he was an Independent http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/house/jared-lee-loughner-was-a-regis.htmlReplyodkin8 days ago-6 diggs+4 / -10Show Hidden CommentReportDiggBuryThis is Photoshop BS.

Wishful thinking? Probably. Talk about over reaching. Some of you far-lefties that have a little intelligence must be just a little embarrassed by this story.

On and on and on...fmaxwell8 days ago+10 diggs+16 / -6Show Buried CommentReportDiggBuryThat was quite a piece of fiction.First off, to claim he was "non-political" is absurd.  Most of his rantings were political in nature.  They are all about the government and the elected politicians.Secondly, the claim is that it is likely that he was inspired to violence by Tea Party rhetoric, not that he is a card-carrying member of the Tea Party.  You've got Sarah Palin telling people "Don't retreat, RELOAD!" while "targeting" Congresswoman Giffords with cross-hairs over her district on a map.  There are Tea Party protesters bringing assault rifles to protests (http://www.onepennysheet.com/2010/01/gun-rights-and-tea-party-activists-encourage-people-to-bring-guns-to-new-mexico-protest/).  We've seen signs at Tea Party rallies that read "We came unarmed (this time)."  We've got Boehner telling people that it will be "Armageddon" if Democrats pass health reform.  That's just the kind of thing that feeds the paranoid, violent minds of disturbed people like the gunman.We've seen this all before with the right-wing anti-abortion activists putting doctors on "Wanted" posters, calling them baby killers and murderers, and then feigning shock and disapproval when one of the crazies inspired by the rhetoric commits murder.DallasW8 days ago+17 diggs+24 / -7Show Buried CommentReportDiggBuryJust a quick note:"Liberal potheads" don't hurt people , Maybe their Mothers or pastors feelings but they don't shoot people.Reply1 Reply - Top reply has 4 diggsgdj118 days ago+4 diggs+11 / -7Show Buried CommentReportDiggBury"Liberal potheads" don't hurt people, and neither do conservative church-goers.

There may not a direct link between this killer and any specific right wing politician but the rhetoric coming out of the far right wing creates conditions for nut jobs like this guy to do what he did. Also, the rhetoric has a horrible chain reaction effect. One politician may call another politician 'no better than Hitler'. That 2nd party might now have to retaliate or risk losing votes. it creates heated conditions...from both parties. I call out the republican party most because they provide much more of the violent rhetoric..... mostly from the tea baggers in the GOP.Reply3 Repliesplanet878 days ago-22 diggs+4 / -26Show Hidden CommentReportDiggBuryExamples?

(teehee)There's TONS of evidence that the vitriol mostly comes from the right.  The incendiary rhetoric to "take matters into your own hands" does a great job of boiling up the blood.  While 99.999% of people aren't going to resort to violence, all it takes is one crazy guy to bring attention to the hate and bigotry from Fox pundits.  Bigot: A bigot is a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices, especially one exhibiting intolerance, and animosity toward those of differing beliefs.Liberals are a bunch of coombaya peaceniks anyway.

Too often, these are just words to 'lather' up the team.  I do however like to disect issues as they appear.  Like this case.  It's disgusting to spin this for political favor or points.  Don't make your 'points' off this tragedy (not you but people in general).Reply2 Replies - Top reply has 3 diggsplanet878 days ago-6 diggs+2 / -8Show Hidden CommentReportDiggBuryI don't get worked up by labels. I get worked up by people's statements and actions and ideologies. It's very clear where Obama comes from. Thank God, the consitution stands in his way. (P.S. Not that I think Bush was much better.

Incitements to violence could trigger someone on either side.My perception is that lately it has generally been people far to the right that have been doing this.  I'm sure that in the past, I understand incitements to violence have come from other sides too.Replyodkin8 days ago-2 diggs+4 / -6Show Hidden CommentReportDiggBuryClassic liberal argument.  You can say anything about assasinating "Bus**tler", putting boots on necks, arresting Cheney, claiming Bush blew up the WTC, and that's all OK.  We say we're going to "target" a district in an election and we're accessories to murder.  Have you people no shame?  At long last, have you no shame?Reply1 Reply - Top reply has 3 diggsericschc18 days ago+3 diggs+4 / -1Show Buried CommentReportDiggBuryHad you really paid attention, you'd know at least half the arguments you just claimed liberals make/made were in fact not made. Bush blew up the WTC? Really? Some retards think its an inside job, an even smaller subset of which think it was directly Bush "blowing them up". Almost no one. Also, there's worlds of difference between "arresting Cheney" and "putting Giffords in your crosshairs". If you can't see the difference, thats your own stupid fault.Replybookant9 days ago+12 diggs+17 / -5Show Buried CommentReportDiggBuryWhether or not they contributed in this specific case, the rhetorical calls for violence and demonization of anyone who disagrees with the !right on the issues is still disgusting, unAmerican and unacceptable, and we've been telling you that for a long time.Reply3 Replies - Top reply has 2 diggsplanet878 days ago-10 diggs+3 / -13Show Hidden CommentReportDiggBuryGood thing George Washington followed your thinking...

Governments are clamping down on peaceful protest in the name of anti- terrorism often creating violent clashes and going so far as to infiltrate and provocateur crowds. I'm not saying this is the case with this guy I feel he is just a nut but I do feel we are going to see more of this in the near future.Replydavidg118 days ago-4 diggs+3 / -7Show Hidden CommentReportDiggBuryViolence can definitely be the answer.
