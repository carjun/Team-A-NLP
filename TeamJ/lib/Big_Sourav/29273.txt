But it is a fierce wind, a bad wind, and when it blows down this tar-black jungle river most people run. Because it turns their eyes to color of blood. Because the wind kills them.Isidore Edjimouagno knows. He survived the evil wind, though it left him a broken man. This is his one claim to fame: He breathed the wind and lived. He is a dead man who sits blinking in surprise under the shade trees of his garden."People thought it was yellow fever at first, and weren't that frightened," recalled Edjimouagno, 61, one of scores of gold panners who were brought down the Ivindo River in dugouts, vomiting blood and semi-conscious. "But the next time the wind came they all ran away. The police had to set up roadblocks in the towns, They wanted to run all the wy to the capital."Edjimouagno's harrowing brush with the foul winds of the Ivindo River was actually the world's last recorded outbreak of ebola, Africa's notoriously lethal virus.The fatal germ with the terrifying mystique has howled down the broad, silent river several times now, most recently in 1997, swiftly killing at least 100 people, or about 8 out of every 10 of its victims. As always, after burning through the local population it subsided back into the jungle without a trace.Chicago Shopping Overwhelming Offers: Always 50% off or more from your favorite brands >>                                    For all that scientists can manage to decipher of ebola's natural history, it may as well be a mystical wind-one that bodes poorly for the future health of this enfeebled continent, or, for that matter, given the ease of air travel, the world beyond.As the new millennium begins, nothing--not the collapse of creaky dictatorships, not the advent of Mandela in South Africa or McDonald's in Mauritius--shapes the character of life in modern Africa more than deadly illness.AIDS rakes the continent, taking such a horrific toll that diseases such as sleeping sickness, which threatens to kill 300,000 people, are considered silent epidemics. Hard-won, incremental health gains that had added a year or two to the average African's lifespan since the 1970s now lie in tatters. Disease, says the World Bank, remains the prime reason Africa still lags in the race of continents. So it is ironic, then, that what gives the international community a case of cold sweats isn't so much Africa's mammoth epidemics--AIDS, malaria or pulmonary infections, to name a few--but instead the small ambushes being set by so-called new or emerging diseases that surface in the forests, pick off a few human beings and disappear in the epidemiological equivalent of a drive-by shooting.Viruses such as ebola and Marburg liquefy the internal organs, causing some victims to bleed even from their pores. Neither has a cure, each is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids and can kill within days.Gruesome as the diseases are, global health authorities are even more alarmed by the certainty that new, ebola-like scourges are on the way. The reason? As Africa's burgeoning population continues to push into tropical ecosystems--farming, cutting down trees and grazing cattle where they never had before--countless more people will blunder into the ancient webs of parasitism between unknown microbes and animals and thus become possible hosts themselves.Consider the numbers. According to the United Nations, in 1950 only 224 million people lived in sub-Saharan Africa, a vast region larger than the United States, China and India combined. Today, that figure has almost tripled, to 650 million. By 2025, even under the killing weight of its epidemics, the number is expected to nearly double again, to 1 billion. The majority of these people are rural, and as such will remain in the cross hairs of strange, opportunistic diseases.But if health authorities suffer nightmares about red-eyed ebola victims staggering into their airports--as one was thought to have done in August in Berlin (it was yellow fever; he died)--then rich nations share part of the blame.Climate change sparked by fossil fuel use in industrialized countries is disrupting the tropical ecosystems of Africa and probably will unleash unpredictable new epidemics, experts warn. Malaria, a not-so-novel killer, already is marching south with unprecedented warm weather into parts of South Africa where it has never been seen.Moreover, global commerce is playing a powerful role in opening up the Congo basin's gigantic, almost impenetrable forests to human settlement. International logging corporations have multiplied in the region since the mid-1960s, and in Gabon, where French corporations are active, the muddy roads that funnel out truckloads of tropical hardwoods destined for parquet flooring have brought out something less profitable--people dying of ebola."Ebola is just the tip of the iceberg," said Sally Lahm, an American ecologist and anthropologist doing fieldwork in the vast, sweltering Ivindo watershed in Gabon. "Everybody in the West loves the idea of biodiversity in rain forests. Well, people forget that that includes microbes too."Look at it from the perspective of these viruses," said Lahm, who lives in the jungle trading town of Makokou. "Look who's invading who."Whichever end of the microscope you view it from, it seems that even after a quarter-century of experience--ebola came to light in then-Zaire in 1976--the human beings aren't doing so great.In Africa's most recent outbreak of hemorrhagic fever, a Marburg epidemic in rebel-held Congo last year that reportedly killed 70 to 80 people, it took 10 months for scientists to identify the culprit.The delay came despite an infusion of cash from nervous developed countries eager to monitor emerging killer diseases. This is one of the few elements of Africa's collapsed health system that has seen a boost in foreign funding recently, much of it courtesy of a $50 million donation by the U.S.12next|  single pageGet the Chicago Tribune delivered to your home for only $1 a week >Copyright  2011, Chicago Tribune E-mail PrintReprint Digg Twitter Facebook Home deliveryComments (0)Add comments | Discussion FAQCurrently there are no comments.
