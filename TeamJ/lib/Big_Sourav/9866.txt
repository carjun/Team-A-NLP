Kathy Griffin was not yanked off CNN last night. Griffin, who referred to her turn on CNNs New Years Eve as Yank Watch 2011, kept it clean during her co-hosting gig alongside Anderson Cooper. Last year, Griffin dropped the F bomb and the year before she heckled an onlooker whod been heckling her. This year Griffin got physical. She slugged Cooper a few times (above), tried to take off his clothes, and kissed his producer four minutes before midnight.TVNewser was there again on the press platform where CNNs Cooper and Griffin broadcast from the west end, while on the east end of the riser, high above Duffy Square, Fox News Megyn Kelly and Bill Hemmer hosted FNCs All American New Year. In between stood two rows of local and national news anchors broadcasting in multiple languages to networks around the world.Fox News hosts Ainsley Earhardt, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Greg Gutfeld roamed the Crossroads of the World talking with some of the 1 million revelers on a rare December night where, thanks to a 40-degree temperature, one couldnt see their breath.Leading up to the main events on broadcast and cable news channels, E!s Bill and Giuliana Rancic hosted festivities for the Times Square crowed. Leading up to midnight, we ran into CBS News Early Show EP David Friedman who spent seven New Years Eves here producing Carson Dalys NBC special. Friedman, who joined CBS in late 2009, is back at work today doing rehearsals with the new Early Show anchor team which debuts Monday morning.

Calling up the farm team isnt going to have millions of Americans waking up and saying, Hey, lets see what the new guys are doing over at CBS.Broadcast television is a business built on habit  no more so than in the morning, when viewers mindlessly flip the television on with their first cup of coffee. The inertia is profound and cuts both ways. An object in motion  in this case the Today show, with nearly twice the viewers of The Early Show, will remain in motion. It will get the hot bookings, the big guests and the tune-ins.Carr does present some possible ideas for what can be done, although the probability of CBSactuallytaking him up on them arequitelow. Among the ideas: Read moreCommentsShareCBSEarly Show EP David Friedman: I Honestly Believe This Team is the Team for the FutureBy Alex Weprin on November 30, 2010 3:47 PMAs we reportedearlier, CBS News announced sweeping changes to its morning news program The Early Show. Anchors Maggie Rodriguez and Harry Smith, along with weather anchor Dave Price will all leave the program, with Chris Wragge, Erica Hill, Jeff Glor and Marysol Castro taking over January 3rd.TVNewser spoke to Early Show executiveproducer David Friedmannow almost exactly a year into his current role about the decision to relaunch the program with a new team.TVNewser: Why did you decide to make the changes at The Early Show?David Friedman: Well, I started here a year ago, and when I came in the goal was to continue to grow this show and be more and more competitive in the morning, I looked at every single aspect of the show, from content to bookings to staffing, talent, and my big priority was not to rush to do anything, but to soak it all in and make decisions that would take us to the next level.This was a very long process to figure out what would do just that, and put a team in place that would make us even better than we already are and going forward. It wasnt a rushed thing, we have been talking about different options and different teams for a quite a while, and we decided this was the way to go. I am sure it feels abrupt to everyone else, but we have put a lot of thought into it.TVN: How did you decide on the anchor lineup that will be starting January 3rd?

Weve been covering it, executive producer David Friedman told TVNewser, But when you put an anchor there, it makes it feel more important to people.For Mondays broadcast, Weather anchor Dave Price as well as contributing doctors Jennifer Ashton and Deb Turner Bell were dispatched to the region.This was a story we spent so much time covering and we felt like day 50 was something that we should be there for, Friedman said, explaining that plans had been put into motion over the weekend with Smith flying out after Mondays show.  CBS announced Monday that the networks evening and morning shows would be anchored from the region weekly. Our feeling is that the story is such a big story, everyone is watching and caring about it, as they should, and we felt like were going to give it as much attention as possible.Friedman says hes been working closely with Evening News EP Rick Kaplan to coordinate, but admits that the morning show format does present some challenges.The difference is in evening news, its a little bit easier to cover your broadcast: its only 30 minutes and most of the broadcast is designated to that coverage, Friedman explains. With the morning shows, theyre two hours long.  And you start with oil and end with cooking.  Its a weird thing.  You have Harry Smith in the Gulf, but then you still have to do the lifestyle, fitness, cooking segments.  And yes, you have Harry in a place where hes out of pocket for those, but we have the people to cover us. CBS named Friedman EP late last year, and he started in January, going from producing Lady Gaga performances and NBCs New Years Eve broadcast to producing CBS morning coverage of the earthquake in Haiti just a few weeks later.We chatted with the new boss about how The Early Show is changing and his transition to what he calls the best job in television with the worst hours ever.

As one of his staffers put it, there rests the fate of BBC World News America pride.After nearly everyone lost their champion pick, Kansas, in the first few days, the competition remained tight.  David Friedman (The Early Show) led for much of the way, until David Tabacoff (The OReilly Factor) took the lead.While Hartman was out of the top five for most of the tourney, his stubbornness about sticking with his alma mater ended up launching him to first pace when all was said and done, which means hes officially crowned the 2010 Boss of All Bosses champ.  Congratulations, sir.MSNBCs Chris Licht (Morning Joe) is the first runner up followed by Tabacoff, Amy Sohnen (OReilly Factor) and a three-way tie for fifth between Bob Epstein (NBC Nightly News), Kim Rosenberg (FOX Report), and your TVNewser editor.Heres Hartmans winning bracket and check out the full standings after the jump.
