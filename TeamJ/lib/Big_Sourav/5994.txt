Yet Americans cannot afford to live here.  Let me share two brief stories with you of friends I have run into recently.  Both friends are leaving America because they cant do it any longer  they cannot afford to live here.6 commentsRead the full article 90 Positive accomplishments by President Obama in his first six monthsNovember 30, 2009[Editor's Note: I have published this list - followed by a progressive critique - as a counter-pole to the anguish progressives and leftists feel right now, on the eve of President Obama's announcement of additional US troops being sent to Afghanistan.  Some progressives are ready to throw Obama out of office because of his Afghanistan "surge." This is basically a list of positives and there are many items on this list that progressives will disagree with, will consider to be cosmetic, or will fault for a lack of follow-through -- and there are without doubt a lot of negatives not included. But we think this is an impressive list just the same.]By Robert P. WatsonI am always being asked to grade Obamas presidency. In place of offering him a grade, I put together a list of his accomplishments thus far. I think you would agree that it is very impressive. His first six months have been even more active than FDRs or LBJs  the two standards for such assessments.7 commentsRead the full article OB Flashes  News, Calendar, and Discussion Board  November 30  December 6, 2009November 30, 2009OB Elementary Selected as Grand Marshall of Holiday Parade   Convertible Wanted_______________________________Point Loma school cluster wants in on District budget discussions_______________________________Library hours, beach clean-ups, 200 workers and cop horses to be cut in Mayors budget_______________________________Food and Toy Drive for local families gears up  Volunteers welcomed_______________________________Jetty Project manager claims boulder placement key to jetty repair_______________________________Anna Daniels nominated to have room named after her in new Central Library10 commentsRead the full article Demonstation called for day-after President Obamas Afghanistan escalationNovember 30, 2009President Obama is likely to announce on Tuesday, December 1 an escalation in AfghanistanSDCPJ calls for a Demonstration The Day After his announcement35,000 new US occupation troops next year$35 billion more to pay for the war and occupation3 commentsRead the full article An Open Letter to President Obama from Michael Moore on AfghanistanNovember 30, 2009Dear President Obama,Do you really want to be the new war president? If you go to West Point tomorrow night (Tuesday, 8pm) and announce that you are increasing, rather than withdrawing, the troops in Afghanistan, you are the new war president. Pure and simple. And with that you will do the worst possible thing you could do  destroy the hopes and dreams so many millions have placed in you. With just one speech tomorrow night you will turn a multitude of young people who were the backbone of your campaign into disillusioned cynics. You will teach them what theyve always heard is true  that all politicians are alike. I simply cant believe youre about to do what they say you are going to do. Please say it isnt so.48 commentsRead the full article What Is the Role of the Artist-Intellectual in Society?November 29, 2009by Frank GormlieSome Musings .[Reposted 06/29/08. Originally posted 11/08/07]What is the role of the artist  the intellectual artist  in modern society? If the role of the artist is obviously and intrinsically tied to the role of art, then what is the role of art? In modern society? Or in any society?Art reflects reality at the very least. Art is humanitys attempts to recreate reality, to create reflections of reality  and imagination & creativity are part of reality  thus also reflections of imagination; but then what is good art? How is it separate & distinct from ordinary or bad art?The role of the artist then is connected to the role of art, in whatever medium  oil on canvas, watercolor, charcoal, pencil, colored pens, other canvas work, photography, computer art, sculpture, performance art, theater, movies, TV, poetry, novels, literature, music, dance,  cave paintings, 7 commentsRead the full article Mayor Sanders is Gunning for our Libraries  Again!November 28, 2009by Anna DanielsYes- it is dj vu all over again. This time last year Mayor Sanders proposed closing 7 branch libraries, including Ocean Beach. Ocean Beach responded immediately. Ocean Beach responded unequivocally- DO NOT CLOSE OUR LIBRARY! A number of you were even willing to participate in non-violent civil disobedience by forming a human chain around your library in the event of closure.Your response so inspired and encouraged me personally that I became involved with a city-wide effort to rally all of the communities against the closure of the other 6 branch libraries. We mobilized quickly, acted in unity and we won. Read about it here and feel very, very good. Just dont feel so good that you think you should bow your collective heads to this years proposed library cuts. That would be so not-OB.26 commentsRead the full article Still in Pursuit of the Good Old DaysNovember 28, 2009by Ernie McCrayMy Nancy has been gone for a few months now and Im slowly getting back up on my feet to continue on the path she and I trod together for thirty-four years.In spite of the sudden moments of pain that slow me down now and again I will strive to keep my eyes forever on the prize and hope shes looking down on me with pride as I, more importantly, in the vernacular of the day, try to keep it real and not lose sight that changing the world is not the kind of enterprise that should be overly glamorized. Such thinking is based on how we used to laugh at how so many people rave about The Good Old Days, remembering events in their lives as, basically, little white lies. 1 commentRead the full article Weekend in the WastelandNovember 26, 2009by Larry OBI recently attended the Road Warrior Weekend up in the Mojave Desert. It was a costumed campout for fans of the Mad Max movie trilogy. Sort of a post apocalyptic renaissance fair. The costumes and vehicles spanned all three movies. We had the good cops of the MFP (Main Force Patrol), and the bad cops of the Gay Boy Beserkers. The wearing of a metal-studded cod piece was usually a good way to quickly judge the threat level of an approaching cop.The gathering was generally well behaved. The event organizer prudently forbade live ammunition, but there were enough real homemade weapons to give things an element of danger. Axes made from sprocket gears, and knives welded to steering wheel clubs. 10 commentsRead the full article The dilemma of the disenchanted progressive: why its important for Ocean Beach  Part IIINovember 24, 2009by Frank GormlieThe dilemma of the disenchanted progressive has come full circle. If the progressive is disenchanted and deeply puzzled, what about the progressive community  what about a place like Ocean Beach?This then is the third and final part of the series.  In Part 1, I presented what I see as this dilemma for disenchanted progressives: as people on the political left we are disenchanted about the tempo and types of changes that President Obama has ushered in to date. And yet, as I discuss in Part 2, this country is facing a mass movement that represents an American brand of fascism, and its gunning for President Obama.30 commentsRead the full article Blackwaters Secret War in PakistanNovember 23, 2009By Jeremy Scahill / The Nation / November 23, 2009At a covert forward operating base run by the US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) in the Pakistani port city of Karachi, members of an elite division of Blackwater are at the center of a secret program in which they plan targeted assassinations of suspected Taliban and Al Qaeda operatives, snatch and grabs of high-value targets and other sensitive action inside and outside Pakistan, an investigation by The Nation has found. The Blackwater operatives also assist in gathering intelligence and help run a secret US military drone bombing campaign that runs parallel to the well-documented CIA predator strikes, according to a well-placed source within the US military intelligence apparatus.1 commentRead the full article OB Flashes  News, Calendar and Discussion Board  November 23-29, 2009November 23, 2009Last Springs Annual OB Heathen Parade Drew Police Wrath____________________________Hodads to open 2nd restaurant in downtown San Diego____________________________OB Architects Win Small Orchid____________________________(Another) OB Comic-Con Founder Passes  Ken Krueger____________________________Scientists search for bugs on Navys Point Loma Base____________________________23 commentsRead the full article Open Letter to Mayor Sanders from Friends of the OB LibraryNovember 23, 2009The Honorable Mayor Jerry Sanders:The Friends of the Ocean Beach Library recently met and it was decided to write you about the impending budget situation, particularly as it might apply to our own Ocean Beach Library. We want to be involved in bringing possible ideas forward to you and the City. We wanted to share with you four thoughts that we came up with:1. Any cuts that might come to the library system, should be shared equally among all libraries and library departments.2.

All found not guilty of illegal fireNovember 19, 2009by Frank GormlieAll four of the fire hoopers who were cited by police last June here in Ocean Beach, were found not guilty this afternoon of having an illegal fire.  The judge in the case, Commissioner Peter Doft declared at the end of the infraction trial that he cant cite these women for this conduct.

They were all members of a troupe of fire performers called Hoop Unit, managed by Valentina Unity Martin, and were practicing at night with their lit hoops.25 commentsRead the full article The Book Nook: How We Decide, by Jonah LehrerNovember 19, 2009by Doug PorterThe Boeing 737 was at seven thousand feet descending into San Diegos Lindbergh Field from the west, due to weather conditions, when the left engine caught fire. Bells and horns sounded immediately within the cockpit, warning the pilots of multiple system failures. The plane immediately reacted to the emergency cutoff of fuel to the affected engine by banking steeply. The pilots struggled to steer the plane as it veered first one way, then the other, but their efforts were in vain.8 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
