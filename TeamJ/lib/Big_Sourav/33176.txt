To answer that you must ask what is the real meaning of "Conservative"? Where did this  conservative 'ideology' come from? Who made it up? And Why? Who benefits from a conservative culture?After all, when you look at what conservatives say vs how what they say pans out in the real world, you'll find out what exactly these elitists calling themselves conservative are conserving. They are hypocrites,conserving their own power, wealth, and social domination within their own ranks. All the hate and fear mongering talk goes to those sickening same old self-interested ends.The S/M dynamics the dysfunctional abuser & abused a social tragedy against human well being is operating below the surface is repeating here.The central ideas of The Conservative mindset are 6 core  beliefs upon which American conservatism is essentially based. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *************************************************************************    ~~~~There are six basic "canons" or principles of conservatism.~~~ And how those six canons of conservatism seem to pan out differently in reality.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     #1  A divine intent, as well as personal conscience, rules society.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UnSpun that is another way of saying, The Divine right of kings. If by divinity they mean Christian it is a theocracy. If there is one God, one creator, then one king is divinely appointed, well it must be God's chosen ruler on top, if society is run hierarchically by divine order. This "order" of classes mentality makes sure the most ruthless bully boys and richest  are first in line for everything.... but work, submission, austerity,responsibility and deprivation. And conservatives feel entitled to impose suffering upon others below,the very sufferings the rich avoid by forcing the costs on other people's lives all while robbing the nation blind.When I hear some snotty elitist speak of "ordered liberty," I can't help but ask, Liberties come in which order? And whose liberty is the most important and first here? And order implies a hierarchy -- where you are located at on said hierarchy is very relevant to how "free" you are in this "order of liberties."In the "conservative" way  of dealing with cognitive dissonance caused by contending requirements of the community  VS the individual/ of individual freedom and individual human  rights/ These are not important as a "value" for others who are different.What is most valued is where one is at in the social hierarchy of the right wing apparatus.. Narcissism & insecurity & power seeking is the "power base" of the right wing masses.Threaten the followers of conservatism with a threat to control,ego,status and uncertainty with rhetoric it will move them.Sometimes with deadly results.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"In The Conquest of A Continent, for example, Grant relates how the Nordic (Aryan, etc.) race forcefully occupied North America, destroying its forests, looting its minerals, exhausting its soils, and evicting the Indians: "Waste was the order of the day in America: All this was perhaps inevitable, but never since Caesar plundered Gaul has so large a territory been sacked in so short a time. Probably no more destructive human being has ever appeared on the world stage than the American pioneer with his axe and rifle. Yet it was precisely those pioneers whom the Boone and Crockett Club eponymously honored, and who were perennially invoked as emblematic of Racial Will -- of the daring, dash, and ruthless enterprise which had lifted America to world dominance, and Grant, Osborn, Roosevelt, et al. to the apex of its social ladder. Grant's plunderers were those same industrialists and bankers (or the fathers who bequeathed them fortunes from the sacking) who, at the turn of the century, took up the twin causes of conservation and eugenics. Responsibility, of limited government and unlimited markets, it always favors the most powerful and their interests first. Natural Aristocracies,Eugenics, and the U.S. Conservation Movement by Gray Brechin, Antipode~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    #2 Traditional life is filled with variety and mystery while most         radical systems are characterized by a narrowing uniformity ... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The truth is quite the opposite in reality.  This so called "order" has an agenda it makes sure they are first in line for everything but work, submission, responsibility and deprivation.Tell that shit about "variety and mystery" to a housewife in the 1950's or a teen stuck in the suburbs,Or a radical Mormon woman stuck as wife # 4 in a poly marriage saddled with with ten kids of her own. Sometimes women back then were in such awe of the mysteries of church, taking care of house and husband and kids and seeking life we never had, they took Valium to sleep it away or became sick,mentally fell apart or died.. Tell that shit to a factory worker who hates his job, or some cubicle slave  doing telemarketing who has no time to rest because quotas are too high & wages are not enough to survive on.. Oh, and never forget the  influence of that so called great invisible hand -- divinity? -- of the market that more often than not reinforces conservative fantasies.."... while most radical systems are characterized by a narrowing uniformity.Radicals all must agree with the basics of conservative ideology,(DLC & Blue dogs) or be ruthlessly stomped by the state if they do not uphold this notion of elitism couched as "divine order."Of Darwinism and Social Darwinism by Robert B. ReichThat is why conservatives hate Uncertainty, Anarchy & Ambiguity Because the radicals directly undermine the conservatives' bullshit about "divine mandates"& orders& classes they believe God declares them to uphold. They think God gave them their privilege to rule others, and exploit and manipulate people.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     #3 Civilized society requires orders and classes.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Stratification creates both Poverty & Class War. When times are hard, it is no longer the entire group that suffers: The elite takes what it thinks it is 'entitled' to take, and the underclass does without.The orders of things get switched around rhetorically when it is most convenient to these elites getting theirs. When big uncreative corporations can't deal with the upstart competition of creative people from below outdoing them, then the markets are "too free" and they get limited in the favor of the big gorillas (to preserve the top-down divine order). If markets make big gorilla monopolies that ruthlessly plunder the people, well, then the big gorillas are just the divine working order of the market.This is why classes exist (hence "divine order," or more accurately an institutionalized excuse for systemic exploitation of others by the most powerful). God is used as the ultimate "permission giver" for the elites, excusing their plundering, enslaving, and domination of the masses. The conservative uses beliefs like: Gays are unnatural; not in the order of nature as God made it to be male and female, together...Atheists are evil because they don't see God as king of everything and owning it all...And anyone is evil if they don't see "family values" when a man is head of the household and owns a little kingdom and his wife and kids are his property serve to keep the social status quo unequal, unjust, unfair and oppressive.Ancient Rome and Nazis also had this "nuclear family" model, The wife and kids were property of male head of household. This is the same crap the Christian Conservatives are spouting these days -- they want to go back to home feudalism. And if feudalism is a 'normal' lifestyle at home, then society will reflect it as "normal."In Rome, fathers could beat, rape, kill their uppity wives and disobedient kids because the"right" of the 'dick-head of the household' to dominate the weaker was couched as "divine order." It was master and slave, morality deified.But there is nothing divine about "divine order." The classism, elitism, and social hierarchy that conservatives tout as the "special" "glue" or bedrock of 'civilization' means they rely on maintaining a master/slaves morality to keep their own power stable. Basically, conservatism echoes the divine right of kings, and insists that the proper place for the "lower classes" is a life of poverty, desperation, xenophobia, ignorance, religion, and being bound in servitude. That is their 'divine order', and this self serving ugly, evil ideology is what conservatives believe holds civilizations together.It is the supreme insult to humanity. All this lie does is concentrate power and keep the elites on top of this "divine order." Slavery is a natural part of divinity for these thuggish, entitled, well-off people. It's all part of the elites' plan, which they call "God's plan."~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~       #4  Property and freedom are inseparably connected.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Basically this says, If you own it, you can do whatever you want with it. Other people who don't own it have no say in what you do with your property, lest their objections interfere with owners' or plunderers' property owners "freedom."Beating and raping slaves, for example, is a divine right of an owner, when human beings are seen as "property." That is part of the owners' "freedom" and "property rights." Even today, human trafficking and certain industries create and reinforce the idea a human being is an object that can be used owned and sold (porn) as property of the 'owner'.Remember it was not long ago (still is this way in some countries) when women were seen as property of their husbands/buyers. In those days and places, husbands had a right to beat their wives for not submitting, or for not cooking dinner on time. The wedding band is a symbolic remnant of this marriage bondage, and according to sociologist Stephanie Coontz, 'family' was a word that once meant a band of slaves.The wife and kids were property of male head of household.Wives used to be property in America too.Today it is implied symbolically by the wedding band.Reinforced by the misogyny in the bible."A wife is property that one acquires by contract, she is transferable, because possession of her requires title; in fact, woman is, so to speak, only mans appendage; consequently, slice, cut, clip her, you have all rights to her."Honor De Balzac"No written law has ever been more binding than unwritten custom supported by popular opinion."Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947), in a speech at the Senate hearing on woman's suffrage, February 13, 1900~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      #5  Man must control his will and his appetite,     knowing that he is governed more by emotion than by reason.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Republicans and politicians know this.So they exploit this emotional part of us with rhetoric that speaks to that raw gut emotion.Conservatives use rhetoric very differently than liberal egalitarians.The Republicans have a very narrow self serving agenda they want.This narrow agenda gives republicans an illusory certainty that masquerades as competence and solidarity.Reality smacking conservatives in the face sometimes fails to break their faith working against their own well being.If you are poor thou shalt not covet the wealth of parasites and kings. Thou shalt work for boss without sloth or offending him. Thou shalt not eat too much. Thou shalt not have pride and look unsightly before the king. Thou shalt not challenge the "divine order." Thou shalt not do anything that would offend the classes above you, unless the rulers above them tell you to do it.But ... if you are of the elite class, different rules apply. Because of your status you can be taught the "inner" truths -- that there is no morality, that having ethics is a show to keep the peons loyal to you. If you have insatiable appetites, don't incite the plebeians envy of your wealth, dress down when you walk among them, hide your decadence, pretend it isn't there and do it anyway away from the gaze of the poor lest they covet and the Bastille is stormed. Because the most elite are sociopaths, and know to be depraved behind closed doors where the "evidence" can be hidden. They will not be called into account for it. Because the ways of princes is Machiavellian and the plebeians need not meddle in the affairs of kings...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      #6  Society must alter itself slowly.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Because if things change too fast, the elites might not be able to control how it comes out. They might lose their cushy place in the "divine order" if it turns upside down.For conservatives, there must always be a king even if he's called a "president".This rule does not apply in Democracies when "conservatives" control all the levers of power.When Liberals had control the right wingers abused the filibuster,when bush was in,they rushed things  through like the patriot act ,Social change is goes slow when the power is shifted left..Change is fast when it shifts to the right. The changes the right seek are not popular in reality so they must happen fast and secretly. Right wing concepts further undermine democracy, and the hierarchical can't tolerate that. In that wild unpredictable of unsupervised freedom solidarity is exploited by the right through fear. Horrors, if there was an insurrection and people had idle time and a place to gather the rulers could lose their "divine" place in the lofty heights of plutocratic power and be forced to live like the lower classes live if they are permitted to live at all, and that must not happen.This same old eugenics shit and so called "natural" right is a scam disguised as 'philosophy', made up by and for rich bullies. Conservatives' ideology is all about the elites' "divine rights" to plunder and murder others for securing their own gain and stability at the expense of everyone else being deprived. This lie is being applied even today. And people are duped by it still.Horatio Alger ,and the puritan work ethic are popular lies.The aim of controlling the internet, control of the workplace, control of public space, control of lifestyles through religion and "family values," and control through systemic manipulation of many other aspects of our lives, is to keep us controlled and exploited by the powerful, every day. These "divine orders" lead to top down social 'control, always. It all leads to the same results: inequality and classism and master/slave dynamics. eugenics and elitism, and concentrating power to the wealthy.     "To be a good animal is the first requisite to success in life, and to be a Nation of good animals is the first condition of national prosperity."    Herbert Spencer The enthusiasm for conservation among the plutocracy at the turn of the century was more than a passing fashion; it came with a changed view of capital concomitant with inherited wealth and a growing sense of noblesse oblige. The descendants of the men who had mown the forests, gutted the mountains, and slaughtered the seals grew ever more concerned with the long-term management of their assets. A psycho-social history of the human species by Dr. C. George BoereeManipulation of the masses through religion and other media, exploitation of the 'work ethic', and various other kinds of social  control/ are engineering we think of as 'normal'.This belief in NORMAL only benefits the few top wealthy families and their 'kind'.Someday I would hope that the scam that is ongoing under the label "conservative" will be shown for what it is: the ugliest lie of all time.Maybe there will be a final revolution, one in the heart of non- sociopath mankind that decides they have no time to waste on abusers. Maybe one day, the top will be brought down to the level ground where we all stand and be forced to answer for the crimes against humanity,crimes against the human mind and crimes against the general welfare of society they have done for a very long time...I wish for all humans to grow wise enough and courageous, honest and ethical enough to not desire a king to rule them or rule others. I hope someday we choose to rule ourselves, so we don't rule each other. So that no-one is another person's subordinate, so that no-one can crown himself and say that his own ambition and desire to rule and steal is a divine mandate.Race, wealth, and other status markers have been used as a symbolic proof of a person's "divine" superiority" for a long time, and it is a very insidious lie of inflated self-worth. It's designed to allow the privileged a way to conveniently rob others of their essential humanity, to negate others' inalienable human rights. And this lie exists so the elitist can pretend he still has moral authority to "rule" by "divine right." There is nothing divine about "divine order."The classism, elitism, and social hierarchy that conservatives tout as the "special" "glue" or bedrock of 'civilization' means they rely on maintaining a master/slaves morality to keep their own power stable.Basically, conservatism echoes the divine right of kings, and insists that the proper place for the "lower classes" is a life of poverty, desperation, xenophobia, ignorance, religion, and being bound in servitude.That is their 'divine order', and this self serving ugly, evil ideology is what conservatives believe holds civilizations together.Christianity fits right into this giving hate":divine sanction".Ancient Rome and Nazis also had this "nuclear family" model this atomization stuff seen most everywhere in America..This is the same crap the Christian Conservatives are spouting these days -- they want to go back to feudalism.And if feudalism is made to be OK through manipulation it becomes 'normalized'in families,then society will reflect it as "normal" also. Empathy is antithetical to control, which is why control systems demand psychopathy as the standard mode of function. It keeps hierarchy, authority and contractual obligations in a dominating position, always overriding the urge of care, compassion, and a heartfelt connection and empathy for all forms of life. That psychopathy and hared of empathy is what is at the heart of "compassionate conservatism."Even to this day conservatism is still the same old shit it always was..Many pigs are wearing lipstick and loyal believers in conservatism are loath to admit they really are a bunch of pigs.
