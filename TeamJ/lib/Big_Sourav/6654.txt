The new GOP majority in the House of Representatives will wage a campaign to disable health reform, financial regulation, and the EPA; stonewall executive and judicial appointments; slash nondefense discretionary spending (thus undermining the economic recovery); gut Social Security and Medicare; and launch investigations into every possible White House indiscretionpotentially leading to a vote for impeachment. Democrats only recourse will be to practice what Howard Dean famously derided as damage controlto abandon hope for big progressive accomplishments and hunker down until 2012, like the Clinton administration did after the Gingrich Revolution, defending government from the worst excesses of those who would like to eliminate it altogether.Theres only one problem with this scenario: the time-frame. Politicos and pundits are used to thinking in two-year cycles, and its easy to convince oneself that, in 2012, Obama will be able to capitalize on an improved economy, favorable voter-turnout patterns, and aweak GOP presidential field in order to sweep into office with a renewed mandate. But that misses a big part of the picture. Even if Obama wins reelection by a comfortable margin, its most likely that the House will remain in Republican hands and Democrats will lose seats in, and perhaps control of, the Senateand beyond that, Republicans will probably do fairly well in 2014. In other words, we could be looking not at two years of damage control, but sixMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesDemocrats, Democrats regaining control of Congress, House reapportionment of seats, The House, The SenateRead moreMaybe the GOP taking over the House isnt such bad thing after all..January 8, 2011jamesb1019 commentsYep.The Democrats who ran things there for two years..Celebrated their win of that body and the PresidencyAnd ..Promptly fell asleep at the wheel.The Healthcare Bill , Stimulus and few other things were done in the first year and a half.But.As a matter of fact ..More work was completed in the last 45 days then a long while up on the Hill..With John Boehner and the Republicans leading things a funny thing has happened.The Democrats have pushed back.They are just now starting to sell the Healthcare Law.Something they should have done from the jump.They are now punching back at the GOP..Something they should have done from the jump.And the President has begun to remind people in Washington that .He IS the PresidentAnd he WILL step up when he needs to.How refreshingFor most of last year, Democrats were playing defense on health care, responding to Republican criticisms or, in many cases, trying desperately to change the subject of debate. Now something has changed. Congressional Democrats are challenging Republicans, daring them to come out against the bills more popular provisions. The Democratic National Committee is aggressively distributing talking points. According to an account in theNew York Times, Democrats will soon have a campaign-style war room for making their case. Its almost as if the the Democrats want this fight now.Of course, they may not have a choice. Republicans have made repeal a top priority, so the fight is going to take place whether or not Democrats want it. But I think it also reflects a changing dynamic, as well. According toGreg Sargent, who was among the first to spot the shift, House Democrats in particular are aware of the opportunity they missed last year, while the party and most of its leaders were trying so hard to save endangered incumbents. They think theyre in a stronger position now, since people are starting to see the laws benefits and repeal will mean changing an increasingly favorable status quo.It also helps that the Republicans finally have to do some governing. And governing requires the kind of specifics Republicans could avoid when they were merely campaigning to win office..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, UpdatesCongress, Democrats, House Democrats, Politics, President Obama, Republicans/GOP, The Democrats losing the House, White HouseRead moreThe Senate Filibuster Reform Update.January 5, 2011jamesb101No commentsBREAKING: Senate Filibuster Reform PackageSenators Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Harry Reid (D-NV)Here arethe specific filibuster reforms that Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), will be pushing beginning this afternoon, obtained by TPM. Spoiler: they include at least one little-discussed item meant to appeal to the minority.As promised, Udall proposes ending secret holds and the right of the minority to filibuster thestart of debate, and demanding the talking filibuster.But, according to documents provided by Udalls office in advance of his floor speech, it also includes a proposal that guarantees both parties the right to amend legislation  limiting the majority leaders power to fill the amendment tree and block extended debate.Read more .On Filibuster reformBy Chris Bowers @ Dailykos..Today, the final, three-week phase of the Senate rules reform campaign begins. As the 112th Congress convenes, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico are leading Senate Democrats in procedural maneuvering that will prevent the Senate from continuing under the procedural rules of the 111th Senate. In place of the old rules, he, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, have presenteda package of proposed changes to Senate rules for the 112th Senate.Over the next three weeks, culminating on January 24th, Senate Democrats will haggle over these proposals. They will do so both internally, and with Senate Republicans.Those negotiations will be led by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is the Chair of the Senate Rules Committee:According to several sources on and off the Hill  including those in leadership and those lobbying Congress on filibuster reform  Schumer has been given, in essence, the final say over what package Democrats will introduce on January 24. This is, in part, because he has served as chair of the Senate Rules Committee but it also is a byproduct of his larger leadership role in the caucusShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Politics, UpdatesDemocrats, Senate Filibuster Reform, Senate Majority Leader ReidRead moreThe Senate 2012 movesDSD..January 1, 2011jamesb1016 commentsHere are the comments I added to my original post (on an earlier thread by someone else about the NRSCs top 5 targets: Fla, Neb., ND, etc.) So (after adjusting for Scott Browns election) there are 21 Democrats, 1 Independent Democrat, 1 Independent and 10 Republicans up for re-election or retirement in 2012. The GOP has more targets.A few Republicans (e.g. John Ensign [Nev.], Scott Brown [Mass.], Bob Corker [Tenn.]) are not immune from plausible challenge, but should they run again such home-state institutions as Jon Kyl (Ariz.), Richard Lugar (Ind.), Olympia Snowe (Me.) and Orrin Hatch (U.) wont be dislodged short of scandal or a tectonic landslide.In theory, Sen. Snowe could lose if the Maine GOP collapses, but her current position seems more like John Chafees (R.I.) than his son Lincoln. On the other hand, Margaret Chase Smith (R.-Me.) slowly lost popularity and touch with her electorate and eventually lost re-election.The other three Republican Senators up in 2012 are John Barrasso (Wyo.), Kay Bailey Hutchison (Texas) and Roger Wicker (Miss.)*** I hate to sound like Daniel G., but the DSCC (Dem. Sen. Campaign Ctee) will have to run the table to shift the current stalemated Senate back away from Mitch McConnells obstructionism. Theyll have to hold on to seat like North Dakota and Nebraska, while trying to dislodge someone like John Ensign or Scott Brown.Twenty-two months before the event, it seems (I say grudgingly and regretfully) more likely that in the 113th Congress well return to the knife-edge do-nothing Senate we loved so well between 2001 and 2009. Worse if McConnell becomes Majority Leader while John Boehner remains Speaker.

Only 57 percent of Democrats wanted Bill Clinton renominated in the days after the 1994 Republican Revolution. Clinton went on to defeat Sen.

It wasnt the Tea Party that decided to create twonew health care entitlements (Medicare Part D and Obamacare) just as America was about to go over a fiscal waterfall. It wasnt kooks and reactionaries who got the European Union intoits current mess. It wasnt the radicals of the left and right who risked the global economy on a series of disastrous real estate bets, or locked our government intoa permanently symbiotic relationship with the banking and financial sectors, or createda vast labyrinth of unaccountable bureaucracies in the hopeless quest for perfect security from terror attacks. And to bring things up the present day, it wasnt the more extreme members of the Senate  be they Jim DeMint and Tom Coburn on the right, or Bernie Sanders on the left  who just voted formore short-term spending and tax cuts without any plan to pay for it. The Tea Partys politics are not my politics, but the movement has virtues as well as vices, and at the very least it represented a possible alternative force at a time when our politics desperately needs alternatives, whether right-wing or left-wing or something else entirely, to the policies that have led us to our present pass.I dont disagree, which is why I have found the last eighteen months highly uncomfortable. I have long thought that the problem with conservatism in the last decade was that it wasnt conservative enough in its free-spending, country-invading, tax-cutting, prisoner-torturing binge. But when an epic recession hits, thats theone time you ease up a little on fiscal tightness. And the bitter partisanship and cultural warfare and religious extremism that the grass roots feed off simply leave me cold if not alarmed.But isnt the solution criticizing the failed record of the political establishmentand calling out charlatans like Glenn Beck? Isnt the answer to take necessary short-term steps to grapple with the recession, while forging a real compromise on taxes and spending for the long term in the next two years? Thats the realistic standard for the Tea Party and, for me, a litmus test for their success. Do they bend the entitlement and defense spending curve sharply downward over the next two decades in what will require a compromise with Obama on such a path?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Media, Men, Politics, The Economy, Updates2010 Midterm elections, BiPartisanship after the 2010 Midterm elections, Democrats, GOP, Obama, Slow spending, Tea Party, To the same and greater goodRead moreThe Senate passes Obama Tax Deal.December 15, 2010jamesb101No commentseWashington (CNN)  The Senate approved a controversial $858 billion tax cut package Wednesday, overwhelmingly voting to extend the Bush-era tax reductions despite a series of objections from both the left and the right.The measure, which passed 81 to 19, now advances to the House of Representatives.Among other things, the package includes a two-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire December 31. It also would extend unemployment benefits for 13 months, cut the payroll tax by 2 percentage points for a year, restore the estate tax at a lower level, and continue a series of other tax breaks.The estate tax  currently scheduled to exempt inheritances up to $1 million and tax amounts above that at a rate of 55%  would be reduced under the tax package to a rate of 35% on amounts above a $5 million individual exemption.The vote came hours after President Barack Obama urged lawmakers Wednesday to approve the deal, which the White House negotiated with Senate GOP leaders..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesDemocrats, The House vote, The Obama Tax Cut Deal, The Senate vote on the billRead morePage 1 of 15123...15Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
