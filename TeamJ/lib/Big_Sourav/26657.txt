NoI am looking for the elusive all nighter. You know, the full night sleep without the blasted helicopters waking me up as they search the seas for drug runners, or illegals.I mean a full night sleep without someones security alarm beeping when they go out to their car to retrieve something at 2:00am.  I dont understand why the bartender neighbor down the street MUST have his stereo blaring when he comes home from work night  no morning  after morning.Sometimes the wonderful sound of the waves crashing on he cliffs wakes me up.  Or how about the seabirds excitingly calling to their friends when a school of bait fish are spotted near the shoreline.  The night herons are wonderful examples of spreading the word.Or, where did that Charley Horse, or crick in my neck come from?Why, after playing a game of scrabble before going to bed, do the letters I used keep appearing in my mind?Why cant I fall asleep without thinking of some topic to write about for the OBRag?Why can Buddy, my Golden Retriever, have dreams that allow him to keep sleeping but wake me up by his noises?Where did that damn fly come from that sounds like a kamikaze circling over my head?Why doesnt the young man dropping off the neighbor girl across the street turn off his motor as they make out in the car?Why do the neighbors down the street have to YELL at each other at 2:00 in the morning?  Why couldnt they yell at each other earlier?Want to know something funny? I can take a nap in the middle of the day and NONE of those noises bother me. I can sleep soundly and wake up refreshed  at least for an hour or so until I find I am tired again.I think instead of turning our clocks back 1 hour in a few weeks, we should turn them back 12 hours.  If I cant sleep at night, maybe I can sleep during the day.Written at 2:45am  October 27th.So.what do I do now until the alarm goes off at 6:00am?Share|Did you find this article interesting?

I talk myself out of getting up and going to it by saying, it is cold; Ill wake up my students; the dog will want to go out, etc.  and I STILL wake up.  Last night there were 5 helicopters that went by.  If the airport is closed from 11:30-6:30 so that the residents sleep is not disturbed, then why do we have to put up with the helicopters?  Thanks for your suggestion.ReplyDallasOctober 28, 2010 at 11:38 amI completely sympathize with you. Many people dont understand insomnia. They think its just your body refusing sleep. Which is so not the case. Its much easier to deal with when your body has the coffee buzz feeling. The worse bouts of insomnia come when your body is fatigued and tired but your mind races about things that surely should (and could) wait until the next morning. Its about your senses catching things it really doesnt need to be catching. Like your neighbors porch light that isnt very bright, but still seeping through the break in the curtain. Or the sound of your nocturnal cat grabbing a midnight snack from the dry bowl.Even worse, though, is the hangover of the insomniac. Those who are prone to sleepless nights can attest to this. Its waking up the next morning after a short nap (loss for a better term) and feeling like you were out all night drinking tequila shots in a loud bar. Your head hurts, your body aches, and even a brisk morning walk for an espresso doesnt do the trick.  Its all the hell of the hangover without all the fun of what you would do to get one.ReplyFrank GormlieOctober 28, 2010 at 11:49 amJudi  hey listen, if it takes you a night without much sleep to come up with your wonderful posts on the OB Rag, well, gee, maybe we should send more mid-night kissers to your neighborhood ha ha ha.Replydave riceOctober 28, 2010 at 1:58 pmI hear ya, Judi  what baffles me is why, even though the lights and noises are ten times worse, if I can squeeze  30-45 minutes to lay down in the afternoon it does more for me than 6-7 hours staring at the ceiling most nightsReplyjudicurryOctober 28, 2010 at 2:24 pmHi, Dallas,  Dave and Frank,Dallas you are so right  I have felt BETTER from a hangover than I sometimes feel when it is time to get up and start the day.  And you are correct  it is the little things that keep me awake.So why, then, do Dave and I feel better after a short nap  even with the distractions  than at night when our body is programmed for sleep?And, Frank, I think all those other little kissers will be dropped off on my corner on Sunday night to trick or treat. The parents keep their motors running so I wonder if I should try to sleep then.  I am wondering if I should ask to see their green cards, or immigration papers, or.before I give them a piece of candy!ReplyJim BaileyOctober 28, 2010 at 2:19 pmWhen I cant sleep at night I usually get up and watch TV or read until I get sleepy or I lay down on the couch with the sound turned low on the TV and usually go right to sleep.  My naps are always accompanied by the low TV.  You seem to have a lot of energy for someone who gets little sleep.ReplyJohn KocaOctober 28, 2010 at 3:37 pmHey Judi, you are hilarious! I would tell you to join the crowd but I see youve already joined. Ill tell ya though, in those midnight hours I have figured some pretty important things out, Ive learned to enjoy the silence, Ive learned to pray better, Ive learned how well my wife sleeps and her little sounds in the night, I know how many skunks and raccoons visit my backyard, I know Im lucky enough to have only one close neighbor who makes noise late at night but only on special weekends. I am still learning though how quiet myself down and try to fall asleep, and I am sure that tonight Ill be wondering what you are going to say in your reply and I wont be able to wait and read it. you write some good thoughts Judi, keep up the good work.:)ReplyjudicurryOctober 28, 2010 at 5:56 pmHi John and Jim,John, I dont want to be the cause of no sleep for you tonight  after all  one of us not sleeping is enough, I thought I better answer this post haste!The only thing different  from your two answers  I am not doing is leaning how well my wife sleeps with her little sounds.  Not having a wife  but not adverse to having one  and losing my husband a year ago, eliminates those sounds from nightly attempt to sleep.  (Although I did tell my husband that he would make someone a wonderful wife!)  Could it be I miss his snoring? Doubt it, because Buddy sometimes snores louder than Bob ever did.  And Jim, I fall asleep with the TV on.  But I also wake up with the TV on.  And when I sleep during the day  I dont have the tv on because I DONT NEED IT TO SLEEP!  Go figure.  John, do you think I could borrow your wife for a night or two to see if that is my problem.  Butit will have to wait two weeks.SeeI host foreign language students that are here to learn English. My student that was supposed to leave tomorrow has decided to stay for 6 months.  Another student  from Germany/Poland will stay until Nov. 11th and a new student from Kazakhstan arrives tonight.  (He sent the school an email saying he would be in around 9:00pm.  No airline; I can imagine what his stay  until Feb. 19th  will be like.  Sorather than have your wife share my new students bed  which was mine last night but will give up to him till the 11th  I can wait to borrow her.  Unless, of course, she doesnt mind sleeping on the other couch in the living room.You may not recognize me, John, but if you are walking down Newport and you see an old lady carrying the bags under her eyes in a recycled bag  chances it is me.  Sleep well. One of us has to.ReplyJohnOctober 31, 2010 at 2:36 pmHi Judi: you are funny! lq (means laughing quietly)on the other note, sorry my wife is not a loaner..I like her herehave a nice day  ReplyjudicurryOctober 31, 2010 at 9:21 pmDarn! Will have to look someplace else for a wife, but if you ever change your mindReplyJohnNovember 1, 2010 at 1:14 pmYea, good luck:)ReplyAbbyOctober 28, 2010 at 6:31 pmHave you tried a white noise generator? I find that really helps block out distractions when I am having trouble sleeping.ReplyobchrisOctober 28, 2010 at 7:47 pmThis is a perfect excuse for gettin outa town, & visiting places like ;  Joshua Tree, & Big Bear   for a while !  Then its always nice to come back home to OB.  Living full time at the beach  definitely has its price !! Thats for sure !ReplyMichael CarnahanOctober 28, 2010 at 9:12 pmRelaxing techniques such as breathing exercises work for me.ReplyjudicurryOctober 29, 2010 at 7:05 amDear Abby, Mike and Zach,Thank you for your great suggestions in my quest to find a cure for insomnia!I have no trouble getting to sleep, but, after 1-2 hours I wake up and cannot go back to sleep.  I have tried the white noise but after waking it no longer helps me.  I have tried deep breathing and even some yoga. It jazzes me up, and walking does not help me sleep.  Buddy would go for a walk any time, as many times a day as I want, but it is trying to get back to sleep that is the problem. Maybe all I need is just 1-2 hours of sleep a day.  Because I am now sleeping on the couch because my bedrooms are full of students, I have a new wake-up call.  The newspaper man throwing the paper on the porch and hitting the front door.  Yes, I still read the newspaper. Cant cuddle up with a lap top and do the crossword puzzle.  Ah well.your ideas are great. ThxReplyZach on the sideOctober 29, 2010 at 3:40 amExercise in general helps sleep, if you can talk the dog into doubling the walk!ReplyGenieOctober 31, 2010 at 1:15 pmI use PBS radio, at night they play classical music, and I put it on very low. It has really helped.ReplyjudicurryOctober 31, 2010 at 2:36 pmThanks. Genie. I will try it.  My trouble is when I recognize what they are playing and hum along with it.  Ill let you know.ReplyCancel reply Leave a CommentName *E-mail *WebsiteWant to be notified of follow-up comments by email?
