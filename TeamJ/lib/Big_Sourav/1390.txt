  Whos Missing? | worldwide hippiesworldwide hippies Changing the world, one mind at a time.HomeAboutStoreEventsFashionMusicNewsOpinionWhos Missing?2010 December 3tags: Diana May-Waldman, missing people, worldwide hippiesby Diana May WaldmanAn astounding 2300 Americans go missing every single day. This to me is a staggering amount of people unaccounted for. If you find it hard to believe that this could be possible, it is because the majority of missing people receive little or no media coverage.The public at large dictates what the media puts out there. We decide what sells newspapers and why we tune into the nightly news.I rarely watch the news. Or I should say, that I dont tune in on a regular basis. I scan the screen on my computer and pick and choose which stories look interesting enough to read. I glance at headlines and get the gist of things. If I am watching a specific television show and the local news stations gives its two minute blurb about what they will feature later in the eveningif it peeks my interest, I might stay tuned for the local or national news. If I am standing in line at the grocery store, I glance at the newspaper. If it looks interesting, I might buy it, but more often than not, I dont. And that is a lot said for a former, print journalist. If I want to read real news, I tune into World Wide Hippies. Its never watered down and it is straight up real news. WWH gets down the heart of the matter. WWH wants to inform and take care of and look out for all brothers and sisters.I personally dont like main stream news anymore. I often scratch my head and wonder why we focus our attention for at least six weeks of news about Tiger Woods. Wasted, wasted air time and paper. Why do we think it is so important to try and figure out whether Eric Massa groped or simply engaged in a tickle fight with someone? We get the gist of it, please move on.Maybe we engross ourselves in these kind of stories, because it prevents us from looking at our own lives or having to deal with real issues. Real news. Real lives. Real news about real lives.I remember the first time that I heard about missing Rochester teen, Brittanee Drexel. I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth and heard the words, Missing Rochester Teen. With toothbrush in hand, I went to the television just as they flashed her picture. See, things like that get my attention. Im a mother and grandmother. What if it were one of mine? I would want you to pay attention. I took a good look at her face and for the next couple of days I searched for word on her.Brittanee Drexel was able to capture Nationwide attention and she was able to stay in the news. Eventually her face and story were all over the Internet. Several Facebook pages were created for her and she became a household name. I attached her picture to the back of my car. I couldnt sleep at night thinking about her. Where was she? What happened to her? In fact, she is still missing.Then, I learned that Rochester had another missing person. Brian Sullivan, who had gone missing long before Brittanee had disappeared. Why hadnt I heard about him? Why wasnt the news media featuring Brian too? Brittanee was all over the television, Internet and radio and I wasnt hearing anything about Brian. I began sending emails to radio and television stations asking that they also include a blurb about Briandont forget Brianplease include Brianremember Brian and nobody ever did.World Wide Hippies featured Brian last week and weve decide to feature a missing person each week. We arent giving up.Brian was last seen at the Burger King restaurant on Chili Avenue in Gates, N.Y. His vehicle was recovered abandoned later that day. He was last heard from when he left a friend a voice mail at 6:10 am on Sunday, July 8th. He has not been seen or heard from since.Brittanee disappeared from Myrtle Beach while on spring break.Natalie Holloway, Morgan Harrington, Elizabeth Smart, Brittanee Drexel, Chelsea King, and Stacy Peterson were all able to dominate the media. The NATIONAL media. Now, dont get me wrong, they should have dominated the media. But, dont all missing persons deserve that too? Ask yourself what all these missing girls have in common? They are young and beautiful.Read the following list of names.Bo Rock, Ben Roseland, Brian Shaffer, Derrick Ray Henagan, Greg Tilley. What do these names have in common and how many of these names have you heard? Honestly, heard? These are missing men.Now read these names. Rochelle Battle, Yasmin Acree, Jaliek Rainwalker and Abree Forkpa. What do these names have in common? Again, how many do recognize? These are the names of African Americans who are missing.With 2,300 reported missing every day, males make up for roughly half of that number.About four out of 10 missing adults are white and three of 10 are black. Looks to me like men dont stand much chance for media attention. Most people will say that they feel men can fend for themselves and it is harder to give sympathy for a missing male than it is to give for a young, attractive female. While that may be plausible, never the less, these men are missing and for one reason or another cant make it back home.If roughly 45% of missing person are African Americans, why is it estimated that they only receive 16% media coverage?Economic, social and ethnic backgrounds play a part in the search for over 106,000 missing persons a year in America. We tend to sympathize with young, white women, while white men and African American men, women and children are largely ignored.Latasha Norman went missing the same time Stacey Peterson did. Do you remember hearing her name or seeing her in the news? The vast majority will answer that they do not recall hearing her name. Latasha, an African American, was reported missing and later found murdered. I never saw her on my national news, but I did see Stacey Petersonand so did you.Jon Benet received national attention (again, and rightly so), but how many of you know the name Lindsey Baum who has disappeared? Or how about Mya Lyons? Her mother still goes door-to-door searching for information in 9-year-old girls stabbing death. Her daughters body was found in an alley a year ago in July. An Amber Alert was never issued for African American child, Mya Lyons. Why?The Amber Alert is named after Amber Hagerman who was abducted while riding her bike and later discovered murdered. It is designed as an emergency broadcast system.The RILYA Alert system was created by the staff at Peas In Their Pods in conjunction with the creator of the Amber Alert, however I have found that most media outlets are unaware of the RILYA Alert, that helps to spread awareness about the fact that African American children account for over 45% of all missing and abducted children.The RILYA Alert system is named for Rilya Wilson, a little girl, that was placed into foster care and fell though the cracks of the Florida Department of Children Services and remains missing. It is said that RILYA stands for Remember, I love you alwaysSo, what if we cut two minutes of Tiger Woods story and featured two missing people on our local news every night? What if every newspaper featured a missing person every day in their newspaper? What if a radio broadcast mention a missing person?With the millions of dollars spent on advertising for television commercials, why dont these sponsors list a missing person and tag their product to it?Why dont we see a two minute blurb and fan the faces of the missing during half time at the Super Bowl?It is possible to reach the masses, we just dont want to. And it is possible to cross gender and racial lines and make sure all missing people are advocated for.Facebook has become new way to network and get the faces of the missing out there, that normally wouldnt be seen. The Internet, itself, has proved to be an invaluable tool in getting information out quickly.See, I cant pretend that I dont know, what I know. I cant pretend that there arent mothers out there with aching arms and fathers with broken heartsI cant pretend that I dont see their faces.If each one us had the courage to post a missing person each day or even each week, we could reach the masses and maybe some of these people will be found. We can give equal attention to those that are missing. For the ones that are ignored are also waiting to be found. They need our voice and guidance to lead them home.Below, please join a cause and help find the missing.Also please feel free to add a missing person in the comment section and lets network together.Peas in Their Pods Children.Every 40 seconds a child is reported missing in the United States. Of these missing children, under 45 percent are African American children. http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=630138112&ref=tshttp://www.facebook.com/blackandmissing?ref=nfHelp Find Lindsey Baum: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=232756400716&ref=tsHelp Find Brian Sullivan: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=145612036015&ref=tsBo Rock http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=824499389&ref=tsRick Morse: http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=829993079&ref=tsNational Center for Missing & Exploited: http://www.facebook.com/pages/National-Center-for-Missing-Exploited-Children/32507971987?ref=tsKelly Sue Ackernecht: http://www.facebook.com/KellisueAckernechtMissing?ref=tsBrian Shaffer: http://www.facebook.com/findbrianshaffer?ref=tsShare/Bookmarkfrom  News16 Responsesleave one             Mikki Tocco permalink             December 3, 2010          You have so eloquently wrote the thoughts of which I have had for a long long time.Stephen Watkins permalink             December 3, 2010          Great Story  I agree with this.  Many lost / Missing / Abducted people could be found faster! I have Shared this on FB.   So when can your website have a photo of my two missing sons to help find them?  Please contact and I will forward you a photo and info.  Best Regards, STEPHEN WATKINS            RJM permalink             December 3, 2010          Its great that WWH has brought focus to the other missing people.  They all deserve the attention the white girl, the senior citizen, the middle aged man, the missing mom, the African American child, the Asian teenager, the Latino bus driver, and so on  each and every person regardless of race, creed, color, orientation, age, religion  they deserve media coverage.Thank you WWH and Diana for bringing attention to this problem.  God Bless Peas In Their Pods for the Rilya Alert.  Keep up the good work.  Media coverage one can trust  Diana May Waldman!            Rick Morse permalink             December 4, 2010          Thank You for well written article that is too true.            Barb Sullivan permalink             December 4, 2010          Great article Diana. You hit it right on and as Mikki wrote it was said eloquently. Thank You for trying to bring attention to the Brians and the Latashas.            Mitchell Waldman permalink             December 4, 2010          Very well written piece, Diana, and a subject that people certainly need to be made aware of and act on. We all have to participate in helping find these missing souls, especially those left behind. No one person is more important than another. Were all in this together.Eigbrettmom permalink             December 4, 2010          Need I say more? As always you prove the point and get people to see that there are ways that they too can help & with little effort. 8o)Now if we could only get the media to buy into giving up the valuable time they keep giving to useless topics!PENolan permalink             December 4, 2010          Diana, thanks for this whole series.  The stories give a face to an issue that is too often reduced to a photo on a milk carton, and the face makes it painfully real.Delilah permalink             December 4, 2010          Excellent, well written and an issue that desperately needs attention! Its mind boggling how some are chosen to receive attention and some are not.  As the motto of CUE Center for Missing Persons says, Every missing person is somebodys child.  How can media place a value on that?Each of us who know about the staggering statistics of missing persons must make it our responsibility to help in any small way we can, because we know!  Thank you, Diana, and the countless others who make time every day to remember those who are often forgotten.            Diana May Waldman permalink             December 4, 2010          Thanks all! WWH, doesnt want to give the watered down version. These are real stories and real people.. WWH is growing and we hope to keep growing and hope to keep making people aware, so we can all see positive changes in the world. We have to look out for one another.Keep spreading the kindness and lovethere is nothing we cant do if we pull togetherwe are the world.Kelly Jolkowski permalink             December 4, 2010          Excellent article, and oh so true. Its difficult to battle all the prejudices and misunderstandings about missing persons, but we can try. My young adult son has been missing for more than 9 years, and I would have never had the little bit of national attention for him if it werent for the work we do and the fact that families we assisted begged producers to feature him. Kelly Jolkowski, Mother of Missing Jason JolkowskiPresident and Founder,Project Jasonhttp://www.projectjason.orgAll missing persons are loved by someone, and their families deserve to find the answers they seek in regards to the disappearance.            Michelle permalink             December 4, 2010          The missing, how little attention is paid to the issue, and the socio economic truths involved in what minimal reporting there isits nauseating that in crisis situations physical appearance dictates whether or not the missing receive proper attention.  You are absolutely right. Two less minutes of nonsense like Tiger Woods could give attention to those who really need AND deserve it. Were so used to being entertained that we forget that we are all citizens of this planet, and have a responsibility to look out for each other. It is possible to reach the masses, we just dont want to. And it is possible to cross gender and racial lines and make sure all missing people are advocated for. Well said.  Lead the way dear friend.  Ill be happy to spread the word right along with you.Maureen permalink             December 4, 2010          Great article!  Being in this world of the missing for over 5 years now it did my heart good to see someone else write the words that Ive been screaming this whole time!  Very nice to also see many of my friends whose loved ones are missing mentioned on here too.Missing male adults do make up most of the missing.  Missing male adults of all colors and all walks of life are the least concern of the media and the public  .. that needs to be changed!  Adult males  are loved and missed just as much as any other missing person.Everyone that is missing should matter to all.Maureen ReintjesAdminPeace4 the Missing (http://peace4missing.ning.com)National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs.gov) Victims Advocate Kansas Teamhttp://www.reintjes.usValerie Nettles permalink             December 6, 2010          Thanks for this article.  My son was 16 when he went missing, 14 years ago,  and I was almost laughed out of the local police station in the UK when I reported him missing.  The police told me he had gone off on a funny five minutes when we knew in every fiber of our being that this was not normal and totally out of character.  We have had to battle for 14 years and constantly keep up the profile to keep the case out there in peoples minds.  It is exhausting.  We get very little help from the handful of UK charities struggling to deal with this issue with thousands going missing each year.  The recent Government budget cuts in the UK just slashed money from these charitiesnow what?            Lonnette Brawner permalink             December 8, 2010          Good to see journalists taking the initiative to write about this subject.   I personally understand this tragic experience.  Our family has been searching for our missing loved one for 2 1/2 years.  Because he was an older white male, I had to practically beg local media to cover his case.  Forget national media.  Every individual that goes missing in this country is important to someone.  Children, obviously are more vulnerable and deserve featured coverage, but the adults, because they can choose to go missing, deserve the benefit of the doubt that some tragic circumstance could have befallen them, and deserve coverage as well.  Just as every teen cannot be categorized a runaway, not every adult has chosen to disappear.   As a missing persons advocate for the last 2 1/2 years, I have seen the volume of cases increase to almost epidemic proportion.  We cannot educate our children about stranger danger anymore.  Now we have to educate them that ANYONE, including your own parent or step-parent can be a potential perpetrator.  Education for our children and our law enforcement officers, need to be improved upon and changed.  Our laws need to be re-examined and changed to provide avenues to law enforcement on a state wide basis, eliminating state by state guidelines that are left to interpretation of the individual agencies and officers.  Stiffer penalties need to be implemented in the legal system for perpetrators and violators of human trust.  Until you have personally felt the pain of this horrific experience, you cannot fully understand the pain of the not knowing where your loved one is.  I have spoken to parents, husbands, wives, children of the missing.  1 day, 10 days, 365 days, 20 years.the pain is the same.  The not knowing is the worst.   Contact a local missing persons organization in your area, to find out how you can Help Bring The Missing Home.Elizabeth Meserve permalink             December 29, 2010          Thank you for your article. I am one of the lucky ones I know as my niece (Megan Waterman missing mother from Maine)has gotten national attention. I was very surprised by the contacts I have gained from familiy members of woman who went missing in that same area around the same time which I never saw on the news. I have posted this article to my FB page and hope more media will take notice of the thousands who dont get the ocverage we get.Click here to cancel reply.Leave a ReplyName: (required):Email:  (required):Website:Comment:Note: You can use basic XHTML in your comments.
