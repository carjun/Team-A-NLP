This morning I got to meet Jim Dent, the Point Loma electrician who was compelled to help an elderly gentleman who had called him needing some electrical work done. Jim discovered that was just the tip of the iceberg A call for help went out and the community answered. There is much more work to do and I have no doubt that call will be answered too, but I have to tell you about what happened today.The group of people that came together this morning was as diverse as it was courageous. Jim had warned everyone in his emails and comments leading up to todays cleanup that the conditions were bad and he was well prepared, providing everyone with respirator masks and sturdy gloves. As folks showed up he asked that everyone sign in so we could keep track of who had volunteered (well do a more complete report later) and we passed out supplies. Shovels, mops, brooms, trash bags49 commentsRead the full article State Panel puts off decision on Southern California marine sanctuaries including OB and Sunset CliffsOctober 30, 2009For nearly the entire past year a panel of marine experts have been putting together proposals for redesigning Californias system of marine protected areas along the southern coast. The areas include Ocean Beach and Sunset Cliffs, and other parts of San Diego County.  The OB coast is considered one of the chief areas of contention.The experts have come up with three proposals for marine sanctuaries  and all of them would more than double the space to be set aside for protecting sea life on the Southern California coast. The trio of proposals would provide from 380 to 413 square miles of near-shore waters as safety zones for species  more than twice the current amount of 182 squares miles.3 commentsRead the full article OB Flashes  News, Calendar and Discussion Board for Oct 30th  Nov 5th, 2009October 30, 2009Crane works on jetty repairFederal stimulus are being used to repair the Mission Bay channel entryway.

For all we know, it might be even bigger than all the official events celebrated around town, given the young and how shall we say it?unconventional ethos of this community. It may be a kids celebration in most parts of the country, but here in OB, Halloween is an excuse to get wicked and p.a.r.t.y. So step on up and do a couple of shots of Jaeger and lets get ready for the big day.4 commentsRead the full article Buzzing About OB  Searching For a Good Cuppa JoeOctober 29, 2009by Doug PorterWe can trace the history of our love affair with coffee back to a Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi. The story goes that one day Kaldi noticed his herd dancing from one coffee shrub to another, grazing on the cherry-red berries containing the beans. He nibbled a few himself and was soon frolicking with his flock.History tells us other Africans of the same era fueled up on protein-rich coffee-and-animal-fat ballsprimitive PowerBarsand unwound with wine made from coffee-berry pulp. Coffee later crossed the Red Sea to Arabia, where Yemeni traders sold the beans to traders.19 commentsRead the full article Locals mobilize via OB Rag to help elderly Point Loma residentOctober 28, 2009Jim Dent, who owns Point Loma Electric, found out the hard way.  He has an elderly client, Robert Ehmann, who asked him to come by his place on Orchard Avenue to do some electrical work. Jim and his assistant arrived, they went inside, and immediately stumbled out.The stench was too bad. The garbage was too widespread. They almost refused to go back in.  The elderly man, in his mid-80s, could hardly talk, was bent over and could barely walk.  He begged they to do a couple of things.Thats when Jim Dent realized what he had on his hands.  He had a situation that he couldnt just walk away from.39 commentsRead the full article OB Music Community  a golden garden tended with love and enthusiasmOctober 28, 2009by Dave GilbertWinstons? Sounds good!Hey man! You want to know what OBs coolest new best kept secret is? They just started this here in October so you may not be (as they say) hep to the jive, but its Happy Hour at Winstons every Thursday evening from 5 til 8 pm. I dont know about you, but I completely dig a no cover charge to hear some of Southern Californias best musical artists and acts perform at a great live venue while Kate the bartender serves up some great libations. Hey, maybe youve just always wanted to perform for your friends and others at a local night spot. A place that has national acts and yet still doesnt break the bank while you knock back $2 Nati Lites, $3 PBRs and/or $2 house shots.11 commentsRead the full article OB Canine Carnival Celebrates Howl-O-Ween  Photo GalleryOctober 26, 2009by Dog PorterYou have to lift your leg in support of the dog owners of Ocean Beach. These humans dragged their decked out doggies down to Dusty Rhodes park on Sunday to participate in the 4th Annual Kiwanis Dog Carnival.A howling good time was had by all. Despite the large number of dogs in drag and various other costumes, no one got hot under the collar. We did learn that the latest high fashion item for celebrity dogs is a cellphone  a little bluetooth unit imbedded in their neckwear. Yup, now Fifi will have ring around the collar!9 commentsRead the full article DaddyingOctober 26, 2009My mind cant move away from thoughts of fatherhood ever since I wrote An Unrequited Wish for the OB Rag sometime ago wherein I shared my belief that my late soul mates dads indiscretions with her throughout her childhood led to her taking her life.Most of my reflecting has been about my own experiences as a dad starting back when I first heard that I was a father to be. The news caught me off guard completely. I mean, in one moment, I was strutting down the halls of Tucson High, wearing my big red T for my basketball artistry, All-City, All-State, All-Star, All-Ego, in the flow, high fiving and asking Whats happening? of everybody I happened to know, throwing in all the latest dance steps just to diversify the show  and, in the next moment, somewhere in the middle of all the festivities my girlfriend managed to say to me: Im pregnant.6 commentsRead the full article 1972: Early History of the OB Rag  Ocean Beachs Underground Newspaper October 25, 2009(Editor: With the blog OB Rag celebrating its second birthday, we thought it would be cool and appropriate to publish some more history of the original OB Rag, OBs underground newspaper of the 1970s.

Having returned to San Diego after thirty some odd years as a hospitality manager, it took a little while for me to find my voice.  This is, as you may have heard, an all volunteer effort, so finding your passion has to come from the inside.3 commentsRead the full article Newport News  news from OBs main streetOctober 24, 2009OCEAN BEACH, CA.

The Navy sprayed, burned or buried an estimated 500,000 gallons of fuel during that period.1 commentRead the full article Is Ocean Beach ready for its own airport  off-shore?October 24, 2009Editor: Way back in the Sixties, then-Mayor Frank Curran  before he was sent to prison for his involvement in the Yellow Cab scandal  proposed building a floating airport for San Diego off the southern tip of Point Loma.

When Voice of San Diego announced recently that they were hiring three reporters from out of town, I gave them all kinds of hell.Why, I asked, would you hire someone from out of town when we have all kinds of good and decent and knowledgeable reporters and journalists right here in good ol San Diego? New reporters come in, knowing nothing about our history, the players, the scandals, whats going on, and have to take months just to catch up.  The Union-Tribune itself has laid off all kinds of journalists over the last year, and Im certain many of them would be happy to move to online news production and writing.36 commentsRead the full article 1 Million pounds of trash removed from San Diego RiverOctober 23, 2009The San Diego River Park Foundation says it expects to reach a milestone at a river clean-up event Saturday.
