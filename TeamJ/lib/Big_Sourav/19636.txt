Appropriate use of a block can help prevent imminent problematic conduct and disruption to Wikipedia.Contents1 When not to block2 When to block3 How to block4 User blocks/unblocks5 IP blocks/unblocks6 Username blocks/unblocks7 Other linksWhen not to blockMain page: WP:INVOLVEDDo not block someone where you have, or may seem to have, a conflict of interest with regards to the editor in question or the topic in dispute  known as being "involved". This is generally construed very broadly by the community, to include current or past conflicts with an editor (or editors) and disputes on topics, regardless of the nature, age, or outcome of the dispute. However, issuing warnings, calm and reasonable discussion and explanation of those warnings, advice about communal norms, and suggestions on possible wordings and approaches, do not make an administrator 'involved'.In cases which are straightforward, (e.g. blatant vandalism), the community has historically endorsed the obvious action of any administrator  even if involved  on the basis that any reasonable administrator would have probably come to the same conclusion. When in doubt, however, raise the matter at the relevant noticeboard and let other administrators take action, if appropriate.When to blockCommon User block templatesTemporaryIndefiniteVandalism:{{uw-vblock}}{{uw-voablock}}3RR:{{uw-3block}}N/ASpamming:{{uw-sblock}}{{Spamblock}}UserName:N/A{{uw-ublock}}Legal threats:N/A{{uw-lblock}}Sockpuppetry:N/A{{Indefblockeduser}}Harassment:{{uw-hblock}}Generic Block:{{uw-block1}}{{uw-block3}}One critical point to remember is that we block users to protect the encyclopedia from harm; blocks should not be punitive. Blocks can be used for:persistent vandalism;3RR violations;persistent gross incivility;persistent harassment;persistent spamming;edit warring or revert warring;breaching the sock puppetry policy;persistently violating other policies or guidelines;persistently making personal attacks;making personal, professional or legal threats (including outside the Wikipedia site);persistently posting material contrary to the biographies of living persons policy;accounts that appear to have been compromised, as an emergency measure.Note Blocking may be used in other situations (not just the above), where particular situations are addressed by more specific policies dealing with particular issues.Blocks sometimes are used to allow discussions (such as AfD discussions) to proceed without interruption. The block length usually is based on how long you think the block needs to be in place to protect the encyclopedia. 3RR violations usually have a period between 12 hours and 48 hours (some administrators prefer 31 hours). Registered sockpuppet accounts receive indefinite blocks, however, IP sockpuppet accounts only receive temporary blocks. Discussion blocks might last long enough to conclude the discussion.Blocks are most often used after a user continues to vandalize despite repeated warnings. Such blocks generally are imposed when a user continues to vandalize after a final warning (corresponding to a level 4 warning template) but this is a guideline, not a hard and fast rule. Template warnings are often used but are not required. Single purpose accounts or vandalism-only accounts may warrant blocking with fewer warnings. In cases of gross or extreme vandalism a warning is not needed at all, such as in the case of promotion of hate and racism, or uploading shock images. Other users will deserve only one warning, others more warnings. Decide on the severity of the behavior and the likelihood of salvaging a good user. No hard and fast rule will do; use your good judgment.The actual block procedure is not too difficult. Open the blocking template, select a block time, pick a listed reason or write one yourself, and press block. Blocking etiquette is simple, too. Administrators should not unblock users blocked in good faith by another administrator. If you plan on undoing another admin's block, ask them to consider unblocking first. If that is not possible and there is good reason to unblock, notify the original blocking admin and consider posting a note at WP:AN to let other administrators review your intended actions. This will prevent wheel warring which would otherwise escalate into a dispute.Note: The relevant policy can be found at the block policy page.How to blockBlocking a user is accomplished by filling out the blocking form. The blocking form can seem complicated at first with all of its check boxes and options; however, once you understand what these options do, it is easy to determine which are needed and which aren't. Below is a step by step guide on how to make blocks to different groups of users.Follow the instructions through and then block the users as the guide says.yes, it's fine for you to block User:ThisIsaTest, User:192.0.2.16 and User:Keegagan !!Note: Please make sure to unblock the users/IP's that you have test-blocked when you're done so that these steps may be repeated by the next Admin.User blocks/unblocksNote: User:ThisIsaTest is a test account and is available for testing purposes.

He has sequentially received the four warnings {{uw-test1}}, {{uw-test2}}, {{uw-test3}}, and {{uw-test4}} (which is more than adequate warning), yet he still continues his rampage. With his continued rampage after adequate warning, he needs to be blocked to stop any further disruption.Typical Admin blocking formView ThisIsaTest's Talk Page, verify that he/she has been adequately warned and that the warnings are recent.Click on ThisIsaTest's contributions.Verify that ThisIsaTest has continued to vandalize after being adequately warned.Directly under the title you should see ""  click on block.
