Carolyn McCarthys (D-N.Y.) bill also goes further than than the assault weapon ban that expired in 2004, outlawing the sale or transfer of clips that hold more than ten rounds, even those obtained before the law takes effect, according to a copy of the bill obtained by POLITICO.Continue ReadingText Size-+resetAUDIO: Rep. McCarthy on high-capacity ammunitionVIDEO: Bloomberg on gunsPOLITICO 44The bill closes a loophole in the expired assault weapon ban that let gun owners buy high-capacity magazines made before the ban took effect in 1994.The bill carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.The only purpose for the existence of these devices is to be able to shoot as many people as possible as quickly as possible, McCarthy wrote in a letter to her colleagues that accompanied the bill. There is no reason that these devices should be available to the general public.The bill faces an uphill climb in the new Republican-controlled House. An aide to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said its unlikely that he would support it.Still, since McCarthy floated her plans for a gun-control bill on Sunday, three other New Yorkers have followed suit, saying they planned to introduce bills as well. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) said he will propose a companion bill to McCarths in the Senate.Gun control is a personal matter for McCarthy, whose husband was murdered and son seriously injured in 1993, when a disturbed gunman opened fire on a Long Island commuter train. Like the alleged Arizona shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, the gunman who killed McCarthys husband also used a high-capacity magazine.The United States Constitution guarantees to our citizens the right to keep and bear arms, McCarthy wrote in a letter to her colleagues that accompanied the bill. At the same time that we can all acknowledge this basic right, I believe that we should also be able to come together to develop reasonable laws designed to ensure that the right to bear arms is exercised safely and responsibly.McCarthy originally planned to introduce the legislation this week, but in the wake of the shooting, the House suspended most of its regular business until next week.214 CommentsRSSEmailPrintBack to topRead more about:John Boehner,Bill Clinton,Guns,Gun Control,Carolyn McCarthy,Frank Lautenberg,Arizona ShootingGet reporter alertsShira ToeplitzEmail More on POLITICOZero hour for Michael Steele at RNCThe astronaut by her sideTeam Obama faces 2012 cash challengeObama speech recalls ReaganReaders' Comments (214)Have an opinion on our comments system?

I was in CA when freeway shootings were common place. One bullet or many, it doesn't matter, people are dead. And so, my neighbor emptied a single shot 22 aiming (and hitting my dog), the legistlation would stop him? Does she realize a 22 bullet can go one mile? Nothing has stopped the intercity violence. Of course congressmen from those districts haven't stopped pedalling the same old rhetoic either. So we put a stop gate in here for semi automatic rifles, will we see an increase of single shot long range rifles instead? Guns cannot fire their own triggers. (assumingly) so where is the focus on the basic problem? This one incident, which happens multiple times throughout the US every day, is being used to limit guns but the other tragedies didn't count? I'm confused. How do you resolve I kept a gun in very liberal CA but don't feel the need to in my conservative state I now live in? Are people supposed to change their politics too?

ReplyQuoteReport AbusePoppa Party: RepublicanReply #9Jan. 13, 2011 - 2:03 PM ESTShe's a nutcase but I agree that there is no reason to have a 33 round 9 MM clip. The problem is that even if they become illegal they will still be around. Then they will be in the illegal gun trade and that's when kids and crazies can access them at the corner 7-11.ReplyQuoteReport AbuseTheEducatedPatriot Party: IndependentReply #10Jan. 13, 2011 - 2:14 PM ESTCan we get away from "symbolic" bills? There is no appetite for gun control even after this tragedy. I doubt you could get a 31 round handgun magazine ban, never mind one that would arguably outlaw most of the semi-automatic handguns made today.  The same could be said of the healthcare repeal bill. Everyone knows Its not going to pass, so why are we doing it?

That is a result of bringing so many cultures and beliefs together. What makes this country great is also part of it's problems. Gun laws like this will not help. All we can ask for is that the level headed majority of this great country can manage to survive to pass on common sense and open mindness to our young so the nuts don't take over.ReplyQuoteReport Abusereason 1 Party: ConservativeReply #14Jan. 13, 2011 - 2:47 PM ESTLOL... another Liberal pointless exercise in futility... ReplyQuoteReport Abusehallaquila Party: DemocratReply #15Jan. 13, 2011 - 2:49 PM ESTJudging by the ranting right-wingers, I can suppose that you are the easily frightened and have no understanding that a congresswoman who had her husband murdered and son wounded by a gunman like in Tuscon with a large capacity clip might want to outlaw these needless clips. The rightees unlike the leftees love their guns and are paranoid and hate government--sounds like the Tuscon shooter which ya'll dismiss as simply crazy. If he was so crazy, how was he able to buy a semi-auto Glock and the large capacity clip? Sometimes I think Republicans are so obcessed about gun protection is because they are afraid that the gullible public will one day wake up and realize how much the GOP (Greed On Parade) crowd has robbed working class America.  Recall that in 2000, George Bush promised not to repeal the assault weapons ban which included the extended-capacity clips and automatic weapons. He sold out to the NRA twits and America is back to the 30,000-plus gun deaths annually and should include the 30,000 killed in Mexico over the last three years by the drug cartels most of whose weapons are smuggled from the US. Mexico, by the way, has stricter gun laws than the US. The GOP-packed SCOTUS has ruled that everybody has a right to own a gun provided that they are mentally stable or do not show a history of violent and criminal behavior. The GOP are against background checks, particularly at gun shows where any twisted jerk can buy lots of guns, and want to continually expand gun usage and the ability to carry concealed weapons anywhere including at political rallies, in government buildings, restaurants, and colleges. (Try putting God in your life and that fear will subside.)    I can't help wondering how many of you faux-macho men attended college, served in the military, or have served your country or your God in any way. Most of us who grew up in rural areas and were exposed to guns and hunting lost the thrill of killing for pleasure and, later, through military service, eventually lost interest in guns and weaponry.ReplyQuoteReport Abusewyatt515 Party: ConservativeReply #16Jan. 13, 2011 - 2:59 PM ESTHigh capacity magazines should be available to sane law abiding citizens of this Great Nation. The American people will need a way to defend themselves from the far reaching, constitution ignoring politicians that strive to strip away the rights of their constituents.ReplyQuoteReport AbuseLeftywacker Party: ConservativeReply #17Jan. 13, 2011 - 3:01 PM ESTI'm sure Rep. McCarthy's proposed bill is close to heart, given the same circumstances of her husband's killer who also had a large-capacity clip. But this is just another ill-informed bill aimed (no pun intended) to further infringe on our 2nd Amendment rights. It's always the liberal Gov't (state or Fed.) who are trying making it more difficult to own "certain types" guns and ammo, and chip away at the 2nd Amendment. Remember, every little piece of legilation that chips away at our 2nd Amendment rights, we become that much closer to having Liberals ban guns altogether. Liberals and anti-gun types refuse to admit that old saying is true; "Guns don't kill, people do". A 10 round clip or an extended clip doesn't matter one iota. It's the "lunatic factor" that matters, and making it a point to enforce the existing guns laws and better screening of applicants, that are already on the books. You can use the Mexican/U.S. border immigration issue as a perfect analogy. You'll never stop crazed people from killing others, no matter how many rounds are in their clip or revolver. In a frenzy, such as what was going on at the time of the killings in AZ., I could have had four or more 10 round clips with me, shoot and reload before anyone new what was happening. The whole concept of this proposed bill is just plain stupid, so it MUST be just another bill to infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners! This bill will never pass the house, and this is only one of many "good reasons" that the Republicans took the house back!
