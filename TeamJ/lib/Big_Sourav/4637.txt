The city lies on an altitude of 1,330m above sea level on the Shahar Chay river (City River). Urmia is the 10th most populated city in Iran with a population of about 600,000.[1] The population is predominantly Azerbaijani and Kurdish, with significant Assyrian and Armenian minorities.[2]Urmia is situated on a fertile plain called Urmia Plain, on western side of Lake Urmia; and eastern side of Turkish border and marginal range of mountains.Urmia is the trade center for a fertile agricultural region where fruit (especially Apple and Grape) and Tobacco are grown. An important town by the 9th cent., Urmia was seized by the Seljuk Turks (1184), and later occupied a number of times by the Ottoman Turks. Urmia was the seat of the first U.S. Christian mission in Iran (1835). Around 1900 Christians made up more than 40% of the city's population, however, most of the Christians fled in 1918.[3]Contents1 Etymology2 History3 Geography3.1 Climate4 Demographics4.1 Language4.2 Religion5 Sport6 Consulates7 Ethnography8 Culture8.1 Museums9 Education9.1 Higher education9.2 Libraries10 Media10.1 Television10.2 Radio10.3 Press11 Infrastructure11.1 Health systems11.2 Transportation12 Plane Crash13 Celebrities14 See also15 Photo Gallery of Urmia16 References17 External links[edit] EtymologyThe name Urmia is thought to have come from Sumerian tongue, the earliest known civilization in the world located in southern Mesopotamia. Ur was a principal Sumerian city. Some believe the name is derived from Syriac. Ur, meaning "cradle," and mia, meaning "water." Hence, Urmia, situated by a lake and surrounded by rivers, would be the cradle of water. Some have claimed connections to other languages. There is, however, no generally accepted etymology.[edit] HistoryThe city of Urmia (Urmiyeh), in northwest of Iran, is considered one of the ancient cities of the country and a Cradle of civilization.The diggings in the ancient ruins around Urmia led to the discovery of utensils, some of which date back to some 2000 years B.C.Also research by Professor Minorski shows that there have been villages in the Urmia plain some 2000 years B.C., with their civilization under the influence of Van nation.In the ancient times, the west bank of Urmia lake was called Gilzan, and in the ninth century B.C. an independent government ruled there which later joined the Urartu or Mana empire; in the eight century B.C., the area was a vassal of the Asuzh government until it joined the Median Empire after its formation.All and all, according to historical documents, the western part of the Urmia Lake has been a center of attention of the prehistoric nations, the evidence of which are the numerous ancient hills in the area, such as Gouy Tapeh, 6kilometers southeast of the lake which competes with the oldest hills of Mesopotamia, Asia the Minor, and the Iranian Plateau.Many old Islamic historians have acknowledged Urmia as the birthplace of prophet Zoroaster.The claim that the area was the birthplace of Zoroaster, or even the burial site of one or two of the Zoroastrian priests who allegedly traveled to Bethlehem for Christs birth indicate that the city has been one of the largest religious and scientific centers of the ancient times. [4]Urmia, according to some historians, is believed to be the birthplace of the prophet Zarathustra, the founder of Zoroastrianism.[5] The Columbia Encyclopedia mentions that Urmia was an important town in the region during the 9th century.[6]The Ottoman Turks made several incursions into the city, but the Safavids were soon able to regain control over the area. The first monarch of Iran's Qajar dynasty, Agha Muhammad Khan, was crowned in Urmia in 1795. Due to Urmia's relatively large Christian population growth by the end of the 19th century, Urmia also became the seat of the first American Christian mission in Iran in 1835. Another mission soon became operational in nearby Tabriz as well. The Catholic Encyclopedia mentions Urmia as the seat of a Chaldean diocese.[7][edit] Geography[edit] ClimateUrmia's climate is semi-arid (Kppen BSk) with moderately cold winters, mild springs, hot, dry summers (though mild for Iran) and crisp autumns.

For this reason, the demographics of the city have undergone numerous changes. Some historical documents show that at the beginning of the 20th century, the city's population had a significant Christian minority (Assyrians and Armenians).[9] According to Macuch, and Ishaya, the city was the spiritual capital of the Assyrians from 1830 to the end of World War I by the influence of four Christian missions.[10] Some of the Assyrians and Armenians left the region in 1914 after battles between the Russian and Ottoman armies which led to a shift in the city's demographics.[10] During the era of Reza Shah Pahlavi, Iranian Assyrians were invited to return to the region and several thousand did return.[edit] CultureThis section requires expansion.[edit] MuseumsNatural History Museum - Displays the animals native to the vicinity of Urmia.Urmia Museum - Archaeological museum affiliated with the faculty of Shahid Beheshti University.[edit] EducationUrmia University's entranceUrmia University's hall[edit] Higher educationUrmia was an important center for higher education approximately a century ago, indeed, medical faculty of Urmia which was built by Joseph Cochran and a team of American medical associates in 1878, is the first University of Iran.
