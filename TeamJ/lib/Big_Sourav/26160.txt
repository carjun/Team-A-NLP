Schoen conducted the poll, apparently at Holtzmans request, between March 27 and April 1, with a sample size of 500, and claims his research shows that in the seven-way race of current Democratic contenders considering or declared in the race, Holtzman has a 20 point lead.  Holtzman had 29 percent, and Nassau County District AttorneyKathleen Rice had 9 percent, while state Sen. Eric Schneiderman andDenise ODonnell were tied at 4 percent each.  It is my considered opinion that if Liz Holtzman runs, she will be a very strong candidate and would begin as the odds-on frontrunner for Attorney General in New York, Schoen said in a statement accompanying the poll, which was distributed wide to reporters.  It wasnt immediately clear whether Holtzman paid for the poll out of her own pocket.Note..This is a reprint of an earlier Political101 postShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Polls, Updates, WomenBreaking News, Law, Men, Polls, Projections, WomenRead moreThe Democratic National Committee will help out House/Senate and Governors with $50 Milllon..June 25, 2010jamesb101No commentsPresident Obama and others are helping the DNC raise a lot of money..They are going to need to keep it up..The Democrats could lose a lot of seats..The Republicans are in trouble.several donors have indicated that they will not give to the Republican National Committee because of concerns with its head..Michael Steele..The Democratic National Committee will contribute more than $50 million in cash and services for Novembers midterm elections, a top Democratic official tells POLITICO.The payments for House, Senate and governors races will start in June.

Ill bet youre wrong.. This piece from MyDD. Com gives the surprising answerThe One Agency We Trust More Today than in the 90sbyJonathan Singer, Sun Apr 18, 2010 at 11:14:10 PM EDT  A lot of interesting and ominous data from the latestPew poll worth sorting through tonight. But one point that stood out to me as particularly surprising is the comparison of sentiments towards various government agencies today versus in 1997.  Over the past decade, Americans views towards a majority of the federal government agencies polled by Pew have declined significantly. Only a small handful of agencies, like the FBI and the Veterans Administration, have seen their favorability ratings hold firm.  The one agency to see its numbers increase significantly in the past 13 years? You wouldnt guess it, but the Internal Revenue Service.

Orrin Hatch, the vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Senate GOP Conference Chairman Lamar Alexander are among the hosts of the event. The NRSC has not formally endorsed Rossi, but worked to recruit him into the race.Jennifer Morris, a spokeswoman for Rossi, said there was no conflict between Rossis criticism of politics as usual and the support hes drawing from longtime lawmakers.When Dino went to DC in March, he made it very clear to all of the senators he met with that, if Republicans werent going to change their ways, he had no interest in running for Senate, Morris said. Dino welcomes the support of anyone whos ready to work in good faith to change the direction the country is headed by putting an end to trillion-dollar budget deficits, industry-wide bailouts, and government waste.South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, whose Senate Conservatives Fund PAC has shuttled money to insurgent Senate candidates in several key races, will be present at the Washington fundraiser.Matt Hoskins, a spokesman for DeMints PAC, said the senators appearance didnt indicate that he was endorsing Rossi.

Kevin Cooksaid that foreign-flagged vessels are inspected at least once a year for compliance with work safety regulations. But after being grilled by lawmakers, Cook also conceded that U.S.-flagged vessels are inspected more rigorously, theL.A. Times reported.In the case of foreign-flagged vessels, theTimes wrote, the Coast Guard relies in part on outside companies that submit detailed inspection reports that are then reviewed by the Coast Guard.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Military, Politics, UpdatesBreaking News, Counterpoints, Ecology, Gulf Oil Rig Inspections, Health, Military, Travel, US Coast GuardRead morePage 1 of 42123...42Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (145) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsScott P on Will the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?Scott P on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Day Your Ad Here 2011 Politicaldog101.ComDesign by SRS Solutions
