Her naked and decomposing body wasdiscovered 17 days later in the middle of a grassy field. She died at the handsof paedophile monster Roy Whiting and this book tells the story of her birth,life, death and legacy, from her mothers viewpoint.The first half of the book tells of their earlier lives leadingup to the disappearance, of the emotions and struggles her family went throughwhen it happened, believing her to be lying injured somewhere, refusing tothink the worst. Sara Payne describes frankly how she and her husband drankheavily to try and blot out the pain; how the police assigned the familyliaison officers to keep them up to date with the search; how well they werelooked after by everyone but they barely took it in as they struggled to cometo terms with what was happening; how they held their other children closerduring this dreadful time and since.For a long time they blamed themselves. The day Sarah wentmissing, the family had gone down to the coast to visit the grandparents. Inthe early evening the children were playing on the shore, and pleaded withtheir parents to be left to play on their own while the parents visited afriend nearby.Sara Payne: A Mother's StoryAmazon Price: $7.33List Price: $14.45 See all 5 photossarah payne as her face appeared in the newspapersThe abuctionIt was the first time they had left Sarah and her littlesister unsupervised, but their two older brothers were with them (aged 11 and13) and so it was decided they could stay there alone, provided they all stayedtogether.Sara Payne and her husband Mike dropped into the local pubfor a quick half before heading back to the grandparents house at around 7.45pm.Arriving there it was to find the family frantic as Sarahhad disappeared. The book is really heart-wrenching at this point, as Sara describesher feelings of panic as she desperately searched the surrounding field for herdaughter, hoping against hope that the wee one was just hiding in the tallcrops in the fields bordered by unruly hedgerows, the panic rising all the timeas she knew her daughter was not the type of child to play this kind of gameand would have been scared to be all alone.Turns out the children had come off the beach and ambledback  towards their grandparents home,stopping to play in a field next to the house. They had been playing some gameor other, and Sarah had fallen and hurt herself, then ran off crying home. Oneof her older brothers had been in the process of running after her, when hisother little sister got stung by nettles so he turned back to comfort her.There was a clear line of sight between the field and thehouse, but when he turned round again to watch Sarah on her journey home,she had disappeared. roy whiting's white vanwhite vanHe later told police he had seen a man in a white van nearbyat the time, but didnt pay much attention. He described the man as scruffylooking with a gap tooth, and this man had nodded and smiled in his direction.The family searched everywhere that evening, askingneighbours in the community to help, and finally just before darkness fell,called the police. (In July it gets dark about 10  10.30pm).A massive police search ensued, involving helicopters andhundreds of police officers, and when the story hit the Press it stayed top ofthe news items on all TV channels and newspapers for weeks. Sarah Paynes facebecame as familiar as your own childs, smiling out from the newsprints frontpages day and day.how her mum dealt with thingsFrom the book, it seemed that the mother Sara seemed to bethe one most in control. She makes reference to it several times how she feltshe had to be strong for everyone, especially the children, and how she heldherself together fearing that if she didnt, she would not be able to acceptthe reality of it all and just go mad with grief.It was she, therefore, who fielded most of the questions atPress conferences; she who dealt with the telephone ringing off the hook; shewho dealt with the hordes of reporters camped outside their house.Her husband dealt with his grief in a much more private way,and he just couldnt face the crowds and the cameras most of the time.The book goes on to describe the releasing of Sarahs bodyfor burial, the public and the private services held for her, and later thecourt case of the man accused of abducting and murdering Sarah, whose body was sobadly decomposed it was difficult to impossible for the coroners to determineexactly how she died.prayersThe whole country prayed for the safe return of this littlegirl, but it was not to be.I cried along with the family reading this book.It seems like every detail has been recorded in Sarah Payne A Mothers Story, every emotion for every minute of every day. Days when theparents couldnt sleep unless they were drunk and even then it was not sleep,it was unconsciousness.Sara describes in detail how all the family were affected,from the older boys who were eaten up with guilt to the little sister who keptasking when Sarah was coming home, to the parents who were going througha living nightmare with no end. Roy WhitingRoy Whiting trialRoy Whiting denied his involvement all along, and he plednot guilty in court, but he was convicted on forensic evidence when fibresbelonging to the clothes Sarah Payne had been wearing were matched to fibresfound inside his van.After his conviction, when he was sentenced to lifeimprisonment, it was admitted to the court that he was already on the Child SexOffenders Register having been convicted of molesting a child once before. at the time of the trialthe family visiting the site where sarah's body foundsarah paynemegan kanka sarah payneidea for Sarah's Law formedIn the days and weeks after the court case, with publicinterest in the case still high, several newspapers were badgering Sara toallow them exclusives, offering ridiculously high sums of money.Sara and Mike discussed their offers at length in private,and jointly decided not to accept any of the offers, seeing it as blood moneyand therefore tainted.However, an idea was forming in Sara Paynes mind. Herdaughter had been murdered by a convicted child sex offender, and she felt thatif the public were to be made aware of sex offenders living in the community,they would know, as parents, not to let their children out to play near them,or to make sure the children were adult supervised at all times for their ownsafety.She felt that if theyd known Roy Whiting lived nearby, Sarahwould be alive today.She mentioned this idea to a reporter from the RupertMurdoch-owned News of the World whom she had come to know, while telling himthe offer of an excusive was off.He called back later to say he had spoken to his editor, andthat the paper were ready to give full backing to Sarahs Law, to give theright to the community to know who is on the Sex Offenders register, similar towhat had been passed in America, after the death of seven-year-old Megan Kankawho had been snatched and murdered on 29 July, 1994, by twice-convictedpaedophile Jesse Timmendequas.After this little girls death at the hands of theirneighbour, who they had no idea was a convicted sex offender, the family campaignedfor a change in the Law resulting in Bill Clinton introducing a new Law, dubbedMegans Law, just  89 days after hermurder, giving parents the right to know when a convicted sex offender moved inamongst them.Sara hoped she could persuade British politicians to adoptthe same attitude, but despite paying her lip service, no such moves came aboutunder Tony Blairs government. name and shameDuring the course of this campaign, the News of the Worldtook the decision to publish the names and addresses of convicted sex offenderson the register; 50 or so each week the campaign ran. Unfortunately thisdecision backfired when mobs of people targeted these houses, only to tar thewrong people because the register in many cases was out of date and offendershad moved, leaving new, innocent people to take the flak.This only encouraged the government further in their stancethat it was insecure to allow members of the public access to the SexOffenders Register.Over the course of the next few years, Sara Payne continuedher fight and won the backing of the police federation amongst others. Talkswere held and the original bill she asked for was watered down to the right ofsomeone responsible in the community to have access to the sex offendersregister, but obviously they would be sworn to silence lest word got out andthe offender was then hounded out of his home only to go underground whereno-one could keep an eye on him.new babyThe book finishes with the joy Sara and Mike found with thebirth of a new daughter, Ellie. sara payneAnna Gekoski  is aBritish criminologist and authoress of several real-life crime books.MBEFootnote: Nearly 10 years after Sarah Payne was murdered,Britain still has not introduced Sarahs Law, but some small steps have beenmade towards it, with 15 new pieces of legislation passed going somewhere towardsher goal.Interestingly enough, Sara Payne now works at the Ministryof Justice, in central London, as  a VictimsChampion, and was recently awarded an MBE from the Queen for her for her longtireless fight for changes in the law to make Britain safer for all children.

Great hub. Thank you.fishtiger5812 months ago Oh Izzy what a great hub and a very good cause. I can't believe they haven't passed this law yet. In heavens name what are they waiting for. Seems the criminal is getting more rights than the innocent. It's a shame.IzzyM12 months ago Thanks DAL and Fishtiger. I was so depressed after writing this. I'd read the book and it was upsetting enough, but then to write about it and go looking for accompanying photos just made me feel awful.(of course that's nothing compared to what the family went throught!)Yes we are desperately needing new laws here. I'd hate to think my kids had to live next to a child molester, unknowingly.IzzyM11 months ago Amazon.com have stocked the book now, so if anyone wants to buy it, you can click on the amazon link above.Milee10 months ago This is every parents worse nightmare. Such a sad story and I'm so sorry for this families loss.IzzyM10 months ago Milee thankyou for commenting.Yes it is tragic, but it would happen to less families if we knew who the paedophiles amongst us were.I think you agree with me there :)Nell Rose9 months ago Hiya, I thought I would read this one as it caught my eye, when I was reading your others. I still remember it so vividly, and even all these years later, her face comes instantly to mind. her poor mother carried on fighting and fighting, she was a very brave woman. I just wish they would bring back hanging! thanks nellIzzyM9 months ago It was one of these cases that caught the British imagination, if those are the words to use. She felt like all our daughters. May she RIP.Slainia7 months ago Oh, this is heart-breaking... The book shows such signs of strength, though. This review fit the book very well - you handled the topic carefully, but thoughtfully.IzzyM7 months ago Thankyou Slania. I must confess the book affected me profoundly...to read the heartbreak the family went through from a firsthand experience brings you the reader right into the middle of their personal Hell. You are left with the feeling that there are lessons to be learned and you want to do something about it, to help them and to stop other families from having to go through this or something similar.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites96IzzyMFrom Alicante, Spain673 Followers362 HubsJoined 14 months agoRead more hubs by IzzyMContact IzzyMFollow IzzyMSubscribe to IzzyM's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk IzzyM a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsI cannot find a biography on serena mcgann.
