We added a whole bunch of new voices, posted more often about more things, and still managed to keep a good eye on what was going on in our community. Our readership grew by leaps and bounds and our unique brand of citizen journalism gained significant local and national recognition. We had our hits and flops, made a lot of new friends and a few enemies along the way.Frank Gormlie and I have been talking back and forth over the past few days, trying to figure out how best to recap the year. We tried collectively writing about all our coverage and it quickly got unwieldy. So heres my stab at writing about the impressions that reside in my memories of the last twelve months.19 commentsRead the full article The Big Lebowski and Its DudenessDecember 30, 2009By Dwight Garner / The New York Times / December 29, 2009Joel and Ethan Coens 1998 movie, The Big Lebowski, which stars Jeff Bridges as a beatific, pot-smoking, bowling-obsessed slacker known as the Dude, snuck up on the English-speaking world during the 00s: it became, stealthily, the decades most venerated cult film. Its got that elusive and addictive quality that a great midnight movie has to have: it blissfully widens and expands in your mind upon repeat viewings.The Big Lebowski has spawned its own shaggy, fervid world: drinking games, Halloween costumes, bumper stickers (This aggression will not stand, man) and a drunken annual festival that took root in Louisville, Ky., and has spread to other cities. 4 commentsRead the full article Avatar, The Movie:  Mind Blowing Eye CandyDecember 29, 2009The family & I headed out to Mission Valley this weekend to catch James Camerons latest film, Avatar. Wed seen the previews last month during a 3-D showing of another film (A Christmas Carol) thatd left me wondering if the higher ticket prices ($14.50!) for Hollywoods latest techo-babble could ever match the hype.After sitting through all 2 hours and 45 minutes of Avatar, the answer would seem to be yes, at least for this film. Cameron effectively uses the medium to draw the audience into an artificial reality that goes far beyond the usual visual gimmicks employed in 3-D films.15 commentsRead the full article Around Town  Waves close pier, Christmas Tree down, and bar crashDecember 28, 2009OCEAN BEACH, CA.  The big news around downtown OB today was the big waves, number one  which forced the OB Pier to be closed by lifeguards.  And number two, the infamous Charlie Brown OB Christmas Tree came down  to be recycled.With large swells arriving up and down the Southern Cal coast, and with a National Weather Service high surf advisory in effect until 10 p.m. on Monday, local lifeguards had to close the pier, while a few top-notch surfers braved the waves  which could have been as high as 8 feet.18 commentsRead the full article OB Flashes  News, Calendar, and Discussion Board:December 26, 2009  January 3, 2010December 26, 2009* OBs Tsunami Signs Merit a Union-Tribune Quote from the OB Rag* Pagan Trees to Robb Field* OB Christmas Tree Comes Down for Recycling on Dec 29th* OB Parade Committee Email Hi-Jacked!* Up to 30 Suspected Illegal Immigrants Run from Boat in OB* Councilmember Faulconer Proposes Sponsors for Lifeguard Training and Equipment* New York Times to Pick Up OBs Adopt-A-Fire-Pit Story* Local Wonderland San Diego Producer Noah Tafolla Gets Props* OBMAs Winners of the Holiday Storefront Decorating Contest* Sparks Fly  Duplex Burns on Niagara in OB* Donations Gathered for the Pets of the Homeless* Dont forget OB Historical Societys Meet with Local Photographer Steve Rowell15 commentsRead the full article 7 Reasons for Atheists to Celebrate the HolidaysDecember 25, 2009Its often assumed that the atheist position on what is politely termed the holiday season is one of disregard at best, contempt and annoyance at worst. After all, the reasons for most of the standard winter holidays are supposedly religious  the birth of the Savior, eight days of miraculous light, yada yada yada. Why would atheists want anything to do with that?But atheists reactions to the holidays are wildly varied. Yes, some atheists despise them: the enforced jollity, the shameless twisting of genuine human emotion to sell useless consumer crap, the tyrannical forcing of mawkish piety down everyones throats. (Some believers loathe the holidays for the exact same reasons.) But some of us love the holidays. 6 commentsRead the full article Jim Grants LensDecember 22, 2009OCEAN BEACH.  It is difficult not to be amazed by Jim Grants lens and the scenes he captures.  Here are some recent December views of our ocean and our little piece of land.Whether its Peace Rock or the cliffs at Sunset Cliffs Park or the OB Pier, Jim Grants lens seem to hold the magic of nature that surrounds us, particularly when our star glides into the ends of the earth. 6 commentsRead the full article Two Aging Hippies Live HereDecember 21, 2009The other day, as I pondered the words, Two aging hippies live here, the greeting on the welcome mat at the front door of my home, I thought about how lucky I am to have had Nancy in my life for so long.I wondered how we ever got together. I mean Nancy was raised in Pacific Palisades, in L.A., overlooking the mighty Pacific, across a canyon from Grace Kelly, Walter Matthau and Betty Davis, just to name a few.25 commentsRead the full article Federal Stimulus Money  San Diegos Share So FarDecember 21, 2009by Doug Porter(Not a Tiger Woods Story)The challenge in authoring an article about a weighty subject like the $792 billion dollars the Congress authorized earlier in 2008 is to keep the readers eyes from glazing over. It doesnt take long for a series of numbers and statistics to lull the logical mind and encourage a longing for yet another Adam Lambert or Tiger Woods story.I could have taken the Union-Tribunes usual approach and found a project amongst the 600 plus grants made in San Diego County that seems sensational,  3 commentsRead the full article Last Minute Gift Idea: The Vodka BongDecember 20, 2009So. Your long awaited royalty check has finally arrived.  Or you just woke up from a really long winters nap.  Or youre just afraid to buy gifts in advance in case your friends dump you.  Or you just put off shopping till the last minute because thats the way you are.The dilemma of finding that perfect Obcean gift at the last minute just got way easier, thanks to our good friends at Newport Farms (The store next to Hodads).  6 commentsRead the full article Rick Sorben  Co-Creator of the OB Seagull Logo  Has PassedDecember 18, 2009If you have spent one day in OB, you know about the OB Seagull  a decal logo plastered on just about every car in town. And then some.  The creator of the logo  another Ocean Beach artist  has passed away. Donald Rick Sorben died on December 2nd, after a brief illness. He and his brother were creators of the OB Seagull Logo, a community icon.10 commentsRead the full article Fire pits out, tsunami signs inDecember 17, 2009Is it me or does this thing about the City putting up tsunami signs ring a wrong tune in these budget cutting times?On one hand, OB and the rest of San Diego beaches are threatened with losing our fire pits, yet at the same time, the City goes around and puts up these warning signs.Whew! I am sooo relieved.  I never would have known which way to run, ride or skate if OB was faced with a tsunami.12 commentsRead the full article The Saga of OBs Fire Pits: Almost All of Our Fire Pits Have Been Tentatively AdoptedDecember 17, 2009It was one week ago that the idea was presented to have OBceans adopt the communitys fire pits in order to save them from the Citys plans to remove them.  One of our commenters, bodysurferbob, told us that we would really regret it if we allowed the City to take the fire pits and offered:I propose we in Ocean Beach find a sponsor for each fire pit on our beaches.  Whether a business, a church, a civic organization, a sports team, a circle of friends, or just simply an individual, I believe that we can organize sponsors who will maintain their pit for the rest of the community.  We can do this. Lets start now, before its too late.(Go inside for more .)11 commentsRead the full article Debate among progressives about whether to support the current health care billDecember 17, 2009Editor: Here then are some of the arguments on both sides of the question of whether progressives should support the current version KEITH OLBERMANN: Kill the bill  In a Special Comment Wednesday night, MSNBCs Keith Olbermann agreed with former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean that the Senate health care bill, as it currently stands, should die. (Go inside for more.)ORPAUL KLUGMAN: Support the bill despite illusions and bitterness: Theres enormous disappointment among progressives about the emerging health care bill  and rightly so.

The auditorium was about one-third filled with concerned parents and two of the five Board members were absent as the district staff presented one report after another outlining options and suggested courses of action for the 2010-2011 budget.You have to give the Board of Education credit for coming to grips with the problem.

More History of OB and the RagDecember 15, 2009Today a good friend sent us a tidbit that he found tucked away in his morgue file, and that got me sidetracked in a real fun way.Frank has written a lot of historical pieces on Ocean Beach (click on HISTORY up there in the navigation bar, you wont be sorry) and in my opinion this article needs to be part of the story of the Collier Park Riot. Originally published in the door (another San Diego underground paper) in May of 1972, it tells a bit of the story of our very own EditorDude on that infamous day in March 1971.26 commentsRead the full article Medicare, Medi-Cal, Medicaid: the Public Health Programs that Already ExistDecember 15, 2009Theres a lot of  confusion, we find, about government or public health care programs. Medicare, Medi-Cal, Medicaid  just what are the differences?Well, some would argue that Medicare actually helps adult people, whereas Medi-Cal really is better for children and prenatal mothers than the general population it serves. My opinion? They could all be better. But Ill stop with opinions now..Medicare  Federal Health Insurance plan for seniors and the disabled. Contrary to what some may believe, you can be a 20 year old with Medicare.4 commentsRead the full article More on the fire pits: the City has been trying to close them for years and its not about money.December 15, 2009The City of San Diego has been trying to close or remove the fire pits at the beaches for years.  This is the only conclusion I can reach after reviewing a 3 page memo that has crossed my desk that was given to the Peninsula Planning Board way back in May of 2003  over 6 years ago.The memo is from the San Diego Police Department Western Division and describes a power point presentation to be given to that planning organization that calls for the Seasonal Removal of the Ocean Beach Fire Rings.  The proposal called for the removal of OBs fire pits from October 1 to April 30th each year.22 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
