More money jumped into the coffers than imagined. In the history of boxing has anyone, not the GREATEST, not money, not a named Suger, not Oscar Dela Hoya and certainly not a contentious contender, provided the receipts anticipated by the FIGHT. Manny PacquiaoManny Pacquiao vs. Miguel CottoMiguel Cotto. Manny Pacquiao beat, broke, pummeled, and capitulated both a former WBA champ and all records of money, interest and PPV, according to the latest reports. His seventh title against seven different guys weighting the recognized weights goes down as a block buster. He is the MAN. We could spend hours extolling the virtues of another fight with the prospect of delving more and more or help those in need he helps. We could talk about how MANNY and money could devastate the reigns of money paid on pay-per-view. I just hope you read the previous sentence. It has nothing to do with what we have witnessed - once in our life time  that Manny Pacquiao need naught fight again. Bruised, battered and reserved Manny Pacquiao met, fought and vanquished. He should call it a night. Of course, there are those who will sing  mostly out of tune  how boxing DESERVES his presents. His obligation. There are those who sing his praises without regard to his family, his true friends and his accomplishments. Manny. Manny. I know you naught. I care for you much. I care naught that you can make more now than ever. I do not believe that was your initial impetus. Manny.

Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoNo doubt about it. I just want to raise my voice that it is unnecessary. It's just money.            Reply  Posted By     gunawangungun|about 1 yearagoretirement? why? I think he still can perform more            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoThere is no doubt that he can still perform. My contention is simply that he has accomplisheded enough.

I appreciate it.            Reply  Posted By     inamshah|about 1 yearagoHmm!! Nice report!! keep tha good work on!!!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoThanks man. I appreciate your view. I think we have witnessed something very rare with Pacquiao. Amazing story.            Reply  Posted By     Adrian Holman|about 1 yearagoHe has to at least fight Mayweather, Jr. before he retires. There will be too much money on the table to walk away. He also is looking to continue to help the plight of the Philippines as well because they need a lot of help. People used to say this about Roberto Duran too, but you are failing to look at the humanitarian aspect.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoWho knows. It's just my humble opinion.            Reply  Posted By     Nyjil|about 1 yearagoYeah. Manny should retire. He has done a great job for the country. :D            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoI think he can channel his energy in any direction and become successful. I wish him the best.            Reply  Posted By     mahpudinudin|about 1 yearagovery good performance, let's ... keep the spirit.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoCool. Thanks for the nod. No matter what Manny does, he does it well.            Reply  Posted By     JKKASHYAP|about 1 yearagoThanks man. I appreciate your view. I think we have witnessed something very rare with Pacquiao. Amazing story.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoI could not agree more. I have considered myself lucky to see the likes of Michael Jordon, Tiger Woods, Derek Jeter and now Manny Pacquiao during my lifetime. I absolutely enjoy a good athletic endeavor. Thanks for sending the note.            Reply  Posted By     ahmedharara1|about 1 yearagoNice report!! keep tha good work on!!!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoJust an opinion I hold dear. The man has done it. Money can't be everything.            Reply  Posted By     Vinnymac11|about 1 yearagoHe has one last fight in him and that in Floyd Mayweather!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoSo is the feeling of many. I disagree. Not because I fear for his success. Not because he would be scared. I just think he has done more for us than we can imagine. Your voice isn't the only one.            Reply  Posted By     mrfoxy55|about 1 yearagohi every body i;m anew hwant to knoe one to teach me what i can do here            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoWelcome. I will help in anyway I can. Thank you for viewing this story. It's fun. You can voice yourself.            Reply  Posted By     ylthao85|about 1 yearagoThe Pacman is still a great fighter and getting better. I wouldn't want to retire out of a profession of which I am in my prime and improving, I don't think the Pacman will either.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoAbsolutely understood. But when, in your mind's eye do you determine to stop? When you get beat? When you fail? When you disappoint? Very important questions for us all. Right now, I suspect we enjoy HIS successes. We vicariously live through another. I speak only from my perspective. He has done more than anyone. He has generated more for his country than anyone. He has inspired more than anyone today. At some point (in my arguement) enough.We have have been treated. We should learn to stop living on others.            Reply  Posted By     George Vieto|about 1 yearagoI am just concerned that Manny doesn't get Parkinson's disease and have the media cry that he should quit while ahead or that he winds up in a mental hospital due to brain damage.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoI am not really concerned about his health. He knows the possibilities. I just believe he has done all he can do. A fight against an unworthy opponent - someone who does not bring the luster - can only tarnish what he has done already. If there were an opponent that made me believe otherwise, I would encourage him to continue. That being said, I don't believe FM brings anything.
