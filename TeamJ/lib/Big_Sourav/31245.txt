The Obamaites put down the banks and Wall Street when they wanted TARP, then they put down the insurance companies and pharmaceuticals when they wanted UHC, they want the FCC to control the airways and Internet so they attack Fox News and other Conservative Outlets and now, they are putting down the GOP since the Dems lost the November Elections. The Communist/Socialist never know how to govern, only destroy. From the druggies of the Vietnam protest, the rhetoric of revolution of the seventies they still continue on their path of violence to get their way. Now that they have their State propaganda media in place they can spread the word for violence in seconds. None of them respect themselves, then how can we expect them to respect other people. Listen to the words of the Obamaites, they are inciting violence all the time in front of our eyes and ears. Obama is now playing the nice guy and his people in the Congress and Senate are now taking up the point guard in dissing the GOP and RICH. The theartre goes on while the dupes do the physical damage.

McCaskell saying last night the GOP could have taken the pork out of the bill before the budget bill got to the floor, what she left unsaid was the Dems could have removed the pork before they brought it to the floor. Translation, the GOP were greedy hogs while the Dems were only doning what the GOP wanted. Obama with his compromise on the Tax Bill, the GOP were holding the middle class hostage. Tanslation, he was being blackmailed into agreeing with the GOP. It's not just class warefare, it's opposition warefare. As usual whenever there is incited violence it's always the innocent that get hurt. The biggest difference today is, we have the silent majority rising, something the Obamaites never counted on happening. As long as the silent majority keep active, we can stop their revolution from starting. They are going to push and scream and we have to stand there and continue to talk. The Communist/Socialist are being seen for who they are and more people are seeing it now. They are getting desperate and next year will come the big street protests. The rhetoric is starting to appear from their own mouths.
