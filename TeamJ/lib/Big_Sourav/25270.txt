She is now a creative director of gadget line. In a recent Consumer Electronic Show 2011 held in Las Vegas, Lady Gaga, together with Polaroid, unveiled 3 new high-tech photo-capturing gadgets that would surely wow the techies. The Grey Label by Haus of Gaga includes a set of sunglasses (GL20) that not only protect the eyes from the harsh glares of the sun, but double as camera, which can capture and display the images and videos on the lenses. Images can also be sent and printed via Bluetooth technology. Along with it is the GL10, which is the paperback-size mobile photo printing device that can print pictures wirelessly sent from camera phones. It is compatible with any Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone, except iPhone. The GL10 will be available by March of 2011 for $150. Finally, the GL30, which looks like the traditional Polaroid camera, but is more state-of-the-art. It not only prints photos, but stores them digitally as well. The images can be viewed from a pop-up display screen on its top. The GL30 will be available in the market by the end of 2011.        1 of 32         Entertainer Lady Gaga smiles while introducing her Grey Label product line during the 2011 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas      glassshards is based in Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (58.1%) United Kingdom (23.1%) Canada (4.0%) China (3.5%) 24 other countries (9.4%)           READ MORE: Entertainment Culture, Las Vegas, Technology Internet, eyewear, Optics, Polarization, lady gaga, instant camera, sunglasses, Bluetooth, polaroid, technology-news, Microsoft Gadgets, computing, technology-news, Apple Inc.
