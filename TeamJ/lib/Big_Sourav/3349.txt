We were to see the former President's hand built cabin, the famous Clydesdale horses, enjoy some beer and more.It was an abbreviated introduction as we had also been shown the St. Louis Botanical Garden earlier that same day. http://hubpages.com/hub/The-Beautiful-Missouri-Botanical-GardenOne could spend an entire day in each of these places!Grant's cabin See all 15 photosThe cabin that Ulysses S.

Tour the 281 acre wildlife preserve, see the world famous Anheuser-Busch Clydesdales. Purchase Grant's Farm gifts Online.Grant's Farm is so named due to the fact that an American President, Ulysses S. Grant hand built and lived in this cabin pictured above. He also farmed about 80 acres on these grounds. About a century ago August A. Busch Jr.'s father purchased land encompassing Grant's original acreage and added to it. It now totals 281 acres.August Busch Jr. made it into a country estate and brought in over 1,000 animals from all over the world. Most of the large animals such as zebras, bison, elk, cattle, Sika deer, antelope and more roam about quite freely.An open-aired tram takes one through this area where one can view the animals in a natural setting.Admission to Grant's farm is free and there is much to see.Over 1,000 animals on this farm!

Many of those vehicles date from the 1800's.We took advantage of having a bite of lunch and sipped on a free glass of Budweiser beer. We all decided that the bratwurst looked good that day.Since it was the month of October, the area was decorated appropriately with dried corn stalks, bundles of hay, pumpkins and blooming mums.It was a bright and sunny day and the umbrella tables offered some needed shade.The beer...Anheuser-Busch - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThe Bauernhof This sign pointed the way to the BauernhofThis is the courtyard in a part of the U-shaped buildings forming the Bauernhof.Inside the building showcasing the collection of old coaches and carriages.A bit of history...The Clydesdales Up close and personal with a Clydesdale named BillyClydesdales in the yardThese magnificent horses...Budweiser Clydesdales - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThe famous Clydesdale horsesGrant's farm is a breeding center as well as a training center for the beautiful and famous Clydesdale horses. One can stroll through an area where the magnificent beasts romp and roam in pastures. One can also go through a stable where some of the horses are on display.Each horse has a brass plate with his name inscribed. The stables are immaculately clean and fresh.Approximately 15 foals are born at this location each year and they are nurtured and eventually turned into the show horses that we have all come to love.A full grown Clydesdale horse weighs in at around 2,000 pounds! Keeping them fed and watered takes some effort as they each consume around 60 pounds of hay as well as 30 quarts of feed. 30 gallons of water is also needed for each horse every day.In the stable was a display showing a normal horses hoof and a Clydesdale hoof. These horses are huge in every respect!Family friendly and with no admission fee, be sure and plan to spend some time here if you are in the St. Louis, Missouriarea of the country. Grant's Farm is well worth a visit! You can even sample some Budweiser beer if you are old enough and wish to partake of some.**********************************************************************************************If you were to visit Grant's farm, what would you most like about it?

It's a wonderful place.  I'm terribly excited for spring.  Enjoyed the videos and photos.  Grants Farm is a definite attraction to see while in St. Louis.Peggy W21 months ago Hi SoulaBee,  You are fortunate to be living so near a wonderful place like that.  Few places exist that offer so much entertainment and the price is certainly right.  Free!The Real Tomato21 months ago This is a very good Hub. I could waste too much time here :-DIt all looks so inviting, a wonderful way to spend the day. A friend of mine has Clydsdales and I can never get used to how huge their hooves are! The size of my head almost!Thank you for sharing this - if I am ever in Missouri I have bookmarked this place as a must see.G-Ma Johnson21 months ago this was so good and those animals all seem to be so content and happy...loved the scenery...We have some work horses here that a farmer owns and displays their work at a fair we have. These horses were used back in the logging days before machines were around (not these actual horses, but ones just like them LOL)They are magnificant and so true to each other as team mates...At one farm where they use them in teams for giving rides on old buggies...one of the team died...her partner would not pull the buggy for days cause he was mourning her death...he acted up so badly they had to let him just mourn...it was so sad to see :O(...is fine now though...Thanks for a wonderful story...G-Ma :O) hugs& PeacePeggy W21 months ago Hello Real Tomato,  You will not be disappointed in spending a day here if you ever get to the St. Louis area.  I agree, the Clydesdales are unbelievably large...expecially their hoofs!Teresa McGurk21 months ago I just adore Clydesdales -- a great breed of true work-horses who have the patience of saints. Peggy W21 months ago Hello G-Ma Johnson,  Animals definitely mourn the loss of others that they know and with whom they share feelings.  We have had several dogs that mourned right along with us when one of our pets died.  So your story of the horse that lost it's teammate was sad.  Happy to hear that is has recovered.  I'll just bet that it still remembers however.Thanks for commenting and hugs & peace right back to you.Peggy W21 months ago Plus they are so beautiful, Teresa.  Their eyes shine with intelligence.  It was fun to see the young ones frolicking in the large fenced areas with the older horses. Enelle Lamb21 months ago I have to echo The Real Tomato's comment...I could spend a lot of time here. I have a passion for horses, and picking one particular breed over another is impossible for me, however, the Clydes are and have always been truly magnificant! Thank you for sharing such a peaceful, picturesque place with us.Peggy W21 months ago It was my pleasure, Enelle.  It is fun sharing wonderful vacation experiences with others who may want to go there or want to relive the trips over again as I do when writing these hubs.MellasViews21 months ago wow, great job on this hub peggy!!!
