Wrong QuestionPosted by James Poniewozik Monday, January 10, 2011 at 9:26 am15 Comments  Related Topics: news media, politics, , arizona, gabrielle giffords, shootingOne of my first reactions to the sickening shooting in Arizona, and to the charge that it resulted from violent imagery from politicians and media figures: the Rally for Sanity is suddenly not looking so wishy-washy and irrelevant for focusing on the tone of politics.One of my next reactions: something else will happen. At some point, someone will do something terrible, and someone else will want to draw the same kind of connection to a certain cause, or a videogame, a TV show, a song, a movie. There will be talk about the danger of extreme expression (generally, someone else's) because of its effects on impressionable or easily-led people (generally, someone else). And the lessons we take from this atrocity will set the precedent for the next atrocity.It will happen, because it has happened before, and when it does, my response will be what it was before. Expression has effects. Tremendous effects. Rhetoric shapes our worldview. Narratives change people's lives. Arguments move listeners and infuriate them. Does rhetoric cause anything? You could make a good argument that, when it comes to human behavior, rhetoric causes everything.Expression has profound, undeniable effects--but it rarely has directly traceable, because-A-thus-B effects. It's possible for a novel to drive one person to appreciate beauty and another person to kill a celebrity. It's possible for fiery rhetoric to turn one person into an activist and another into a criminal.What's not possible, short of a direct admission, is to prove that an "atmosphere" of any sort led anyone to commit an act of violence they otherwise would not have. Setting the argument on those terms--who has "blood on their hands," etc.--frames it in terms of one more eternal unprovable debate between the already-convinced. (I give Keith Olbermann credit, at least, forincluding himself in his Special Comment as someone whose language has also crossed a line.)And that misses the point. Hostile, belligerent rhetoric isn't wrong for what it causes. It's wrong for what it is in itself.There's already a reason that it's inappropriate to use "fight" and "target" and "battle" metaphors cheaply; to suggest "Second Amendment remedies" for frustrations at the ballot box; to put crosshairs or bullseyes on a map over the districts of your ideological opponents; to make a campaign ad where you take out a rifle and shoot a bill you don't like.That reason is not that somebody is going to see that and suddenly decide that murder is a legitimate means to an end. It's that responsible, grown people don't act that way in public. It's because it cheapens us. It's because acting as if every triumph of your political opponents is the end of democracy, every concession of your allies the appeasement of Hitler and every election loss a secret coup is bitter, small and ugly. (No one inscribes the monuments of beloved leaders with their greatest political insults.) It's because our automatic habit of seeing every disagreement as a "battle" with "targets" and "war rooms" makes us a cynical, depressed, crabbed electorate--at minimum.If Jared Loughner were somehow definitively proved to have acted for reasons entirely unrelated to violent political rhetoric, would that violent rhetoric suddenly become any better? No. Here's a good rule of thumb: if you're looking at a campaign graphic and thinking, "How bad would this look if somebody tried to kill one of the people on this map tomorrow?"--guess what? It's probably a bad idea.Most people already realize that. But if it makes a few people ask themselves a simple, decent question before they put their rhetoric out there, it would not be such a terrible side effect of a truly terrible act.PrintE-mailComment Twitter LinkedIn Buzz Up!

I generally try to avoid posting anything remotely politically related on my Facebook page, but I had to post an excerpt from this piece--specifically, the reason that such metaphors are already inappropriate. Thanks for articulating this.Bemused January 10, 2011at 12:21 pmLog in to Reply 2.1  I also try to avoid political postings on Facebook, but I too posted a link there to James's well-reasoned and sobering post. It's hurt, today, to see the recriminations and counter-recriminations about the violent rhetoric multiply like the violent rhetoric itself. It's been hard to witness people assigning, apportioning, and arguing about blame today when I want only to grieve. I hope that going forward we can all be grown-ups and take responsibility for creating a better tone for its own sake; I don't agree with Jack Shafer (http://www.slate.com/id/2280616/) that calling for a modulation in tone is a slippery slope to neutering the language and abridging our First Amendment rights. I have never understood why such angry rhetoric is "necessary" to communicate passion. Can't we find better words? I can think of a number of politicians on both sides of the aisle who are perfectly capable of articulating their passionate beliefs without resorting to images of violence and assault.The Hoobie January 10, 2011at 5:56 pm3  Err ... make that "hear, hear."

I have not carried this act out, and I never intend actually to strangle him or anyone for that matter, but I am human, and I sometimes display that innate human trait of wanting to destroy someone for what seems like no reason or for sport.  Actually, the person I spoke about in this way has done something very hurtful to me.  I digress.When leaders say these hyperbolic things, I usually try not to give them my time.  I do not actually take what they say that seriously, but it's like my mother once said to me of my being a good driver, "it's not you on the road I'm worried about, it's the other drivers."redlotuspetal6 January 10, 2011at 6:26 pmLog in to Reply 5.1  A commenter on a Talking Points Memo article makes a similar point about putting tighter restrictions on gun purchases so it's harder for mentally ill people to get them. (I have to paraphrase; can't find the article now) "So if people, not guns, kill people, does that mean that because drivers, not cars, kill people, we don't need to suspend the licenses of drunks?"The Hoobie January 10, 2011at 7:10 pm5.2  (Aargh. I really didn't express that well---I wish I'd been able to find the original post and comment. Basically: If we don't have a problem with trying to restrict drunks' access to cars, why would we have a problem with trying to restrict access to guns by the mentally ill?)The Hoobie January 10, 2011at 7:29 pm6  Thank you for saying this as well as you usually do, James. The bullseye map was gross before anyone got shot, but the fact that it was pulled down so quickly was telling. This was not an image that Palin or her staff were willing to stand by. Perhaps if public figures considered that as a standard - "Am I willing to stand by these words?" they would have less to be defensive and angry about.(Which isn't to say that people can't change their minds. But Palin didn't change her mind about the need to win those elections.)Crazy people will still be crazy, but simply being able to say "it's not my fault!" is not good enough coming from folks who claim to be wise and responsible enough to be elected to office or analyze the stories of the day.olivececile January 10, 2011at 8:35 pmLog in to Reply 7  People who aspire to positions of leadership -- whether in politics or the media -- need to recognize the inherent potential hazards of extreme hyperbolic commentary.  Claims that Obama and the Democrats are trying to destroy the nation, assertions that left-of-center members of Congress are guilty of unAmerican activities and beliefs, commentaries equating progressivism with communism or Marxism, and inflammatory calls to "take back the country" , "take up arms", "lock and load", and resort to "Second Amendment remedies" will only serve to boil the blood and embolden the irrational thinking of a handful of the most disturbed, violence-prone residents of the nation.We need to see the larger picture. It's not whether or not a specific comment by a specific pundit or politician led this individual to commit these heinous acts.It's the recognition that these types of incendiary, fear-mongering statements have the potential to incite such violence, and that this event should be a wake-up call to tone down the histrionics.Simply because one has the First Amendment Right to say a thing does not mean it is the right thing to say.labman57 January 10, 2011at 8:49 pmLog in to Reply 8  When you say or do incendiary  things like cross hair circles or Limbough saying this whole thing will lead to more rights lost  99.99% of the population will just laugh and know they are looking for increased advertising or sponsorship.  It is the other few mental problem people who we probably can't find until after the fact that the speeches and poor manners between parties stimulates or pushes over the edge.  My only comfort to my self is that we probably can't really solve that problem but must live with it.dochosvet January 10, 2011at 11:03 pmLog in to Reply 9  before you use this situation for a metaphor, maybe look into your subliminal thoughts yourself and ask yourself what does the rule of thumb actually state. Maybe look up where that statement comes from. and then not use that phrase as it could pop up some crazy women libs. to do something to bring it to national attention. be careful what you say. point the thumb instead of down at yourself. here is rule of thumb explinationbelief in the existence of a "rule of thumb" law to excuse spousal abuse can be traced as far back as 1782, the year that James Gillray published his satirical cartoon Judge Thumb. The cartoon lambastes Sir Francis Buller, a British judge, for allegedly ruling that a man may legally beat his wife, provided that he used a stick no thicker than his thumb, although it is questionable whether Buller ever made such a pronouncement (poor record-keeping for trial transcripts in that era make it difficult to determine whether such a ruling may have existed). The Body of Liberties adopted in 1641 by the Massachusetts Bay colonists states, Every married woman shall be free from bodily correction or stripes by her husband, unless it be in his own defense from her assault.[10] In the United States, legal decisions in Mississippi (1824) and North Carolina (1868 and 1874) make reference toand rejectan unnamed "old doctrine" or "ancient law" by which a man was allowed to beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb.[1] In 1976, feminist Del Martin used the phrase "rule of thumb" as a metaphorical reference to describe such a doctrine. She was misinterpreted by many as claiming the doctrine as a direct origin of the phrase and the connection gained currency in 1982, when the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report on wife abuse, titled "Under the Rule of Thumb."[8]heresscotty January 11, 2011at 12:21 amLog in to Reply 10  It is odd that the same people who cautioned us about rushing to judgement in the case of Muslim assassin, Nidal Malik Hasan are now rushing to judgement on Jared Loughner. Why the double standard?It can't possibly be a blatant political ploy by the left to tarnish their political opponents as they tried to do with Lee Harvey Oswald, could it?paulejb January 11, 2011at 3:54 amLog in to Reply 11  This tragedy happened Saturday and for the next 48 hours the liberal bigots in the news media used this as a political football, alternately attacking Palin or talk radio or FOX, then trying to make Loughner out to be a tea party member with NRA membership. None of this proved to be true.Loughner turns out to be a troubled young man with mental problems, who listened to violent Satanic heavy metal music, took drugs, burned flags, read leftist books, and was most probably a democrat (they found a constituent thank you letter in his safe from Congresswomman Gifford). The liberal bigots in the news media owe Palin, talk radio, FOX, the tea party, and others an apology.jollypants January 11, 2011at 9:02 amLog in to Reply 12  Bravo.sherriott January 11, 2011at 2:01 pmLog in to Reply Add Your Comment:Click here to cancel reply.
