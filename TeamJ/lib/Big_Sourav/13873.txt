Kyl's remarks about the Az Sheriff:Kyl: Arizona Sheriff's Remarks InappropriateSen. John Kyl (R-AZ)I thought he was talking about THIS Sheriff:Sheriff Paul Babeu and Senator John McCain (R-AZ)McCain's 'Danged Fence' Sheriff: The Government Is Our Enemy"Our own government has become our enemy," he said, "and is taking us to court at a time when we need help." ......A few weeks ago, in fact, Babeu appeared on a radio show called Political Cesspool to talk about immigration.This caused some trouble for McCain, as Political Cesspool is a radio show for white supremacists.Babeu and the McCain campaign both said Babeu didn't know about Cesspool's pro-white agenda. The show's hosts, however, said they spoke personally to Babeu and that he knew about, as they describe it, their pro-white, "paleoconservative radio program." But this was not the Sheriff Sen. Kyl was speaking about. In fact Sen. Kyl greatly admires THIS Sheriff, who seems to have no problem blurring facts to push his own agenda. I'm sure everyone remembers McCain's ad featuring this Sheriff and the controversy surrounding it. Sen. Kyl, from my research, did not condemn Sheriff Babeu's  claim that the 'Government is our enemy'. The Sheriff whose words he called 'inappropriate' was Sheriff Dupnik:Sheriff Dupnik Credit:AP Photo/Chris MorrisonSheriff Dupnik's criticism of political 'vitriol' resonates with publicDupnik's name was a top search term on Twitter Saturday night, with many of the tweets thanking him for his candor, and overnight, a Facebook page titled "Clarence Dupnik is my Hero" sprung up.In a news conference Saturday evening, Dupnik condemned the "atmosphere of hatred and bigotry" that he said has gripped the nation and suggested that the 22-year-old suspect being held in the shooting was mentally ill and therefore more susceptible to overheated messages in the media."There's reason to believe that this individual may have a mental issue. And I think people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible to vitriol," he said during his televised remarks. "People tend to pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that. That may be free speech, but it's not without consequences."So while the public agrees with Sheriff Dupnik, the MSM and the Republican Party dismiss concerns that the violent rhetoric mostly coming from the right has anything to do with the number of violent incidents aimed at Democrats and Liberals in recent times. For a second though, I thought Sen. Kyl, in the immediate aftermath of this tragedy,  had finally taken some responsibility for the behavior of some of his party's followers and some of their more prominent public figures. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paeuC-i8E1o Republican Candidate for office in above video: "We have a chance to fight this battle at the ballot box, before we have to resort to the bullet box"But, this is just 'political war rhetoric, very common' according to such rightwing pundits as Chuck Todd and Howard Kurtz. And I'm sure Sen. Kyl would agree. Refresh|+14 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadNoRagAssJan-09-11 03:42 PM#1No?

Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topsabrina 1      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 07:42 PMResponse to Reply #2530.He was not inappropriate. It's this kind of fear of telling the truththat has allowed the violent rightwing to get away with what they do for so long. He added no fuel to the fire. It is those who refuse to tell the truth, people like Palin, Limbaugh, Hannity et al who light these fires and then refuse to take responsibility for their actions, who incite this kind of violence. Then people, like you eg, are afraid to let them know that their behavior is reprehensible so they keep on doing it. These are the people he is talking about. How can he throw any more fuel on their fires?  They've been doing this for decades and everyone had been afraid of them. I wish more people would speak out like this Sheriff. But they won't, the scaredy cat Dems will try to be all nice and polite, AGAIN, thinking these criminals will one day appreciate how nice they are!Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toplonestarnot      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:28 PMResponse to Original message26.If truth is inappropriate, which it is to CONS, then yes inappropriate.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHamlette      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:32 PMResponse to Original message28.you can be a friend on FBhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Clarence-Dupnik-is-my-Her...
