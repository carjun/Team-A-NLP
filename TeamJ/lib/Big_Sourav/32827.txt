Leaving the relationship also means leaving behind a sense of security and identity. In some cases, leaving a relationship is needed in order to protect ones welfare. Although new relationships have a built in excitement, there are losses that occur in leaving long-term relationships. In time, the pain associated with losses decreases. Taking a closer look at what motivates people to leave long-term relationships leads to insights regarding bonding and relationships in general.   Affairs and Sexual addictions  In the case of affairs, people rarely leave relationships where their partner is a great lover and their needs are being met. The major exception to this is when one of the partners has a sexual addiction. Affairs often expose the areas of relationships where the needs of the spouses are not being met.   In cases of sexual addiction, the addict often goes seeking the next high. It is not that they are not committed to their partner. Sexual addictions are often experienced as a compulsion to gratify their urges. The strength of the compulsion is intensified by the chemicals released during their sexual activities. The intensity of the sexual gratification is often stronger than the bond holding the addict to their partner. There are also some cases, where physical traumas lead to chemical changes in a persons behavior. In such cases, the physical traumas lead to changes in brain function. If you suspect such a case, seek professional help.  Relationships are often easier to start than to end. There are many ways to start relationships but no many good ways to end them.Bonding and Needs When needs are not being met in a long term relationship, people often have to re-evaluate what their needs are and what is required of them in the relationship. When needs are not being met in the relationship, they often look for ways of meeting those needs. Besides their own needs, they also consider what is required of them in the relationship.   Long-term relationships often also involve bonding. Although many types of bonds are of a healthy nature, there are some long term relationships based on unhealthy or traumatic bonding. There are also some long-term relationships which may have developed based on availability rather than bonding. The couple stayed together, not due to needs being met or bonding, but rather due to limited choices at the time. In such cases of weak bonding, when a potential relationship arises, and they have no healthy bonds to their partner, it is easier to leave the relationship.  In the cases of unhealthy bonding that holds the spouses together, when the pain or trauma out weighs the strength of the bond, there is an increased possibility of the relationship ending. Relationships based on traumatic bonds often contain elements of fear or threats as part of the bonding process. The intensity of the fear keeps the persons locked into the relationship. In some cases, these fears are based on actual threats. In some cases, the fears may be self-induced based on personal insecurities.   Once the traumatic bonds are broken, those in the relationships often look for a way to leave. In such cases, the person which had been bonded by trauma, now look for other ways to meet their needs. When they can find a healthier way to meet their needs outside of the unhealthy relationship, and they have worked up the courage to leave, they do so. The leaving of relationships based on traumatic bonds occurs within families and marriages.   Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needsHeirarchy of Needs The psychologist, Abraham Maslow spent years studying healthy relationships and identifying what needs exist in relationships. He devised a hierarchy of needs. Maslows hierarchy not only identified what the needs are in relationships, but also gave them a hierarchical rating. His hierarchy of needs has been found useful in helping people not only know what needs are requiring attention, but also which needs should be taken care of first. When needs are met, partners do not go seeking alternative methods of meeting their needs.

Leaving unhealthy relationships is not an easy task.Amanda Severn2 years ago I studied Maslow's hierarchy of needs when training to become a hypnotherapist. It's an interesting concept for many, as it puts 'love' in the halfway position. Having known one or two couples who have had highly successful arranged marriages, I can see the sense in that. Lust is all too readily mistaken for love by many people, and unfortunately ,all too often, it proves to be no more than a sugar coating with a bitter pill beneath.Thanks for a well-written, thought-provoking hubAnanta652 years ago I agree, JD. And leaving them in a positive way is even harder, but well worth the effort.I also think that if you come to completely depend on another person for satisfying your needs - no matter how low or high in the pyramid - you have a problem, a disbalanced relationship. J D Murrah2 years ago Amanda,There were many ideas put forth by Maslow that would help couples. His ideas of Being love and Defeiciency love are especially  helpful. I am glad that you enjoyed the hub. J D Murrah2 years ago Anatana65,Relationships with a large dependency factor are definitely at risk.

Thanks in advance, your newwest fan - KINGJ D Murrah16 months ago Kingwiththeaxe,Thanks for stopping by. I will check out your hub. It is challenging dealing with a separation in relationship. Since the relationship is young, there may be hope. A lot depends on what is behind the separation. Many times spouses look for a change in heart and attitude before they are willing to commit. It takes time for hearts to change, so she may need a little of that.christalluna112413 months ago What a very well written and informative hub. It is hard and scary to leave a long term relationship and know you have to start over. It is very refreshing to see such an in-depth and well researched article.Happy HolidaysWarmest Regards,ChrisJ D Murrah13 months ago Chris,Leaving the familiar always presents challenges, whether it is a familiar city or familiar relationship. Leaving means being out of one's comfort zone. Oftentimes people stay in unhealthy relationships driven not by love or compatibility but rather by insecurity. The fear of the unknown has trapped many people into dysfunctional relationships.dashingscorpio13 months ago Before I got married in 2008 I had a long term relationship of almost 7 years.In fact I lived with her for close to 5 years.I had been married once before and swore off of marriage and she had been married twice.1.As in most relationships everything started off great but as time went on I began to notice she had a drinking problem at social functions. She always wanted to be the first to arrive at the party and the last to leave.Looking back I suppose when we first got together this "fun/happy" quality was something I enjoyed but having her get sick on a Friday or Saturday night throwing up most of the following moring and sleeping most the next day killing the rest of the weekend got old. It got to a point where I dreaded getting party invitations, BBQ invitations, and especially going to her company's Christmas party.All of her friends and co-workers loved her antics when she was flying high. I had to deal with the crash.2. Her kids and grandchildrenWhen we first got together her adult children came around from time to time and all was well. (All three were girls).As time went own I saw that she never treated them as adults. She would spend $300 on each of them for Christmas even when she couldn't afford it. In fact her debt to income ratio was scary especially for her age!Thankfully we never co-mingled our accounts.One daughter was in a very abusive relationship with a guy that lived in her same condo complex. Sometimes she was scared to go home, she cry all night and my girlfriend would get caught up in it. A day later her daughter would be back to dating the guy that slapped her and spit in her face! A few weeks later she'd be back knocking on our door.Another daughter who was married began to have kids.This meant we had to have a set of toys at our home whenever they came by. The kids would run up and down the steps, turning on and off the lights and no one seemed to be bothered by it other than me.When we had BBQs sometimes I would stay out by the grill while her family took over the house.The other daughter was always depressed mainly about not having a boyfriend and she was not good handling her finances even though she was a teacher making over $45k at the time with no one to take care of other than herself.3. Menopause and lack of sex (I'll leave that one alone)Note: She was 6 years older than me.After 7 years of dealing with this the only thing I could think of that would be worse was 8 years!When I moved out into my own apartment there was a peace and joy which I had forgotten.I met a woman who was a lot like me (attractive) (good paying job), (no debt), (no kids),(great sense of humor)and she rarely has a drink. (Never has been drunk in her life). My only regret is I can't get back 5 of those 7 years!Sometimes it takes a person too long to figure out that tomorrow will be just like today unless they make a change."The world may not owe you anything but YOU owe yourself the world"J D Murrah12 months ago dashingscorpio,Thank you for sharing about your relationship. Looking at relationships in hind sight often reveal things we did not want to see at first. It sounds like you have quite a capacity for reflection and insight. Loosing years can be difficult.akm11 months ago he is ending the relationship after 15 years. We were not married. Both of us never felt the need. now after 15 years he is leaving. If this makes him happy I am happy for him. however it is hard to deal with because he is the love of my life  my soul mate and that only comes once in a life time. You can't make someone love you. this I know I just have to learn to go onJ D Murrah11 months ago akm,Relationships and attachments are often hard to leave behind. Even when there are good reasons, it remains painful to sever the attachment bonds which formed during the relationship.ItsThatSimple5 weeks ago Another reason people leave long term relationships is because it is hard to truly know somebody until a few years have passed. By that time you know all of your spouses quirks, temperament range, and any other qualities you consider employment. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer to evaluate long-term compatibility.J D Murrah5 weeks ago Its That Simple,Thank you for your contribution. There is some truth to the old saying "You don't know someone until you have (lived with/traveled with) them."Although people should know who they marry, many times they fall for the 'fantasy' spouse and it takes them a few years to see the real spouse they married.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sitesWomen Men Love, Women Men Leave: What Makes Men Want to Commit?Amazon Price: $3.93List Price: $7.99Why Men Leave: Men Talk About Why They Ended Relationships, and What Would Have Changed Their MindsAmazon Price: $4.95Wally's TestAmazon Price: $1.99Leave Her to HeavenAmazon Price: $6.68List Price: $14.98RELATIONSHIP TURNAROUND CD SET by Christian Carter Current Bid: $149.85 RENEE GARCIA Where Do I Fit In Christian Relationships Current Bid: $45.00 Can a Darwinian be a Christian?: The Relationship betwe Current Bid: $6.42 Naked Christian Craig Borlase  Find True Relationship Current Bid: $4.36 91J D MurrahFrom Refugee from Shoreacres, Texas332 Followers163 HubsJoined 2 years agoRead more hubs by J D MurrahContact J D MurrahFollow J D MurrahSubscribe to J D Murrah's RSS feedAnswers The QuestionWhy did you leave your long term relationship?
