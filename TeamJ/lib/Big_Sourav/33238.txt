And I'm from Northern Iowa.Not much in the way of winter weather scares me, but I learned to be very, very cautious about ice storms and to avoid going anywhere during and shortly after them.So incredibly, seriously dangerous.  Ice on the roads, 1-2 inches thick, is incredibly dangerous.  You just can't "get a grip" on it.  And on the trees?  Causes them to fall on houses, across roads, onto power lines, etc.  And the power lines break because of the heavy ice buildup. Very, very dangerous.  No place to be outside for civilians.  Stay in, stay sheltered, stay safe.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopProdigalJunkMail      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 07:35 PMResponse to Reply #127.will go...or ...have gone?just try to hit a grocery for milk, eggs, cheese, bread...it's nuts!sPPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopErose999      (984 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:46 PMResponse to Original message2.OH NOES!!

I just had over a foot of snow these past two days here in Conn., but snow can be plowed and shoveled out of the way and was by our very prepared road crews.  Ice adheres to the road and makes the entire surface unusable, even to plows and salt trucks. Add to that the fact that GA. isn't used to snow storms and this is a major problem for them.  Sure, the roads were completely dry and clear by noon after 8 inches overnight here, but we didn't have an ice storm!

Last big snowwe got which was something like 3", there were a lot of cars losing control on the steep hill near where I used to live. People don't know to gear down when descending a hill, or to lay off the gas and turn into a skid until you get traction. Their knee-jerk reaction is to slam on teh brakes which, of course, is the worst thing you can do.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJoe the Revelator      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 09:32 PMResponse to Reply #3440.We don't have plows down here.I think ATL literally has 7.

Yeah, our roads are very prone to icing when we get freezing precipitation here..I think a lot of it has to do with our roads are usually warm when the snow falls on them, it melts in the daytime and then freezes at night and you have instant skating rink. As you say driving on snow is not particularly difficult, driving on ice is damn near impossible.Combine that with the fact we don't get enough snow and ice to be really good at dealing with it as individuals or as a community and yo have a recipe for trouble if you venture out when the roads are frozen.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topphylny      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 09:47 PMResponse to Reply #3442.Southwestern Virginia hereand we have problems with snow because of the hills, mountains, and miles of rural roads that have to be plowed.
