It does bother me just for the lack of personal responsibility, but to answer an earlier question, I plan to do nothing about it. They're still two of my best friends, and I still support a woman's CHOICE to make her own decisions about her body. FWIW, these two friends I speak of left those days behind years ago - one now has a beautiful daughter & husband, and the other has 4 daughters ranging from ages 6-12 (including a set of twins). One day I realized they'd have around 13-15 kids between them, if not for those abortions... egads!                                 01-05-2011, 11:38 AM          smartalx  Senior Member         Status: "trying not to be here"        (set 7 days ago)       Join Date: May 2009 Location: Houston, Texas 880 posts, read 258,333 times Reputation: 295           Quote:    Originally Posted by Anberlin   I stand on my ground and say I am pro-life.

It doesn't sound too much like pro-life.  That sounds exactly like pro-choice. If you are pro-life because you don't believe abortion is the answer for yourself, but you think it's sometimes necessary for other women, then you ARE pro-CHOICE!  That's the definition of pro-choice dear. To be pro-life, you have to be willing to take a stand and say to pregnant women the world over, "you should not have an abortion."  And even if you think "it's okay in the case of rape/incest/life of the mother/etc." I gave you those options to choose. Please vote, but be honest.  Are you actually pro-life, or are you really pro-choice?                    01-05-2011, 11:40 AM          smartalx  Senior Member         Status: "trying not to be here"        (set 7 days ago)       Join Date: May 2009 Location: Houston, Texas 880 posts, read 258,333 times Reputation: 295           Quote:    Originally Posted by Ceece   I'm not voting in the silly poll but as a post menopausal woman I can honestly say abortion is OK if you have an unwanted pregnancy.

What part of "If you are a man, gay, or post-menopausal please answer best you can imagining that you were faced with an unintended pregnancy" do you not understand?                    01-05-2011, 11:42 AM          smartalx  Senior Member         Status: "trying not to be here"        (set 7 days ago)       Join Date: May 2009 Location: Houston, Texas 880 posts, read 258,333 times Reputation: 295           Quote:    Originally Posted by skoro   I'm a man.

I think that's quite reasonable since so many people (life or choice) use those 4 excuses to say they support abortion. So far we have,  6 Pro-life; would have an abortion under extremes2 Pro-life; would have an abortion even without extremes5 Pro-life; never have an abortion 11 Pro-choice; would have an abortion under extremes14 Pro-choice; would have an abortion even without extremes3 Pro-choice; never have an abortion 18 people abstaining What we have are16 people who would have an abortion no matter what17 people who would have an abortion under extremes8 people who would never have an abortion no matter what. 41 votes (13 pro-life/28 pro-choice); 18 abstentions39% people who would have an abortion no matter what41% people who would have an abortion under extremes20% people who would never have an abortion no matter what.  Basically, 61% of the voters would NOT have an abortion in most situations. Why did I choose to draw the line at the extremes?  Because they are extremes.  They don't happen too often and I'm thinking about the pro-life AND pro-choice voters who said in their minds, "I personally don't like abortion myself, and I probably wouldn't have one if I got pregnant, but I can imagine if I was pregnant with a disabled baby it might be best to abort." "I personally don't like abortion myself, and I probably wouldn't have one if I got pregnant."  THAT was what I am polling for.  THAT is what I said I was polling for in the OP.  And so far the statistics are showing that I am absolutely right.  While 68% of the voters are pro-choice, and 80% support having abortions, only 20% would never have an abortion... only 39% of the voters would have an abortion under most circumstances. And only 50% of the pro-choicers would have an abortion under most circumstances. That DEFINITELY supports the case that MOST people oppose abortion for themselves, EVEN if they are "inconvenienced" by having the baby.  Even if the baby gets in the way of their lives.  I gotta say... It makes me feel quite good that 50% of the pro-choicers would have a normal baby, even if it means they have to work extra hard to support it.  Even if it means the direction of their life changes drastically.  Even if it means they have to put their career on hold.  I gotta say... that really gives me hope. ================= So YOUR contention that MY contention is lame.... is what is lame.

It is very easy to have staunch opinions in such circumstances when it is not your reality. I can honestly say I have no idea what decision I would make if faced with an unplanned pregnancy, and it would depend on age, current circumstances, paternal factor, etc.                    01-05-2011, 12:49 PM          smartalx  Senior Member         Status: "trying not to be here"        (set 7 days ago)       Join Date: May 2009 Location: Houston, Texas 880 posts, read 258,333 times Reputation: 295          Granted.  Nevertheless.  61% of the voters do not in their minds support abortion.  And remember, C-D has a decidedly liberal population, hardly completely representative of the overall western world.                    01-05-2011, 12:51 PM          vkhmini  You know what I always say...................
