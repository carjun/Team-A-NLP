Abusive behavior is notan act of rage. It is also not caused by substance abuse. It is apersonality disorder and the chances of stopping a person fromresorting to violence is so slight. The only thing you can do to safeguard yourself is to end the relationship before it is too late. These peoplerarely change. The fact that women in abusive relationships leave theirpartners an average of seven times before they eventually end therelationship is proof that abusers don't stop abusing their partners. Unfortunatelythe last thing that we think of when entering into relationships is thepotential of our newly found partner to become abusive. I sayunfortunately because studies show that one in every four women will bephysically abused by their partner at some time during their lifetime.That means that there is a 25% chance that the next relationship youenter could be with a potential batterer. Many of these relationshipscould have been avoided if the women knew what the warning signs wereand ended the relationship before the onset of the abuse. Image courtesy of Nathalie_Renaud - FlickrWarning Signs -  Battering PersonalitiesThe following is a list ofbehaviors that should raise a red flag. The danger will of courseincrease with the number of these traits the person exhibits.Shows lack of respect towards his mother or women in general:When a man shows a lack of respect to his mother it is usually a signthat he has been brought up believing that women are the weaker sex andthat men have certain privileges. The chances are good that his motheris herself a victim of emotional abuse or she would not allow her childto treat her in this manner. Unfortunately children who grow up inemotional abuse surroundings are at a high risk of becoming emotionalabusers themselves.He has a history of abusing in the past:One thing to remember is that circumstances don't influencewell-balanced adults into becoming abusers. Abusive behavior is apersonality disorder and in time these men will resort to abusivebehavior if the relationship lasts long enough. If you hear that theperson has resorted to battering in a previous relationship take yourmoney and run. And don't look back. Abusive people never take the blamefor anything. They will most definitely not take the blame for previousabuse.  Physical abuse rarely starts at the beginning of arelationship. It could be months or even years before a person becomesabusive. As much as 30% of physical violence starts when a womenbecomes pregnant. That could be quite a time after the start of therelationship.Hits and kicks objects when he is angry: If you see him slamming doors, kicking things he can not fix or hitting objects off a table be careful. The next time he lifts his hand could be to hit you. Normal people do not go around hitting objects - only in the movies. This is a sign that he shows no respect and is a means of instilling fear. He wants you to know what he is capable of when angered so that you make sure that you keep him happy.Leads you to believe that you are inferior: The abusive personis self-centered and in an attempt to make you idolize them leads youto believe that you are unintelligent, inferior, only good for menialtasks such as caring for them. This is all emotional abuse andmanipulation to make you feel that you are dependent on them for yourvery being.Emotional abuse is the precursor to physical abuse:Physical abuse does not happen without a build up of emotional abuse.Emotional abuse can on its own leave much deeper scars than physicalabuse and if your partner starts abusing you emotionally the its timeto get out of the relationship. Verbal abuse includes saying cruelthings to you in order to degrade and belittle you. They become soobsessed with humiliating you that they often keep their partner fromgoing to sleep or wake them up in order to abuse them verbally.  Threats of violence should never be seen to be idle threats: Normalpeople do not threaten to harm their partners irrespective of how angrythey may be. Never see a threat to slap you, kick your teeth out orkill you or any similar threat as an idle threat. They will try toconvince you it is just a manner of speech and that everybody talkslike that. People don't -  unless they have the potential to act outtheir threats.  Inability to accept responsibility for his failures: If yourpartner has difficulty in holding down a steady job  and findingsomeone else to blame for this - see this as a big red flag. If yourpartner puts the blame squarely on your shoulders for everything thatgoes wrong in his life see this as a major clue to where thisrelationship is heading. Abusive partners can never admit that they areat fault about anything and tend to blame their partners. This is justone of the ways that they get to manipulate and brainwash theirpartners into believing they are indebted to the abuser, that they areterrible people and in so doing they slowly but surely gain power andcontrol over their victims.Jealousy:Jealousy is not a sign of love in fact it has nothing to do with love.It is a sign of lack of trust and an attempt to gain control over you.Abusers will always try to excuse themselves for being so insanelyjealous by telling you their jealousy is a sign of how much they loveyou. Don't be fooled into believing this. Unless one of the partnershas done something to betray the other's trust people in healthyrelationships trust each other.Pushing the relationship to move too fast:Abusive people can be very charming at the beginning of a relationship.They tend to sweep women off their feet and before you know it he'll beasking you to move in with him. Beware if you feel that therelationship is moving too fast. Many victims of domestic violencereport that they moved in with the abusive partners after only knowingthem for a few months. Take your time and make sure that you know asmuch as possible about a person before taking your relationship to thenext level.Attempting to control your every move: Underthe pretense of being concerned for your safety abusive partners try tocontrol your every move. They will get upset if you take too long whenyou go shopping, get home a bit late from work and will not reallybelieve you when you try to explain that the traffic was heavy or anyother valid reason. They will eventually want to know who you spoketo;where you spoke to them and what you spoke about. This controllingbehavior tends to worsen and the next thing you will realize that yourpartner is making all your personal decisions for you. He will tell youwhat clothes to wear, how to arrange the furniture and whether youshould go to church or not. As time progresses these people takecontrol of all the finances and will try to control you to the pointwhere you will need to ask their permission to leave the house. Watchout for those first warning signs before it gets to this stage.The partner tries to isolate you from your friends and family:In an attempt to cut you off from any outside resources the abusiveperson will try to keep you from having contact with the people thatare close to you. He will criticize all your friends, in particularthose that are supportive. He will label them as trouble-makers and tryto prevent you from maintaining the friendship. He will find fault withall family members and make it so unpleasant that the abused partnerwill eventually refrain from visiting her family. They may evenrestrict your telephone calls under the pretense of saving money. Blames you for how they feel:Abusers never take responsibility for their own feelings, despite thefact that they actually make a decision about how they feel or think.It will be your fault that they are angry or mad. They will use this tomanipulate you and make you feel guilty. This is all part of emotionalabuse which is the biggest predictor of physical abuse.They feel sorry for themselves:Abusers tend to feel sorry for themselves about things that otherpeople just accept as part of ordinary living. They will feel that itis unfair that they need to actually get up and go to work, or stand ina queue, or help you with trivial things. They are hypersensitive andtake everything personally.Cruelty to animals and insensitivity to children: Peoplewho abuse animals and resort to brutal punishment are high risk fordomestic violence. If they are constantly criticizing other people'schildren or expecting them to be able to things beyond their capabilityconsider this as a warning sign. These people will not easily acceptchildren that you bring with you into the relationship. The abusiveperson tends to tease children until they cry. The abusive partner maytry to prevent you from having contact with your children or may punishthem to hurt you. Remember that almost sixty percent of partners thatresort to physical violence abuse their children as well as theirpartners. Little or no regards to your sexual needs:These people often have sexual fantasies and will expect you to actthese out. They may even tell you that they get exited about thethought of raping someone. They will sulk or get angry if you do notsatisfy their every sexual need as way to manipulate you. They are alsoknown to start having sex with their sleeping partners and demand sexirrespective of your state of mind. They invariably use sex as a meansof making up after a verbal or physical attack on you.

Thank you for pointing it out.Paradise714 months ago Once again, Laura, my hat's off to you for a truly telling hub.  And I also liked Princessa's point about recognizing the warning signs on behalf of daughters and friends (and sisters!)Laura du Toit14 months ago Thanks PaeadiseYes I agree - if we can recognize the signs we can help other people who are unaware of them, Unfortunately love is blind and most people don't want to believe anything bad of their partner in a new relationship, but ar least we can try.Mighty Mom14 months ago Very thorough.Although the most common abuse dynamic is male to female, there can be abuse in gay relationships and women can also abuse their male partners(typically mental/emotional more than physical).The one thing I would add is you are right. Abuse/domestic violence is not caused by substance abuse. However, you very, very rarely see this kind of violence without alcohol or drugs involved. The relationship may not be causal.But it does co-occur. So heavy drinking/drug use is another clue if you see some of the other signs as well! MMLaura du Toit14 months ago Thanks MMI agree with what you say - Just wanted to make sure people understand that substance abuse is not the cause. Abusiveness is still a personality disorder and not caused by substance abuse - only aggravated by it. The substance is a scapegoat for the abuser.tonymac0414 months ago Thanks for an insightful Hub on such a difficult subject.Love and peaceTonylyricsingray14 months ago If only more people knew these critical points,really well done and well written, thank you, KimberlyLaura du Toit14 months ago Thanks Kimberley!Hopefully with this week's hubmob topic more people will become aware of the magnitude of this problem.terrowhite14 months ago Some of the most tragic situation comes in life when people around you abuse you and torture you at every single step..

As a man I find the statistics you given very disturbing! I have never hit a woman and I have high respect for my mother and women in general. However, I do have a bad temper and it makes me want to search my soul even more so I can find ways to keep my temper from being destructive to ANYONE including my self. Thanks again for your courage in tackling this very important and serious subject!Laura du Toit14 months ago Thanks HighvoltagewriterI am glad that reading my hub made you realize just how grave the situation is. It seems we have a pretty unstable society based on the figures. Hope you find some way to vent your anger. It may be a good idea to take up some form of exercise such as kick-boxing ( I'm no expert but maybe this will help to get rid of pent-up anger).ahostagesituation3 weeks ago Excellent.
