The protagonist,  as narrator, described a certain piece of music as "ice-cold Bach".

Kenny G noodles, he does NOT improvise. There's a famous rant about what a hack he is that floats around on the Internet and which is attributed to Pat Metheny.  A lot of Pat Metheny's stuff lately sounds like snow on the TV, but his stuff with structure to it, I like (Secret Story, We Live Here). Accomplished classical musicians get bored and go into jazz.  Why? Because jazz and classical are the only two complex forms of music.Example: Jean-Luc Ponty earned the Grand Prix (outstanding student prize) at the Paris Conservatory.  Everybody who's anybody in French music went to the Paris Conservatory. Saint-Saens,etc.He figured out he could make more momey in jazz.Note:I trained as a classical musician on two instruments for about 20 years.  And I have seen a lot of jazz artists. Stephan Grapelli, Ella Fitzgerald and many others.  It's about improvising, which is NOT random.

They seldom play blue notes or otherwise bend the notes.  You can't play blue notes on a piano, but the enriched harmonies achieve somewhat the same effect.  Modern jazz doesn't sound exactly like Delta blues, but they are cousins, musically speaking.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopMilesColtrane      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 01:03 PMResponse to Reply #915.I'm sure Aaron Copland and Charles Ives would have been chagrined to find out...Edited on Sat Jan-08-11 01:04 PM by MilesColtranethat they didn't make real American music.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopAmerigo Vespucci      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 01:14 PMResponse to Reply #916.HEY, Snooty Noodler is one of my favorite performers.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLionel Mandrake      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 02:18 AMResponse to Original message10.Jazz is beautiful music.Jazz was born in America about a century ago.  It has a rich tradition.  It appeals to people who know how to listen to it, who understand or sense the tradition, the rules, the conventions.  As jazz developed throughout the 20th century, the music became more complex.  The chords went from triads and seventh chords to 9th, 11th, and 13th chords, flatted fifths, etc.   Not everyone could follow the changes.  My dad, for example, loved dixieland and swing.  His attitude toward bebop was something like this: "I don't get it; therefore it sucks."Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopUTUSN      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 12:04 PMResponse to Original message13.Allow me to explainEdited on Sat Jan-08-11 12:11 PM by UTUSNSo there was this gathering place last night.  The crowd was friendly and warm.  Pool playing, beer, chatter, and juke box were going on.  There was a real buzz of conviviality.  The SurroundSound of the music was just right----POPULAR songs, not "bubble-gum" but things with THE ELEMENTS ---melody above all, rhythm, harmony, (lyrics are way down the list).  Not that I ever liked EISENHOWER, but I love TCHAIKOVSKY and EISENHOWER came up with a great line when he was asked what music he liked.  He said, "Something TUNEFUL.  TCHAIKOVSKY."O.K., so it was a great crowd and mood.  The music queue was extra long, so things playing at the moment were thrown in a long time before, and there was no way to get rid of something playing except for ditching it, which is a last resort since somebody paid money for it.So, this jazz thing started and went on and on.  No, I'm not educated in jazz and never will be.  Clearly the notes have some relation to one another but not in my simplistically TUNEFUL demand.  The effect of this thing was like a dagger made of ICE that plunged into the warm, throbbing mood of the crowd.  People automatically went to stuff bucks into the juke box to get this thing supplanted, but the queue was what it was.  And this THING went on and on for, like, TEN EFFING MINUTES.  Perhaps I exaggerate.  But I could feel the irritation and hostility rise up the neck hairs.  It had no discernible beginning, middle, or end.  I will not dispute if anybody says it is I, not jazz, that am stupid, but life is getting shorter all the time and jazz will remain for me one of the myriad of things that I will thoughtlessly and happily relegate to unexplored territory.HooKAY.  That said, I always remember a band director tuning us high school band up and we were a bit out of sorts, musically.  He said, "Well, that's close enough for jazz!1"  Superfluously, I will add here that we weren't playing jazz.And I don't know who Kenny G is, nothing except hearing the name.   Sorry to offend anybody with my ignorant opinions.  We can't convert anybody to anything.  As Prince Phillip said, "There's no accounting for taste."  Gawsh, I've quoted a Rethug and a "royal," both categories being anathema to me!1Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Sat Jan-08-11 06:22 PMResponse to Reply #1319.Deleted messageMessage removed by moderator.

I posted fresh from the incident described, knew that the bare bones of my O.P. was a tad inflammatory but thought most DU Loungers would get the tongue-in-cheek, but my "attack" was a specific OPINION ABOUT MUSIC, not an attack on PERSONS.

The chords, the beautiful lines, the meshing of tones, the ability to bend and change notes - listen to some Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald singing. Just gorgeous.
