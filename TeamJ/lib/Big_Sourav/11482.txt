The most commented-on story by far was our9 On Your Side Investigation looking into the Tucson Unified School District's Mexican-American studies program. The report found some striking similarities between some of what the students are learning and what they've been practicing lately in walk-outs and protests. Those findings tend to cast doubt on TUSD's assertions that its program does not violate the letter of the new state law, HB 2281, which among other things prohibits teaching "ethnic solidarity." The story did not explore the issue of whether the new law itself is legal or morally correct. But the investigation did show that students in the program tend to do significantly better academically.Ran Yodel writes: "It's a simple picture: either we institute pro-American identity legislation like this or the country will resemble the Balkans soon. Every state, even from the federal level, should attempt to replicate what AZ's legislation is trying to do. Otherwise racial chauvinism will continue its oppressive march of America into the toilet."Judith McKinney wrote (all the way from Tijeras, New Mexico): "Your article is so biased toward the left that you cannot really believe you are a journalist - do you? I am the daughter of a Swedish immigrant mother and an Italian immigrant father. They had no ethnic studies for these groups. My parents felt so blessed to become American citizens that they would be outraged by your article. You are stuck in the past while the world needs to move forward toward a more positive, united America."I asked Ms. McKinney to explain what she thought was biased about the story. She sent this explanation: "I see no quotes about the huge number of successful 'assimilated' Hispanics that have been in the Southwest for centuries and how they worked peacefully with Anglos and Native Americans to build great cities (like Albuquerque). Over half of our government employees are Hispanic as are our elected officials in NM. Where is the racism and oppression? .....I know of no immigrant group that has not, at one time or another, suffered from discrimination until they were fully assimilated into the country. This is particularly true for Irish and Italian immigrants. If you see the glass as half empty, then this class is for you. If you see America as the great melting pot who has given opportunities to millions of people willing to earn their success, then you will see the glass half full."From "Julie:" "Gee, I learned about how colonists overthrew a government and established a new one! That is the history Anglo students learned! What is the difference? Peaceful protest, civil disobedience, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, justice and equality under the law, those are the ideas that our country holds dear! How are the actions of the Chicano movement different? I'll tell you what the problem is. Republicans are afraid of smart, well educated Latinos, especially Mexican Americans who graduate from HS and college, create strong candidates for office and know how to vote against racists, neo-Nazis and liars who say they are doing one thing while really doing something else."From "m griffin:" "I am an American of Irish decent. If ethnic studies are available does TUSD provide studies for my background? It's not economical feasible. We need to get back to basics to compete in the global market. This is not a racial issue."From Beau Ciel: "Mr. Horne [Tom Horne, the state schools superintendent who pushed the new law] continues to say, "What's wrong is to have a whole course just teach the history of the ethnicity of the race you happen to be born into." The classes at TUSD are open to all students of many races. Learning about the history of various groups of people will serve the students in TUSD well over a lifetime as they will have an understanding of other cultures and traditions. The academic success of those students taking the ethnic history classes is exemplary and should be encouraged."From Ted Allen: "Wait I'm German, Russian and part French, I think. Will those ethnic studies be offered?"From "irishman1928:" "Well, I am English and Welch, and my wife is half Swiss and half Swedish. So, why isn't that covered? Why can't she have things written in Swedish, and also in German? Fair is fair. This whole thing is so stupid. English should be the language, and nothing else. Why does everything have to be in Spanish as well as English? This is the United State of America, soif you don't like it, leave NOW!"From "azitaliania:" "Every person on earth has the right to know where he or she came from.Every person on earth has the right to know his or her ethnicity, with associatedtraditions and customs. Every person on earth has a right to know his or her family andmedical history."From Joyce Nielsen: "We should be teaching what it means to be a U.S. citizen and not worry about the ethnic history of each individual. Ethnic history can be taught at home. We should not be paying for this in our schools. You teach one type of ethnic history and then you have to teach all. Why aren't we teaching Polish ethnic history, or Italian, or German, or Dutch. Use the schools to teach academics!!!!""montanachick" writes: "The last two years of my high school year I took the ethnic studies classes! They've taught me so much about my heritage as well as involvement of other heritages! I don't believe this [the ethnic studies crackdown] is a smart educational move! Both years the classes welcomed all races, and I always had a mixture in every class. Tom Horne has been attacking these classes for a couple years now and has yet to justify the real reason behind his actions. These classes are important and have more educational purposes than regular American government classes. If the students can't show just how important these classes are by walk outs than I don't know what will!!!"Trish Shelton writes: "Your news cast is inflammatory and biased. You continue to put more and more emphasis on these protests and marches thus throwing more and more gasoline on the situation with your broadcasts. THIS IS AMERICA...DO NOT HELP DIVIDE THIS CITY, THIS STATE, AND THIS COUNTRY. STAND UP FOR AMERICAN CULTURE. This is NOT MEXICO. TUSD should NOT be offering LATINO STUDIES in lieu of AMERICAN HISTORY. If people want to immigrate here, they must assimilate to American culture. Governor Brewer has the right leadership and so does Tom Horn to ban these divisive studies from our school system."From "Evag:" "I don't understand why everyone is so upset. Could it be that the majority will no longer be the majority in a few years? Maybe it's fear that the oppressed will no longer be the oppressed because we are growing rapidly in numbers. Too bad you cannot stop us -- we are here. Originally we did not even cross the border, the border crossed us. And FYI Spanish (along with English) is one of the widely used languages in the world. It is considered cultured and worldly to be bi- or tri-lingual. What is all the fear and hatred about? ....Racism is fear plain and simple. I would gladly encourage any of my children to learn about any other culture. I am not afraid of learning new ways or cultures. This class should continue; it has positive results!!!!!!!!!! Heaven forbid a bunch of Chicano kids gets get empowered, don't drop out and improve and increase results of standardized testing. Arizona is looking MIGHTY racist right now."From "steph71: "This is no different than the 'separate but equal' law that was eventually banned. How can these programs be about fairness and equality while separating themselves to do it? Why should anyone be forced to cater to, accommodate, and pay for the teaching of ONE specific group of people. IF the argument is that these programs benefit ALL by learning ALL cultures and traditions, and people have the right to know where they came from, etc etc.... then teach ALL cultures and ALL traditions. Let me know when the Irish American studies program opens up."From "scola91660:" "Just a thought, when Italians, Germans, Irish, etc. came to the States in immigrant waves, did they whine about a need for ethnic studies? My ethnic studies happened at home with my mother, my father, my grandmother, etc. There was a time when the people that came from other places wanted to become just Americans, and the schools served as a place to bring these diverse groups together. It is ironic that those that do not want to be set aside or segregated often do the setting aside and segregating themselves."from "Fred:" "How racist does the state intend on portraying itself to the rest of the world? First they pass an immigration law that does nothing but foster racial mistrust and does nothing to fix or even remotely help the illegal immigration problem, and now they pass a bill going after ethnic studies classes. What's next, are they going to start separating students by race?"Frederick Thomas writes: "Once again you state that the majority of Arizonans agree with Tom Horne about his bill about ethnic studies. Why is it you never post the amount of people surveyed in these polls, is it because we will find out that 1 or 2 thousand people voted, and thereby undermine the message that John Justice, errr, I mean KGUN9 On Your Side, is trying to feed it's viewers? The Illegal immigration bill and the Ethnic studies bill are bad for Arizona, making Arizona look even more racist than it did before it adopted the MLK holiday and your reporting (which should be impartial) isn't making it any better. Get with it KGUN9."To answer that Mr. Thomas' question: KGUN9 News asked viewers about the new law in three "Question of the Day" KGUN9.com web polls. In one poll 59% said they support the new law cracking down on such studies; 37% opposed. In a second poll, we presented the question a different way, asking whether students have a right to learn about their ethnic history in school. The results of that one were dead even, 49% in favor and 49% against. And we also asked the question a third way, asking viewers what TUSD should do with the program. 65% said drop it; 27% said leave it alone; and 8% said revise it. Mr. Thomas is correct in saying that our web polls are not scientifically accurate; the sample base is self-selected and the size varies from poll to poll. We have found, however, that the results typically track fairly well against scientifically accurate polls, when such polls are available for comparison.As for the potshot about Jon Justice, I've written previously about that.Another big story for viewer comments this week was Tammy Vo's examination of immigration laws and enforcement practices in Mexico. The story showed that Mexico's moral standing to criticize the immigration policies of other countries is shaky at best.Corey Anderson writes: "Thank you so much for Tammy Vo's report about Americans questioning Mexico's immigration laws. It was informative and necessary to help your viewers understand the various aspects of the 1070 debate. It is refreshing to see the media present a differing side to the debate rather than always focusing on the "racial" concerns. This issue goes much deeper than that and, Tammy Vo did a wonderful job bringing another perspective to the ongoing controversy."Diana Knapp writes: "Kudos to Channel 9 for mentioning that Mexico's Immigration laws are stricter than Arizona's. I wish the major networks would bring that to the attention of the viewers, it might stop such out bursts from both Mexico and the Protesters who are against the new law. Yes, Mexico and the protesters are hypocrites to be remarking on Arizona's immigration laws when Mexico's is so much more strict."Edgar Vasquez writes: "Although Mexico has this law, Mexico also has a 'No Hassel Travel' which allows US citizens to travel all the way to San Carlos, Sonora without the need of purchasing a permit. If you cross that line and the Mexican police pull you over and asks you for your permit and you don't show it, they have the right to impound your car and maybe put you in jail. This is basically the same that the US has because a Mexican citizen with a visa can travel to Tucson without a permit. If they pass Tucson without a permit they are, in other words, breaking the US law and might be fined or put in jail.... In all my trips to Cancun, Mazatlan, Guadalgara, and other Mexican states I have never been asked for a permit.... So even though you may not like the laws Mexico has or the way they criticize our laws they really don't enforce their law, because they want us to spend our money in Mexico -- unlike Arizona, which is making it harder for them to spend money here. So before you criticize Mexico for what they have written but do not enforce, compared to what the US has written and dose enforce, I think that Mexico has all the right to say something about our law."Lynn Martin of Oro Valley writes: "I just watched your story this a.m. on Mexico's immigration laws and wanted to tell you how appreciative we are that you researched this and put it on the air.
