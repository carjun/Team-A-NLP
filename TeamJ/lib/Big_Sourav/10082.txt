Gabrielle Giffords was hosting an open house for constituents. Investigators found a letter from the congresswoman in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a similar 2007 event, a federal agent's affidavit states."Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature," the affidavit states.Read more: http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/01/09/arizona.shooting.in...

It is of no surprise that "mental illness" was going to be mentioned in this case. We as humans find it hard to understand what he did... so alas, it must be mental illness.... and when I called him "a mad dog"... I didn't suggest it in the sense of mental illness.  He seems to have had a drive to hurt others... so is it "meanness"... or is it "mental illness"?How does one suss out pure directed hate from mental illness?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPosteritatis      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 08:16 PMResponse to Reply #716.Not treating the two as synonymous might be a start.Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 08:16 PM by PosteritatisNot treating "mental illness" as a monolith would be nice, too.

I was going to write my version of all this, but instead found a handy explanation from PBS:http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/crime/tri... Each state, and the District of Columbia, has its own statute setting out the standard for determining whether a defendant was legally insane, and therefore not responsible, at the time his crime was committed. In general, the standards fall into two categories.About half of the states follow the "M'Naughten" rule, based on the 1843 British case of Daniel M'Naughten, a deranged woodcutter who attempted to assassinate the prime minister. He was acquitted, and the resulting standard is still used in 26 states in the U.S.: A defendant may be found not guilty by reason of insanity if "at the time of committing the act, he was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong." (emphasis added) This test is also commonly referred to as the "right/wrong" test.Twenty-two jurisdictions use some variation of the Model Standard set out by the American Law Institute (A.L.I.) in 1962. Under the A.L.I. rule, a defendant is not held criminally responsible "if at the time of his conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law." (emphasis added) The A.L.I. rule is generally considered to be less restrictive than the M'Naughten rule.Some states that use the M'Naughten rule have modified it to include a provision for a defendant suffering under "an irresistible impulse" which prevents him from being able to stop himself from committing an act that he knows is wrong.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topqueerart      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 08:26 PMResponse to Reply #1821.Thanks For That My Friend....   n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJackpine Radical      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 08:40 PMResponse to Reply #2125.There is no reason to imagine this guy would meet an ALIstandard let alone a M'Naughten standard. In fact, NGRIs are quite rare--much more so than the general public seems to believe.

Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense." This act, a response to the Hinckley verdict, eliminated the irresistible impulse test from the insanity defense under federal law. The act also provided that "the defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by clear and convincing evidence." Previously under federal law, the government had the burden of proving sanity....Current Status of the Insanity Defense among the StatesThe following list gives the status of the insanity defense in all 50 states, describes the test used, the party on whom the burden of proof lies, and whether the state uses the guilty but mentally ill verdict.ARIZONA: M'Naghten Rule, burden of proof on defendant....The M'Naghten rule states: "Every man is to be presumed to be sane, and . . . that to establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party ACCUSED was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.

His words and actions are not the words and actions of the broad spectrum of the public but he is certainly well aware of what he is doing and that applies to both before and after the rampage -- after all, he is not cooperating with authorities.

I mean, literally, brainwashed--maybe one of the techniques that were being tried out at Guantanamo Bay or other torture dungeons.   He cannot hold two thoughts together.  His mind has been messed with. That's my take--on what little info there is, at this point.

A lifetime in the joint seems to me like such a more appropriate price to pay for what he has done (much more so than merely being allowed to check out).  He looks so cute in the picture with his curly hair do; and although I have no idea what makes one male appear attractive to another, I rather imagine that his living in the joint will enable him to become the perfect prison spokes model for Preparation H.  I also like to imagine that his first cell mate will weigh 315 lbs., and his name will be something like "Willie Slaughter". Yes Virginia, we all have our karma to bear.

I hope the MSM starts reporting the story correctly, the Arizona assassination attempt on U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.  It wasn't another mass killing.  It was an assassination attempt and he has been charged with that crime.All the clowns on teevee that say it wasn't political are wrong.  They want to spin the story as if they had no culpability.  They did/do have culpability.  They played up the vitriol for ratings and a damaged man took the ideas to fruition.Where is Condi Rice to tell us that "No one could have predicted"?  Oh right, Gabrielle Giffords is on tape, from earlier this past year, predicting that indeed words will have consequences.
