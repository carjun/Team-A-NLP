No longer able to ignore the widespread and deplorable record of the Catholic Church, Pope Benedict XVI spoke of child sexual abuse.Addressing the Cardinals and Bishops Assembly, Pope Benedict accepted the humiliation of clerical child sexual abuse reports this year and institutional complicity through active concealment. Earnest admonishment for the wrongs was expressed.  He urged reflection by the Church upon its role in allowing the sexual abuse of children to occur within its midst.Pope Benedict failed to accept full responsibility.  He cast blame on the moral laxity of society and its tolerance of pornography and sex tourism. He suggested that Catholic theology of the 1970's was influenced by social sexual permissiveness of the times.''We must ask ourselves what was wrong in our proclamation, in our whole way of living the Christian life, to allow such a thing to happen,'' admonished the pontiff.Blaming ''the contextof these times'', the Pope seemed to deflect responsibility while acknowledgingawareness of the gravity of "sins" by ministers of the CatholicChurch.''There is a market in child pornography that seems in some way to be considered more and more normal by society,'' lamented the earthly leader of the Catholic Church. He said that children are reduced to merchandise and are psychologically destroyed. 'We must ask ourselves what we can do to repair as much as possible the injustice that has occurred,'' he remarked to the Assembly of Roman Catholic clerical leaders. ''Morality is replaced by a calculus of consequences, and in the process it ceases to exist," said the Pope in his criticism of the abandonment of absolute values in favor of moral relativism.The Pope was not optimistic about the future of morality with society's drug culture "spreading its octopus tentacles around the entire world."  The focus on the subject of child sexual abuse and the call for change sends a clear message of hope for candid disclosures by the Vatican for the victims of child sexual abuse.Child Abuse SignsChild abuse comes in so many shapes, sizes and degrees that it is difficult to sort it all out. The single element in common is the long lasting harm to the spirit of the victimized child. The categories of abuse are physical, sexual, emotional and neglect. All are injurious to the well-being of a child.There are many behavioral indicators which include but are not limited to nightmares, irritability and anger. A child may appear sullen or melancholy. There may be changes in weight or appetite. Personal hygiene habits relative to bathing or undressing, more or less, may be a signal. Sleep disruption by bedwetting or nightmares may provide a clue. Overdressing with multiple layers of clothing may also occur.Sexuality may send a red alert. It may manifest in drawings, conversation and dress. The source of knowledge of sexual subjects should be explored with any child who is behaving sexually inappropriately to their age.  Fear and avoidance of certain people and places may appear as a pattern of behavior.Survivors of sexual abuse are a good source of needed information. An article by a professional in the field for twenty years which sets forth the behavioral and physical signs of all categories of child sexual abuse is an excellent resource.Blue Children Lets Go West: Painted blueSource: sligobayChild Abuse HubsHow to Recognize and Prevent Child AbuseI have worked with programs designed to prevent child abuse and other forms of abuse for all ages and genders for over 20 years and will list some signs and indications of abuse here.

Sexual identity issues are prominent.  Promiscuity and inability to sustain monogamous relationships are common.  Homosexuality and homophobia are two sides of the same coin.Fear, helplessness, hopelessness and depression are often experienced.  Problems with drugs and alcohol may evolve as false coping and pain management strategies.Anger and violence may occur in response to repression and denial of sexual assault.Self-blame , shame and guilt undermine self esteem and self worth.Self-destructive behavior of every description manifests in a person who has not addressed themselves to the acceptance of the reality of the traumatic experience(s) and entered a process of therapy and healing.Prison for Many Child Abuse VictimsPrisonThere are almost 2 million prisoners in the United States today.

Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you too.SilverGenes2 weeks ago Knowledge is power. The more lights go on, the less power abuse and the abuser have and that's what is needed. Well done.Amy Becherer2 weeks ago I think the greatest disservice by the Vatican aside from the abuse of it's children, is the laxity and nonchalence of it's admission.  The herculaneum efforts required to extricate the truth and it's subsequent minimizing has forever denigrated trust.  I feel scorn for the church.  I grew up educated in parochial schools from grade school through one year at a Catholic college, but will never again participate in organized religion.  I believe in God, I pray, but it will not be in a church. The church, as a result of their long denied crimes and self protective, insulated lies and coverups, holds no relevance or purpose for me.  They are relegated to just another money making business in my book.  With my degree of disdain, I can only imagine the pain and betrayal that these crimes, against the most innocent of humanity, suffered at the hands of those who chose to "protect the little children", feel.  The painfully lacking rhetoric of the pope and now shifting the blame from where it belongs to society in general, illustrates how far from God's plan the church has strayed. I wonder if his Holiness sleeps at night...if his conscience knows that he has displeased God?  Beautiful, insightful and informative piece about an especially difficult subject.  Thank you and glad to see you back, Sligobay.  I missed you.always exploring2 weeks ago I watched the video of the little abused girl and it broke my heart.It was me so many years ago,the feeling of helplessness was all around me.I remember every detail as if were yesterday.This occurred from my mother's boyfriend when i was six years old.It's a trauma that is with you throughout life.I don't dwell on it,but when i read or hear of another,it becomes fresh again.How anyone can attend a Catholic church is beyond my comprehension.Thank you for writing this hub,also happy to see you back writing.Peacesligobay2 weeks ago Silver Genes/thank youHappy Xmas.Amy- on my phone replying.

I think these stories relate to your content.http://hubpages.com/hub/An-Article-on-Street-Childhttp://hubpages.com/hub/An-Article-on-Child-Abuse-Amy Becherer2 weeks ago always exploring, I'm with you 100% on your comment "How anyone can attend a Catholic church is beyond my comprehension". I think it has to do with the way Catholic schools teach. As a student, I was not taught  the Bible, but rather memorized catechism questions and answers...rout memorization.  Questions were discouraged and it felt, to me, like a form of brainwashing. I was berated by my 2nd grade teacher, a 78 year old nun, for questioning the need for weekly confession.  I broke out in a cold sweat in that coffin-like box. I was admonished that "the saints went everyday, and who did I think I was?"  I had no aspirations for sainthood, but I couldn't win the argument so I devised a plan whereby I confessed a made up sin and covered myself with "and I lied once". I can only assume that as a group it is much easier to gain and maintain control in that fashion.sligobay2 weeks ago Ruby- I am so sorry for your pain, at so young an age. I was sexually abused in my adolescence at 13 ( not a priest or family member) but physically abused in the second grade by a Catholic nun. I remained terrorized by Sister Justina the following year in the third grade. I was relieved somewhat in the 4th grade with a lay teacher but the emotional scars are permanent. Read my next Hub, Brother's Keeper, about my physical abuse as a child.  The later sexual abuse may have stemmed from my early abuse in some fashion but I don't know.  I launched that Hub today.  Also today, I launched the sequel to my Candy Bar Diet Hub to lighten up the subject matter for Christmas. My humour has been my greatest resource in my survival. Working on "touching" and "Brother's Keeper" has been extremely painful but I hope, eventually cathartic. I was in a very dark place this past weekend.On Brother's Hub, I posted a YouTube video of Pat Benetar performing "Hell is for Children" which brought me to tears. Enjoy my 'Candy Bar Brawl' Hub just launched. Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy and healthy New Year. Gerrysligobay2 weeks ago Amy- Thanks for calling over, your very thorough comments, your support and your welcome. There can be little doubt as to my position on the matter of the Church conceding nothing other than what has already been publicly proven. It seems that my heritage and belief system have both been undermined by the lack of candor. The truth itself is a victim of the concealment. Physical abuse in parochial schools is the subject of my new Hub, "Brother's Keeper". There is an unfortunate schism between principles and practice in the Holy Roman Catholic Church. Happy Holidays.MartieCoetser2 weeks ago I believe abusing an innocent child in any way is the worst crime an adult can commit. It is mutilation of the soul/spirit, which is the core of a human being. How can one develop like a normal being when its core has been harmed? Eventually there is always something different about adults who were abused (in any way) while they were children, and that something different is either beautiful or ugly. I can see yours are beautiful sligobay. May God bless you in abundance.eveangelel2 weeks ago When a child is abused early on by someone who is said to protect them such as a parent... it steals away so many aspects of their humanity. I never considered how damaging it would be when the abuser was a 'holy' person. Though bein abused in any way by anyone is scarring and despicable. The more the child respects and trusts the abuser the greater the psychological damage. The worst thing is that children learn at such an early age that abuse it what the world is. As they go on in their lives, many lose to the internal stuggle, the feeling of shame and being tainted. The majority of self-mutalators and those who commit suicide were sexually abused as children. It is of course a despicable practice but those who cower in filth and dark  flee from the light of knowledge. I appreciate you writing about this.... too many children have been robbed early on of opportunity and a wholesome life. Thank you.sligobay2 weeks ago Thank you for your visit Eveangelel. Your kind words and thoughtful remarks are welcome and appreciated.sligobay12 days ago Thank you Martie for your visit and your compliment and your blessing.
