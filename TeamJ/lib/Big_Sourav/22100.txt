Even when the military took over they only kept him [Aden Abdullah Osman Daar] for a night. My generation grew up with nationalism and we had faith in good governance.Education was outstanding. I was privileged. I got the best quality of education I could've got at home. I was provided with accommodation and all my books. Us students were even given extra pocket money and so on Thursday nights, we used to go to nightclubs and party. The beauty was that we were five minutes walk from the best club in the city - Jazira. You didn't even need a car.Those were good times: Boys, girls having a nice time and there was always music playing, be it Western or Somali.'Good old days'Fashion at the time was fantastic... dressing in summery clothes. No-one noticed in the good old days. I had four sisters and my father was a religious man but he never imposed anything on them. They could wear whatever they wished and were all educated. Mogadishu used to be one of Africa's cleanest and safest capitalsFridays were family days. We used to go about 15km outside Mogadishu to a restaurant we called Abukarow after the man who owned it.He had a mosque built next door so that families could go to prayers and then come and eat. If you didn't get there early and reserve a table before prayers then you had no chance of being served a meal as it was so popular and always crowded. We would feast on "dhaylo" - baby goat grilled on charcoal, with heaps of Somali rice all washed down with sour camel milk taken with a little bit of sugar. Please turn on JavaScript.

All the schools were closed for a year and instead everyone had to get together and those who knew how to read had to teach those who couldn't.It was amazing.By 1976, our literacy rate was 95% and the majority of those were women.  It was that generation who became the teachers and the doctors and the professionals. 'Such naivety'Somalia's health system was very good back then. There were many who like me became doctors.During the war with Ethiopia, I was a student at medical school and we were sent to the frontline to help the wounded. It was the first time for someone like myself, who grew up in the city, to see war. Those times were filled with such naivety. We thought we would win and we were winning - for a time - until the turning point. That was when our naivety changed into maturity. The refugees who came from the Ogaden changed everything. Since then nothing was the same. Central Mogadishu is now a war-zoneFormer Deputy Prime Minister Osman Jama I want to pass my congratulations to all Somalis wherever they are.I remember how we were all so excited.I was at that time studying at secondary school and we all ran away from school and trekked to Hargeisa just to see the colonial flag pulled down and to watch the Somali flag rise.Continue reading the main story Start QuoteNo-one could ever imagine that it would become as bad as it hasEnd QuoteFormer Deputy PM Osman Jama I was there and singing songs. Everybody was so happy. We were shouting two words: Independence and unity. Five days after northern Somalia was granted independence, the south and Mogadishu got their independence and we were united.That time was euphoria. But then I remember everybody was trying to unify Somalia - the territory that was given to Ethiopia by the British: We call it western Somalia. They call it the Ogaden. We were all speaking together as one country but of course now it is not like that. That war was the start of the decline.But no-one could ever imagine that it would become as bad as it has.'And so there was chaos'At independence everyone was hoping for something good - to get rid of colonialism and then to find freedom. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.Video compiled by Dirios from YouTube showing independent Somalia's first elected president, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar.  It shows the history of his rule and a glimpse of life during his era. But unfortunately of our 123 ministers of parliament, only three had degrees - one from Britain and two from Italy. There was no experience of how to run a state. So after the colonials left, corruption came and then the military took over to rectify the mistakes of the civilian government. During the first seven or eight years of military rule, there was continuous development. Life was good.But once we fought with Ethiopia, the regime became one of nepotism and corruption became rampant. Everybody became clan-ish. Clan-based origins took over every part of life - employment, promotions, social opportunities, health, education and so there was chaos. And this is the result: Statelessness.'Paradise'But now I believe everything is changing. We came through clanism, and warlordism and now we have extremism. This is what we are going through now but it is getting weaker. Religiously we are all Muslims and the same sect: Sunnis. This is what will hold people together. We have the same religion, language and culture. This is our strength as a people and it will come. There is hope. Mogadishu was once an international city - now it is too dangerous for foreignersI was in our capital, Mogadishu for 28 years. It was called the most beautiful city of Africa when I first moved there in 1968. It was the safest and the cleanest. We had the most beautiful beaches. Life was very pleasant. We were global and developing - the Soviet Union gave us a lot of help. Mogadishu was an international city.It was really a paradise.Now it is a disaster. It is rubbish. No water, no electricity. Only fighting and war. It is very unfortunate.It is very painful to see what has happened, what our country has become. What are your memories of Somalia since independence? As I grew up in the town of Elwak on the frontier with Kenya, Somalia was quite organized country. To my suprise there were schools on the Somali side of the town, post office, gas station, the town had both water and electricity and gigantic stadium (we used to call it 'isbartiimada October 21). On the Kenya's side of the border there is another town by the same name but without any of these amenities. The value of somali shiling was equal to the Kenya shilling. Cross border trade between the town obviously was booming, but favored Somalia. It was so peaceful. We had properties and daddy run family business while I was sent to English language school on the Kenya side. Before the hell broke out, I was to go to Garbaharey High school. I still miss Elwak Somali nowadays run down by shabab bandits.abdi Isaak, Seattle, USA I am not from somalia, but i remember when I WAS LITTLE IN MY COUNTRY COTE D'IVOIRe, the name mogadishu meant a place that i have to visit one day. i pray God that this country and all country in Africa will go back to their glorious and better years.dany, jersey city, nj Today on the 50th anniversary of the Somali Republic (union of Somaliland British Protectorate and the Italian Somali territory), I am reflecting my childhood in that country; a wonderful time and a bygone era that is causing much of my melancholy. I am saddened on the one hand about the plight of my fellow countrymen in south/south central Somalia. On the other hand I feel optimistic and happy to see, Somaliland's (my parents birthplace) fair and free election that took place on the 26th of June 2010. I feel there's sense of revival and hope and better future for at least one part of the former Somali republic. A hope that I also feel that one day other Somali groups will regain their popular voice and sort their differences through the ballot box just like Somaliland. For the coming 50 years I would advise my fellow Somalis (wherever they are in the Horn of Africa) to built the basis of strong foundation for consensus grass-root orientated governance at local levels; i.e. villages, towns, districts, regional. We should avoid the mistakes of these last five decades. People should feel they have legitimate claim of the ownership of their representatives. They should start the process of regaining the captainship at helm rather that making themselves mere passengers who are then often hijacked by religious groups whose ideological base is alien to the Somali pastoralist culture.  When reflecting today and in the coming weeks, we should also take solace that 50 years have not gone without gaining the experience and the maturity we needed to better ourselves in tomorrow's journey. So in reality we have grown up in these tumultuous passed years. We should look ahead to the future for the sake of our children; a good number of whom are growing up presently in diaspora as part of other nations. Last but not least we should keep hope and faith that the next decade will be better. After all, can it get worst than it is right now? Happy 50th anniversary to Somaliland and Somalia.Magado, London, UK I was born when the fighting started in mogadisho and seeing these pictures in the past it really hurts. I haven't even seen broken light trafic in mogadisho streets. i wanted to see the remains of old mugadisho but I don't think there are remains of the old mugadisho  I wish to see my countery develop again and stand on its feet I don't know what is wrong with my peopleMuna, Bristol And yes, a beautiful city it was, and safe.  Even as an expatriot child living in Mogadishu in the '60s I remember the sense of hope and forward looking optimism that pervaded the nation.  And though Somalis always had a rugged individualism, they have always been very gracious and sociable.  May peace return to that land!Galen Reed, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA My beloved country, Somalia, had become the World's only truly failed state. It is sad. It make you weep when you remember from the goodness and the greatness that we have fallen from to the bottom of the hole we are now languishing. In the 1990s, I thought things could not get any worse. Now they have. It is utterly depressing. Foreign intervention will only make things worse. It will only serve as a recruiting sergeant for the militants. The Ethopian invasion is a case in point. It is not the solution. The only way to salvage the country from this chaos, I firmly believe, is to aid the current Somali Government. Despite all its ills,  it is the only hope we have. To rid the country from the fanatics, the international community should support the security forces. The nascent Somali army are not given any wages or equipment. The government is broke. How can you expect the government forces to fight when they are penniless. You cannot. A fraction of what is being spent in Afganistan will be sufficient.
