Williams / June 30, 2010Section 1: Last re Working HereI have achieved some goals and failed to achieve others during my six months in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as an English teacher.The most significant failure is in not being retained at the school where I taught for most of this past six months. It was my goal upon arrival to do well, and to work through a year at this one school. It even seemed possible to me that I might advance to a supervisory or administrative position as the year progressed.As it is, I have become toxic, radioactive, a leper; not only removed from class overnight, but denied any contact at with students, to the extent that I was not even allowed to grade final exam writing papers.16 commentsRead the full article Standing for Children in Front of The BlackJune 29, 2010Getting in my car to drive to OB to protest The Blacks Dont Feed our Bums mentality, my mind said to me: Hey, nobody will as much as give us remnants of picketers from another day the time of day.But when I walked down Bacon and hit the corner where it intersects with Newport Avenue and saw all the people and picket signs 36 commentsRead the full article Credibility: Darrell Issas ProblemJune 29, 2010by Andy Cohen/ The Politics of FootballIf you would like to know just exactly whats wrong with Washington these days, look no further than Darrell Issa, the Representative of the 49th district in North San Diego County.

Run by George, the blog keeps track of anything to do with our liquid necessity.  Here is a recent sample of Georges work, as Groksurf observed Councilman Carl DeMaios tactics of disruption as he pursues his goal of privatizing water and other city services.by George/ Groksurfs San Diego /Councilmembers Sherri Lightner and Carl DeMaio took advantage of councilmember Marti Emeralds absence at [the June 16] Natural Resources and Culture Committee meeting and threw a wrench into the gears of San Diegos Indirect Potable Reuse/Reservoir Augmentation Demonstration Project (IPR Project).7 commentsRead the full article Prop 19: Imperfect, but worthy of your voteJune 28, 2010At first glance, the November ballot initiative to legalize marijuana in California seems like a no-brainer. It will boost tax revenues. It will lighten the burden on our prison system and allow law enforcement to focus on more serious issues. It will move billions of dollars out of the hands of drug traffickers and into the legitimate economy, creating thousands of jobs. Overall, it will end the prohibition of a relatively harmless drug that has demonstrated medical benefits and is enjoyed by millions of recreational users.46 commentsRead the full article Hands Across the Sands from OB to the WorldJune 28, 2010At least 80 people left the OB Street Fair on Saturday, June 26th, to join the Hands across the sands movement. They literally crossed the beach and linked hands with each other at the oceans edge to form a human wall against any further off-shore oil drilling.  The line stretched from close to the pier all the way past the lifeguard station.The OB event was one of over 800 such happenings across the country, and it was coordinated by Mike James.4 commentsRead the full article Update on the bum sticker controversyJune 25, 2010Heres an update on the whole bum sticker controversy.Wednesday, June 23rd in front of The Black    * I started to write up a summary of what happened the other day in front of The Black but ended up deleting a lot of it. (It had been such a challenging two hours out there in front of a crowd, I almost didnt want to relive it again by blogging about it.  So, heres an abbreviated version.)47 commentsRead the full article I hate that you suffer.

That way, wed have something we could share; wed have something in common and could get along even though we each thought the other to be an idiot, fool, dolt, or just plain stupid and bad mannered.44 commentsRead the full article Fear and Loathing at the BlackJune 24, 2010by Doug PorterThat old law about an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind.

This movement is not about politics; it is about protection of our coastal economies, oceans, marine wildlife, and fishing industry. Nearly 700 sites are planned worldwide.8 commentsRead the full article Its Bash The Homeless Week In San DiegoJune 22, 2010by dougbob / Daily Kos / June 22, 2010Greg Sullivan followed his conscience. He showed up last Saturday to picket a local head shop that was selling anti-homeless stickers. The stickers, which read Welcome to Ocean Beach, Please Dont Feed Our Bums are spoofs of a sticker often seen in national parks that urges people to not feed bears.The OBRag blog noticed these stickers being posted on street signs around the community and ran several stories, one of which pointed out that the stickers were the brainchild of a co-manager at a local retail store.56 commentsRead the full article Opinion on Current Anti-Homeless Sticker by Former Owner of The BlackJune 22, 2010by Steve A/ Special to the OB Rag / June 22, 2010During the seventies, (from 1970 to 1980), I was one of the co-owners of The Black.As of late, via the evening news (I no longer reside in the area), I have been made aware that there has been considerable discussion regarding the homeless or bums in O.B. and that The Black is smack in the middle of a controversy and possibly even on the wrong side of the fence in the matter.26 commentsRead the full article Children, as They Relate to the Lack of News from Afghanistan and PakistanJune 22, 2010Recently, while channel surfing on TV, I happened on a little repartee on the war in Afghanistan and I couldnt help but notice in all the wit and pontification that Pakistan was barely mentioned since were there, too, chasing down al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
