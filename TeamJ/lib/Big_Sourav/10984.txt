Earlier in the hotel pool, which, apparently, became the preferred venue for Amy in Rio, she was caught nearly erased, probably due to excessive drinking. Coincidence or not, the scenes appear on the eve of the first shows that she will do in Brazil.  The success story of the singer in recent years have followed parallel to the scandals and episodes of perceived lack of control - caused by overuse of alcohol and drugs. Several times she failed to complete their presentations. In some presentations, missed the letters, words directed to the audience and therefore had just booed. Even with this risk, the Australian public does not seem worried about a possible "pipe" for Amy.  Camila Vasconcelos, 29, who lives in Brasilia, Sao Paulo is going to give the show the singer. "I do not think she'll make a cardboard. I think it will be a great presentation, "wait.  Although the episode of the balcony, Amy has been struggling to seem more behaved. The singer took advantage of another sunny day in the capital from Rio de Janeiro during the afternoon and stayed in the hotel pool followed by the staff and security guards. Shorts and bikini hopefully-that-falls, and sinuses, also exhibited a bruised right thigh. Caipirinha - cachaca-based drink, lemon and sugar - has been presented to Amy, who, on leaving the pool, had to go to the room supported by security guards. They had to hold their arms to help her climb the stairs.  More discreet and less known, the soul singer who will open the shows in Brazil Amy Winehouse, Janelle Monae, owner of one of the best albums of 2010, sent a message on Twitter to Brazilian fans. "I love you, Brazil! Let's have an incredible moment, "he wrote in Portuguese, at last Thursday. It is the first time that Janelle considered revelation, is present in Brazil. She has also performed with the bands Paramore and No DoubtNo Doubt in the United States.  Amy Winehouse and Janelle Monae will be today at the Pacha club in Florianopolis. Next Monday (10th) and Tuesday (11), the concerts will be at HSBC Arena in Rio de Janeiro. On day 13 (Thursday) they will sing at the Convention Center of Pernambuco in Recife. And the end of the tour will be on November 15 (Saturday) at the Arena Anhembi in Sao Paulo. Until yesterday, there were still tickets available for almost every day of presentation, with values ranging from $ 100 to $ 700.        1 of 8         Amy Winehouse the british singer "drunk and out of the breasts" in Brazil      breeze84 is based in Cairo, Kairo, Egypt,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (36.6%) Italy (21.4%) Brazil (9.9%) United Kingdom (5.8%) 18 other countries (21.8%)           READ MORE: music, Brazilian, Entertainment Culture, Rio de Janeiro, Camila Vasconcelos, British singer, Janelle Monae, entertainment-news, Brazil, No Doubt, jazz, Amy Winehouse, Sao Paulo, Women in jazz, human interest, Brazil Amy Winehouse, Singers   More News From: Rio de Janeiro :  Brazil     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Sao Paulo : Clash between security forces and drug sellers in Brazil : ...
