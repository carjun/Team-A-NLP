A 47-year-old office manager who was unemployed or underemployed for most of 2009 while her welder husband spent three months out of work, Porreca has joined a local taxpayers' group because she's furious at the union's tough tactics in fighting to keep those gains."I've taken a lot of time, read their collective-bargaining agreement - none of it has to do with the education of our kids," said Porreca, whose daughter is a sophomore at Neshaminy High. "It's a gimme, gimme, gimme - all the things they have and things they want to keep. And they don't want to contribute to health care when they're making six-figure salaries. That is unbelievable to me."In many ways, the sprawling Lower Bucks County district, where a protracted contract dispute has played out in the streets and over the airwaves for more than two years, is the tempest-tossed center of a perfect storm sweeping the region, starting with a war of words in New Jersey and spreading to more than a dozen suburban Pennsylvania districts.http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20101220_Teacher...

The woman who is an office manager -- and white collar workers have traditionally been opposed to unionization -- also deserves a comfortable salary and benefits.  Whether she works for a manufacturing company, an insurance company, a small business or a large business, she has many of the same daily responsibilities as a teacher.  SHE TOO SHOULD BE PAID WELL.But rather than fight for herself, she would rather do the grunt work of the aristos and attack someone else who is much more like her than different from her.Tansy Gold, tearin' her hair out in frustration at the stupidityPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topproud2BlibKansan      (1000+ posts)      Mon Dec-20-10 10:12 PMResponse to Reply #314.AmenShe needs to direct her energy at improving her own pay and working conditions instead of taking gains away from workers who have fought for gains.

The average taxpayer simply does not see the value of education and most see us as glorified baby-sitters.  Until we educators begin to attack the anti-teacher, anti-public education meme running through our nation by not supporting Dems in Con clothing, we will keep losing everywhere.  But mostly the country loses, since we won't have life-long educators worth a damn.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topdaleanime      (1000+ posts)      Mon Dec-20-10 12:51 PMResponse to Original message4.Their are worried about a teacher making $97,000....Edited on Mon Dec-20-10 12:53 PM by daleanimepaying their fair share, but not anyone making over $250,000?

They are making teachers targets because they aren't employed so teachers shouldn't be either. I wonder if that office manager has a Master's degree and is able to teach others. I am a retired nurse and had to do teaching occasionally. I found teaching to be exhausting and it required twice the preparation time as the actual teaching time. My hat is off to teachers and I wish they were making even more money. And I don't think $97,652 is a six figure salary. As far as "gimme, gimme, gimme" if you don't ask for and protect your salary and benefits you will get nothing.

We pay part of insurance and all of it at retirement if we want to stay in the group.  But even this is considered too much because it is more than some earn in private sector jobs. It's full attack on anyone working in the public sector, no matter how low the pay and how few (in any) the benefits. Minimum wage paid with tax money is too much. Apparently we are "taking" their money and are completely unproductive.  How easy it was for the right to get workers to declare war on other workers. This class warfare thing may work out very well for the wealthy class.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top1monster      (1000+ posts)      Mon Dec-20-10 05:26 PMResponse to Original message9.Yes, well people will always find a way to covet  what someone else has when they themselvesEdited on Mon Dec-20-10 05:31 PM by 1monsterare having a bad financial time.There is no way any teacher in the public schools in my county will EVER see that kind of money.  Our teachers are paid lower than most of the counties in the state, and Florida has the lowest funded schools in the nation, but there are still those who think teachers are paid too much here.  Those are the people who make a lot more than the rest of us and those who are surviving on next to nothing.The need is not to bring the salaries of the teachers down, but to get jobs for and to pay those hurting a living wage.Teachers earn every single penny of their pay, plus more.  (and on edit, just for bragging rates, our county's schools are the best in the state...)Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topspedtr90      (46 posts)Mon Dec-20-10 07:41 PMResponse to Reply #911.reading about your new governorYou have my sympathy. Mother Jones has an article about Scott's plan to decimate public education.  Given his track record with health care he will do his best to cut costs and not give a damn about the results.I hope parents can see what a disaster for their children a "free market" education system would be. Every state will have some versions of this issue to deal with soon. We have a real battle ahead.http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/12/rick-scott-flor...

He doesn't seem to want to do the job.  He has asked most of Governor Crist's staff to stay on for at least three months because he has yet to hire ANY (that's right, not even ONE) staff members in the two months since he was declared the Governor-elect.  I think Florida is in for even worse times than under Jeb Bush.

This is not a zero-sum game. Shorting teachers does not mean higher salaries for everyone else -- it probably means less success, including lower salaries, for today's students when they enter the work force.

About 2.6% of families and 3.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.0% of those under age 18 and 4.7% of those age 65 or over.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langhorne,_Pennsylvania Salaries range from $26K to $101K.  Weighted more heavily to the top because the teaching staff has a lot of years in, and the higher-salaried people are also lead teachers & dept heads.  The two people making $101K have 38 & 31 years in.http://www.neshaminytaxpayers.com/Certified_Staff.pdf http://www.neshaminytaxpayers.com/Lead%20Teachers.pdf This fight against the high school's funding has evidentally been going on for some time & is being led by a pastor.

A) Because a principal never gave someone an F?   B) Because they don't work directly with kids so their job is so easy any anyone can do it?
