One, a team dancing number led by former Dancing Champions and Olympic Gold Medalists Kristi YamaguchiKristi Yamaguchi and Apollo Anton Ono...then the remaining teams had to recreate an iconic dance from season's past. So it was pretty creative and interesting to watch.   I'm not a fan of the team dance concept, because it just shines a bright shiny light on how bad the fix is in on this show. Of course Apollo's team was going to win. Brandy and Jennifer were on it. You can't expect Bristol Palin to keep up with Cheryl Burke and Lacey Schwimmer and NOT look totally horrible and lost, even though, she kept up pretty well, and I much preferred their cha-cha to that mess the other team did.   Let's talk about the individual dances. I liked revisiting the 'iconic' ones from season's past.   Kyle Massey and Lacey Schwimmer: Mel B's Paso Doble Kyle did a great job with this dance! I'm starting to come around with this kid. His feet are so much better than they used to be, and I think it's clicking for him. Posture is still the worst, but it's improving. Lacey did a good job, unexpectedly, in reworking the dance. She's not the best choreographer, but she really did a good job at this particular dance. Safe another week...   Kurt WarnerKurt Warner and Anna Trebunskaya: Emmitt SmithEmmitt Smith's Tango Well first off, let's all recognize that Emmitt was probably a weeee bit overrated compared to the dancing we've seen since his season. That being said, Kurt really did a spectacular job with it. I noticed how good his feet were last night. I think Anna's trying to not make him look so "FrankenWarner" out there, so that's why he looked a little squatty last night, and Len pointed that out. His head jutting forward doesn't bother me so much, because I think it's over compensating for the height difference and lack of mobility in his back. I'm not sure how to call Kurt this week. I think he might be safe, but I'm 0/3 right now, so he's probably going home.   Bristol Palin and Mark Ballas: Kelly OsbourneKelly Osbourne's Viennese Waltz For the love of everything holy Mark, FIX HER SHOULDERS! This girl could be a contender if she would just stand up straight! She has beautiful arms and feet, but watching her dance with her shoulders and hips too far forward negates everything good.If you have no idea what I'm talking about, look at Jennifer & Brandy's backs compared to Bristol's. They have nice arches with their shoulder's over their hips. Bristol is ramrod straight and sometimes leans forward. But it was a good dance. I think like Kyle, Bristol has clicked finally and she's settling in to dancing a little bit. But please, if you're reading this Mark, and of course you are...FIX HER SHOULDERS!  Rick FoxRick Fox and Cheryl Burke: Helio Castoneves' Quickstep Cheryl Burke is a genius. There is a reason she's in the 'iconic dances' three times, and that's because she knows how to hide flaws, and bring out the best in her partners. because Rick Fox stinks. He really does, and he'll probably be the last guy standing because of Cheryl's genius. That and his smile seems to erase the judges brains because I don't know about you, but I watched 90 seconds of the Incredible Hulk skipping around. This was awarded 9's.   Brandy and Maksim Chmerkovsky - Gilles Marini's Foxtrot Were you watching Brandy's feet this week? Ha! Told ya they were horrible! But Maks, like Cheryl is in the business of miracles, so unless you're looking for it, you'll miss it. It's because of those hooves of hers she blew the steps infront of the judges, but Maks is so good at making everything above the waist absolutely perfect you forget he's dancing with a horse.   Jennifer GreyJennifer Grey and Derek HoughDerek Hough - Drew Lachey's Tango Baby's falling apart, y'all... she needs some spare parts if she's going to survive. I think they need to calm down and relax a bit. She has the best total package of anyone on the show, save the timing issues, and if they just quit trying to make her a 25 year old, they're going to win. This was a beautiful dance. She really does struggle with timing, though. It comes out in the Latin dances especially. I'm not even sure why we're here. It's a Jennifer Grey and Brandy finale, it has been since the 3rd week, so really the battle here is for 3rd place. Again, Bristol should probably go home, but it's election day, so she won't. I'm going with Warner again this week. What did you think of the competition?
