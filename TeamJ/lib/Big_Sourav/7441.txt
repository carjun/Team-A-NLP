The bank had to scramble, go out and find it somewhere before they could make good delivery.Rickards expects the world will eventually go to a gold standard-backed currency.To me, the big issue is, is it going to be intelligent or is it going to be ugly? Rickards says. Is it going to be something we think about, we have a public debate, hearing in Congress  we give some thought to, and then, over time  we do it in stages so that markets can adjust.Unfortunately, says Rickards, were on the other path, ignoring the issue and acting as if gold plays no role in finance, which, of course, it does, keep printing money until almost spontaneous collapse of the dollar and then, in the midst of chaos, on an emergency basis, have the president announce that were back on the gold standard.Rickards' advice? Get your gold out now before other banks begin following suit.Thestreet.com reports that gold prices popped after President Barack Obama's agreement to extend Bush-era tax cuts fueled investors concerns that the move would increase U.S. deficit problems and weaken the dollar.source:http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/Swiss-Bank-Refuses-...

Financier is a synonym of scam.  The bursting of the financial bubble proved it.  This example is a proverbial double ended scam and I have no doubt this Swiss Bank played the same game with others.  A statement of assets in the vault means nothing. The only real gold is what you own and possess and have assayed. Financiers have exploited naivety for centuries.

What's even more ridiculous is the people holding these certificates end up paying 'storage costs' on gold that doesn't really exist except on a piece of paper. When push comes to shove if a particular person yells loud enough about seeing 'his gold' they can trot out enough to show him 'his gold' but if every holder of a gold certificate demanded to see their gold the whole scheme would collapse. Another scam to screw the little guys as brought to by the financial elite roaches of this world.

An industry insider "whistle blower" has come forward with "smoking gun" evidence that major financial institutions have been openly and blatantly manipulating the price of gold and silver.  But so far those who are supposed to be regulating these firms have been sitting back and doing nothing about it.Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/11-examples-of-recent-co... It has also now come out that most "gold" that is traded on the markets is not backed by the actual metal itself.  For years, most people have assumed that the London Bullion Market Association, the world's largest gold market, had actual gold to back up the massive "gold deposits" at the major LBMA banks.  But that is not the truth at all.  Industry insiders are now revealing that LBMA banks actually have approximately a hundred times more gold deposits than actual gold bullion.  When most people think they are buying gold what they are actually buying is pieces of paper that say that they own gold.  Meanwhile they are being charged huge storage fees to store the gold.
