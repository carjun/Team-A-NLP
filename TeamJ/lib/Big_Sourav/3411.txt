The aide did not provide details concerning the volume of threats, how much have they increased or whether they are being referred to the authorities.  A different Palin aide, Rebecca Mansour, told USA Today that the increase in threats since Saturday has been "incredible."   "There has been an incredible increase in death threats against Gov. Palin since the tragedy in Arizona, since she's been accused of having the blood of those victims on her hands," she said. "When you start to accuse people of having the blood of innocent people on their hands, it incites violence."   Almost immediately after the Saturday shootings, critics drew a connection between the attack and a map released by Palin that used crosshairs to spotlight 20 House Democrats she wanted to see defeated in the midterm elections. One of them was Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a victim in Saturday's tragedy.   There is no evidence that alleged shooter Jared Loughner was inspired by Palin or had seen the target map. While partisans on both sides have worked to tie Loughner to their political opposition, it appears he is a young man with a loose grip on reality and muddled politics far outside the mainstream.   On Wednesday, Palin responded to the criticism in a video in which she accused the media of "blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence that they purport to condemn." She was criticized by Jewish groups for her use of the phrase blood libel, which has been used to describe false claims that Jews killed Christian children to use their blood for cooking and religious rituals. The Daily Caller reported that dozens of Twitter users called for Palin's death in the wake of the Tucson attack.

Maybe in 2012 we will read about "Cult-leader Sarah Palin" and her followers, the dregs of what was once known as the Tea Party. Of course, as perpetual victims, they blame the lame-stream media for their decline. It seems that those in the diabolical left-wing media conspiracy against her finally lost interest in her every bout of flatulence...

Why is it that while not all Republicans are homophobes, all homophobes are Republicans?     Reply to this comment           by jerzyrhodes January 14, 2011 1:44 AM EST  Gee, isn't this the same approach to logic used by the Arizona gunman?                         by mick7744 January 14, 2011 12:45 AM EST  Now people are calling it "THE PALIN MASSACRE"How very unfair...but how ironically just!Poor Sarah...What's a victim to do? There's never a Reichstag around to burn when you really need one, so I predict we can look forward to an UNsuccessful attempt on the life of Her Divaness or one of her dysfunctional family members.Of course, if that doesn't swing enough sympathy her way...one of them will have to go. I wonder who Sarah will choose?Bristol's caused her a lot of trouble with one illegitimate child or another and she didn't win that dancing show after all...but naw...she can't deprive both her grandchildren of their mother."Oh Todd..."     Reply to this comment           by mick7744 January 14, 2011 1:01 AM EST  A shaken Sarah Palin told reporters, "I didn't see the shooter's face, but he was wearing an Obama sweatshirt and kept shouting Yes we can"                      by michaelamsterdam January 14, 2011 3:21 AM EST  To date, Palin has not discused her husband's shooting with the police or the FBI on the advice of her attornys, but a highly placed member of her staff confirmed that a memorial after-school TV movie, "Sarah Palin's Heartbreak" is planned, and that negitations for a new TLC reality show, "Sarah Palin...Single Again" are proceeding.

But Palin won't report them to the authorities? Why ever could that be? A man was just arrested for threatening to kill Democatic Rep. McDermott, he was reported, we know that is true. A Democratic congresswoman and a whole group of her supporters was just shot, we know that is true. We know that Tea Party Republicans are constantly using violent rhetoric and images and carrying guns and Democrats are not. We know that is true. What we certainly are not sure of is that it's true that Sarah Palin is suddenly receiving an "incredible" number of death threats. There is no truth in these people.

Even after all those people lost their lives and a congresswoman is fighting for her life, Sarah is the victim. Insane.                         by kchibrown January 14, 2011 12:25 AM EST  Now maybe she will get off our airwaves and let me enjoy televsion, she is done and should have been after the election, she showed her real nature of the beast and it will stick to her like crazy glue good riddence to an annoying person with super low self esteem and she has the nerve to belittle everyone she encounters if she does not feel at ease with them or even opposes her stupid comprehension maybe the best thing she could have said was nothing!

Reply to this comment            by danmilburn January 13, 2011 10:59 PM EST  There are many many prominent public figures ranging from political circles to that of Hollywood figures that could have come forward with their own personal comments regarding the shooting. What delusions of grandurious behavior prompted her to produce an 8-minute message to America and to have her obviously reading the lines on TV. Makes you wonder what her perception of how America views her is going through her mind. She was acting like it was an audition for Presidential speeches 101. I was actually embarrassed for her. What an attention *****. Hell, Jimmy, George jr, George sr, Nancy Reagan, they didn't jump in front of a camera. Then she choked further by mentioning a "blood liable". That will sure as hell **** of every Jew in the world. In case you don't know what a "blood liable" was it was fiction, it it didn't happen. Anti semantics (jew haters) spread the lies that the Jews killed Christian children and made mautza )sp) out of their blood. I think Sara Palin should be a celebrity like a white Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton. She should find a cause like the Grizzly Bear club and stick to it. But a counterfeit Presidential address is just way out there on the very edge of egotistical act ill conceived attention getter!

When you oppose the government, it is no less than treason... Their republican allies should be banned as well.     Reply to this comment           by kchibrown January 14, 2011 12:35 AM EST  Seriously, you are right on the money! What you think now she has put her foot in her mouth ,I think the repeblicans will disconnect from her now to distance their selves from her temper tamtrum even better how about the tea party go against her wow this get better with thought watch it unfold. But seriouly we should ban them they are morden day malitia group with a american household name taxed enough already!                         by skponggol January 13, 2011 10:05 PM EST  Like their German predecessors on the eve of Kristallnacht and Hutu predecessors on the eve of Rwandan Genocide, the American lamestream media like CBS has maunfactured a blood libel against the Palin family and the Tea-partiers.After blaming and smearing the Sarah Palin for the Arizona killing, American lamestream media has succeeded in their long-cherished obsession of mobilising a hit squad to assasinate the Palin family:http://www.facebook.com/pages/I-hate-it-when-I-wake-up-and-Sarah-Palin-is-still-alive/129929197021040?v=wallhttp://vimeo.com/18733744http://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/hate-filled-crackpots-blame-sarah-palin-glenn-beck-for-violence-at-oakland-rally-in-support-of-tucson-victims-video/Like their German and Hutu predecessors, American lamestream media are on the thresold of achieving their long-held dream of exterminating the Palin family, especially Trig whom they share an intense hatred and contempt with their German and Hutu predecessors.
