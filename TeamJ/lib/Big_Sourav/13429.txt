But their problems followed them to Texas.Leah Richardson saw it first-hand back in September, when she called police to report Nettles allegedly choked her and threatened to kill her family."He came up and that's when attacked us, and told me he was going to throw me over the railing,"  she recalled.All of this was on their mind Tuesday, when Carter's parents got a frantic call from their daughter saying that Nettles had hurt her again."She said she was scared to leave," Willie Richardson recalled. "She said, 'Daddy, I think he's outside.' I said, 'OK, wait for the police to come, and I'm on my way and I'll come and get you.'"But by the time they arrived at Kimberly's apartment, it was already too late."My wife turned the doorknob  and pushed the door open, and that's when it was obvious that it had already occurred," Willie Richardson said.They saw Officer Jillian Smith lying in a pool of blood and shattered glass.They later learned that their daughter was shot in a bedroom of her apartment, and their 11-year-old granddaughter Ciani was protected by the police officer."When [Nettles] walked in and had his gun, the officer just immediately put herself in front of Ciani... and he started shooting," Leah Richardson said.Nettles  a convicted child rapist with a troubled past  was already out on bond for the alleged assault to Carter's mother.The only question this family has left is "Why?""Frankly, I think he should have been in jail," the victim's father said. "I don't understand how this guy got so many chances. It's not normal to get that many chances with those serious offenses like that."E-mail ccivale@wfaa.comShare this article:33 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Arlington community pays tribute to women killed by gunmanNext article Parents of slain Arlington woman say gunman threatened them, tooTo add a comment, please register or login.Add another commentLeave your comment1000 characters remainingSubmitWe welcome your comments on this story's topic.

There are some questions raised here. The first is have they ever dropped charges against him? Next, if so why was he still roaming the streets if he was already a convicted child rapist? A big question is why was she even with him in the first place if he had this past? Why would she even consider being with a man who had done what he was convicted of while she had her own child being exposed to that lifestyle? Lastly, with all that what are our courts thinking letting animals like him roam freely? Who is really imprisoned here the criminals or the public? Where do our judeges and lawyers get their degrees from Walmart, Target, or Kmart? The system needs to pull their heads out and stop bleeding for the criminals and start sticking up for the public. I know some people accused are innocent but letting criminals go on bail or because of a technicality is wrong.58162159Flag this commentfreddya said on January 1, 2011 at 4:11 AMshe had enough time todo something other than what she did , the parents knew and tried to warn ms carter but she didnt get the wake up call until it was to late , i also feel that the carter family could have warned the apd prior to them heading over to check on their daughter about mr nettles previous history and that way there could have been more officers dispatched to the location , i feel that ms carters family has to share the blame in this crime ,to me there were many victimes in this crime officer smith and her family , ms carters daughter  the  11 yr old  ,and  mr nettles children thats it , and if ms carter would have survived the killiongs i have one question to her why did you leave your child in harms way ?58158447Flag this commentwazabrit said on January 1, 2011 at 12:46 AMThe problem is, is that the law doesn't take these domestic abuse cases seriously, and then when they do in many cases the woman withdraws the complaint because of fear of reprisal or a misplaced sense of love or loyalty.Here's some advice to you girls out there. If a man raises his hand to you EVEN ONCE then leave his sorry behind. 'cus if he does it that first time, it is guaranteed it will happen again.58156593Flag this commentinfo269883444938 said on December 31, 2010 at 10:13 PMA few years ago my sister was with a guy that hit her and gave her a black eye. She filed a restraining order but he showed up again threatening to kill her. My family doesn't put up witht that stuff. My dad and I found him out one night and beat him until he couldn't stand. We told him if he ever came around my sister or my family again then we wouldn't hesitate to drop him in a wood chipper. He never came around again. I know it may not work in every situation but families need to be proactive and take care of each other. I'm not going to sit back and wait of some guy to kill my sister then cry about it afterwards..58154157Flag this commentrjs123 said on December 31, 2010 at 3:55 PMi would be buying a shootgun loading it with buckshot and hope they guy would force his way throught the door so i could take of the problem foir good.58146452Flag this commentdannym said on December 31, 2010 at 3:47 PMGood points Honeymoon. One violent act from a guy with past multiple offences on my child grown or not and I would AT LEAST be moving them in with me. The police would be informed about the move and I would hope that if he came by my house in a violent threatening manner I would be ready to deal with it as I called 9-11. I would NOT allow him to get to my daughter and granddaughter at ANY cost.58146247Flag this commenthoneymoon said on December 31, 2010 at 3:17 PMFist of all a child should not be around a sex offender, sencond, Kimberly's father should have purchased a gun for his daughter or allow her to move with her family, and last, why was this guy not in jail?  Family violence is serious and should stop!58145483Flag this commentdanta said on December 31, 2010 at 2:28 PMDannym, good comments, but there should have been one break given to this slime, around the area of the neck. The court system have been pummeled so much with jailing innocents, that they forget about the innocents hurt when they don't jail the guilty. Plenty of rules about how to set bail, few on how to revoke.58143856Flag this commentdannym said on December 31, 2010 at 1:36 PMA person should do whatever they have to do to protect their families. Of course! Sometimes a person is in a situation where you must act NOW. This had been building for a long time it looks like and finally came to a head. She needed to be removed from this a long time ago. Especially with a kid. The best answer is to weed the criminal element out one at a time. Violent behavior against innocent people will be dealt with swiftly and harshly BEFORE it gets to this point.58142336Flag this commentgetitright2 said on December 31, 2010 at 12:51 PMwhy people always want to point fingers at the system...  Take care of your self .  If I knew someone hurt my family then told them he was gong to kill them... Well  theres no waiting for "something" to work.  I'm going to take care of the issue. dont point fingers.58140689Flag this commentsusieeq said on December 31, 2010 at 12:46 PMWell everyone should know that if the court system or if she had a protection order... ITS NOT WORTH THE PAPER ITS WRITTEN ON!I had one on my now ex... and its was worth nothing,,, hope his next girlfriend or wife has better luck,,, what's even a topper is he's in a industry that only his license can be taken away if convicted... And believe me he or they are smarter they know how to bet the law,, boy you should have seen how he played the victim when the cops should up... men stick together......58140494Flag this commenttruetexan said on December 31, 2010 at 12:04 PMIf this had been my daughter and grandchild, I would have moved to another state no matter if I lost everything.  Not kidding when I say that.  Either that or after the threat to the parents of the daughter, I would surely have known this criminal at anytime could kill my daughter and grandchild no matter who believed it.  I agree with one poster. It would have been him or me as this guy obviously had no stops when it comes to acting out his threats.  He should never have been out of jail or prison. These type of people should never be paroled. They are everywhere. Don't allow violent criminals out on parole.  They can't harm anyone if they are locked up. Why was he out? And why wasn't someone monitoring this guy if he was a sex offender? For goodness sake, why didn't his parole officer know he was around an 11 yr old?58138926Flag this commentimjustsayin84 said on December 31, 2010 at 12:03 PM@dallasgrump: the decade ended dec 31, 2009... we are one year into a new decade.58138894Flag this commentdallasgrump said on December 31, 2010 at 11:07 AMdannym, great comment although this is the last day of this decade.58136909Flag this commentbjcarlson62 said on December 31, 2010 at 11:05 AMThis young woman is the very defenition of a hero.

Are they any less violent than what he did? Both are a danger to society and should be dealt with the same. Violent crime is driving law abiding citizens to the breaking point. Let a couple of mall bombings or car bombings occur in the metroplex and see how long decent people would stand for it. The populace would be outraged and would be up in arms. It wouldn't be allowed to continue. This shouldn't be allowed to continue either. No more breaks for violent criminals. They get no second chances.58136789Flag this commentbware said on December 31, 2010 at 10:42 AMThis is the kind of dirtbag the Castle Law was written for.

We the people have to take a stand against varmints like Nettles.58135943Flag this commentdannym said on December 31, 2010 at 10:25 AMLaw abiding decent people are OVERLY FED UP with out of control crime. Especially crimes where innocent people are killed. The fear must be put on the criminal and taken off the ordinary citizen. No more leniency PERIOD. Violent crime is down in many major cities? It's STILL too high and dangerous out on the streets. This is the only example WE and the PD should need to see. Our grandkids will see a much more violent life if WE do not nip this in the bud THIS decade.58135419Flag this commentbrickhouse said on December 31, 2010 at 10:25 AM"There was a time that he put the gun in her mouth and he said he was going to blow her brains out," said Leah Richardson, Carter's stepmother.  THAT is when her FATHER should have stepped in and taken care of the situation.  Really, Mrs. Richardson, just WHAT IN THE H E L L did you THINK was going to happen?!?!   How did you think this was going to play out, or did you even care?  Obviously sitting on your hands didn't help save your daughter's life.  DOING something besides calling the police would have saved her, but apparently you chose to do nothing.  With scum like him, you have to think elimination, at all costs.  1000 ways-pick one!58135412Flag this commentdannym said on December 31, 2010 at 10:06 AMThis is so very tragic and heartbreaking in every way. I do not understand how this man was legally allowed to be around the 11 year old in the first place. Was he not a sex offender? Could the woman not leave when he is gone from the house?  Take what you can and get the heck out? Drive to the nearest police station and tell them you and the child could be killed if you remain there? She need separation AND protection. It had gotten to a point she could no longer handle herself. And why was this guy roaming the streets. He could have killed anyone for looking at him wrong since he was that violent?  We now know the outcome of all this and it could have likely all been avoided. So many questions.58134627Flag this commentsreagle2 said on December 31, 2010 at 10:00 AMWFAA what you should be doing is honoring the victims here PLEASE TAKE THIS MORON'S PHOTO OFF OF THE STORY58134368Flag this commentsshields said on December 31, 2010 at 9:58 AMjbard....shame on you.

More FATHERS need to stand UP for their daughters when situations like this arise.  The risk is worth the payoff.  My father rescued my sister from a punk biker that was knocking her around~the punk now walks with a cane and is lucky to be breathing air.  STAND UP, FATHERS!  Don't rely on the cops to save your daughter's life!!!  (In the 80's, my dad blew up the car of a known drug dealer as a warning.  That's old school justice at it's finest, delivered by a Vietnam vet who showed considerable restraint.)58134157Flag this commentbrickhouse said on December 31, 2010 at 9:36 AMAs a father,you have to ask yourself~is taking OUT the man who you KNOW is eventually going to k i ll your daughter worth giving up your life?  If you aren't willing to give your life for your daughter, are you willing to at least TRY to devise a plan to get away with eliminating scum like Nettles?  It's not that hard to do, if you know the right people.  I once devised a plan to send my evil S-I-L on a trip to the heart of Mexico and have her dumped there...completely legal and with her consent.  All except the dumping part.   Still alive, but with no way out.58133246Flag this commentjack3540 said on December 31, 2010 at 9:04 AMwomen dont want to leave the man because they have no confidence in themselves.  I am sure she was pulling him along and she was more scared to lose him than of him.  The courts have their hands full and until they say to heck with jails being overcrowded, they will continue to walk the streets.  lets see here....a guy caught with some marijuana VS. the guy hitting a woman?  The marijuana guy gets jail time while the other guy is sent to DV classes and beats up the woman again.  Get rid of the judges and fill up the jails and tents like Arizona Sheriff did.58131767Flag this commentsonnee said on December 31, 2010 at 8:41 AM@bboop - very well stated.58130917Flag this commentsadiemae1 said on December 31, 2010 at 8:37 AMjbrad, this woman was terrified to leave him, these animals put such fear into these women and as you see the outcome is so often the same.

When you are terrorized by a man and call the police over and over and yet are not protected and the guy is willing to follow across the country, just HOW do you expect to get free?  How many friends, neighbors, etc. had the nerve to tell this man what he was doing was WRONG, not just passing judgment on the woman?  I'd bet NONE, no just leave it to the victim.  Even Psychologists rarely are brave enough to confront these men.  Women in this country want to believe they are equal and free, that is far from the truth especially in the courts.  Women and children in this country are throw-away toys for men in every way.  Men control the police, the courts, the jobs, and especially the women.  There is NO "justice", only "JUST US".58130254Flag this commentsonnee said on December 31, 2010 at 7:27 AMThere really should be a special place for these sorry, little, weasel guys who beat up women and children.

Why was she still seeing him? I think the police are not to blame because he was not in jail. Now, because of this a poor officer is killed over a domestic dispute? Shameful for the family to point the finger at the cops. It's a loss for both sides.58122821Flag this comment123Next 15 CommentsSign OutProfileMobileRSS FeedsSpecial OffersNewslettersTwitterFacebookCrime VideoArizona congresswoman still sedated after assassin's attack Lawmakers, aides urged to take safety precautions  Funeral for Arlington shooting victim Kimberly Carter Reaction to Rep.
