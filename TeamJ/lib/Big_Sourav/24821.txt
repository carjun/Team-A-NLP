I am against these gutless, tough-talking conservative "representatives" and their glad handlers who come up with these tough talk catch phrases that magically is repeated by every conservative commentator in seconds...tough talk coming from someone who never served this country.  Hey NRA Leadership! You can still have "balls"  you can still be "manly" if you come forward, denounce this SENSELESS attack on innocent American citizens and pledging to help draft legislation that helps keep weapons out of the hands of crazy right and left-fringe nut-cases who take these catch phrases to heart AND ACT ON THEM.Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadwayne lapierre is probably in his bunker hidingspanoneJan-09-11 02:01 PM#1I have no doubt they will condemn it.

They are not condemning the gunman. They are not condemning the fact that a mentally ill military reject managed to legally purchase a gun.

Mind you... I'm speaking as a resident of one of the most anti-gun states in the country; as such, I/we have our work cut out for us, and we've been doing pretty good as of late.Gov. Deval Patricks 1 gun a month plan never made it to the floor, as did his legislation that would have resulted in the closure of many gun clubs/ranges.As far as the NRA is concerned?Well, at the state level they haven't exactly been helpful in MA. GOAL has done all the footwork and knocking on doors there. We'd be seriously fucked if not for their effort.Yeah... in some instances (the NRA), they've gone over the top in later years, but, they do get things done which is what I'm paying them for (at least at the federal level).If they could get rid/oust some of the lunatic shriekers like LaPierre, Nugent, etc, it would help public opinion some (well... maybe).No organized effort is without it's faults (even my union, which has endorsed Republican candidates in the past).K-Kitty? what's not to like?She's hot... she's happening... she get's some people here panties all knotted up in their ass crack.My Mossberg 500...And my K-Kitty t shirt... just like this one...
