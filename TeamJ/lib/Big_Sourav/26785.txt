So many young lives have been undermined and undervalued by negative and/or abusive actions of someone who was held a position of influence, trust, or respect over those lives.  Irrespective of the position; whether parent, teacher, priest or youth services official, the damage caused to the victim of the betrayal; is such that it is a life altering, long term affliction that many don't have the strength to share, let alone deal with.   This is the story of getting even and doing so by gaining the Win - Win position of "I'm Sorry!" over "I Forgive You!"  This is Not in every respect the script to use in seeking direct resolution; this is merely an illustration of a factual event that carried many wasted years of lost potential, regret, guilt, shame and pain.  We all deal with things differently, but if you grow strong of heart and of honesty; then you will be able to use this method of dealing with what I affectionately refer to as Shame Management.  The greatest part of that process is; Putting all the cards of truth, face up on the table, so that the entire picture can be gauged by both parties.  Good Luck. To move on; be brutally honest and demand the same from the party who wronged you!  This is: Truth's Lament.... Thank you.. *Pearldiver*  Copyright2010 Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rights reserved. How Many have not ever reached their greatness as a result of being held back by the deeds and attitudes of others?The Only Positive Thing About Betrayal Is That You Can Move On Without The Negative Parties In Your Life.It takes a special self loveTo forgive one whoWith clear intent diddestroyA really gifted lifeHistory does not merelycover up The deed with graceful ageHistory demands that in timeThe truth is stated.Take the truth, if you canLook at the cost of yourhistory madeTake the truth, if you canIt moves, this history, itmovesIn a clockwise motionAlways away from you in timeThough it never detractsfrom truth  A friend asked me if genesmade some mothers and daughters lieWith malice and carelessdisregard, for simple factsIt seemed this chance totalk was a welcome oneAs neither of us couldcompromise the truth, nor even try So in response to missinganswers from the past. We shared the issue and thisopportunity, to ask why By Not Allowing Yourself To Buy Into the Betrayal or the Other Person's Negativity; Your Life Will Keep It's Positive Color. If I could understand mycrimeThen I would understand the selfimposed walls That stand strongly built aroundthis heart To provide a special soulwith some defense From this cell I have to askmyself each yearWhy those that I cared for, betrayedthe life, of an honest caring manIf I could offer some lighton this issueThen I would have to say,that of family choices, sadly I had noneI have such real strength within,that which they have notBut I do not mean having thepower to despise and yet alone, be happy If I could offer somethingmore on this issueThen I would have to say,that of regret bar lost time, gladly I have noneI have to ask myself why amother would lieKnowing that her liedestroyed the future of her greatest doting childIf I could ask for reasonson such an issueThen I would have to ask herwhy she would seek solace, within haunting guilt I have to ask the value ofone whom the word sorry avoidsBecause such remorse wouldsurely break any real mothers heartIf I could gain advice onthisThen I would understand howto forgive her without such sickening pity felt I have to understand whyinnocence was so stolenKnowingly sacrificed with alie to cover, yet other lies and more shameIf I could know, then Icould explainThen those whom I love wouldknow, that such lies of me can cause no pain I have to ask a daughter whyanother mother wouldThen I could explain to thisfathers son why she tried to give us both awayIf I could guess why she showedsuch madnessThen I would have to saythat the sickness was not mine, to own by proxy deeds I need to know how deeplyshe did plant her hateBecause those facts may saveanother soul, perhaps one as wretched as I wasIf I could direct theprivilege of shame to a mother in such need Then I would have to say;   Lord please forgive thisproxy of motherhood And pass on all the strengththat I have gainedFrom having lived my life socruelly with her liesRefusing to flinch from all thissenseless pain   It takes a special self love,to forgive one who With clear intent did destroya really gifted life If I could offer a factualobservation, it may be That history does not merelycover up the deed with graceful age Rather, history demands thatin time, the whole truth is stated.

That was great driving mate! First and fastest cab off the rank.. hahaha pressed publish and there your welcome smile was! So Thanks for taking the time and for your support Hammer. You Take Care... Umm I don't think I'd keep up in the 100mtrs though... phew!Whikat2 months ago Hi Pearldiver,Hmm, now you got me thinking. I apologize for my ignorance, and I will have to reread this poem over, possibly many times until I "get it"  I have only perceived that a man is angry and feels betrayed by some woman, possibly a mother or the mother of his children. I probably do not understand because in my 40 something years of my life, I have concluded that "truth" and "lies" seem to be a matter of perception in each individual. Because we do not see and sometimes fully understand, what another person's soul is searching for. Two souls collide, both are seeking the opposite of what they perceive is given to them by the other. I shall ponder on your poem some more, to see if I can understand the meaning that you have intended to express. Thank you for getting my brain all fired up and working this morning. :-)Pearldiver2 months ago Hi Whikat, thanks for reading this work. If I have left you deep in thought, then I have written a really good poem! There is no perception here in regard to truth or lies, as the events within this factually resulted in a sequence of events that in themselves identified the issues and subsequently the 'lies' referred to.This is a poem about forgiving... it is not about anger, though I have constructed the poem to show that anger had been at one stage present. This is a very Deep poem, yet it states exactly the desired result.This poem can apply to many circumstances... it was not written to be specific of my own. Perhaps it is good enough to lead you in a different state of pondering, each time you read it... I hope so.. Take Care.Whikat2 months ago Yes, Pearl diver ponder I shall. Although, I shall remain to respectfully disagree about truth and lies as not being a perspective. When I took college Psychology, we read about a research report that involved abused and or neglected children. Interestingly, the abused or neglected children had siblings that were raised in the exact same home with the exact same parents or parent. The abused child described their parent/parents as abusive, cruel and heartless, while their sibling described the same people as kind, warm and loving parent/parents.Now, which child is lying? Could it be the one who felt abused, and neglected, the one who noticed every mistake and every negative trait of the parent or parents, or could it be the sibling, who felt no abuse or neglect and chose only to feel and see the good and positive traits of the parent or parents? Perhaps, both children were telling the truth as to how they felt and witnessed the events in their lives.The research project was done on hundreds of households with two or more children living in the same home with the same parent/parents; one child reported being abused, while the other child or children denied any abuse or neglect. It was very fascinating to see how one person's "truth" was another person's "lies" based on feelings and perception. I will keep pondering your deep poem and possibly view it from different angles. I would sure like to hope that my past college studies have not misguided my perception. :-) Take Care and thank you for a different perspective.always exploring2 months ago Well it appears to me that you are reminding your mother of the hurt felt in the past, due to lies told. Great writing.CheersPearldiver2 months ago Oh Whikat.... You completely miss the entire theme! If you had read the introduction.. then you would have the Actual context of the poem, the issues that it relates to and the perspective that the author uses to bridge the two!If I was however to detract from this work and comment on the 'issue' that you have brought into your assessment of it; then I would to say:Consider the 'lies' covered up by those who taught a generation that no death camps existed in WW2 and the perspective of those who suffered in enforced silence.Consider the textbook perspective on worldwide experiments that the 'experts' in Psychology and Psychiatry conducted during the 70s, when they subjected teenage lab-rats, committed by their parents to mental institutions on the pretense that they did not conform. Consider that from the perspective of the 'patients' who were used against their personal wishes, in shock 'therapy' experiments, so that textbooks for students could be written in a 'detached' perspective. Sit down and watch a movie that dealt with that reality accurately and perfectly! It's called 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest.'This poem is a poem of hope.. that such things can be forgiven... It is written, as with all my poems... well researched, honestly, from the heart and in a perspective that calls for readers who are able to Never fit creative others into Box-like categories or perspectives! I believe I made that point at the beginning of the poem.  Take Care.Pearldiver2 months ago Hi Always Exploring, thanks for reading this work. As I have explained.... All that I am doing is writing a poem per the introduction. However, I'm sure that there are many parents and their children to whom these words really do relate!  In that case then if the hat fits then it applies doesn't it? This is a sensitive subject and for a writer has called for equally emotive words. Cheers Take Care.MartieCoetser2 months ago Is it not the most wonderful opportunity we have in this life: We can always, anytime, walk away...Great writing, exposing deep thoughts.Take care!Pearldiver2 months ago Hello Martie, Thanks for reading this work and your excellent comment... it is an opportunity to be brutally honest and walk away with purpose! Deep thoughts indeed. Cheers Martie.. hope all is well with you.. Take Care.travelespresso2 months ago Hello PD.  This is very powerful.  After a couple of readings I'm left somewhat perplexed though - I thought I "got" what you were saying but after re-reading the balance moved and I wasn't at all sure.  A strong poem and very thought provoking.Pearldiver2 months ago Hi TE, thanks for taking the time to read this poem and get perplexed hahaha.. Don't be perplexed; simply as the path appears to have shifted... it never really shifted at all from the introduction... Or did it?  Take Care.travelespresso2 months ago Maybe shifting the axis wasn't your intention PD but that's what happened in my mind upon re-reading and it happened again when I read it this morning.  Powerful writing.  You have such a gift PD.Pearldiver2 months ago Hello TE, hahaha.. do you think perhaps that I might have unwittingly created something to ensure repeat reading traffic? Thank you very much though for your compliments TE, it is a powerful subject that required powerful words to do justice to the subject. Seems the desired effect that I hoped for has been achieved.. ummm Take Care Kiwi.2uesday5 weeks ago Poetry that forces you to stop and think (that is good) and also to question too, have I got the concept of it. The conclusion I came to was, if I have n't then it may be that I am not at a point in my life when I am up to understanding poet's who write at a higher level than me. Or maybe my eyes are 'blurred ' by a different life experiences and I see my own version and interpretation.I am hoping you do not mind such comments, if you do I do not mind you using the delete forever. I find the images you use as interesting as the words, the page is beautifully set out.Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi 2uesday, thank for reading this work and for your excellent comment. You have interpreted the poem perfectly, as it has asked you to look at your life experiences and consider them. So yes, if that has meant that it has lead you towards stopping and thinking enough to question the concept has not eluded you. You are a good poet 2uesday and you should never limited that talent by not reading or feeling that you can't understand the different genres of poetry. I have only been writing poetry for 1 year and prior to that thought the same as you... The change came from reading poets who I had never heard of before and thus they clearly wrote at 'a higher level' than me... hahaha... This is also an angry poem as could be expected from a confrontation in which guns and swords were left at the door! Believe in you 2uesday.. I do.. and could never delete you forever! Thanks again for calling by..
