Theres nothing like the morning after a big election. If youve bothered with the media today, theyre saying that there was a GOP tidal wave that swept the House last night.

Thats my way of saying that the opinions expressed in this article are nobodys but my own. As a group, we are most divided over Proposition D with some of our friends.

I talked with literally thousands of new and infrequent voters over the phone and knocked on hundreds of doors in neighborhood that usually get taken for granted during electoral campaigns. Multiply those numbers by the dozens of volunteer and paid campaigners who have opted to follow the path less traveled and what emerges is a campaign strategy full of possibilities not included in the conventional approaches to electioneering.1 commentRead the full article Public School Races : Proposition J, School Board SeatsOctober 20, 2010OB RAG Local Elections Coverage  Part 3I mailed in my ballot yesterday. As part of my research in this series (well publish a summary next week) on the election, Ive been paying close attention to all the issues and advertising.

Everybody on both sides of this issue agrees that the city government is facing a shortage of funds. And thats about the only thing they agree on.A coalition of moderately conservative politicians/business groups and more liberal elements of the city council/union groups are supporting this proposal.

Its revenge in retaliation over a union-sponsored initiative that passed last spring limiting Supes to two terms.

Its not that we havent had ideological divides in the past, because there are always multiple points of view about whats best for the country, but these days the positions have hardened to the point where compromises are not even on the table for discussion. Our political system, which by its very nature encourages two (and only two) political parties, has historically yielded an incremental approach to change. 4 commentsRead the full article Proposition 24:Undoing Arnolds Backroom DealsOctober 11, 2010OB Rag Fall Elections  Part 7As part of a series of back-room deals made by Gov. Schwarzenegger in 2008 & 2009, last years budget plan included a series of tax breaks for businesses. They were needed to get the Republican votes necessary to get to the two-thirds vote threshold to pass the budget. These tax breaks had been considered by the legislature in previous sessions but had failed to pass.5 commentsRead the full article Proposition 23, The Really Big Lies of Really Big Oil CompaniesOctober 10, 2010OB Rag Fall 2010 Elections  Part 6Proposition 23, which would suspend AB 32, the Global Warming Act of 2006, is the big bucks ballot box initiative this year. Proposition 19 (legalizing marijuana) may be getting the interest (at least thats what our web stats show) and the initiative (Prop 25coverage coming next week) changing the constitutional requirement to a simply majority for passing a budget may have the biggest long term impact, but the real slugfest is all about Proposition 23.
