Now that we have seen a series of right-wing assassinations take place, the original DHS report looks, in hindsight, to have been very timely and prescient. We have seen Jim David Adkisson open fire upon the congregation of the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church with a sawed-off shotgun, killing two, simply because he opposed the all-inclusive nature of the church, and of the church's liberal teachings. Adkisson wrote in a letter which he assumed would be his last, "I thought Id do something good for this country  kill Democrats til (sic) the cops kill me. His hatred for his fellow Americans could not be contained: Liberals are a pest like termites, millions of them  the only way we can rid ourselves of this evil is kill them in the streets, kill them where they gather.James von Brunn, a radical right-winger from Maryland sought to turn the nation's Holocaust Museum into a symbol for his particular brand of racism, when he went there with the intent to kill blacks and Jews, as an example to the rest of white America to emulate. Luckily for those visitors inside of the museum, the first man von Brunn decided to open fire upon was a black man who had the ability to return the favor, and so no one besides than the very heroic Stephen T. Johns died that day.Shawna Forde, and two other members of the anti-immigrant Minutman group which she founded, the ''Minutemen American Defense,'' decided that one way to finance her burgeoning organization was to dress up as law enforcement agents, and to rob Mexican immigrants. When Shawna and her compatriots illegally entered the home of Raul Flores, and demanded money, the head of the family ordered the trio to leave, prompting the radical right-wingers to put a bullet into the head of little 9 year old Brisenia Flores, and into the head of her father. Unluckily for the conservative killers, Brisenia's mother was able to barricade herself in her bedroom, where she kept a handgun, and she was able to keep at bay her would be assassins until the real police arrived. Richard Poplawski opened fire on police officers during a domestic disturbance call, in April of 2009, killing three of them. Why? The 23 year-old right-winger feared that the President was poised to take away his hand guns.Just a few days after that shoot-out, two sheriffs deputies in northern Florida were shot and killed by Joshua Cartwright who later was fatally shot by other deputies. The reason, according to Cartright's wife, was because Joshua "believed that the US Government was conspiring against him," and, according to her, he had been severely disturbed that Barack Obama had been elected President.The list of victims from right-wing terror does not stop there.It goes on, and on.Doctor George Tiller.Arkansas Democratic Chairman Bill Gwatney.Congresswoman Giffords and the other victims of the Tucson shooting are but the latest victims of this madness.Hours before the shooting spree in Arizona which took 6 lives including that of a Federal Judge and a 9 year old little girl, Christina Greene (born on 9-11-2001), Representative Peter King, a conservative Republican and the new chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, made clear his intention to use taxpayers' money - our money - to investigate the radicalization of American Muslims, claiming in his zeal to persecute American Muslims, that "These are very legitimate hearings." But since the day little Christina was brought into this world, on that fateful September morning, the number of victims who have been laid to rest due to domestic jihad pales when compared to those who have been killed by conservative terrorists during little Christina's short tenure on this earth.For moderate conservatives to hide these blood-thirsty radicals within their ranks behind the legitimate dissent of the anti-abortion lobby, or of that of any other conservative movement, be it anti-immigration, or advocates for 2d Amendment Rights, and to deny any responsibility for help in fostering these lunatic's bizarre views, doesn't help the conservative lobbies attain their aims and goals... It, instead, helps the radical conservative terrorists attain theirs. We should be there, in Washington DC, on the first day that Rep. King convenes his American Muslim witch hunt.We should be there to tell him with a thunderous voice that we know who the real domestic threats to America are.I will be there.Will you?A note on the graphic included with this post: The Sons of Liberty were the patriots who had finally had enough and threw the King's tea into Boston Harbor. The graphic is the flag of those American patriots. If you, too, are ready to throw out the tea, proudly adopt this flag as a piece of your heritage once again.Del Wasso,Rockford Coffee Party Coordinator,Rockford, Illinois,www.rockfordcoffeeparty.org Refresh|+20 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadGreat post - great symbolLiberalEstoJan-09-11 01:51 PM#1Candles?OneAngryDemocratJan-09-11 01:58 PM#3Interesting graphic.northoftheborderJan-09-11 01:55 PM#2Google...OneAngryDemocratJan-09-11 02:02 PM#4I wondered what had happened to the Coffee Party.northoftheborderJan-09-11 02:04 PM#5I was banned from posting on their FB page...OneAngryDemocratJan-09-11 02:09 PM#6Sounds like thery're too decaffeinated  ntLiberalEstoJan-09-11 02:14 PM#7Ha!OneAngryDemocratJan-09-11 02:43 PM#8+1OneAngryDemocratJan-09-11 02:59 PM#9REPUBLICANS will not speak out.

In the scene, a peaceful crowd closes in on a gorilla guilty of murdering a child chimpanzee, repeatedly chanting "Ape shall not kill ape."Guilt ridden, and trying to get away from his accusers, the gorilla climbs a tree - even though the crowd makes no move to follow him.He steps out on a weaker branch, and <<BOOM!>> crashes to his doom, falling out of the tree.I see no reason why we can't chant "Murderer" standing outside of the Republican majority House of Representatives, as Rep. King's witch hunt against American Muslims begins.As I said in my piece, conservatives will NOT take responsibilty.That is already, while the bodies from the Tucson massacre - and we need not shrink away from using that term ''massacre'' - are still warm, self-evident.That doesn't mean we can't thrust the responsibilty upon them, anyways.And we should.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnorthoftheborder      (577 posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:55 PMResponse to Original message2.Interesting graphic.I didn't know that image was the flag of the original patriots.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOneAngryDemocrat      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:02 PMResponse to Reply #24.Google...Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 02:04 PM by OneAngryDemocratDo a google search for "SONS OF LIBERTY", "FLAG", and "BOSTON TEA".It is quite distinct from the Tea Party's "Don't Tread on Me" flag (the yellow flag with the snake), and quite appropriate for those ready, willing, and able, to toss the tea into the sea.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnorthoftheborder      (577 posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:04 PMResponse to Original message5.I wondered what had happened to the Coffee Party.Are there still active groups all over the country?  Perhaps now is the time to become more visible and participate as you suggest, taking action, instead of just talking.  What, specifically, ideas do you have to act against the hatred of the Tea Party & associated groups?  You are aware, I hope, that the Tea Party, etc.. actually have massive amounts of money behind them, and that is where their power comes from:  these powerful wealthy individuals and corporations do not want their interests disturbed, don't want to give up money and power, so they use their power to front groups, buy media, and encourage unhinged people to act in their stead.  I'm not very hopeful groups such as yours, although impassioned, can be effective against those powerful interests.  Try to convince me.  I'm in a very dispirited and unhopeful state of mind right now, that anything can change.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOneAngryDemocrat      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:09 PMResponse to Reply #56.I was banned from posting on their FB page...Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 02:14 PM by OneAngryDemocratI was banned from posting on their FB page for posting the message kicking off this very thread, just yesterday.Why?  The message I got from Annabel Park was that I was too "angry."Well, "Duh!?!?!"The Coffee Party is still out there.Doing next to nothing.It has completely lost direction.Their desire to build partisan bridges crosses into immorally accepting racists and bigots into their ranks.The group of Coffee Partiers I have in Rockford, Illinois still organizes actions, however, and the National Coffee Party can go the way of the dinosaurs for all I care.  There are moral lines that can not be crossed which the National Coffee Party crosses with gusto.For more information, go to www.rockfordcoffeeparty.org Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLiberalEsto      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:14 PMResponse to Reply #67.Sounds like thery're too decaffeinated  ntPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOneAngryDemocrat      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:43 PMResponse to Reply #78.Ha!I'm stealing your line, my man.

It's who they are which creates their ideology & agenda. In a nutshell - The republicans, the force of the rich and their corporations want total and complete control over the workers and the people and everything else in world!They really believe it's owed to them, it's their destiny and they are truly better than everyone & everything else.The ONLY way to achieve this is for REPUBLICANS to continue to DIVIDE & CONQUER.....Republicans are masters of this technique, using hate, guilt and lies, promoting jealousies, teaching selfishness among their lost uninformed flocks.You think REPUBLICANS even want to change? GET REAL!! They want the control, they love to hate & oppress it gets them off, they are as sick and hateful, full of prejudices and need to get rid of anyone who disagrees with them....their insatiable lust for money and power is far too strong to reach them.To talk peace and love is to be laughed at by REPUBLICANS - They can't comprehend it, it's just not in them and they really and truly despise it...and love to destroy anyone who believes this way and never give it a second thought.If you really want things to change YOU better face the facts - The facts are in front of you every single day, one can't start to make a change if one chooses to just ignore truth & reality.As unfortunate as this is one better understand and realize REPUBLICANS are different - Their greatest feelings are of power & control, money and spewing hate, deceptions through fear, distortions smears and complete & total manipulations of peoples minds.This has been the same all through history, one could not change these people they are mad with power, ego, greed as well as insecurities we can't even begin to understand, they were born this way....I do believe this as fact!As much as I dislike saying it, GET REAL when it comes to republicans. - As you will see the lies, coldness heartless come out tomorrow with the greedy likes of the sick Limbaugh setting the hateful tone & talking points for the others at Fox  "news" and for Beck, O'Reilly, Hannity, Palin, Rove, etc...they will spew their lies and manipulative spins, (and they will get out there for all to hear their side) always pointing the finger at others - These are the "conservatives" you speak of = REPUBLICANS!One must understand It's more than just a political party with these people, it a state of mind and way of life.However, we should NEVER give up trying to make it better in the world and for those who care as well the less fortunate, we must sincerely keep fighting these evil, wicked people who hate and laugh at this concept.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topannabanana      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 03:22 PMResponse to Original message11.k&r . . .n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOneAngryDemocrat      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 03:31 PMResponse to Original message12.bumpPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topkpominville      (316 posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 03:33 PMResponse to Original message13.well said.k&rPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOneAngryDemocrat      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 04:06 PMResponse to Reply #1314.bumpPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 10:07 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss General DiscussionPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
