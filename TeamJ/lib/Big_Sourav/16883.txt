In some twisted form of Christianity pastor Fred Phelps explains that God somehow wrought vengence with swift justice on Congresswoman Gifford! The nutbar church and their Sinister Minister plan to picket the funerals of those slain in Tucson...much like their shoddy displays at the funerals of Iraq and Afghanistan war dead. Just what is that congregation drinking as a sacrament in that church? Bile? Is there not enough anger and bad blood with this terrible tragedy? Politics is bad enough..now they want to bring God into the picture?

Reply By     Benjamin Burton Jr.|about 11 hoursagoCouldn't agree more, Andy.This is a major reason why Jesus' message is largely ignored. Too many frail,misguided so-called followers that insist on trusting 'in the blood'-- of those that they disagree with.

Reply  Reply By     Andy Mathisen|about 9 hoursagoPerhaps if you read some of my 900 past articles in the last 2 years..you would discover that you are most certainly wrong in your opinion. What about this one;http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/7831595-the-assasination-get-well-soonor this one;http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/7828981-of-bums-men2nd-chance-ted-on-the-tightropeobviously you DO NOT read my articles!This comes as no surprise. I have over 25 fans from Pakistan and each day my mailbox is full of others from Pakistan wanted me to "fan" them. Considering my viewership in Pakistan is barely 1%...I am under the impression nobody there reads my articles. They just want me to read theirs!Hence..I just "defanned" you.            Reply  Reply By     neandergal|about 2 hoursagoI just read your article "Assasi-nation - Get Well Soon" I commented in response to one of your comments about half-way down. The gun control or lack thereof in this country is ridiculous. California used to have a 15 day wait period, but got rid of it because it was ruled "unconstitional." Go figure.             Reply By     Andy Mathisen|about 1 houragoI read that comment and replied below it.There are very stringent checks for purchasing "fire power" in Canada..at least legally, that is! You have to take a hunting course just to be able to purchase a rifle. For handguns..you have to be a collector or be involved in sport shooting at a club..and the security checks disallow anyone with any violence or serious mental conditions in their background.            Reply  Posted By     Adrian Holman|about 8 hoursagoFred Phelps is a schmuck. The only way to explain it is that he resides in Kansas. Wow, you're in the defanning mood this weekend.

This is the hypocrisy,they speak of jesus but preach hate.I only people will note this,there is freedom to and freedom from,It will never stop I say,never with so called morality teachers like this "pastors" what a laugh!Rated upHave fun keep on saying it as it is.            Reply  Reply By     ethelsmith|about 7 hoursagoI agree. Muslims may act differently when face with acts of violence but christianity was founded on different ideals. Or was it?            Reply  Posted By     FauziaSultana|about 4 hoursagoI'm sorry ethel you've got it all wrong about the religion,Islam.It is in fact a religion of peace but has been wrongly interpreted because of a bunch of fundamentalists who have shown violence in their actions and thus brought a bad name to Islam!This particular pastor that you have written about is also giving a wrong interpretation to Christanity.Thanks for sharing Andy.            Reply  Reply By     Andy Mathisen|about 4 hoursagoThere are factions and sects in all religions and European history is also awash with blood as Christian factions fought for power and control. Most times it has little to do with Faith.And don't get me started on the Crusades! Sunni and Shia sects of Islam do the same injustice to their religion and too much blood was spilt when Muslims fought Hindus in India during the fracturing of the country along religious lines following liberation from the English. No religion can claim very clean hands in all this..except perhaps the Buddhists?It has often been quited that Patriotism is the last refuge of a scounderel. I think it is a coin toss..too often religion has produced not shortage of their own scounderels?Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. Boswell tells us that Samuel Johnson made this famous pronouncement that patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel on the evening of April 7, 1775. He doesn't provide any context for how the remark arose, so we don't really know for sure what was on Johnson's mind at the time.However, Boswell assures us that Johnson was not indicting patriotism in general, only false patriotism.            Reply  Posted By     Punditty|about 1 houragoPhelps has freedom of speech, and I have the freedom not to pay attention. I did NOT watch this video, and I won't.My heart is filled with prayerful compassion for those in Arizona who are suffering as a direct consequence of the madness yesterday in Tucson. In the bigger picture, my I am filled with a strong sense of sorrow at the overall state of affairs in the United States.As for Phelps, may the God of Love touch his heart and open his mind.            Reply  Reply By     Andy Mathisen|about 1 houragoI had to question whether to post it myself..given the tragic circumstances. I wrestled with it and decided it newsworthy. Only by exposing these rascals can public opinion be served to perhaps curtail this behavior. I think ignoring or choosing NOT to see problems is akin to apathy..maybe even fear? To NOT look at a problem does not make it go away. In that sense it is like appeasment. It all boils down to personal choice..and, as you point out..Freedoms.
