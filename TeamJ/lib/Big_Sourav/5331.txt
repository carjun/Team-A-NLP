He believes he has a meeting with the Imam heading up the lower Manhattan mosque project.On MSNBC this morning, NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders reported from outside the Gainesville church that ABC News was preparing to fly Pastor Jones to New York.It appears based on what he just told us, said Sanders, that ABCs Good Morning America has arranged to fly him to New York and he will be flying with a team of producers and camera crews to New YorkTVNewser reached out to ABC News. Spokesperson Jeffrey Schneider tells us that an offer was made to the Pastor by an ABC News staffer in Gainesville, but network higher-ups decided against paying for Jones flight to New York.It is not uncommon for news networks to pay for flights or hotels or even cash (via the licensing of photos or videos) for interview subjects with the hope of securing an exclusive in return. But in the case of Pastor Jones, ABC News decided against it.Jones appeared on all three network newscasts this morning.

Its clear the tragedy is something people are drawn to.  Im enjoying the geeky aspect of this 3D HD technology too.For the story, Sanders has done over 48 live shots for NBC and MSNBC as well as The Weather Channel and Telemundo with few glitches.  While just a few years ago that would have been a difficult proposition, technology has caught up.  I used to dream of reporting live from obscure places and now it almost seems routine, he said. We have an engineer here who spent 3 days wiring the ship to feed a live signal and set up a wireless system so the camera can wander to any spot on the ship (inside and out).With storms brewing in the tropics, we wondered if there was any concern about hurricanes swinging their direction. We have our eyes on the 3D imaging heading down to titanic as well as on the weather radar loop, he told us. Ive covered just about every hurricane since 1982 but never one at sea. Our captain was at sea during the perfect storm. He promises me we will not be in the path of those approaching storms.We had just one more question: Read moreCommentsShareNBCKerry Sanders Okay After Crash, But His Brand-New Car May Not Make ItBy Alissa Krinsky on August 6, 2010 3:41 PMNBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders is sore but alright after a car accident yesterday afternoon, he tells TVNewser.Im happy  I walked away, says Sanders. It could have been a lot worse.Sanders was less than half a mile from his Ft. Lauderdale home  on his way to a story in Orlando  when the accident occurred at a three-way stop. He says the driver of a van blew a stop sign and smashed into his six-day-old Volkswagen, causing the air bag to deploy.The airbag did what it was supposed to do, says Sanders, who had carefully researched the cars safety features before he bought it. I had read it was very good on the safety front. Well, I hate to say that I tested it out in the first 350 miles, but its true, it was very safe.Its not clear yet if the car will be declared a total loss.Im so disappointed my brand new car, with only 315 miles on it  I hadnt even put a tank of fuel in it yet  is now in the shop and I have no idea whats going to happen to it.Bottom line, though, Sanders feels fortunate. I will choose to look at it as Im very lucky to have walked away.(photo courtesy of Kerry Sanders)CommentsShareNBCNBC News Capus Visits Gulf CrewBy kevin on June 29, 2010 6:12 PMNBC News president Steve Capus traveled down to the Gulf Coast earlier this week to visit the NBC talent and crew that have been reporting on the BP oil spill.

Teague, a former NBC News correspondent who worked with Barrak, helped arrange for her to legally come to the U.S. in 2004 and live with him and his family.Numerous friends and colleagues  including NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders   contributed time and money to establish a $60,000 graduate school fellowship for Barrak to study at the University of South Florida.The book describes Barraks adjustment to life in the U.S., and how the Teagues  Don, his wife Kiki, and their two teenage daughters  consider Rafraf a member of their family.Were more alike than we think we are, people from such vastly different areas of the world, different cultures, different religions, Teague says. Ultimately, were all just people, and I think thats what we try to show in the book, is that we all have so many things in common, as well as the things that make us different.(photo courtesy of Don Teague)CommentsShareNEXT PAGE >>You must have javascript enabled to use these forms.Send an anonymous tipTwitterMobileRSSInterested in advertising on TVNewser?Find a JobResearch Manager, DigitalNational Public RadioWashington, DCResearch Manager, Business and Corporate DevelopmtNational Public RadioWashington, DCAdvertising Sales Representative - Inside SalesPandora Internet Radio - Oakland, CAOakland, CAMarketing Research Analystwww.pandora.comOakland, CASee all jobs | Post a risk-free job listing for $279TVNewser StaffChris AriensManaging EditorAlex WeprinCo-EditorMolly Stark DeanCo-EditorGail ShisterColumnistAlissa KrinskyContributorNadine CheungEditor, The Job PostTVNewser on TwitterTVNewser Twitter feed loading...Follow TVNewser on TwitterTopicsCable News RatingsABCCBSCNNFox NewsMSNBCNBCmore...LinksBroadcasting & CableBuzzMachineFTVLiveInside Cable NewsJohnny Dollar's PlaceMedia DecoderMedia MobMediaiteMonsters & Critics  TVNewsBluesNewscastStudioNewslabRomeneskoThe Live FeedTV BarnTV by the NumbersTVNewsCheckTVSpy WatercoolerTVWeekVarietyZ on TVArchivesJanuary 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010more...
