Bush became President? Have you been directly affected by the tragedies of 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina? Have you or a loved one served in Iraq or Afghanistan? Has the housing foreclosure crisis hit too close to your home? How are you coping with $4 a gallon gasoline and rising food costs? How are you surviving?

Defargeit was a Saturday, I was listening to a cable news station and heard the announcement that the U.S. Supreme Court had voted to stop the Florida recount.  I screamed "NO!!!!!!!!!" at the top of my lungs and started crying hysterically.  I'm not, by nature, a screamer, and was shocked at my own reaction.  But I knew.  I KNEW that our democracy and our country would never be the same.  When Gore conceded the election a few days later, I physically collapsed -- I was still suffering from a very sore throat as a result of the assault on my vocal cords -- and missed the next two days of work.My apprehension about the new administration was so great that a month or so after the election I predicted to a friend that there would be some kind of event early on that would lead to a curtailment of our civil liberties -- perhaps even provide a rationale for declaring martial law.  Oddly enough, during the days following 911, I was totally unwilling to entertain the thought that it was anything other than an attack on our country by a foreign enemy.  It was only months later, while reading an article about the Bush family's connection to the Saudi royal, family that I began to start trying to connect the dots.How has all of this affected me?  Physically not at all, since my throat condition cleared up.  But emotionally and spiritually?  My heart is broken.  After the stolen election of 2000, I stopped exercising.  Several years later it occurred to me that I had actually been in a low-grade depression since December 2000.Now, I live life on a day-to-day basis going through the motions of work and domesticity.  I still enjoy relationships and little recreations.  But I am alway mindful of horrific damage that my country has perpetrated upon the people of Iraq, as well as the subversion of the rule of law here at home.  We are now torturers. And I won't travel outside of the U.S. unless and until we have a new leader who can restore our government "of the people, by the people and for the people", as well as our honor in the eyes of the world.Thanks for asking, and keep us posted.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Tue Jan-20-09 12:14 PMResponse to Reply #213.Deleted messageMessage removed by moderator.

The marriage is in keeping with Islamic circumstance in that there is no Islamic statutory jurisdiction within the Western Hemisphere. The marriage is blocked through covert and subliminal means within this society because the untransparent 'official' stance here is not to 'mix' Islamic ideology with Christian ideology, especially in a family circumstance such as marriage.I maintain that as a free adult in a 'free' country it's my right to marry whom I choose and who chooses me. Any situation that doesn't allow for that has no right to exist in a 'free' society.Bush for me has defied and denied democracy, a fact that makes me seriously consider pursuing my marriage within another society that at least replaces hypocracy with honesty.THAT'S how Bush has affected my life.Definition of the Bush Regime = Destroys everything it touches.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopGSPowner      (89 posts)Sat Dec-20-08 10:23 PMResponse to Reply #910.so he has kept you from getting married through covert and subliminal means?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Tue Jan-20-09 12:11 PMResponse to Reply #911.Deleted messageMessage removed by moderator.

Then in 2000 it was about the first week of March when it appeared that Bush was going to come out of the Republican primary fray as the frontrunner.  It was also the week of the beginning of the dot com crash.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.

Lies-Smears were multitude with help of right wing freaknut radio and Conservative TV stations,They held 13 public hearings on Whitewater a well-known simple land deal. Borrow money-buy land-cut roads-sell lots.

SNAKE EYES. UNCLE SAM HELP HELP HELPBUSHALOONSMany leading members of Bush administration were Clinton Haters Deluxe.They joined Nixon in 1969 and were in office until 1977. Then, they joined Reagan in 1981 and were in office for 12 years. The believed they would be in office for the remainder of their active lives.Clinton victory killed them. They hated Democrats and the Press for Nixon Resignation even though Republicans played a major part.Cheney never got over Nixon resignation. His hatred increased with age.He wanted to destroy Clinton. His mind became warped.He had been one of the power people for 20 of prior 24 years.When they returned to power controlling all three branches it was get even time.They ignored Clinton administration many warnings on Osama Bin Laden and concentrated on eliminating the many Executive Orders initiated by Clinton.It did not matter that some were valuable for the people.If the Clinton name was on it --kill the sucker nice Christ-like people?George Bush was part of the Hatred group. He had campaigned for his Dad and was devastated when he lost. He hated Clinton and his people. 1946 to 2007REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH + INCOMEFrom 1946 to 1981 each percentile gained almost evenly, percentage, in Income and Wealth. Economists called it a Picket Fence Distribution.Reagan policies began the Step Ladder distribution.Each percentile gained some but top step (10%) went into outer spaceMiddle Class was rewarded by Reagan with largest income tax increase in history the Payroll Tax increase plus a tax on 50% of Social Security Income plus a 5-cent gas tax.In 2007 it had been upward distributed so much the top 1% owned 21% and top 10% owned 71% of the nations individual wealth.The Middle Class, not top 10%, should own 71% of wealth in a Democracy Big question. How many decades will it take to redistribute downward to middle class?So majority have affordable housing-affordable education-affordable health careFinancial Security more important to the Middle Class than Excessive Military SecurityReagan + GW Bush forced the Rich to take 2500 Billion in Tax cuts.The Rich Income Tax Rate was reduced by 55% under Reagan.His Savings and Loan change destroyed the institution but gave much wealth to Michael Milken ($555 Million income in one year) and his rich buddies in the rich mans Wall Street Gambling Casino.The reduction of Unearned Income Tax Rate from 28% to 15% was boom boom for very rich in the Gambling Casino. The huge reduction in Estate Taxes.Bush 1700 Tax cut was primarily a reward to his Wall Street Gambling Pals.Rich 2.7% (5 million) got four times as much as bottom 80 percent (125 million).WORLDS GREATEST  CREDITOR TO GREATEST DEBTORIn 1980 the Federal Debt was under 1000 BillionReagan added 1700BBush I added 1300BBush II added 5000B +Twenty years of so called conservativism added on 8 times as much as we had after 200 years.Conservatives controlled the Senate for 18 yearsHouse for 12 yearsAll government for 6 years.Federal Spending-- went from 600B per year under Carter to 4000B in Bush last budgeted yearFederal Debt1000B to 11,000B +They gave us the Savings and Loan Debacle, which aided in Hostile Takeovers of major corporations by Rich Gamblers in Wall Street Casino. Rich got ultra-rich.They gave us the Housing fiasco and millions of home foreclosures.Yes! It was Rich Gamblers in the Wall Street Gambling Casino.Plus assistance by Federal Reserve Chairman Republican Alan Greenspan.The same man who gave President Clinton seven significant rate increases in campaign year for reelection and six significant rate increases from June 1999 to June 2000 to elect a Republican President. Impartial? Ho Hum.A Republican President gets a 6.5% Democratic Interest Rate cut to a 1% Interest Rate which exploded Housing Industry into a free for all profit maker for Developers-Realtors-Banks in Wall Street Casino.Wall Street Gamblers were freed to use instruments similar to marked cards and loaded dice as in Coolidge years. Regulators were hog tied.SCANDALSCarter had no person convicted for a crime committed while working for himClinton had one person convicted of a felony that was committed while working for himNixonaw heck forget it.ReaganHaynes Johnson of Washington Post labeled the Reagan Administration as the most scurrilous in history138 persons working for him charged with crimes.That number is more than the grand total for all presidents since 19009 cabinet members investigatedScandals in 32 departments of the federal government15 major officials found guiltyMost of the crimes involved money cswinney2@triad.rr.com Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 11:04 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss Topic ForumsDemocratsPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
