In an interesting twist in the development of this case, police have arrested aspiring rapper boyfriend, 32-year old Jason O. Griffith, on January 8, 2011, on one count of murder, reports ABC News. The police have not indicated whether the arrest was in connection with the Flores-Narvaez disappearance or if it was for the murder of someone else, although boyfriend Griffith is currently housed at the Clark County Detention Center awaiting hearing on January 12, 2011 at 8:30 a.m. This recent arrest on one count of murder adds to boyfriend Griffith's legal problems: in another action that occurred in October of last year, boyfriend Griffith was charged with one misdemeanor count of domestic-violence related battery and one felony count of coercion, and is accused of physically injuring (kicking and punching) girlfriend Flores-Narvaez. A preliminary hearing on this matter has been scheduled for April 2011 and because of the police report taken during the October incident which reports that Flores-Narvaez had bruises on her legs and lost a tuft of hair due to boyfriend Griffith, Griffith is a Person of Interest in the Flores-Narvaez disappearance. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is looking into every aspect in this investigation as if it involved foul play, however state that up to this point they have yet to find any evidence of foul play.
