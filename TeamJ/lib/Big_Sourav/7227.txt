Spiders do not have moveable mouth parts. Defenestration is the act of throwing someone or something out of a window- see Defenestrations of Prague. These are just a few of the thousands of factoids that remain firmly lodged in the Liberry Lady section of my brain.When I retired in 2009, I had spent twenty five years working at the Information Desk of the City Of San Diegos Central Library. I was hired in the 1980s as an assistant librarian. I do not have a Masters in Library Science, which is required for librarian status- hence Liberry Lady or Ms.Information. The old card catalogs were being phased out and it would be close to a decade before computers became available to staff and patrons. That means that I had the good fortune of initially learning to use print resources to answer your questions and that I was there when the first wave of computer technology- no world wide web, no email- was introduced to staff and patrons.6 commentsRead the full article...Tucson Shooting Update: Sheriff Believes Jared Loughner Was Not Aloneby Frank Gormlie on January 8, 2011 in: American Empire, Civil Rights, Culture, ElectionAt the end of the news day for Saturday, January 8th, 2011, heres more that is known or has come out  and this is as of 6 pm PST :    * The Sheriff of Tucson and Pima County, AZ, believes that todays shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, did not act alone, and authorities are currently searching for a second male, a person of interest.
