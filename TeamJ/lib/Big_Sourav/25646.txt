Useful (6)Funny (1)Awesome (3)Beautiful (2)Spa-At-Home: Homemade Facials & Face Mask RecipesCommentsJennifer Chait3 years ago Hmm, the sweet and sour is really different; it sounds good but I'm curious about the sting quality. Is the lime kind of subtle? I've tried something almost exactly like your citrus scrub before -- it works great.Helen Lacan3 years ago hey I will definately give some of these a go but with the honey one it just looks like using soap with glycerin and adding honeu cuz ppl think it sounds good.Maddie Ruud3 years ago Helen:Thanks for the comment... in this hub I've tried to give people plenty of options for easy ways to make a facial cleanser, and one of those is to take pre-existing soaps and add ingredients that will boost the benefits.  If you've got the energy for mixing up your own from scratch, that's great, try one of the other ones, like sweet n sour... but for some people, a soap-based cleanser might be just what they're looking for.After you've tried them, do let me know which one's your favorite!  (I, personally, love the oatmeal-baking soda scrub, as I have acne-prone skin.)Best,MaddieAlli3 years ago Does the almond stuff work cause people tell me it works great!!!!!baby3 years ago i love facials!! lol, omg... me and my bff r having SO much funn!! yew NEED to try these!!!maddy3 years ago dear maddiei need ur help! i only have an avocado, hunny and a banana to work with, but im too afraid to try a facial because my skin is VERY pimpelly and dry, what should i do?please help....maddyMaddie Ruud3 years ago Lucky for you, avocado and honey are some of the best moisturizers for your skin!  Add to that the nourishing power of banana, and you're well on your way.  Look above for the link to "Facial Mask Recipes" and make yourself the Avocado-Banana mask, substituting honey for yogurt.  If you have no olive oil, don't stress... the honey works wonders by itself.tutu3 years ago when the mention oatmeal in some recipes is ti dry unprepared oatmeaL OR IS IT PREPARED ALREADY???!PS. WHAT THE DIFF BTWEEN FINE OATMEAL, INSTANT OATMEAL AND COOKED OATMEAL. dOES IT REALLY MATTER WHAT STATE OF MATTER  OR QUALITY/kIND IT ISIN WHEN CREATING A RECIPE???Maddie Ruud3 years ago Unless otherwise specified, the oatmeal is dry and unprepared.  As far as instant vs fine, etc, the difference is in the texture and the amount of moisture the oats will soak up.  Some sorts of dry oats can be substituted, as long as you are comfortable with the texture against your skin, and none of the oatmeal includes added sugar or flavoring.  When a recipe calls for prepared oatmeal, however, it is important to cook it before using in a mask.flavagirl3 years ago is just banana and avacado goodJulia3 years ago Hola senoritas!! Comoglamorous 3 years ago OMG with these recipes you can have a major girls night!!!catalina3 years ago helen:the mayo and almond seemed - well yucky at first, i tried it, it works great!THANKS! it makes your skin soft and works great one dry  skin especially in winterim curious about something, people have told me egg whites are good for making your skin shiny and clean with a "glow" does this really work, is this true?Brittany3 years ago dear maddie,I have thyme and lemon but i cant boil water at the moment, will the thyme facial work without boiling water?  just curious , your recipes are excelent thankyou so much , U saved my sleepover! we have something to do now, tons of facials to choose from!thanks againDottie13 years ago Maddie,All of your "Spa at Home Recipes" are wonderful.  I added them to my hub on psoriasis today.  I also printed some recipes out for me and my daughter to try.  Good for mother and daughter time together.  They sound so yummy! coconut, avocados, almonds, etc.  Dottiehealthyskincare3 years ago I can't believe the amazing selection of recipes you have - I think I'll give the coconut cleanser a try.Linda2 years ago Hey Maddie,I tried the oatmeal mask, and I know it says that we are only suppose to use it 1-2 times a week. Would it do any harm to use it more then that? And should we be using these cleansers everyday? Also, what is the difference between the oatmeal mask and the cleanser, they both have the same ingredients. One more questions, i feel the oatmeal is working for the acne, but what is the best recipe for acne scars?Thanks! emmabalmer2 years ago The Sugar and Spice scrub sounds like a sensational idea! Thanks for the information. Keep up the awesome work :)Cavyl2 years ago Hi Maddie,All your homemade recipes look interesting but I will definitely give the oatmeal exfoliating scrub a try. I used to use oatmeal on my face years ago because I had read somewhere that it was good for your face. Mandy Dupuis2 years ago I just starting scrubbing weekly with baking soda. I let it dry on my face and then wash it off, it feels great.MarcyL042 years ago Great recipes!Sandilyn2 years ago Good hub. I like your home made recipes. They are all so natural and with things that we all have at home. So many times you see recipes and they include ingredients that I have never seen in anyone's home!I did have a question for you. I love to do foot baths at home. Could you give me a recipe for one?Thanks!Erica2 years ago omg!!! last night i tried the oatmeal exfoliating scrub but i didnt have good results (probably because i didnt use glycerin) but today i tried the honey cleanser using only honey and liquid soap and immediatly after i felt results...it was phenomenal!!!erica2 years ago i mean when i said i had didnt have good results the first time it was probably because i didnt use fine enough oatmealLTyler2 years ago Good tips. I've used honey in the past, just spread it on, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash off and the skin feels lovely, soft and clean.Can't wait to try the honey and liquid soap combo.wow2 years ago its summer so me and my bff spend the night almost every week so we wanted to make these and now we can2patricias2 years ago Thanks for an interesting Hub.  Have you tried all the recipes yourself, or just those appropriate for your skin?Maddie Ruud2 years ago 2patricias:I've used all of these recipes myself at different times and for different purposes.  Depending on the season, weather, and circumstances, skin will require different treatments.ryder(:2 years ago Me and my friends decided to make a homemade scrub when we were hanging out. We tried the sugar-and-spice scrub and the sweet-and-sour cleanser. BOTH WERE AMAZING!!!we are now obsessed with the scrub especially [dont forget to lick your lips;; its DELICIOUSS!!!]. the cleanser is amazing if you use it right after the scrub. then it will eliminate the greasyness left over from the almond oil. nothing stings or is irritating and everything smells wonderful and leaves skin UNBELIEVABLY SILKY SMOOTH!!!thank you so so so much.[use the scrub on feet, elbows, and knees too!]morti2 years ago today i tryed the oatmealmorti2 years ago i mean i tryed the oatmeal scrub and my face felt so soft and smooth and it feels really clean i love itStacie Naczelnik2 years ago I've used oatmeal and water before, but never added baking soda.  I did it tonight because I heard recently that baking soda is good for sensitive skin (like mine) and helps soften skin as well.  I loved the combination.jenna2 years ago i am not sure bout the maynoisse one but the BROWN SUGAR ONE LOOKS REALLY GOODLindsey Lou :)2 years ago I am obsessed with perfect skin. so have seen and tried every little home made facial mask/scrubs/moisturizers! well after trying them all i was inspired to make on of my own and wow .. amazingly enough it worked like a miracle :)I used finely cut oats,eggwhite,bakingsoda,sugar,and honey. Mixed it all together rubbed it on my face and i waited for about ten minutes. i rinsed it off and my face was glowing and the next morning i didnt have one black head.I call this mask the secret to a flawless complexion! xo(tip: before u apply any mask always open your pores with a steaming washcloth!)irene.trel2 years ago I am very natural when it comes of taking good care of my face and skin.Since then, I just wash my face with a ponds facial wash then put a white egg with evaporated milk, honey and lemon in my face,stay it for an hour.I'l do the same in the night time. I'l take a bath by using an ordinary soap then use a whitening lotion for daytime and moistourizing lotion in the night time.This is my daily routine in taking good care of my face and skin.Having a good skin is basically comes from within.carolne23 months ago which ones do you use with which seasons?

Over the years I've tried many, many other cleansers and I always come back to the one from Made from Earth. So, now it is the only one I ever buy.You can use it two different ways, either by massaging it over your face and then wiping it off with tissue or a wahcloth or rinsing it off with water.  It is gentle on my dry sensitive skin and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized. It also removes my makeup, including eyeliner, mascara (unless it's waterproof), eye shadow, concealer, and face powder, with no irritation. It is very reasonably priced and a bottle lasts me a long time, usually at least 3 months.I have recommended it to many people who comment on how great my skin looks and feels.  I can't say enough good things about Made from Earth - so glad I found it!ashley5 months ago thanks so much!!!kazeemjames014 months ago Highly researched. Thanks for sharing this informative hub.Lian2 months ago whats the treatment for pimples?Erica2 months ago Lian,Peroxide can help on pimples.  The cause of pimples is the blockage of your pores and build up of natural bacteria deep in the skin.  You would think scrubbing more would help but it doesn't break down what is blocking it and can make it worse if you scrub too hard.  A cleanser with salicylic acid is good.  A minor scrub is ok along with the peroxide and a mild cleanser.Emily6 weeks ago I am so excited to try these recipes, they have a lot of great feedback so far, not to mention it won't cost me a thing to whip them up, but I have a question about one of the recipes, and if anyone can help me, it would be much appreciated... For the Citrus Scrubbing Grains, it calls for 1 cup cooked oatmeal, but then it says later on in the recipe to reduce all ingredients to a fine powder. Cooked oatmeal is wet, so how do you reduce it to a powder for the scrub? Please explain, somebody!!! Thanx!!Dakotah5 weeks ago Hey, thanks so much for these! I'm running a girls Bible study for middle schoolers, and the activity for this week was spa/facials, but I didn't know how to find some way to do it at a low cost and still have fun. This totally saved the night! I'll let you know how it goes. :)Tia4 weeks ago I'm looking into making several of these for christmas gifts. I have a question though, how important is the sweet almond oil for the sugar and spice scrub? I'm pricing it at several places on-line and it seems to be $3-7 for 4 oz. or less. This becomes very expensive when making it for 6 people. Can it be substituted for something else.Tiffany Latte4 weeks ago I really like the citrus facials. Great hub.guy19732 weeks ago nice hub, so many natural methodsguy19732 weeks ago i want to use the exfloliating scrubs do they work?skye2day2 weeks ago Maddie I am so grateful I found some great Christmas gifts on your hubs of love.
