Sarah Palin should accept responsibility for helping to create an atmosphere in which warped minds can fester and fermentWhat a week it has been for Sarah Palin, and what an education, too. She has learned that words have meaning.And not just bumper-sticker meaning, either. Real meaning that goes beyond soundbites and slogans, placards and button-pushing catchphrases such as Mama Grizzly and Hockey Mom or Dont Retreat, Reload.She has discovered that a term like blood libel, for instance, cannot just be thrown out flippantly into the ether without knowledge of its history. That blood libel is a slur which refers, specifically, to Jews feasting on the blood of Christians, and is therefore hugely offensive to the Jewish community. To use it in a speech which concerned, in part, the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, the first Jewish congresswoman from Arizona, is therefore an act of such crassness that it should disqualify the speaker from serious public office for life. Yet blood libel is not a phrase that occurs in everyday conversation. Most people would never have heard of it, until Palin and Glenn Reynolds, a conservative commentator writing in the Wall Street Journal, brought it into the public domain. Where it has been most commonly used this week is in far-Right commentary and websites; the fringes that Palin inhabits having had her shortcomings exposed too often in the mainstream media.And that is where language is losing its meaning, where the lexicon of hate finds its fullest voice. Did Palin conspire in the killing of six Americans and the attempted assassination of representative Giffords? No. Jared Lee Loughner, a mentally unwell, unemployed 22-year-old man, acted alone. Did Palin and the unthinking rhetoric of plenty like her contribute to the febrile atmosphere in which warped minds fester and ferment? Absolutely.Immoderate language is commonplace in public debate these days. Not just extremes of abuse, but threats of violence and the complete disregard of boundaries or proportion.More...'The forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us': Obama pleads for end to political backlash over Arizona shootingsThe flag of hope: Ground Zero banner flies proudly again... at the funeral of nine-year-old gun victim born on 9/11Police find black bag carried by Arizona 'gunman' hours before massacreThe anonymity of the web has brought ugliness seeping from chatrooms and message boards via talk radio shock-jocks and on to the streets.Barack Obama is Hitler, hes a Muslim extremist, Armageddon is coming, it is the End of Days. These are all thought processes that began in the margins of debate and have somehow filtered into a wider public consciousness in America. Britain does not possess the same demons, but give it time. There is extremism here, as was witnessed in the reaction to the death of murderer Raoul Moat, for instance, with Facebook groups forming to lionise his actions. Wake-up call: A woman places a sign at a memorial outside the offices of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona following the killing spree in which six people lost their livesThat is modern social media for you. If there is one thing the human race is adept at, it is taking a good idea and corrupting it. So what began as a network for Harvard students metamorphosed into all of you who want to kill coppers, join our club. On Twitter yesterday, David Potts, the leader of the Conservative group on South Tyneside city council, branded David Miliband a w***er for taking a job with Sunderland Football Club. How insightful. How constructive. Meanwhile, over in America, the Right are only too happy to appropriate violent imagery and metaphors to appeal to the gun-lovin rump in the middle.

Palin seemed a little unsure when she broke her silence on Wednesday in an address that may have left the bereaved unsure as to the identity of the real victim.Eschewing such outdated qualities as empathy, sympathy, human understanding or contrition, she quoted former President Ronald Reagan. Acts of monstrous cruelty stand on their own, Palin insisted. They begin and end with the individuals who commit them. How true.Then it all went blurry. Journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn, Palin continued. So which is it? Do words have no effect (Palins first statement), or can they indeed incite violence if used injudiciously (her second). Either Palins speechwriters are as dumb as she is  which cannot be ruled out, as they are presumably part-responsible for the blood libel debacle  or she is incapable of demonstrating intellect beyond just a random collection of patriotic homilies and gun images.Palin has never understood the worth of words beyond superficial rabble-rousing and, faced with a genuine tragedy and three days to consider it, she gave a speech solely devoted to saving her own miserable skin. Meanwhile, the erosion of language continues. The sole black Republican Party district chairman in Arizona, Anthony Miller, has resigned because of fears for his safety following constant verbal attacks and intimidation from the Right of his party. At an event in Lake Havasu City, Miller said someone called out: Theres Anthony, get a rope.I love the Republican Party, but I dont want to take a bullet for anybody, he added. And this time it wasnt a metaphor, it was somebodys life. Without restraint, it usually is. Police in the West Midlands have taken delivery of a 50,000 Lotus Evora  top speed 168mph  on a two-week trial basis. Its a very quick car and will prove a deterrent to speeding, said PC Angus Nairn. Of course, an equal deterrent would be if Lotus stopped making cars with a top speed of 168mph.

I have always found it absolutely extraordinary that someone as utterly stupid as Sarah Palin could be in mainstream politics in the US, and recent events have only reinforced that opinion.- Ian, Bristol, 14/1/2011 14:20Click to rateRating4Report abuseGreat piece and a counterbalance to the sophistry of many defendants of Palin. It is a sign of how polarised politics is, that well argued opinion like this is immediately denigrated as 'left wing'. Yes, Democrats and liberals can resort to immoderate language and imagery - witness the arrogant environmental agenda of the liberal elite - but this is as nothing compared with the lunatic ravings of the right. As Mr Samuels says, the scarier (and I do mean scary) parts of the blogosphere are insidiously seeping into everyday politics.- greyridge, UK, 14/1/2011 12:03Click to rateRating(0)Report abuseSarah Palin didn`t create this tragedy and neither did anyone else. This was an act of violence from a very sick individual.It should never have been turned into a political mud slinging match, but it seems that the politicians and the media just can`t resist building up the anger and scoring points against each other. Left / Centre / Right politicians and the media are all using this violent act to their own advantage. Obama has also been milking the situation for all its worth. I have no respect for any of them and none of them have anything worthwhile to say!- Robbie H, South Ribble, 14/1/2011 11:20Click to rateRating11Report abuseMartin isn't the only one claiming politics is so much more civil over here than in America. Have these people never watched Prime Minister's Question Time?It struck me (would you believe) how quaint Fox News commentators were in calling for more respect when debating heated issues, as I prefer more robust exchanges. Compare The Wright Stuff - Before the student riots the host was complaining that we don't riot like the French. When they did he complained the media drew attention to it. A former DJ and Left-wing class warrior Manc who used to host a radio football show (until he spent an hour abusing British soldiers) called on everyone to refuse to pay their council tax and utility bills, as they can't jail everybody.A far-Left ex-Australian soap "star" regular keeps calling for a revolution. Only on Monday he was relishing the coming Tube strike with the police having to fight grown men instead of students. Is no one aware of the hatred towards Thatcher even now?- Wally Toynbee, England, 14/1/2011 11:16Click to rateRating1Report abuseWhen Martin was given a column I was surprised how good it was - particularly for a football writer. Much better than a great many "specialists". I was aware of his Left-wing leanings but have been taken aback at how biased or perhaps ill-informed this piece is. Before any facts had come out The New York Times and other Left-wing outlets jumped to making ridiculous conclusions . Even when some of the facts did come out the BBC and Jon Snow of Ch 4 news were still peddling the line about "Right-wing hate".Americans of both parties have always used war metaphors - we do to a lesser extent over here. Now we know a friend of the mentally ill pot smoker who committed the murders: didn't watch television, didn't follow the political news, didn't watch Glenn Beck or Fox. And yet Martin still comes up with this. It's so bad someone like Yasmin Alibhai Brown could have written it.He could just have easily shot his teacher and classmates - if they hadn't had him removed. - Wally Toynbee, England, 14/1/2011 10:09Click to rateRating12Report abuseWhat a biased article. The kind of piece I would expect to find in the Guardian or the New York Times. Not a word about the far worse rhetoric of the left.I lived in the United States for nine years. I can assure you, Mr. Samuel, that the language of Sarah Palin and other conservatives is mild indeed compared to that of their political opponents. The vitriol aimed at George W Bush was astonishing. I remember in particular a Democrat presidential debate during the 2004 election in which the various Democrat candidates tried to outdo each other in their attacks on Bush. It took my breath away. But there was not a murmur of disapproval from the overwhelmingly liberal US media.One talk show host openly called for Bush to be assassinated. Bush was routinely compared to Hitler.Democrats and their many friends in the media accused Sarah Palin and her allies of inciting the massacre in Tuscon. Palin was simply defending herself (in her usual clumsy way).- Maria Laurence, Weston-super-Mare, UK, 14/1/2011 09:53Click to rateRating15Report abuseThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.Add your commentName:Town & Country:Your name and location will appear next to your comment.You have 1000 characters left.We welcome your opinions.
