I realized Ive missed a couple of days before the third  and thats what I mean when I said God knows.  As the song goes, On the third day of Christmas my true love game to me  three French hens. According to scripture, those three fattened fowl represent the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity.  Of course, there have been some rearrangements of the lyrics like: The 1982 version by Second City TV comic troupe converted the line stanza to, Three French toast. The 1987 version produced by Seattle radio personality Bob Rivers and his Comedy Corp that sing in tune, Man getting over being drunk: Hangovers. And the 1996 Jeff FoxworthyJeff Foxworthy variation that requests his love gave him, three shotgun shells. All toll; you can pick the version that best represents you. Im sticking with the original. I dont want to make you know who mad.         1 of 2         Third Stanza of the Twelve Days of Christmas Song      Nathaniel Hines is based in Florianpolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  Brazil (30.2%) United States of America (28.6%) Canada (9.5%) Philippines (6.3%) 9 other countries (17.5%)           READ MORE: Twelve Days of Christmas, Christmas Carol, Three French Hens, Brazil, Florianopolis, Jeff Foxworthy, The Twelve Days of Christmas, Bob Rivers, your-story   More News From: Florianpolis :  Brazil     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 18            Reply  Posted By     Adrian Holman|about 1 yearagoThat is some cool info about a song most people sing without having a clue that there is meaning underlying this song.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoYeah. I could have written a ton more, but I've always wondered what all that stuff meant.            Reply  Posted By     SirJohn|about 1 yearagoThe song "twelve days of Christmas was originally used as a outline for Catechism lessons. Here is a bit of an explaination.On the 1st day of Christmas my true love gave to me...A Partridge in a Pear TreeThe partridge in a pear tree is Jesus the Christ, the Son of God, whose birthday we celebrate on December 25, the first day of Christmas. In the song, Christ is symbolically presented as a mother partridge that feigns injury to decoy predators from her helpless nestlings, recalling the expression of Christ's sadness over the fate of Jerusalem: "Jerusalem! Jerusalem! How often would I have sheltered you under my wings, as a hen does her chicks, but you would not have it so . . . ." (Luke 13:34)On the 2nd day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Two Turtle DovesThe Old and New Testaments, which together bear witness to God's self-revelation in history and the creation of a people to tell the Story of God to the world.On the 3rd day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Three French HensThe Three Theological Virtues: 1) Faith, 2) Hope, and 3) Love (1 Corinthians 13:13)On the 4th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Four Calling BirdsThe Four Gospels: 1) Matthew, 2) Mark, 3) Luke, and 4) John, which proclaim the Good News of God's reconciliation of the world to Himself in Jesus Christ.On the 5th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Five Gold RingsThe first Five Books of the Old Testament, known as the Torah or the Pentateuch: 1) Genesis, 2) Exodus, 3) Leviticus, 4) Numbers, and 5) Deuteronomy, which gives the history of humanity's sinful failure and God's response of grace in the creation of a people to be a light to the world.On the 6th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Six Geese A-layingThe six days of creation that confesses God as Creator and Sustainer of the world (Genesis 1).On the 7th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Seven Swans A-swimmingThe seven gifts of the Holy Spirit: 1) prophecy, 2) ministry, 3) teaching, 4) exhortation, 5) giving, 6) leading, and 7) compassion (Romans 12:6-8; cf. 1 Corinthians 12:8-11)On the 8th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Eight Maids A-milkingThe eight Beatitudes: 1) Blessed are the poor in spirit, 2) those who mourn, 3) the meek, 4) those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, 5) the merciful, 6) the pure in heart, 7) the peacemakers, 8) those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. (Matthew 5:3-10)On the 9th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Nine Ladies DancingThe nine Fruit of the Holy Spirit: 1) love, 2) joy, 3) peace, 4) patience, 5) kindness,6) generosity, 7) faithfulness, 8) gentleness, and 9) self-control. (Galatians 5:22)On the 10th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Ten Lords A-leapingThe ten commandments: 1) You shall have no other gods before me; 2) Do not make an idol; 3) Do not take God's name in vain; 4) Remember the Sabbath Day; 5) Honor your father and mother; 6) Do not murder; 7) Do not commit adultery; 8) Do not steal; 9) Do not bear false witness; 10) Do not covet. (Exodus 20:1-17)On the 11th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Eleven Pipers PipingThe eleven Faithful Apostles: 1) Simon Peter, 2) Andrew, 3) James, 4) John, 5) Philip, 6) Bartholomew, 7) Matthew, 8) Thomas, 9) James bar Alphaeus, 10) Simon the Zealot, 11) Judas bar James. (Luke 6:14-16). The list does not include the twelfth disciple, Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus to the religious leaders and the Romans.On the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...Twelve Drummers DrummingThe twelve points of doctrine in the Apostles' Creed: 1) I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 2) I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. 3) He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. 4) He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell [the grave]. 5) On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. 6) He will come again to judge the living and the dead. 7) I believe in the Holy Spirit, 8) the holy catholic Church, 9) the communion of saints, 10) the forgiveness of sins, 11) the resurrection of the body, 12) and life everlasting.

Reply  Posted By     asikhagafoor|about 1 yearagoThis is a extremely interesting article,            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|about 1 yearagoI had a lot of fun researching. As it plays during this time of year, it dawned on me that I didn't know what all those things really meant. I thought others might share the same position.            Reply  Posted By     George Vieto|about 1 yearagoI liked the article. Nice to know what the three hens represented in the song.
