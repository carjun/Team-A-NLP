And if that doesnt make choosing a dog food difficult enough, there are many different brands, too. A trip to the pet store or supermarket will provide you with a virtual cornucopia of dog foods. So which ones are really the best? Several make the claim that theyre the one most often recommended by veterinarians or breeders. So how does a concerned dog owner know which is the healthiest dog food to buy? Lamb and rice dog foodOne of the best dog foods on the market is Flint River Ranch dog food. Sometimes this brand is called River Ranch dog food, or simply River dog food. Whats so great about Flint River Ranch dog food? For one thing, its made with human-grade ingredients. In other words, this dog food is made of stuff that you would eat! Its a free-range chicken, lamb and rice dog food. Flint River Ranch dog food contains no by-products, no unhealthy fillers of any kind, no color additives, and no synthetic preservatives. River ranch dog food is an all natural dog food, and theres also an all natural puppy food available. Most veterinarians will tell you that a natural ingredients dog food is the healthiest dog food. River Ranch dog food is a corn free dog foodAnother great thing about River Ranch dog food is that its easily digested. Because its baked twice, the ingredients are more easily broken down by your dogs digestive system. Also, the fact that the particles in River Ranch dog food are small makes them easier to digest. The grains used in River Ranch dog food include rice and whole wheat instead of corn, which many dog foods contain. This is important because corn is very difficult for dogs to digest, so a corn free dog food is much healthier. Plus, this corn free dog food is concentrated. This means your dog eats less to get the proper amount of calories, vitamins, and minerals. Why is this important? Because if your dog eats less, it poops less! Fewer doggie piles for you to have to clean up. This can be a pretty big deal when you have dogs of a giant breed like I do.If you have a dog with a finicky digestive system, youll love this lamb and rice dog food formula. I have two Great Danes who will eat anything, so finding a dog food they like isnt a problem. The problem is that many Danes are susceptible to bloat and other dangerous digestive conditions, so I have to be careful about what they eat. My harlequin male throws up his food often, but hes never had any problems with Flint River Ranch dog food. I guess thats because its so gentle to his delicate system. Ironic to think of a Great Dane as delicate, isnt it? Unfortunately, its true! Part of my dogs problem is that he doesnt chew  he gulps. Even if the kibble is large, the big boy seems to swallow it whole, so its no wonder he throws up a lot. River Ranch dog food solves this problem with their small pieces. Even if the giant pooch barely chews his food, the Flint River dog food kibble is easy to digest, not only because of the ingredients, but also because the small particles mean more surface area.All natural dog food - natural ingredients dog foodIf some owners really knew what was in their dogs food, theyd be very alarmed. These include potentially dangerous preservatives like BHA, BHT, and other chemicals that have possibly been linked to cancer, organ dysfunction, dental disease, and overall poor health. Dog food is supposed to help improve a dogs health  not undermine it!River Ranch dog food doesnt have these chemical additives because its an all natural dog food, a natural ingredients dog food.About dog food allergiesJust like humans, dogs can have food allergies. Dog food allergies are often due to chemicals added to the foods, and not the foods themselves. Since River Ranch dog food doesnt use chemical preservatives or other synthetic additives, it largely eliminates the possibility of dog food allergies. River dog food is a great dog food for allergies. Will your dog like it?River dog food is highly palatable. In taste tests, it consistently scores in the 90s, while most other brands considered premium dog food usually score only in the 80s. Dog foods are scored on a scale of 1-100 for taste.Buy dog food onlineIf you prefer to buy dog food online, youre in luck.

Good review Habee but not sure if I can get this brand in Oz, I'll have to try online.RobinLC10 months ago I use to use FRR dog food. My dog Kota loved it. Unfortunately since it had to be shipped I decided to switch when a TCS was built in my area. I still do recommend this brand though! For their cat food I don't recommend it unless they've changed their formula within the last year or so. Their focus is more on the quality of their dog food and their cat food suffered.habee10 months ago LOL! Sorry, Ann - I couldn't help myself!habee10 months ago Thanks, HH.
