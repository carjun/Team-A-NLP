His        16-year-old daughter was arrested soon after  the alleged assault in        early November and faces similar charges  in juvenile court.Bradford, 43, who posted $2,500 bond Friday evening, and his daughter        could not be reached for comment.According to court documents, the confrontation started on Nov.  11, when        Bradford, his daughter and her brother, Bishop Bradford,  went to Lincoln        to complain about the girl's teacher, Tyson  Garner. The dad told an        associate principal he believed that  Garner, who is also a coach, had        made sexual remarks toward his  daughter, according to the documents.Garner  didn't return a call seeking comment, nor did Dallas Independent         School District spokesman Jon Dahlander.After  the associate principal told them she would look into the         allegations and as the family was about to leave the school's office,         Bradford asked for permission to see a friend who taught at  Lincoln.They were given a pass, but the family had other intentions, police said.The family exited the school's main building, went around to  Garner's        classroom and confronted him. They asked to talk to him  about the girl's        grades in his class and lured him into the  hallway.As Garner showed Bradford his daughter's  grades, records show, the        father punched Garner in the mouth,  causing him to bleed. Garner fought        back and pushed Bradford  against a wall of lockers.The commotion  attracted students from nearby classrooms out into        hallway,  police said. Bradford, still pinned against the wall, continued         trying to punch Garner.The daughter then jumped  on Garner's back and struck him in the head,        records show.  Students intervened and helped separate the Bradfords and        Garner.  The family tried to make a quick exit from the building, but         Dallas ISD police stopped them outside the school, where the daughter         was arrested. Her brother was not charged.After a Dallas ISD police investigation, an arrest warrant for Bradford         was issued in early December. He turned himself in Friday.Share this article:29 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Ex-lovers found dead in Arlington murder-suicideNext article Convicted rapist gets life in attack on SMU studentTo add a comment, please register or login.Add another commentLeave your comment1000 characters remainingSubmitWe welcome your comments on this story's topic.

I know for a fact that teens and tweens will lie about any and everything to get their way so don't just assume the girl is telling the truth. The father assaulting the teacher is wrong.57773029Flag this commentmarymh said on December 22, 2010 at 1:04 PMits not ok to go into a school and attack a teacher....period....57772027Flag this commentstraittalker said on December 21, 2010 at 11:46 PMGhetto trash father - ghetto trash daughter.57743767Flag this commentrjs123 said on December 21, 2010 at 3:40 PMone more question, since they arrested the girl at the scene of the fight, does that mean Dallas ISD police  is going to arrest everyone for fighting at school.  i just wonder exactly how many arrests are made by Dallas ISD police when someone throws some punches?57724654Flag this commentrjs123 said on December 21, 2010 at 3:30 PMi just wonder if there will be a follow-up story saying the girl lied or the teacher did bullying the girl by making sexual remarks to her.  seems to me that a little fist fight is nothing compared to false accusations about sexual misonduct or actual sexual misconduct between a teacher and student.  the more serious story is being ignored.57724147Flag this commentrjs123 said on December 21, 2010 at 3:27 PMso why is it when just about every story involving a teacher being stupid with a child most of the people want the teachers hide?  either throw em in jail and let thier new roomates take care of them to executing the grown-ups. it will be intresting to watch all the comments on the next time a teacher abuses a student.  where are all the pro anti-bullying law people. everyone sure was cheering when the new anti-bullying laws were passed.  and here is a father that probably felt he was going to get the run around and a coverup to protect a teacher that has been accused of basiclly bullying based on the new laws.57723999Flag this commentcemetrius said on December 21, 2010 at 2:22 PMbboop13- ) many Texas African Americans believe bullying their way through life, or calling racism is the way to get ahead when it only calls into play their true motives ...REALLY...... How do you know that. Do you know MOST Texas African Americans. I pray your kids are really much smarter than you.Was the teacher white? Where is racism coming from. I don't get it.  Lincoln High School in Dallas.....I highly doubt he is white.57719997Flag this commentbboop13 said on December 21, 2010 at 1:01 PMbillybear3 my reading comprehension is just fine.  That is why I have one child who went to Harvard and another who qualified for college before the age of 13.  The point is 1) teenagers make up things to get attention  2) words do not equal rape 3) many Texas African Americans believe bullying their way through life, or calling racism is the way to get ahead when it only calls into play their true motives 4) assault in the presence of your children does not teach them how a civilized society resolves a problem.57715049Flag this commentwiseowl said on December 21, 2010 at 12:49 PM@rjs123 - Are you an idiot? We live in a society of laws. So you think this father set a good example and handled the situation properly? I recant my previous question, you are an idiot.57714297Flag this commentrjs123 said on December 21, 2010 at 10:22 AMi cannot believe how many people are trashing the father and daughter for doing something about a teacher that they believe made sexual remarks to the daughter.  Had this father simply made a complaint and it didn't go anywhere and the next thing we hear is about a teacher taking a girl out and raping her, you all would have been saying how if it was yours family you would have taken matters into your own hands.it is simply amazing how many people yell for street justice, but when it happens everyone is so ready to blame the girl and her father for taking matters into thier own hands.  before i pass judgement on this family i want to know what really happened between the teacher and the kid.57704409Flag this commentdanta said on December 21, 2010 at 10:22 AMAlexanderstramp, sarcasm.  When you say one thing to highlight the absurd when you mean the opposite. Everyone else seems to get it. Based on the fact it tok the DPD a month to file charges, this is probably a simple assault charge, a misdemeanor, the same as any lily white father that tried to deck a coach that was making inappropriate statements around our daughters. He may have said something as simple as "Don't get your panties in a bunch ladies." or it could have been an invite to meet in his office after school for some one on one coaching; we don't know.  But yes it is Texas and what the dad did was neither unusual nor to far out of line.  Taking the kids with him and doing his little dance at school was. After all it took the state a month to even file charges and an administrator saying they would look into it usually means they won't.57704392Flag this commentbillybear3 said on December 21, 2010 at 9:25 AMbboop13: This story and the story in Allen has absolutely no similarities, none. Unless you think anyone black is one in the same. The girl in Allen was/is a high achiever from a family of high achievers that in 2010 was the 1st BLACK CHEERLEADER at the school. Hmm, probably a racist squad. This family lied about sexual innuendo then went on to assault the teacher. They are a family of questionable values. However, claiming sexual remarks in no way can be interpreted as claiming racism. Perhaps you should take some reading comprehension courses because obviously you have a problem with getting facts straight.57700119Flag this commentbillybear3 said on December 21, 2010 at 9:20 AMIDIOTS!!!57699788Flag this commentbboop13 said on December 21, 2010 at 9:17 AMWow, did they really think this would get their daughter a better grade?  When are we going to hear the cry of "racism"?  This is like the cheerleader in Allen who wrote a book about how she was treated unfairly when her performance didn't cut it and wants to claim it was due to race.  When you stop acting like thugs and earn your way, you won't need the racism blanket.  A wise woman told me as a child "the only difference between races are the ones we create for ourselves".  She is an African American who is now 107 years old, and still wise and wonderful.57699553Flag this commentkhaney11 said on December 21, 2010 at 8:49 AMIf I thought that someone had made sexual remarks to my 16 year old daughter, especially her teacher, I would have done A LOT worse to that person than what this guy did. The justice system is completly screwed up, so knowing that some creep could be walking around doing things like that to children and could very well not have any consequences would be enought to set most normal people off. Sometime you just have to take things into your own hands instead of waiting around for the state to do nothing about an issue. And to everyone making comments about the use of violence...some violence is in human nature. As long as there are humans on earth there will be violence. If you dont like it move to CA with the rest of the worthless bleeding heart liberals...you dont deserve to live in TX.57697902Flag this commentcyrusdevirus said on December 21, 2010 at 8:39 AMWhat a dysfunctional family !

This guy is a thug, he took matters into his own hands. What ever happened to due process?? This guy should never be allowed back on any school property, ever. as far as the daughter, she is probably nothing more than a liar!! she most likely could not get her way or he called her out and embarrassed her so... make up a little lie and turn it into a thug family thing....57683902Flag this commentdanta said on December 20, 2010 at 8:36 PMJust can't make you people happy at all.  Here we have an African American father actively involved in his child's life and education and still you complain. He even turned it into a family outing by bringing the son along.  There is just no pleasing some people. Geeze, just like my first wife. Move the couch over here, now move the chair, now don't beat up the coach.57679311Flag this commentpuppie said on December 20, 2010 at 7:34 PMNice family.57677033Flag this commentkeithstone said on December 20, 2010 at 7:12 PMThis will cost Bradford a little chunk o change.

I'm not disagreeing with you, but I wonder if you will say why.57675244Flag this commentrmparton said on December 20, 2010 at 6:44 PMSo, gpbob, it would be OK to assault the guy if you could do it when no one was looking?  Surely, that's not what you meant but that's what your comment said.  Great example for the parent to set for his kids.  Sounds like the coach did a pretty good job of defending himself once he knew he was in a fight.  The girl had to jump on his back to keep him from spanking the old man?  She needs to be in juvie until she turns 18 and the old man needs to do a stretch in the Texas Correctional Hotel.57675187Flag this commentbeguine said on December 20, 2010 at 6:43 PMbrilliant behavior by some savages of extreme intelligence57675119Flag this commentscottfwtx said on December 20, 2010 at 6:10 PMWho would name their son Bishop?57673984Flag this commentrookie5 said on December 20, 2010 at 5:33 PMmeth heads probably....57672469Flag this commentjilldavenport said on December 20, 2010 at 4:47 PMIgnorant TRASH!
