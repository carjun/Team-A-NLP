Many of the companies on this list are partially doomed by their industry. Airlines, cable companies, and banks for example, are often maligned by their customers. Retail firms and companies that were sensitive to downturns in the economy had to lay off significant numbers of employees during the recession, which bred resentment.But several companies you might have expected on this list arent. AIG became a pariah after its federal bailout, but it does not show up on the list thanks to high earnings over the past year, as its stock has nearly doubled. Goldman Sachs, that infamous vampire squid of Wall Street, earned a fair share of negative press and popular resentment since the credit crunch. But Goldman also ranked near the top in categories like customer satisfaction, shareholder satisfaction, employee satisfaction and CEO approval. GM has faced similar obstacles, but its also seen a spate of good news in the last few months, with profits, hires, and a successful IPO winning it more positive press coverage.More..Why am I not surprised that Bank of America tops the list?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAT&T, Bank of America, BP, Citibank, Dell, Direct TV, McDonalds, Nokia, The 15 Most Hated Companies in America, ToyotaRead moreBanks are working on NEW fees to replace the old ones Congress took awayJanuary 5, 2011jamesb101No commentsAint this a bitch!In response to new regulations, banks are carefully guarding one of their most reliable profit streams: the fees they charge customers for basic banking services. And this may mean a wave of new penalties and fees for consumers, theWall Street Journal reports.As rules under last summers Dodd-Frank financial reform begin to take shape, banks fear for their card businesses, theWall Street Journal notes. Banks are considering a new set of debit card fees, in addition to fees on checking accounts. From theWSJ, a partial list:Annual fees of up to $30 for people with debit cards.Increased ATM fees for non-customers who withdraw money from a bank.Penalty fees on checking accounts, imposed if customers fail to maintain a certain balance, or fail to meet a monthly direct deposit minimum. Chase already imposes such fees. Customers of the former Washington Mutual, now owned by JPMorgan Chase, will see these fees next month.If you bring us more business, you will get rewarded with better pricing, BofA spokesperson Robert Stickler told theWSJ. The bank has estimated thatDodd-Frank could cost it 80 percent of its debit card revenue,Bloomberg reported.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, The Economy, Updatesbank fee's, Bank of America, New Bank Fee'sRead moreBank of America stops WikiLeaks Transactions..December 18, 2010jamesb101No commentsBank of America To Block WikiLeaksThis decision is based upon our reasonable belief that WikiLeaks may be engaged in activities that are, among other things, inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments, the bank said.The action comes as WikiLeaks says it plans to release information about banks. The sites founder has previously said it has a trove of documents on Bank of America.Other financial institutions, including MasterCard Inc. and eBay Inc.s PayPal, have also stopped handling payments for WikiLeaks, moves which hurt the sites ability to accept donations and support publishing efforts. The websites of some companies that have cut ties with WikiLeaks have come under cyber attack in recent weeks by hackers who support its mission.Reached by phone, Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri declined further comment to The Associated Press on Saturday.WikiLeaks responded to Bank of Americas announcement with a Twitter message urging supporters to stop doing business with the bank.We ask that all people who love freedom close out their accounts at Bank of America, WikiLeaks said in a Twitter post Saturday.

Homeowners, lawyers and analysts have been citing such problems for the last few years, but it appears to have reached such intensity recently thatbanks are beginning to re-examine whether all of the foreclosure papers were prepared properly.In some cases, documents have been signed by employees who say they have not verified crucial information like amounts owed by borrowers. Other problems involve questionable legal notarization of documents, in which, for example, the notarizations predate the actual preparation of documents  suggesting that signatures were never actually reviewed by a notary.Other problems occurred when notarizations took place so far from where the documents were signed that it was highly unlikely that the notaries witnessed the signings, as the law requires.On still other important documents, a single officials name is signed in such radically different ways that some appear to be forgeries. Additional problems have emerged when multiple banks have all argued that they have the right to foreclose on the same property, a result of a murky trail of documentation and ownership..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesBank of America, Court orders, GMACMortgage, Home foreclosures, JPMorgan Chase, Paperwork problems, State Attorney Generals, The US Attorney's Office'sRead moreBank of America joins GMAC and JPMorgan/Chase in halting forclosures over paperwork problems..October 2, 2010jamesb1011 commentI said this was a big oneThe wife and I spend most of the day going over this caperThe banks have admotted that routinely DO NOT even review forclosure paperworkThey just press on with the process..Im knida worried here..Im sure the banks are going resist going back and reviewing ANY old paperworkWhy?First..

In order to win over hesitant parties, the bank agreed to a number of concessions: raising $18.8 billion in new capital; shifting some of its bonus pay to restricted stock instead of cash; and agreeing to shed $4 billion of assets. We discussed with them what they felt we needed and there was a negotiation around it, said Bank of America spokesman Robert Stickler.While regulators wanted Bank of America to shrink as a precondition of their TARP exit, they wanted to avoid the company cutting back on lending in a rush to downsize. The $4 billion of assets the company needs to get rid of will consist of business lines or strategic investments, such as its stake in China Construction Bank, Mr. Stickler said.In the end this move is about people getting paid more money..the spot light has moved onand these guys and girls are assuring that they get those big salaries, stock options, deferred compensation and other perksno matter how the media chastised them last year.and they will.you wait and see.This deal will put pressure on the big companies (J.P.
