As the department struggles with the city's new payroll system, officers continue to wait for their money  13 days before Christmas.A special task force was created to deal with the problem, and it has been making some progress -- some new checks were distributed on Friday.The police department and the city admit that with any major system change, mistakes will be made and there will be learning curve. But for some officers, it's still taking too long to get the money they earned.The Fort Worth Police Association logged onto Facebook Sunday to send this message."Members, we understand your frustration with the new pay system and believe that it is unacceptable that some officers have failed to receive a check." The Association claims the city is ignoring the devastating hardship hitting some employees.The problem is the city's new payroll system.At the pre-Council meeting last week, Chief Jeff Halstead gave an update."We are looking seriously at how much time it was taking officers out of their patrol cars to do this job, andI didn't like that either," he said.According to the Fort Worth Police Department, there have been errors in every pay period since the system went online in early October.The mistakes range from overtime issues to human input, but those have cost some police employees hundreds to thousands of dollars.The volume of paycheck corrections has created a backlog.In a statement, the police department said the chief has been working with the city's human resources, IT and finance departments to reduce the number of needed corrections."The chief has reassigned civilian and administrative sworn personnel to assist in expediting payments to our employees. This includes working through the weekend, day and night, to bring resolution."City leaders have voiced their concerns."I want to know what's being done to ensure this process, this problem doesn't continue a, and b, that everything is being done to ensure that this doesn't reoccur," said Fort Worth mayor Mike Moncrief.The City of Fort Worth said in a statement: "There is no such thing as an error-free payroll system in any major organization, but the large majority of the 7,000 checks issued each pay period across all departments have been correct... It's important to note that the errors in the Police Department and other departments are the result of human input errors, not system errors."The City Council is expected to get an informal report on the pay system on Tuesday.E-mail: mdiaz@wfaa.comStatement from the Fort Worth Police Department:Chief Halstead is working with the city's HR, IT, and Finance departments in an effort to reduce the amount of corrections. The chief has reassigned civilian and administrative sworn personnel to assist in expediting payments to our employees. This includes working through the weekend, day and night to bring resolution. Our greatest asset is our employees and we are working very hard to minimize any financial impact. The greatest challenge has been the sheer volume of time sheets submitted by employees needing to make adjustments in the hours they reported working. Police work is not a 9 to 5 job and it's extremely challenging when an officer is scheduled to get off of work at 11pm but finds themselves confronted with a DWI on the way back to the station. This type of scenario occurs daily/nightly which, under the new system, requires personnel to submit changes to the payroll team charged with entering in those changes. The volume of these changes were not anticipated.Since we have identified this as our biggest challenge we have dedicated more resources, more training, and alternative solutions to address it. We believe that once we resolve the backlog of corrections we will be in good shape to move forward and minimize potential future errors.The good news is that a Task Force was established last week and since then, corrected pay checks were distributed much faster. With any major new system change involving a significant shift in organizational culture, errors will be made and there will be a learning curve to overcome. That is what we are currently experiencing. Our goal is to minimize errors affecting employee paychecks city wide, work to quickly resolve any outstanding corrections, and get employees correctly paid because we know they have bills to pay and we deeply care about them. The chief has expressed his desire in alignment with the mayor and city council members to face this challenge head on and to make the necessary adjustments in order to minimize any unintended consequences as we continue the transition to a new payroll system. We are fully engaged with the challenges we face and we are addressing them as quickly as possible by working together with the Police Officer's Association, Mayor and Council, and various departments within our city. We are making progress in reducing the volume of backlogged change requests and corrections. Statement from the City (Jason Lamers):Correction checks are being issued as quickly as possible through a deliberate correction process once the department provides the information to our Human Resources Department. I do understand however, that there is a back log of corrections in the Police Department that still haven't been turned over to Human Resources. I know PD is working hard to get these moving forward. The project team has also been working through the weekend and should have updated numbers for the City Council on Tuesday.Keep in mind, there is no such thing as an error free payroll system in any major organization, but the large majority of the 7000 checks issued each pay period across all departments have been correct. Every other department outside of the Police Department is running on the new system with relatively few problems, and the Police Department is making progress thanks to our project team. It's important to note that the errors in the Police Department and other departments are the result of human input errors, not system errors. City staff is working to address the time entry problems. While it may not be immediate, any employee who has received an incorrect paycheck will be paid accurately and completely as soon as possible. However, Fort Worth has a strong financial standing, and we will not - nor do we need to - set aside our financial controls during this stabilization process.

Thank you .Comments: Displaying 1 - 15 of 20honeymoon said on December 13, 2010 at 10:24 PMIf a company gets a new system, management needs to make sure to train its employees on how to use it.  DO NOT mess with employees money!  It is time to clean the house and get new people that know what they are doing.  Start with the head of the department!57308479Flag this commentdanta said on December 13, 2010 at 7:52 PMmitrow, bad is bad. I have Indian contractors I deal with daily, or nightly as the case might be and only rarely have misunderstandings. One thing we do is actually train them to think instead of following a script. We also rotate them into the US so they can work with our on shore team and learn how and why we do things. It also helps if you understand their culture but not all companies bother with more than scripts. I'm guessing PeopleSoft is one of those.  We do maintain a large US team too so that may be part of the difference.57302546Flag this commentgpbob said on December 13, 2010 at 4:56 PMHours later, and I'm still laughing at this one!!!57295059Flag this commentcitizen1910 said on December 13, 2010 at 3:49 PMredracer- I'm sure that Ft. Worth has direct deposit. Most companies/cities of any size do. It's simply a matter of garbage in, garbage out. If an employee's time is not entered into any payroll system, PeopleSoft or other H/R software, correctly, then their resulting  paycheck is wrong. Employees can't just go to the credit union to "borrow" paycheck funds. There are tax & SS matters to consider plus the resulting nightmare of trying to reconcile "borrowed" funds to funds due the employee. Lastly, do you really want city employees to use tax dollar backed credit cards to pay for their rent and day to day essentials? That's ludicrous.57292064Flag this commentredracer said on December 13, 2010 at 3:11 PMWouldn't it be simpler to use a direct deposit system, and cheaper too?Isn't there a police credit union that officers who need some cash could borrow from under these circumstances? Don't the police have credit cards?Why is this even news?57289982Flag this commentmitrow said on December 13, 2010 at 3:04 PMDid you know that PeopleSoft works out of India.  Their help desk, i/o clerks, most of the programmers are located in India.  Having expirience with these folks at my job, I know first hand just how hard it is to deal with a problem.  One MAJOR contributing factor is the TIME difference between here and India.  HOWEVER, there is no excuse for people not getting their paychecks when due.57289647Flag this commentharperwc said on December 13, 2010 at 2:41 PModd that the mistakes seem to create only payment shortages and no overages. i bet there are checks and balances to make sure no overages get sent out...57288498Flag this commentcitizen1910 said on December 13, 2010 at 1:34 PMPeopleSoft, really? How interesting! Belo (DMN, WFAA & various other entities) uses PeopleSoft as their payroll system. Belo is certainly not an 8-5 company. I still say that their training program was bad or the payroll employees are bad.57284952Flag this commentihatepeoplesoft said on December 13, 2010 at 12:16 PMThe payroll system is called people soft. All you have to do is go to google and type in peoplesoft lawsuit to know what an incredible piece of junk this system is. It seems like everyone who uses it hates it. Here is what I dont get. The city is in a huge budget crunch, cutting police officer benefits and such and they quietly spend 60 MILLION DOLLARS, 60 MILLION DOLLARS! on a proven broken payroll system with page after page of lawsuits. hmmmmm, wonder if there was a kickback involved with that. Hey WFAA, go find out which city council person is driving a new Bentley.57280379Flag this commentbelfastnow said on December 13, 2010 at 10:58 AMIt's not just the Police Department getting short-changed. Nice of the Startlegram to focus on the Police but there are other City employees getting messed over with this new system. the system doesn't meet the needs of the City payroll, full stop.57275684Flag this commentdanta said on December 13, 2010 at 9:29 AMAny IT projects person can relate horror stories of changes made by the customer to a standard system that resulted in a systems meltdown, but any good IT projects person can relate that you never shut the old system down before the new system works. This is negligence bordering on criminal. If that happened in my shop, heads would be rolling all over the place. I take it that the city failed to get some type of performance guaranty or late install penalties in place or even took the time to do an upfront analysis of the system requirements, like 24/7 time keeping and post period backdates. You Ft. Worthians need to be getting the torches and pitchforks ready.57270667Flag this commentfeduptxgranny said on December 13, 2010 at 8:23 AMWhat a disgrace!  You ask these people to put their lives on the line daily and the money make isn't even worth it and then you owe them money and have the audacity to blame it on "the system".  Who are you kidding?  Have you heard of cutting manual checks?  FT WORTH YOU ARE A DISGRACE!57267463Flag this commentlucmar said on December 13, 2010 at 8:05 AMThis has been going on since October, and still hasn't been corrected, something is very wrong here.  The city needs to get their 60 million dollars back, or else slap a lawsuit on the morons who sold them this piece of junk.  Probably from China.57266559Flag this commentgpbob said on December 13, 2010 at 7:38 AMIdiots...57265319Flag this commentscottfwtx said on December 13, 2010 at 7:35 AMtigger1, what nerve!
