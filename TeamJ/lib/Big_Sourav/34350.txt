This year about one in four children (14million) will suffer an injury that will require medical attention.  Of those, 120,000 will be permanentlydisabled from accidents.  Child safetymust be kept first and foremost in your mind at all times.  Safety covers many areas of home hazards andit is important as parents to recognize the less obvious hazards.  Additionally, it is important to know what todo until medical help arrives if your child has a serious accident.  Taking a first aid course through the YMCA orthrough the Red Cross is helpful so you can learn CPR.You could put your baby in a protective glass cage and theywould probably still find a way to injure themselves.  It seems injuries just go along with childhood.  Our goal is to make their environment as safeas possible to minimize those injuries.Many parents do childproof their homes, strictly use propercar seats, keep a well stocked first aid kit for emergencies but that may notbe enough to prevent some type of injury requiring medical attention.Common Types of InjuriesThe most common type of childhood injuries are: Burns are one of the most common accidental injuries.  They include sunburns, and burns from stoves,fireplaces, lamps, matches, lit cigarettes, wood stoves, and hot liquid fromhot water to coffee.  Mayo Clinicrecommends that for a minor burn you hold the burned area under cool (not cold)water for 10-15 minutes or until the pain subsides.  Use cool compresses if you are unable toimmerse the burned area under water.  Coverthe area with a sterile gauze bandage.Head injuries are caused primarily by falls from highchairs, beds, furniture, stairs and playground equipment and immediate require medicalevaluation.Choking on food or small objects is a common emergency.  Call 911 and use the Heimlich maneuver if thechild is turning blue and not coughing.Strangulation caused by strings, ribbons, ties, cords fromdrapes or blinds, clothing and sometimes household appliance cords is another thing to avoid.Nose injuries usually caused by running into stationaryobjects, falling on a hard surface or from a flying object, or it maybe fromthe fist or foot of another child.  Items stuck in a nostril like small toys, stones, chewablevitamins, pebbles or peas are something children do and this sometimes takes a pediatrician to remove the object.Cuts and scratches may be caused by almost anything, such asfinger nails, pets, any sharp object, scissors and sharp objects in the yard and usually need just a little first aid.Fractures and sprains may be caused by hard falls aschildren break bones more easily than adults due to soft areas called growthplates near the ends of the bones. Ofr course, this means a trip to the hospital.Contusions which are bruises under the skin are caused bybumps and falls. Sometimes a little ice will quickly reduce the swelling.Insect stings or bites can be a problem and your first aid kit will have some treatment.Muscle strains may occur after a child starts playing alittle rougher or after starting a new sport.A pulled elbow can occur if you pick your child up by onearm, jerking his arm forcefully or swinging him by one arm.  The forearm bone actually slips out of thejoint. This is very dangerous for your child and should be avoided.Eye injuries can be caused by dust, sand or many types offoreign matter that gets into the childs eye. Rinse the eye gently with tepid water.   Child SafetyChildproof Your HomeFor babies and toddlers you home and there aremany things to consider.  Most of theitems listed are inexpensive.
