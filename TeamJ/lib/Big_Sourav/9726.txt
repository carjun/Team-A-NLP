Punditty was joking, but Obama chief of staff prediction proves true - relatively speaking    Washington :  DC :  USA|Jan 07, 2011By Punditty        8 1     Views: 320      Jan. 7, 2011 In October, after President Obamas original Chief of Staff Rahm EmanuelEmanuel announced he would be leaving the administration and Obama named Pete Rouse as a temporary replacement, The Punditty Project had some fun with the situation. TPP jokingly suggested that either once-disgraced but newly re-energized former Illinois Gov. Rod BlagojevichRod Blagojevich or soon-to-be former Chicago Mayor Richard DaleyMayor Richard Daley would replace Emanuel. It was, in every sense of the word, a joke. No matter. The joke has turned out to be true, at least relatively speaking. Daleys brother, former Clinton-era Secretary of Commerce and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co executive Goldman Sachs William Daley, will be taking over for Rouse as Obamas chief of staff. Since Wall Street interests are woefully under-represented in the current administration, this is a great move by Obama. It will ensure that banks get their fair share of tax-payer dollars, or money printed out of thin air by the Federal Reserve. Whatever.  For those who want to remember a happier time when the thought of a Daley in the White House was just a joke, see Pundittys October column about the big Blago-Daley debate here. Meanwhileno joking about Obama picking Blago to succeed outgoing press secretary Robert GibbsRobert Gibbs. You never know where something like that might lead.
