The preliminary complaint will include the murder of Judge John Roll, and the shootings of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and several of her staffers.Formal charges are expected this afternoon, Mueller told reporters, though he said its still unclear when Loughner will first appear in court.Mueller said he was not going to preclude charges under domestic terrorism statutes as the investigation continues, and that investigation will focus in part on Loughners possible connections to white supremacist groups..Note..This Dog hopes that the case goes to the State courts alsoAnd that State prosecutors get the first try at the case.We must not let the death of the one Federal Judge however tragic overshadow the fact that 6 others died in the shooting,including a childShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesArizona State Prosecutors, FBI Director Mueller, Federal domestic terrorism charges, Federal Homicide/Assault Charges, Going Federal, Pima County Prosecutors, Pima County Sheriff, Satate Assault Charges, State Homicide Charges, The FBI, The US attorney for Arizona, Tucson District AttorneyRead moreIts Been A Good Month for the Daley Family..The Oligarch Kings.January 9, 2011jamesb101No commentsPicture White HouseIts definitely been a good month for the Daley family of Chicago. December saw Richard Michael Daley, the Mayor of Chicago, surpass the term of tenure that his old man Richard Joseph Daley also held forbeing Mayor. Richard Daley was Mayor from 1955 through to the day of his death in 1976. An astonishing reign.Richard Michael Daley has managed to pass that twenty one year stint on December 26th meaning that father and son ruled (and still rule) Chicago for 42 of the last 55 years.The Daley family have had Chicago in a political lockdown for generations. They are a small example of local oligarchies in action.The old boy was accused of being an old fashioned operator, mobilising armies of Union members to force through his point of view. A Democrat National Convention member in 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964 Daley made sure that the party and its leaders reflected the Daley view of America..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesMayors of Chicago, President Obama, Richard Joeseph Daley, Richard Michael Daley, The Daley Family of Chicago, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, US Secretary of State, White House and Wall Street, William DaleyRead morePima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the DayJanuary 9, 2011jamesb10113 commentsPima County SheriffClarence W. Dupnik(Credit:AP Photo/Chris Morrison)The mans plain sense of out range and the political brinkmanship in his state is wonderful for its directness and frankness..Political manuerib=ng since President Obama has come into office HAS gotten worst..Im with my friend Jack in saying that political gamesmanship isnt the whole reason for the senseless shooting down in TucsonBut it sure doesnt help things.There have ALWAYS been crazies out thereWe can go back and see people throwing things at Presidents.Shooting at them.Seriously or not..People threaten politicians daily..While some call it excessiveElected politicians around the country have police officers accompanying them in protective details everyday.But the Sheriffis rightThings need to calm down out thereWere ALL Americans Trying to get thru this journey.In a more perfect union.That is ever changing..AndChanging is life..It never stops..***Pima County Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik, who is overseeing the investigation of Saturdays mass shooting that critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D), became an overnight sensation with his remarks that the vitriol in todays political discourse contributed to the incident and that Arizona has become a mecca for prejudice and bigotry.Dupniks name wasa top search term on Twitter Saturday night, with many of the tweets thanking him for his candor, and overnight,a Facebook page titled Clarence Dupnik is my Hero sprung up.In a news conference Saturday evening, Dupnik condemned the atmosphere of hatred and bigotry that he said has gripped the nation and suggested that the 22-year-old suspect being held in the shooting was mentally ill and therefore more susceptible to overheated messages in the media.Theres reason to believe that this individual may have a mental issue. And I think people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible to vitriol, he said during his televised remarks. People tend to pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that. That may be free speech, but its not without consequences.His remarks especially resonated with liberals, who even before the name of the suspect was released suggested that the shooter may have had been incited by the tea party. There is no indication that the suspect, Jared Lee Lougner, identified with the tea party or was politically conservative. During the campaign, liberal pundits and politicians asserted that the sometimes militant language some conservative politicians used could incite violence..MoreOf course the knuckle head GOP Senator Kyl really doesnt get it..Kyl: Arizona Sheriffs Remarks InappropriateBrian Beutler | January 9, 2011, 11:50AMSen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ)In a Sunday morning appearance on Face the Nation, Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl (R-AZ) took issue with Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, who criticized Arizona hours after the Giffords shooting.I didnt really think that that had any part in a law enforcement briefing, Kyl said.In a candid moment at a press conference on Saturday, Dupnik said his state had become ground zero for the sort of political rhetoric that foments violence.Read more And we would hope that Sarah Palin will come to her senses and move way from stunts like putting crosshairs on pictures of Democrats..Palin Aide: Crosshairs On Target List Not Actually Gun SightsBrian Beutler | January 9, 2011, 10:52AMFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah PalinAn aide to Sarah Palin claims the crosshairs depicted in her now-infamous target list of Democrats were not actually gun-sights, and that its obscene and appalling to blame Palin for the shooting.We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights. It was simply cross-hairs like youd see on maps,saidRebecca Mansour on the Tammy Bruce radio show. Moreover, there was nothing irresponsible about the image, and to draw a line connecting Palin and Saturdays shooting is obscene and appalling.You can see the original image below.

Stop it. Dont go there, trust me. Trust me. Trust me. You will not like the blow-back, I assure you.Palin posted a statement on Facebook around 3 p.m., calling for peace and justice. She did not make any direct reference to the debate over political rhetoric, playing out on her own Facebook page, which drew more than 3,000 comments.My sincere condolences are offered to the family of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and the other victims of todays tragic shooting in Arizona, Palin wrote. On behalf of Todd and my family, we all pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and justice.Palin, the original Mama Grizzly, had a famous line about how conservatives should not retrench, but instead should reload.How dare people politicize a political assassination!
