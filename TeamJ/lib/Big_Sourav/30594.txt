I know I can be sentenced with the death penalty but I still want to make this confession, Aseemanand reportedly told the magistrate at a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court, Indian media reported. He also told to the court that leaders of different Hindu organisations including Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Abhinav Bharat, Jai Vande Matram and Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, were also involved in the blasts. In his 42 page confessionary statement in Hindi, Aseemanand has exposed the inner workings of the terror network.

While, many Muslim were arrested by Indian Police in connection to the blasts. Assemanand, 59, was arrested from his hideout in Haridwar on November 19, last year for his involvement in Mecca Masjid blast in Hyderabad that left nine people dead. His name had also come up during the probe in Malegaon blast of 2008.        1 of 1         Swami Aseemanand confesses role in Samjhuta train blasts     Shinkansen is based in Karchi, Sind, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (69.6%) Pakistan (13.0%) United Kingdom (6.5%) Czech Republic (2.2%) 3 other countries (4.3%)           READ MORE: Indian Hindu extremist confesses role in Samjhuta train blasts, War Conflict, hindu extremists, Hindutva, Swami Aseemanand, Religious violence in India, Malegaon, Sangh Parivar, odd-news, Assemanand, India, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, new delhi, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Politics of India, Jatin Chatterjee, Abhinav Bharat, Religion in India, Jai Vande Matram, Vishva Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, islamic terrorism, Mecca Masjid, Chronology of terrorist incidents in India   More News From: New Delhi :  India     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         A CONFESSION BY HINDU EXTREMIST OF INVOLVING IN SAMJHUTA EXPRESS ...
