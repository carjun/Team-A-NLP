Proposition 19 (legalizing marijuana) may be getting the interest (at least thats what our web stats show) and the initiative (Prop 25coverage coming next week) changing the constitutional requirement to a simply majority for passing a budget may have the biggest long term impact, but the real slugfest is all about Proposition 23.

Janczyn / Groksurf s San Diego / August 11, 2010As noted in yesterdays water rates story, (08/10/10) the main supplier for most of San Diego Countys water is the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) and it holds great power when it comes to the cost and reliability of our water supply. So when MWD announced a stakeholder forum to examine the 2010 Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) Update there were naturally going to be many local water professionals in attendance. The IRP makes major changes to MWDs strategy for water reliability through the year 2035, including a bold plan to create a large storage buffer to serve as a backup supply against virtually any scenario.1 commentRead the full article Californias water storage dilemmaAugust 11, 2010by George Janczyn  / Groksurfs San Diego / August 9, 2010Many large reservoirs in California need to store and release water in a way that balances flood control needs against water supply needs (San Diegos reservoirs have limited flood control capability but were mainly designed for storage). Those state reservoir levels need to be lowered in late summer and fall in order to have enough capacity to capture and hold floodwaters that will come during the wet season, but they also need to retain enough to supply needed water in the dry months.0 commentsRead the full article City moves to end free juice off Newport lamp postsAugust 6, 2010OCEAN BEACH  It seems some people have found a way to steal electricity on the Ocean Beachs dime, but the city has a plan to put an end to the theft.Joe Castillo, a representatives with the City Streets Division, tells San Diego 6 that people are ripping off electricity from Ocean Beach lamp posts whose electrical sockets are meant for Farmers Market vendors.
