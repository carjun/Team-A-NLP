It's time to move on,'' Hoffman told the website. "This is more of a self-evaluation. I expect to pitch at a certain level and I had to be honest with myself that I wasn't certain I could maintain that anymore.''Hoffman, 43, went 2-7 with a 5.89 ERA and 10 saves with the Milwaukee Brewers last season, a year after making his seventh All-Star Game and logging 37 saves with a 1.83 ERA.In his prime, from 1996-2007 with the San Diego Padres, Hoffman befuddled hitters with a darting changeup that looked just like a fastball coming out of his hand but plummeted suddenly upon reaching the plate.The likely future Hall of Famer twice led the National League in saves  including a career-high of 53 in 1998  and converted at least 37 every season during that span, except for 2003, when he was limited to nine games because of an injury.Hoffman left the Padres as a free agent during an acrimonious contract dispute after the 2008 season and signed with the Brewers, but told MLB.com he will return to San Diego in a front-office capacity.Last September, Hoffman was carried off the field on his teammates' shoulders after becoming the first pitcher ever to record 600 career saves. He finished with 601 and a 2.87 career ERA.The New York Yankees' Mariano Rivera, who signed a two-year deal with the club this offseason, sits 42 saves behind Hoffman and will likely overtake him by the time he's done.Hoffman, however, figures to remain the NL leader for a long time, having spent his whole career in the older circuit.By Jorge L.

Hamilton also had the AL's top slugging percentage (.633) and OPS (1.044).By Jorge L.

Among the latter was Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who remains in critical condition with a bullet wound to the head.The memorial fund will be held by the Community Foundation for Southern Arizona and can be accessed at www.cfsoaz.org by clicking on the link to the Christina Taylor Green Memorial Fund."Our family has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love for our sweet Christina,'' John Green said in a statement released by the Dodgers. "This memorial fund will ensure her legacy for the children in our community.''Dallas Green, who managed the Phillies, Yankees and Mets and was also the Cubs' general manager, released a statement through the Phillies, saying:"This is such a tough time for (wife) Sylvia and I and for John and Roxanna and little Dallas. We thank everybody from the bottom of our hearts for their friendship, thoughts and prayers, especially the Phillies and our extended family in baseball. Somehow we will get through this, but right now our little nine-year-old granddaughter is not here and we're having a hard time with that.''By Jorge L.

"Really, I think that's what we've been saying all along.''Baseball is widely expected to increase the number of playoff participants from eight to 10, likely in 2012, by adding a second wild card in each league. The format of the wild-card elimination series has yet to be determined, although a best-of-three set has received a fair amount of support.Use of replay was instituted in August of 2008 but only on boundary calls. Demand for its expanded use has often swelled after incorrect calls in high-profile postseason games, as well as the blown call in Armando Galarraga's bid for a perfect game last season, but to this point MLB has not gone beyond examining the issue.By Jorge L.

Renteria, 35, has 15 seasons of major league experience, although he played in only 72 games last season because of a series of injuries that required three trips to the disabled list.He came alive in the World Series, batting .412 with two homers and six RBI and playing strong defense. Renteria's three-run homer off Cliff Lee in Game 5 provided all the Giants' runs in a 3-1 victory that clinched their first championship since moving to San Francisco in 1958.After paying Renteria $18.5 million over two seasons in which he underperformed  batting a combined .259 with eight homers and 70 RBI  the Giants hoped he would follow in Pat Burrell's lead and accept a $1 million deal to return in a utility role.His reaction to the offer, articulated in an ESPNDeportes.com story, drew mostly condemnation from the Bay Area fans and media. That, plus an additional $1.1 million, ensured his departure.By Jorge L. OrtizSee photos of: Cincinnati RedsTags:Cincinnati RedsEdgar RenteriaWorld Series MVPSoriano, Pavano and Guerrero head list of top free agents still available04:39 PMCommentRecommendMost of the prized catches on the free-agent market already know where they'll be reporting when spring training camps open in a little over a month. But several big names remain on the board, including some hitters with Hall of Fame credentials.The Daily Pitch takes a look at who's still looking for a place to call home and where that place might be.:1. Rafael Soriano: He's an elite closer who led the AL with 45 saves (in 48 chances) while registering a 1.73 ERA, but a big price tag and his status as a Type A free agent  meaning the team that signs him will have to forfeit a high draft pick  has scared off some teams. The Yankees have said they will pass, and the White Sox don't have the money, so the Angels look like the most viable suitor.2. Carl Pavano: Having resurrected his career in Minnesota, Pavano appears on the verge of staying put and signing a two-year deal with the Twins, according to multiple media reports. The once-ridiculed right-hander is coming off his best season  17-11, 3.75 ERA  since his breakout year of 2004, but he's 35 and doesn't overpower hitters, so teams haven't flooded him with offers.3. Vladimir Guerrero: After a huge bounce-back season -- .300, 29 homers, 115 RBI  Guerrero is looking for more than a one-year deal, but he won't get it with the Rangers, who plan to move Michael Young into the DH spot. So Guerrero is left to contemplate possible openings at that spot with the Angels, Orioles and Rays.4. Brian Fuentes: Cheaper than Soriano and without the Type A tag, Fuentes has 187 career saves, including 24 in 28 chances last season. He held left-handed hitters to a .128 average (righties didn't do so well at .202) and is seeking a closing job. The Rays, Blue Jays, Mariners, Mets and Pirates are among the teams with openings.Read more  See photos of: Vladimir GuerreroTags:Vladimir GuerreroCarl PavanoRafael SorianoReality TV's next frontier: How to pick up a ballplayer01:16 PMCommentRecommendL0oking for an autograph at spring training? Boring.How about a hello from your favorite major leaguer as he heads to the practice field? That's hardly made-for-TV stuff.But plotting a way to take a big leaguer home for the night? Anyone who's spent more than a few days around spring training -- or just watched "Bull Durham" -- has to wonder what took the reality TV folks so long to catch up with this little slice of inside baseball.According to RadarOnline.com, casting has begun for "Cleat Chasers" -- the story of player-chasing Baseball Annies, some of whom are as willing to name names as they are to hook up with players.These fans aren't headed to Florida and Arizona to catch some rays -- unless they choose to skirt the fringes of the Tampa Bay camp.But Scottsdale, the social center of the Arizona spring scene, is the odds-on favorite to be the locale for the show. No word yet on when it might appear, but a membre of the production company -- Get Some Media -- indicated verifying some of the women's stories is more difficult than finding willing participants.By Paul WhiteJan 09, 2011Dallas Green's granddaughter killed in Arizona shooting11:57 AMCommentRecommendThe Arizona shooting of U.S. representative Gabrielle Giffords resonated within the baseball community Sunday when it was learned that the 9-year-old victim (one of six dead) was the daughter of Los Angeles Dodgers scout John Green and the granddaughter of former Phillies pitcher and manager and Cubs general manager Dallas Green.Christina-Taylor Green was a third grader and the lone girl on her Little League baseball team. With an interest in politics, she was at the shopping plaza in Tucson to meet Giffords when the shootings took place.She was born on Sept. 11, 2001, and had been featured in the book Faces of Hope, about children who were born on the day of the terrorist attacks.Phillies president David Montgomery issued the following statement:"The Phillies organization expresses our heartfelt condolences to Dallas and [his wife] Sylvia and the entire Green family on the senseless, tragic loss of Christina's life. She was a talented young girl with a bright promising future. Her untimely death weighs heavily on our hearts. Our thoughts and prayers are with all the families affected by yesterday's horrific shooting."Dodgers owner Frank McCourt had this to say:"We lost a member of the Dodgers family. ... The entire Dodgers organization is mourning the death of John's daughter Christina, and will do everything we can to support John, his wife Roxana and their son Dallas in the aftermath of this senseless tragedy."By Seth LivingstoneSee photos of: Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia PhilliesTags:Los Angeles DodgersPhiladelphia PhilliesGabrielle GiffordsDallas GreenJan 07, 2011As Pettitte waffles, Yankees mull pitching options04:51 PMCommentRecommendThere's no denying it, the New York Yankees are short of pitching even though they may have a payroll of more than $200 million in 2011.But general manager Brian Cashman says don't expect him to make any big moves in free agency, and that includes bidding on Rafael Soriano.Cashman told the The Journal News of Westchester, N.Y., that he has no interest in giving up his first-round pick this year now that Cliff Lee is off the market. To sign a player such as Soriano or Grant Balfour, both classified as Type A free agents, the Yankees would have to compensate the player's former team with their top pick in the June draft."I will not lose our No. 1 draft pick," Cashman said. "I would have for Cliff Lee. I won't lose our No. 1 draft pick for anyone else."Read more  See photos of: New York YankeesTags:New York YankeesCubs agree on deal to land Rays ace Matt Garza11:21 AMCommentRecommendUPDATE, 12:05 p.m. ET: The teams have agreed on the trade and just need physicals to finalize it, according to ESPNChicago.com.The Rays will get the four prospects listed below and outfielder Sam Fuld. In addition to Matt Garza, the Cubs will receive a minor-league pitcher and outfielder.* * *The Cubs are nearing a deal with the Rays for right-hander Matt Garza, accoridng to the the Daily Herald of Arlington Heights, Ill., and ESPNChicago.com.The players in the trade have not been finalized, according to the Herald, but the Rays would most likely get four prospects -- right-hander Chris Archer, shortstop Hak-Ju Lee, outfielder Brandon Guyer and infielder Robinson Chirinos.The Rays, who won the AL East, have suffered through a dismal offseason, losing Carl Crawford, Carlos Pena, Rafael Soriano and Jason Bartlett to free agency and a trade, but they do have depth in starting pitching. If Garza is dealt, that would leave a highly capable front five of David Price, James Shields, Jeff Niemann, Wade Davis and rookie Jeremy Hellickson.Meanwhile, the Cubs are desperate to become relevant again in the NL Central after in fifth place with a 75-87 record. Garza was 15-10 with a 3.91 ERA in 204.2 innings last year and would figure to move to the top of the Cubs rotation, which already includes Ryan Dempster, Randy Wells, Carlos Zambrano and Tom Gorzelanny.As for the prospects the Rays are set to receive, the latest Baseball America rankings (subscription only) have Archer first, Lee fourth and Guyer 10th in the Cubs organization. Chirinos, 25, has been in the Cubs' system for nine years.Archer, 22, was a fifth round pick in 2006 who came of age last season when he combined to go 15-3 with a 2.34 ERA at high-A and Class AA. Lee, 20, was signed out of South Korea and hit .282 in 122 games at Class A last year. And Guyer, who turns 24 on Jan. 28, hit .344 with 13 home runs and 30 stolen bases at Class AA in 2010. None of them would figure to make the Rays' opening-day roster.By Peter BarzilaiSee photos of: Chicago Cubs, Tampa Bay RaysTags:Chicago CubsTampa Bay RaysMatt GarzaJan 06, 2011Book chronicles Yankees' alleged dirty business in international market09:14 PMCommentRecommendFacing the New York Yankees on the field is one thing, but dealing with the powerful franchise in the international arena and legal proceedings can be just as formidable  and eye-opening.At least that's the lesson an Arkansas lawyer lays out in Pinstripe Defection, a book released last month about a four-year saga that includes claims the Yankees used bribes, lies and international intrigue to acquire players.Lawyer and player agent Jason Browning in 2003 took the case of Mexican League team owner Gustavo Ricalde, who claimed the Yankees owed him $500,000 for his role in delivering catcher Michel Hernandez, a Cuban defector who signed with the Yankees in 1998."To get into the mechanics of the relationships between clubs and agents was very eye-opening," Browning told USA TODAY. "I'm not sure the casual fan gets all these issues. From an agent's perspective, it's disgusting as well. My hope is that it sparks debate, discussion, attention."Read more  Adrian Beltre improves Texas Rangers 03:00 PMCommentRecommendThe American League champion Texas Rangers have made themselves better with the signing of free-agent third baseman Adrian Beltre, although his addition comes with costs beyond the substantial $96 million he'll earn for six years.Beltre will be the Rangers' everyday third baseman. That means Michael Young will be asked to move again. The former shortstop-turned-third baseman will likely shift to DH and play some first base.Young, a six-time All-Star and 2005 AL batting champ, will handle the move with grace and aplomb, just as he did when he was asked to make room for Elvis Andrus at short. He is that kind of professional."It's clear that I want to play with the Rangers," said Young, who at 34 has three years and about $48 million left on his contract. "I'm willing to make some pretty big sacrifices in order to do that. Obviously, this is pretty significant in terms of my career path."Read more  See photos of: Texas Rangers, Michael Young, Adrian BeltreTags:Texas RangersMichael YoungAdrian BeltreHall of Fame president says voters have it right on steroids02:45 PMCommentRecommendWednesday's announcement of the Hall of Fame voting results made as much news for who did get in as who didn't.It seems that voting members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America are relatively united in saying no to players who have been linked to steroids, either through the Mitchell Report, testing or an admission.Mark McGwire lost ground in falling to 19.8% of the vote (with 75% needed for election) after finally admitting last year to taking steroids. Rafael Palmeiro, who tested positive in 2005, got a measly 11%. And Juan Gonzalez, who was linked to steroids in the Mitchell Report, was almost kicked off the ballot for good (at least 5%) with a measly 5.2%.So how does the person who oversees the Cooperstown shrine feel about all of this? Hall of Fame president Jeff Idelson tells Sports Illustrated's Joe Posnaski that the system is working and the writers are doing their job.Read more  Orioles, Derrek Lee reach one-year deal01:58 PMCommentRecommendThe Orioles and free agent first baseman Derrek Lee have finalized their one-year deal, the team announced Thursday.According to The Baltimore Sun, the deal is worth a guaranteed $7.25 million with performance bonuses that could up the total value to $10 million.Lee, 35, is a two-time All-Star who hit .260 with 19 home runs and 80 RBI in 148 games with the Cubs and Braves in 2010. In 2009, he set a career-high with 111 RBI and led the Cubs with a .306 average, finishing ninth in National League MVP voting. In his 14-year career, Lee has hit .282 with 312 home runs, 1,019 RBI and an .865 on-base-plus-slugging percentage (OPS) in 1,829 games.Read more  See photos of: Baltimore Orioles, Mark ReynoldsTags:Baltimore OriolesDerrek LeeMark ReynoldsJ.J.
