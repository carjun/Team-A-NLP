These warnings had been vindicated, Netanyahu said.Haaretz Print Edition, November 30, 2010***The WikiLeaks affair has given new life to the old conspiracy theories of underhanded Jewish and Israeli involvement in an event with significant repercussions for the US and many nations around the world," ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman said, according to a published statement.. "The news is being exploited by conspiracy theorists, some world leaders, and various Web sites across the ideological spectrum to spread false and malicious conspiracy theories against Israel."On December 1, Huseyin Celik, a deputy leader of Turkey's ruling party, hinted that Israel could be responsible for WikiLeaks during a press conference, saying that "Israel is very pleased [with the WikiLeaks controversy]" and "has been making statements for days, even before the release of these documents."After a leaked diplomatic cable revealed the Palestinian Fatah party had asked Israel to attack Hamas in 2007, the party condemned the release as "fabrications and lies" and claimed it was a conspiracy by the Israel Security Agency.groups:News, News and Politics, Politics tags:War,Israel,Terrorism,Iran,Wikileaks,Saudi Arabia,Jews,Zionism,Julian Assange,Alternative Media,Israel-Palestine,Anti-Defamation League 8 more|8 comments// Anti-Defamation League claims bloggers are spreading WikiLeaks and Israel conspiracy theorieshide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

The report says nothing about passing secrets of Iranian nukes.Just because you want Iran to be building nukes so the US or Israeli military can go and  murder Iranians like they did Iraqis doesn't confirm your Iran nuke conspiracy theory.Siadat "confessed that he had transferred information to Mossad about Iran's MILITARY ACTIVITIES," Irna said, adding that he had "received $60,000 to give classified information to the Zionist regime".http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12084885The IAEA and at least ten other intelligence agencies have long debunked your Iranian nuke conspiracy theory, but obviously you love being conned by zio-baloney like Iraq's imaginary WMDs. 9 days agoflag  reply0freecrack  maasanova:"According to BBC reports, Iran hung the spy for providing military secrets. The report says nothing about passing secrets of Iranian nukes."amazing strict adherence to only factual information when it supports your position vs the liberal inserting of supposition when ya need to cultivate a narrative.do you imagine the iranian military has any other element that israel would need intel on? the iranians entire military is outfitted from the soviets, who are working of off technalogy that israel as far exceeded.hence russia begging for drones cuz they dont know how to make them themselves.it isnt as if the iranian airforce is scary to israeli forces.it isnt like iranian tanks regiments mean dick to israel.the only military element israel has any interest by any stretch of the immagination is irans nuclear capabilities.thier is literaly nothing else that is intel worth gathering in the iranian military.i dont want anyone to die.thats why i dont want hostile nations having nukes.how many civilian casualties again when israel did it to iraq?ZERO.you seem to be obsessed with this invasion thing that i have gone over with you at least 8 times now.no one is advocating in any serious way invading iran.not us, not israel, not anyone.even if that were the case, you cant seem to understand that my position isnt for invasion.im all about less war not more.i dont want any one murdered wich is why israel bombing iran's nuclear facility is a good thing.a littel boom today with limited to no casualties versus a highly likely future of massive casualties.unless the iranians have housed people in the nuclear facilities, no one is talking about killing anyone in this.i can find a shitload of entities and countries that claim to debunk the iranian nuclear weapons story.but the thing is qualifications.we dont really ever lift a finger to help israel in the public relations department, or anytime they need military help.(yes the uss liberty, but stay focused here) so we arent gunna do shit as our time table exceeds israels on this and we have an opportunity to not dirty ourselves with this when we are trying to subdue the arab muslim world.what ever we say in this regard is because it needs to be said and isnt one of those things that can be ignored, like how we do with the palestinian issue,and the flotilla,and so on.the english are on the same page, despite being a fair weather friend to israel at best.and the french actualy are rather anti-israel and anti-zionist in all policies, and still find themselves on the side of israel on this.not to mention that when has israel started a war with any of thier nieghbors?ya can try to use 67 but we both know that despite israel striking first that wars declaration was not from them.how could israel invade iran, who is a zillion times larger than themselves?how would they be able to hold any position in iran, and not lose home territory from being spread too thin? how would every fellow arab nation not decend on israel if they attacked iran?why invade a nation whos people are on the brink of overthrowing thier government?not to mention what happens to the 30 thousand jews in iran if israel does anything.this type of bullshit is the same type crap that was said when israel did this in iraq, and it was attempted when they did it to syria.yet no invasions.always stated as obviously what the zionists really mean (wink wink) when they speak of nukes.we will "bomb" (ahem invade).yet no invasion ever happens cuz it is propaganda with no basis in reality outside of suppositions based on antisemitic ideas of a zionist new world order. 9 days agoflag  reply0maasanova  freecrack:Facts are facts, and you have none.The fact is that there was nothing stated in the article to back up your claim that Iran hung a spy because he was passing on nuclear secrets to Israel.Obviously I'm not against theorizing, but yours wasn't even a theory or else you would have offered some evidence to support such a claim, but you didn't. It's more bullshit you just created out of thin air, as usual. 7 days agoflag  reply0freecrack  maasanova:you want facts.okiran blames us and israel for such an absurd amount of things, that if israel or america were behind them, we would have no resources to allocate to anything else.chances are in all factual based reality, this poor guy in iran has never spoken to an israeli ever in his life.chances are is he is a political dissident and as usual when looking for a reason to kill him, israel is the standard reason.but we dont have the luxury of facts when talking about iran in domestic terms, as the only information to come from iran is that of the state run media.so im posing suppositions to you, based on what iran has claimed.in my position i clearly stated that no evidence exists to link this poor guy to irans nuclear program.nor does any ecidence exist to link him to any other element of the iranian military infrastrcture.so with that being the case, i ask you, what element of iranian military infrastructure would the israelis be interested in?i tried to move this along by skipping over the bullshit.being as soviet tech is far behind israeli tech and iran is outfitted with russian armorments, it would be a logical conclusion that only irans nuclear ambitions are subject to israeli interest.any problem with this assumption?and please dont even start with who pulls facts out of thin air mr "jewish nationalism" and "wikileaks is zionist poison".the volume of out of thin air bullshit that you deem headline worthy alone is enought to stun a team of oxen, no less the material in those articles. 6 days agoflag  replymore fromNews:The #1 Work From Home Business Of 2011 . . .
