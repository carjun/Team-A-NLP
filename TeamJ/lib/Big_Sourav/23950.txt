The idea is that the heavily Jewish condo vote willgo to these folks -- no matterhow ill-suited or unqualified for the bench they may be -- and knock some good judges off the bench. EntinPublic Defender Howard Finkelstein said it was wrongand would foster anti-Semitism. Lawyer Alvin Entin recently railed against it on JAABlog, even going so far as bringing the Holocaust into the argument. "My concern is that this targeting is based on a belief that a Jewish surname by itself is a qualification for office, and that this provides one with an advantage. The fact that this may be true is of no moment, because persons running in this manner should be ashamed of themselves...," Entin wrote. "In Nazi Germany, Adolph Hitler attacked and attempted to eliminate the Jewish people because of their ethnicity. For you to run a campaign based upon ethnicity is an example of what you should spend a lifetime telling your children is totally wrong." Now erstwhile campaign consultant Dan Lewis, who has a deep history of involvement in Broward politics and is behind a new business website, is jumping into the fray. "The problem is that inexperienced generally out of work or unsuccessful attorneys with Jewish sounding last names think that they can win a judicial seat on that fact alone," Lewis wrote in a piece that is included at the end of this post.

He may havecried whiletalking about other people crying, like Irene "I Don't Want to Go to Jail" Stay, former chief financial officer for RRA, whom he said ran out of the roomin tearswhen questioned about the plundered trust accounts on Friday, October 30. That was theday Boden and others at the firm learned that Rothstein had fled the country.

It's making its way to shore in Mississippi and Louisiana and could destroy one of the great fisheries in America -- and the livelihoods of thousands in the process. Officials are employing controlledfiresto try to reduce the impact. That's right, the Gulf of Mexico is on fire right now. Drill Baby Drill has been replaced by Burn Baby Burn. It's a huge disaster as it is, butimagine if that oil was on its way to our beaches right now. Imagine what it would do to tourism and our economy. Imagine what it would do to our quality of life. Damn near unthinkable isn't it? It was just a month ago that we called out the Sun-Sentinel for whoring out the front page of its Sunday Outlook section to dipshit oil industryflack Hank Fishkind, who touted all the benefits that offshore oil drilling would bring.

The Broward County School Board is being ravaged by budget cuts and layoffs. A total of 461 noninstructional employees have already lost their jobs and teachers are supposed to be getting their pink slips today. The people who really need to be fired-- if not thrown into the stockade -- are the superintendent and eight of the nine board members.*Some deserve much worse than just the loss of their positions. Why? Because they ran our school district like a Ponzi scheme that benefited their political benefactors, the school construction industry and its lobbyists.Riding the bubble, the board overbuilt the district by a projected 35,000 seats -- roughly the size of the entire Oklahoma City School District -- and financed it not only on taxpayers' money but on their futures: The district is now some $2 billion in debt. Scott Rothstein couldn't have done it any better. What we're experiencing now is theimplosion ofthe board's crooked games. The writing was on the wall by the middle of last year. In July, these layoffs were predicted. This is from a screed that was publishedlast July 23 that More >> Write Comment Email to FriendBadge Numbers?

WhenHamilton asks forOvercash's name and badge number, the officer immediately putsthe cuffs on him and arrests him. Thanks to JAABlog, we have the back story from Hamilton's attorney, Brad Cohen: "We have several witnesses for the incident prior to the arrest. The facts are essentially the train was going past the intersection, on SW 2nd Avenue, Fort Lauderdale. My client,Brennen Hamilton,was waiting with his wife and friends for thetrain to pass. My client leaned up against the rear of thepolice car. Officer Overcash approachedmy client and took him by the arm and said 'Get your ass off the car.Howwould you like it if I leaned my ass on your car?'

By Bob Norman,                                                            Wed., Apr. 28 2010 @ 9:41AMAcouple of newsflashes:-- Scott Rothstein abettor Debra Villegas is set to entera plea this morning at the federal courthouse in downtown Fort Lauderdale. This should be little more than a formality but I'll be tracking for news.UPDATE: Villegas pleaded not guilty in what was indeed a formality. Interesting fact from the Sentinel: "Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence LaVecchio informed the magistrate that Villegas first began cooperating with authorities last November, and LaVecchio said she has provided information not only about Rothstein's Ponzi scheme but other criminal activity involving his law firm" (italics are mine).Lamberti-- We all know that the Broward Sheriff's Officeis expected to start handing out pink slips as Sheriff Al Lamberti tries to cut $60 million from the budget, but a recent letter from the agency to the jail union gives some precise numbers. The April 22 letter to Federation of Public EmployeesPresident Dan Reynolds explains that a total of 90 jail jobs -- including 84 deputies and six sergeants -- are expected to be cut on October 1. Signed byBSO assistant legal counsel Christine Catuccy, it also says that all control room deputies will be replaced bylesser-trained and lesser-paidcivilian "technicians."ABC NewsKuehneNeedless to say the detention deputies aren'tpleased with this news, especially since the road patrol just received a two percent raise -- money that could have saved some jobs. Remember that the FOPE backed Lamberti's opponent, Scott Israel, in the last election while the Police Benevolent Association that represents the nondetention deputies backed Lamberti. I'm hearing about possible walk-outs and everything from the jail side. We'll see. --As federal and state corruption investigations plow throughBroward,politicians arerunning for cover in the form of big-namecriminal attorneys.

Word from sources close to the case is that 20 or more of Rothstein's associates will be charged before all's said and done, several ofthem from his old law firm, Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler. Villegas will be a key witness -- as Rothstein's queen of the inner sanctum, she will be a key witness innumerous cases involving her former coworkers (who generally despised her). The feds confirm that she helped cook up the bogus settlement deals that Rothstein sold to investors, invented fictitious names, forged signatures, sold interest in the fake deals, and moved money around in the scheme. Rothstein never could have pulled off the scheme without faithful Debra, but expect her to get no more than a few years in prison (she faces a maximum of ten years). I am hearing that federal prosecutors Jeffrey Kaplan,Larry LeVecchio, and Paul Schwartzhave beenknee-deep in the Rothstein case. Since seven months have elapsed since Rothstein fled to Morocco, it's no wonder the natives have been getting restless, but the truth is that thefeds are undermanned on this. There wasno cavalry that camein from Washington. Theseguys -- and the FBI agents doing the investigating -- are spread thin on what is a monumental case. The fact that we're talking about overcautious bureaucrats in the federal government doesn't help to speed things up either.To understand what Villegas meant to Rothstein, here's a portion of an email the disbarred lawyer sent last March (first published here back in November). "[W]hen she speaks she is speaking for me," Rothstein wrote about Villegas. "Thus, absent extraordinary circumstances, no one is to challenge her authority or come to me to attempt to override any decision she makes... Please NEVER tell Debra, or anyone behind Debra's back, that you are going to just 'take it to Scott.' That defeats the purpose of having a COO that I have trusted for nearly 2 decades..."Then he went into all-caps mode:"For those of you who do not understand Debra's significance to RRA....let me elaborate briefly.....WE WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT HER---SHE HAS HELPED ME AND CONTINUES TO HELP ME MORE THAN I COULD EVER EXPLAIN.....OUR OFFICES THAT WE CURRENTLY OCCUPY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITHOUT HER......OUR GROWTH WOULD BE IN REVERSE......WE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FULFILL THE VISION OF WHAT RRA HAS BECOME WITHOUT HER----WE More >> Write Comment Email to FriendDid Magnum P.I.

Inthe article,the player talks of how the debacle has "forced him out of the investment-advisory business and left himstunned at how things fell apart."Here's the lead quote from the player: "I rip my eyeballs out for an investment that didn't work. What did we do wrong? How did it not work? In some . . . in this environment . . . there's nothing you could have done." In that quote, he's specifically talking about the real estate collapse, but it gives you an idea where his head is at. The article makes a lot of his use of a private jet andfancy cars, including anAston Martin and Ferrari, which he said healways wanted because Tom Selleck drove one onMagnum P.I.As a youth, he said, he watched Magnum P.I. just for the cars -- in the 1980s television series, the star drove a Ferrari."I'm not just some guy who has a Ferrari," he said.Hit the jump for more.

It was the year that Halle Berry won the Academy Award for Monster's Ball, the New England Patriots won their first Super Bowl, andthen-state Rep. Roger Wishner (and current Sunrise mayor)criticized the North Broward Hospital District and got on the wrong side of then-NBHD general counsel Bill Scherer. Florida TrendSandsSo what did Scherer do? He propped upa Democrat named Franklin Sands to run against Wishner and got the political machine he ran at the public health system to finance tens of thousands of dollars in contributions for Sands. The money came from doctors and lawyers; Scherer and his own family members contributed about $3,000. Dr. Sein Lwin, a Burmese native who operated as somethingof a bagman for the political machine, was responsible for another $1,500 to Sands. In early September 2002, a couple of months before Election Day, it was decided that all that money might not be enough. So a private detective, Ron Cacciatore, was hired to investigate claims that Wishner's medical waste company was improperly disposing of waste. Scherer, however, didn't hireCacciatore. Neither did Sands. To find out which then-unknown political operator was the front man for the dirty work, go to the jump.Hint: The guy stiffed Cacciatore on the bill.

Bull. There's plenty to look at -- and none of it is pretty.Novack,theformer grande dame of the glamorousFontainebleau Hotel in Miami, was found dead in her blood-smeared Fort Lauderdale home a year ago in a "nightgown drenched with blood" and with "massive skull injuries, broken teeth, a fractured finger and broken jaw." The Fort LauderdalePolice Departmentdetermined thatthe 87-year-oldNovack diedafter a "series offalls."A whole lot of people aren't buying that explanation.In fact, her Batmobile-collecting son, Ben Novack Jr., reportedly had doubts about the police ruling before he himself was beaten to death in a New York hotelroom three months after his mother's demise. Then there were the bizarre goings-on at Ben Jr.'s house on Delmar Placeyears beforemother and son met their brutal ends.Back in 2002, Ben Jr. claimed his wife, Narcy, a former stripper from Ecuador,bound and gagged him in his housein a murder plot. But therewere never any chargesand Narcyclaimedit was all part of a sexgame gone awry.Ben Jr. -- whose father was thefounder of the Fontainebleau -- dropped his divorce filing when the couple reconciled and got back together. AfterBen Jr.'s mother was found dead in her home, ananonymous note to police claimed that both Novacks had been killed in an attempt to snare their multimillion-dollar fortune. The letterpointed at Narcy, who policecalla"person of interest" in her husband's death.
