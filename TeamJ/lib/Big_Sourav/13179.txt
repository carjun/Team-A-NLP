Granada is the oldest city in Central America. The Nicaraguan city is almost exactly 530 years older than I am. A remarkable age.One day, here was the residence of an American named William Walker. It was this one, who wanted to be a ruling monarch of Nicaragua. After a while, he realized that this idea was very unhealthy. Escaping from Granada, his general set the city in fire placing a sign on the shore of Lake Nicaragua that said, Granada Was Here. I can prove that he was wrong. Granada is still there.  See all 8 photosView from Kathy's by jantamayaGranada is a beautiful, well-seasoned, little bit crumbling, and typical colonial town. When you walk on well used, full of gaps, holes, and cavities sidewalks you feel pretty well the citys aura: a medieval, colonial mix. Most of the houses there have street-level floors and are covered with huge, deep hanging terracotta roofs. From the street, you often can see their roofless inner courtyards with ornamentally bejeweled fountains standing in beds of exotic blossoms, surrounded with palms, and flowering shrubs. Such views were for me always like a mountain eye, it means like a crystal-clear lake in high mountains, or like a view on a radiant oasis in a desert. An exhilarating sight. Always.In this city lives Kathy She is young and very beautiful. A very popular girl with many friends and loving family. One day she meets an American. It is exciting for Nicaraguan girls to meet a Yankee, or better named as a gringo (an old Spanish word meaning foreign, it comes from griego, and it means Greek in Spanish. I understand what they mean; they simply say those foreigners sound Greek to us Okay).

Hence, Nica-girls enjoy gringos Yes, sometimes. Especially when the Yankees arent very poor For the reason that in general Nicaraguans live in poverty, they of course, appreciate the opposite of lacking money, the prosperity. It is understandable.Why Nicas are so poor? Their neighbors to the south, Ticas, are much better situated. You even can find many Nicas working for lowest wedges in Costa Rica. In this way, they are able to help their families left back in Nicaragua.I still havent told you why Nicas are so badly affected by poverty. This is primarily because of politics and wars. Their neighbors to the south enjoyed stable, democratic government and no violent political disturbances in the last almost hundred years. Nicaragua wasnt that lucky. Maybe you still remember the dictatorship of Somoza family, and all the Sandinistas, and Contras. This fighting between all those political groups left the country financial devastated. Now, Ortega is democratically elected President but it is possible that he is corrupt The situation in NicaLand is slightly better nowadays, but there is still a long way to go.I didnt forget Kathy. No, no, no. Ill never forget her. I only wanted to portray closely Kathys situation for you. She is a happy girl, although her new gringo friend is much older than she is. Exactly said, her friend is fifty years her senior. At least he is wealthy, she thinks. She isnt materialistic; she only is realistic. After short time, they decide to marry. Kathy looks gorgeous and happy on her wedding day. Everybody else is happy too, including her groom. And they lived happily together forever after. The End of the story. :-)Sorry.There is something else.Kathy's dog, by jantamayaChurch Iglesia de San Francisco, photo made from Kathy's by jantamayaIn background corner of Kathy's, by jantamayaMade from Kathy's by jantamayaGranada, Nicaragua by saltydog40The fortunate groom bought a restaurant for Kathy. He wanted to keep her busy. It was a good idea.  In the meantime, its a famous breakfast and lunch place in Granada, Kathys Waffle House. Down-home American breakfast with best vista in town. Across the street, you see the bluish church Iglesia de San Francisco, a nice sight. You can even admire the Volcano Mombacho from there. The minus point is that youll find here only tourists and expats. The native population is represented by waiters (all men), kitchen personal (all women), and beggars (all cute children). Shortly before we  my friend and myself  leave Costa Rica for a trip to Nicaragua, I read The Nica Times. Nica Times is part of The Tico Times a weekly newspaper for English speakers in Costa Rica. This newspaper is published since 1956, and it is the first English weekly in Central America. Not good news coming out of Tico Times. There is flooding on the way to Nicaragua and a bridge is damaged. It happens quite often in Costa Rica. The bridges there arent the safest in the world. The next news I read are even worse.  Few minutes ago, as you know, Ive introduced you to the young and beautiful Kathy and her breakfast restaurant, Kathys Waffle House, in Granada.  The Tico Times says that she is dead. I cant believe it. I reread it. It must be another Kathy, somebody else named Kathy; this isnt our Kathy  I ask my friend, he reads and says, I cant believe it, but it only can be our Kathy. When she would die a regular dead it would be somewhat acceptable. However, it was nothing regular in this what happened to her. I look at the photography of her, published in the newspaper. A slim, well proportioned, well curved, beautifully smiling  her face was great looking under a big, black sombrero young woman, was sunny beaming into the camera. She was sitting on thoroughbred black horse and wearing on her legs skinny jeans and good-fitting equestrian boots. Somebody has said about her, It was a very happy and optimistic, young, pleasing, attractive and hard working girl. A rare combination of beauty and intelligence. Although there was a large crew in her restaurant, she was often seen mopping the floors herself. She was of course very popular in her hometown. Kathy was a celebrity, one of the most liked and recognized people, and probably a most amazing young woman in Granada. How did she die?

Her husband, who is around fifty years her senior, couldnt get through to her, because her room was locked. At this time of her dead, she was in her room upstairs, her husband and somebody else were downstairs. The official version says that the death of young Kathy was suicide. She was the one who shot with Taurus revolver, caliber 3.57. It was her husbands weapon.How and who have figured it out that she killed herself? The police said it after investigation of gunshot residue on Kathy; they checked also her husband, and one another person. Only on Kathy, they found gunshot residue. What I know, it isnt enough to say that people around her arecleared because washing the hands can remove all traces of gunshot residue. Shortly before her death, Kathy was seen working around the restaurant. She was like always, cheerful and in good spirits.I know only little about her husband. He is almost 80, ex-pat from US. Kathy was his seventh or eighth wife. Few years ago, he was married to a Costa Rican woman and was leaving in Costa Rica (not Nicaragua) for many years. Went also there to jail because of possession of marihuana. Thats all.Kathys heartbreaking funeral was four days after her death. It was hold in the Cathedral, there was largest and most abundant horse carriage with tons of flowers and mourners. There was also her black horse with her boots and sombrero draped over the saddle. Her father was brokenhearted crying, Mi hija, mi `angel, (Hija = daughter, mi = my); her husband was shaken in bereavement, in deep grief, sad over his loss.Few days later we were in Granada, eating breakfast in Kathys Waffle House, her widower was there too. He was, as always, greeting and talking to his guests. Business as usual? I dont know. The breakfast was good. Nothing has changed? I've seen Kathys dog and her widowed husband. I ate in her restaurant, twice as she was still with us and twice after her dead. However, I've never seen Kathy in real life. I feel only somewhat connected to her... I'm sad for her. I'm sad that she can't speak to us anymore. I wish she could.Copyright Maria JantaThe text is part of a book which is going to be published 2011.Crime in NicaraguaGringo Nightmare: A Young American Framed for Murder in NicaraguaAmazon Price: $4.99List Price: $25.99The Bridge: The Eric Volz Story: Murder, Intrigue, and a Struggle for Justice in NicaraguaAmazon Price: $9.26List Price: $17.95Crime in Nicaragua: People Murdered in Nicaragua, Prisoners and Detainees of Nicaragua, Terrorism in Nicaragua, Augusto Csar SandinoAmazon Price: $19.99Nicaraguan Law: Crime in Nicaragua, Law Enforcement in Nicaragua, Recipients of Nicaraguan Presidential Pardons, Treaties of NicaraguaAmazon Price: $19.99Youth Violence in Latin America: Gangs and Juvenile Justice in Perspective (Studies of the Americas)Amazon Price: $55.95List Price: $85.00What She Always Wanted: A True Story of Marriage, Greed, and MurderAmazon Price: $4.39List Price: $7.99Lie After Lie: The True Story of A Master of Deception, Betrayal, and MurderAmazon Price: $4.31List Price: $7.99Our Little Secret: The True Story of a Teenager Killer and the Silence of a Small New England TownAmazon Price: $4.85List Price: $7.99Evil Next Door: The Untold Stories of a Killer Undone by DNAAmazon Price: $4.11List Price: $7.99Granada, San Juan del Sur & Southwest Nicaragua: A Great Destination (Explorer's Guides)Amazon Price: $13.90List Price: $19.95vote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...?
