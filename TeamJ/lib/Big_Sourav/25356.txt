Samjhauta Express is a train that runs between Asian Giant India and pony Pakistan- two arch rivals as the train spreading peace. The notice termed the leakage of Aseemanand's statement by CBI as a "politically motivated" and calculated move to "jeopardise" his reputation and deny him a fair treatment. This means RSS directly charged CBI of acting on the words of Central Congress Government who's main motive is to stating Hindus as terrorist to get Muslim votes. Notice served by RSS reads as,"The repeated abuse of authority and misuse of law by you do not only render you liable in law as stated but show also how tainted your investigation is" Report leaked by CBI can be interpreted as, On Friday, Swami Aseemanand, the head of the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram in Gujarat's Dangs district, has reportedly confessed before a magistrate to his involvement in the February 2007 Samjhauta train blast. He was arrested on November 19, 2010 for his alleged involvement in the Ajmer, Hyderabad and Samjhauta Express blasts, which took place in 2007.  Notice says further that , by presenting statement of Swami Aseemanand in this manner in public to tarnish the image of Hindus and Swami CBI has show completely that it is acting on the behest of Central Government's pressure otherwise this kind of action was not required at all. Notice further adds,"It is not only in breach of law but liable in addition under the Contempt of Court Act, 1971 for criminal contempt as the exercise undertaken by you is clearly intended to prejudice the minds of the public by deliberately presenting a statement the truth of which is not established as a fact."  CBI is nobody to term accused as convict before it is proved in Court of Law. Notice further says that no harassment should be cause to the accused but in this case it is totally untrue and CBI is now to be questioned. The latest reports from New Delhi has confirmed that RSS, leader has categorically stated that in lieu of harassment caused to Swami Aseemanand on behest of Congress Government , RSS will now fight the case of Swami , as the justice cant be denied to suit the interest of some political party who is in power at the centre. RSS has now and then stood up for the rights of India ,be it be of any religion. Congress is ruthlessly trying to prove that Hindus are Terrorists, undermining the fact that, Why all Terrorists in India are Muslims. The need of the hour is to uplift Muslim Community in India as they are very much part of this Nation leaving aside the fact that they were converted in the past.        1 of 6         saint      foru_22 is based in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (51.9%) India (33.3%) United Kingdom (3.7%) Czech Republic (3.7%) 1 other countries (0.0%)           READ MORE: Rss, political-news, Asian Giant India, Right Wing Activist, Swami Aseemanand, legal notice, Samjhauta Express, political-news, India, new delhi, Hindutva, Sister Abhaya murder case, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, law enforcement, Sangh Parivar, Swami CBI, law crime   More News From: New Delhi :  India     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Video: Swami Aseemanand- the New Face of Terror By: aymaan30      The focus has shifted to what is now termed as Hindu Terrorism.Jailed Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh [RSS] leader, Swami Aseemanand has confessed to plotting the Samjhauta express blast, including a host of other violence like Malegaon blast, Mecca Masjid and the blast at the Ajmer Sharif Shrine in Rajasthan.A self-styled ...  2 days ago          Loading News Contributions...
