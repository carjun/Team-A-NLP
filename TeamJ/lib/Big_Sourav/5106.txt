Stars Baring It All For A Worthy Cause: Effective Or Blatant Exhibitionists?    Los Angeles :  CA :  USA|Jan 07, 2011By Veronica P Roberts         9 1     Views: 573      January 7, 2011]----We have all seen the PETA ads with a parade of naked celebrities--from sexy beach babe, Pamela AndersonPamela Anderson to body of steel NFL/reality star, Ochocinco, all to allegedly raise awareness for the ethical treatment of animals.  I recently came across Maroon 5 star Adam LevineAdam Levine, with his delectable "full monty" splashed front and center on the pages of U.K.'s Cosmopolitan magazine, with only a pair of female hands strategically placed over the parts they wanted to remain private, barely. He was reportedly posing to raise awareness for testicular cancer. Hmmm. The pics are aesthetically pleasing. In fact, I have noticed that all those bodies on display, for a worthy cause, of course, are always perfectly chiselled and downright sizzlingly hot and sexy.  Apart from raising our temperatures, do they really raise awareness for the worthy cause they profess to be aiming at or are these celebrites seizing an opportunity to display their blatant exhibitionists tendencies? What do you think?        1 of 3         Baring it all for a worthy cause:effective or exhibitionists?

I'm waiting for the "Strippers for Peace" marathon and perhaps the "Hookers for Hygiene" Campaign? :-)I suppose there is nothing wrong with exposing your "celebrity" for a good cause. Offer void in Muslim states and more "righteous" Christian principalities?            Reply  Reply By     Veronica P Roberts |2 daysagoThat would be something....bare it all for a worthy conservative cause!((:            Reply  Posted By     Hardy Wright|2 daysagoSorry...

Reply  Reply By     Hardy Wright|2 daysagoIt was a cheeky response to the rhetorical question:"Apart from raising our temperatures, do they really raise awareness for the worthy cause they profess to be aiming at or are these celebrites seizing an opportunity to display their blatant exhibitionists tendencies?"LOL            Reply  Posted By     mrspleats|2 daysagoGuess he is Adam for sure biblically speaking,At least his body looks good. Love when people are liberated,we all know what is being covered and it is okay. For a worthy cause it is just fine I think.!!It is better to as Andy who cracks me up says in his Canadian humor and our liberation no inhibition selves (flaunt it if you have got it)(lol)Well exhibitionist?mmh I reserve that for honey ,guess we will go to a nude beach in the island(lol)Rated up.Have fun!

In fact, I have a very sinfully decadent, sweet tooth---hahaha!Thanks for the rating BTW....            Reply  Posted By     dhreff|1 dayagoi WOULD BE DEMEANING FOR A MAN TO DO WHAT IS ON THE PHOTO BUT, LET EVERYONE SEE IT WITH DISCERNING EYES AND MIND DISREGARDING WHAT WAS COVERED WITH FEMALE HANDS. IT MUST HAVE BEEN DONE FOR ART'S SAKE OR FOR A NOBLE CAUSE. EVERYTHING ON THIS WORLD COMES OUT WITH VALID REASONS TO FULFILL CERTAIN PURPOSES. TRUTH COVERED OR UNVEILED REMAINS THE TRUTH. RATE YOU UP.            Reply  Posted By     marivicmalinao|1 dayagoWhy is nudity always associated to a worthy cause? I really can't understand. Why not use pictures of fruits and vegetables to raise awareness for cancer?            Reply  Reply By     Veronica P Roberts |1 dayagoI understand the nudity..sex/sexuality sells but I wonder--- Heterosexual women and gay men might appreciate the art form but would that generate stampede among men to the doctor's office to be tested for prostate or testicular cancer?            Reply  Posted By     Senaratne|1 dayagoI'm OK by the exposure, Veronica. I'm committed to PETA's cause.Rated up            Reply  Posted By     Veronica P Roberts |1 dayagoThank you all for your contribution and positive ratings, I appreciate it.
