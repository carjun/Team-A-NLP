Iranian plane crash leaves 72 dead    Ormyeh :  Iran|Jan 09, 2011By sanain        1 0     Views: 14      An Iranian passenger plane en route from Tehran to Orumiyeh having 105 people on board crashed, breaking into pieces and killing at least 72 passengers. The IranAir Boeing plane 727 was due to land 700km west of Tehran near Orumiyeh when crashed because of bad weather. The plane that broke into numerous small pieces did not ignite fire and has 33 survivors among the 105 on board. Mahmoud Mozaffar, an official of Iranian Red Crescent, said that darkness coupled with heavy snow is hampering rescue efforts. Also the site of the plane crash has 27 inches deep snow. Rescue workers are reaching the crash site via helicopters. Over the past few years, the number of plane crashes has soared in Iran. The last major crash of the Iranian airlines took place in June 2009 when 168 passengers were killed in a plane that caught fire mid air, crashing in northern Iran.        1 of 20         Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaks during a news conference in Tehran      sanain is based in New York City, New York, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (36.4%) Pakistan (18.2%) United Kingdom (18.2%) Canada (9.1%) 1 other countries (0.0%)           READ MORE: Iranian plane crash leaves 72 dead, disasters-news, Iran, Orumiyeh, Iranian Air Force C-130 crash, Aviation, Iran Air, Aviation accidents and incidents, Disaster Accident, Mahmoud Mozaffar, plane crashing   More News From: Ormyeh :  Iran     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         At leat 70 feared killed in plane crash in Iran By: jonnalagadda3      Tehran: At least 70 people were killed in a plane crash in Iran, due to bad weather on Sunday. 35 more were injured.According to re ports the passenger plane carrying 106 people, 12 crew members and 94 passengers crashed while landing in the city of Urumiyey.
