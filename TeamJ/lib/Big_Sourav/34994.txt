The PS3 has a Blu-ray player, but the Xbox 360 now streams ESPN. PS3 has a few more exclusives, but the XBL online community is much larger than the PSN. There is no "better" system, just pros and cons that each system has. The Wii also has its strengths and weaknesses, but Nintendo has geared its console for a slightly different market, so it is kind of in its own category, as are PC games, of which many of these titles also appear.The list below is our choice for the top 10 games that are either exclusives for the Xbox 360, or have something that specifically makes the Xbox 360 version more appealing than its PS3 counterpart. If a game is designed for multiple platforms, it is generally (though not always) designed on the 360, because the development tools are slightly easier. In turn, those titles will look better on the 360 since they are designed on it. The flipside to this is that some of the PS3 exclusive titles look better than anything on either system, thanks to the power of the PS3 hardware. Again, it is a tradeoff.The list below is a starter kit of 360 titles that includes a handful of games that may have slipped under many people's radars, as well as some of the biggest titles released for the system. If you are considering buying a 360 this holiday season, or are just checking out some possible games to buy for someone who already owns an Xbox 360 (including yourself), here are 10 games that you should consider starting off with.Alan Wake(Rated T; $29.98)Alan Wake is one of the more interesting titles on the market, and it truly utilizes the Xbox  especially Xbox Live. Along with two downloadable episodes that continue the game, there are a series of six live-action videos called "Bright Falls" that act as a prequel to the game.They are well done, and not only show the game's potential off, they also hint at what the Xbox 360 can do on multiple levels.Alan Wake is more than just a game, it is an experience. You live the mystery and become a part of the interactive storytelling. Through an original story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, you control Alan in a series of episodic moments as you look for your missing wife. This is not the average game where you grab a weapon and fight enemies, this is something different. Alan Wake is a game no fan of mysteries should be without, and if you are looking for something a little different for the 360, look no further.Bayonetta(Rated M; $19.98)One of the best-rated and least-played games available for the 360, Bayonetta was also released on the PS3, but the difference between the two is startling. Where the 360 version offers amazingly fluid hack-and-slash gameplay, the PS3 version is noticeably less graphically impressive, and it is filled with glitches that make it feel like a different game. Bayonetta is a very Japanese game, from the look, to the objectification of women that is so blatant it makes American objectification seem Puritan by comparison. Overlooking that, the game is stylish and looks incredible.Bayonetta is a title that makes you feel like you are incredible at the game, even if you are just button mashing. It is one of the most intuitive releases on the market, and while the gameplay is easy to learn, it will take you a long time to master. If you are looking for something that is just fun to pick up and play, Bayonetta is a good pick.Crackdown(Rated M; $9.99)Crackdown has two things going for it that earned it a spot on this list. First, you get to be a super hero in an open world where you become increasingly powerful the further you progress, and that is awesome. Second, it is under $10. There is a sequel on the market for this game, but the original still holds up well, and if you are on a budget, then you simply can't beat a game of this size and scope for under $10.You play as a police officer with cyborg enhancements, tasked with bringing down three crime lords in whatever manner you see fit. The world opens up to you, and as you become more powerful you can wade further into the territories of the bosses, or you can take your time and power up while exploring the futuristic metropolis of Pacific City. The choice is yours, and that is part of what makes Crackdown a game worth owning.Fable III(Rated M; $59.99)Fable 3 is the type of game that people will love or hate. From the moment you begin, you are faced with choices that will not only affect the story, but will also determine how others will treat you, what you look like, and now how the people you come to rule live. In Fable 3, you become a king with a nation to rule. If you rule wisely and justly, the people will prosper and the nation will thrive. If you choose to be a tyrant, the nation will adapt and live under your iron fist. Although the game is the third in the series, it is only loosely connected to the previous games, and you do not need to know anything about the series to pick it up.Fable 3 is an open-world game, with a massive environment to explore, as well as several side quests to expand the game. The plot of the game is engrossing, but Fable 3 is all about choices. Some of the missions you can skip, while others will change based on previous decisions. Because of that, the replay value of this title is very high. Part action title, part RPG, Fable 3 is a must-have exclusive for the 360.Forza Motorsports 3(Rated E; $29.99)When it comes to racing simulators, the Gran Turismo franchise is still the series to beat, but the Forza series has one major advantage: Unlike Gran Turismo, Forza has actually released a full length game in the past six or so years. Three of them, in fact. And during this time of insanity where Turn 10 Studios actually made the crazy decision to release games, it has learned a lot about the racing sim genre and produced games that rival, and in some ways even surpass the Gran Turismo series. Whether or not the new GT5 is better or not is going to be debatable, but the Forza series has earned the respect of its rival, especially the most recent release, Forza Motorsports 3.With over 400 vehicles spread over multiple classes, plus with increasingly longer and more difficult races, Forza 3 is a game that could take months for even the most dedicated fan to complete. Exceptional racing physics and top notch graphics also make this a must have for any race fan, and worth a look for even those that haven't played a racing game before.Gears of War 2 Game of the Year Edition(Rated M; $29.99)Although Halo and Master Chief have become the iconic images that are most closely associated with the 360, if there were a contest, the Gears of War crew would be the runners up. Even if you don't know the games, odds are you have seen an image from the Gears series of a grizzled soldier holding an assault rifle with a chainsaw on the end of it. It may have been better to simply list the Gears of War franchise rather than just the second part of the trilogy (part 3 is due out in April), but if you are on a budget, then Gears 2 is the slightly better choice, although both are worth owning.The campaign is a third-person shooter that follows a war-weary planet fighting a losing battle against a race of subterranean invaders. It can be played alone or with a friend thanks to a robust co-op system, but there is also a deep multiplayer experience that greatly builds on the offerings of the first game. While it continues the previous game's story, Gears 2 can be enjoyed without playing the first. But if the budget allows it, both games are a must for every 360 collection.Halo: Reach(Rated M; $59.99)Even if you are not a gamer, it is hard not to be at least somewhat familiar with the Halo name. Without the success of the Halo franchise, it is possible  maybe even likely  that the original Xbox would have died a lonely death, destined to be a footnote in the history of video game consoles. But thanks to the original Halo, the system got a much needed boost of both confidence and sales, and people began to turn their attention to Microsoft's gaming console. You could even make an argument that without Halo, there would be no Xbox 360, and it wouldn't be much of a stretch.The flagship title for the 360, the newest entry in the Halo franchise is also the last from developer Bungie (although the series will continue through Microsoft). The story is a prequel to the previous games, but as a self-contained game, it should still appeal to fans that missed the previous entries. Besides, the Halo story is only one part of the series; the rest is the multiplayer, which fans have been playing fanatically for years now. Halo is a game that almost everyone who owns a 360 has at least played in some incarnation along the years. It is Mario Bros. with assault rifles. It is Sonic the Hedgehog with grenades. And it is an easy pick for this list.Mass Effect 2(Rated M; $19.98)This was the very first game to be included on this list, and is a must-have title for 360 owners who like little things like amazing stories and deep character development. The worst thing about this game is the "2" on the end of the title. The first game was decent, with a solid story and an epic feel, but it was also tedious and repetitive at times. It might be worth slogging through the first game (it wasn't bad, it just had a few slow parts and technical issues) just to play the sequel. You don't need to, but some of the story elements will be lost on you. Don't let that scare you away from one of the best games on the 360, and one of the best games made in the last few years.You play as Commander Shepard, an agent for an intergalactic collective that is under threat from ancient forces. As you progress through the game, the choices you make, both in terms of the missions and in smaller things like dialogue, will change the way the game reacts to you. It is a very smart title, and one of the most immersive experiences on the market. A PS3 version is due out early next year, but the game was made for the 360, and belongs in the collection of all 360 owners.Splinter Cell Conviction(Rated M; $29.98)Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell has quietly become one of the longest running franchises in operation right now, but for the most recent entry, developers Ubisoft decided to make Conviction an exclusive title for the 360 (and PC, but it will not be heading to the PS3). That is a good thing for 360 owners, as the latest entry is also perhaps the best. Conviction marks a change in gameplay for the series and adds far more action elements. While it is still a stealth game at heart, it is accessible enough that gamers who tried the previous Splinter Cell games and did not like them should give this one a try.If you aren't familiar with the story, don't worry, the newest game is self-contained. Knowing the protagonist Sam Fisher's history is not vital to enjoying this game, just know that he is an angry man that is not to be trifled with. Just imagine Jack Bauer from 24, only with a heavier reliance on stealth, and you have a rough idea of who Fisher is. Besides a spy story about WMDs heading into America that is worthy of, well, Tom Clancy, the game also features a separate co-op campaign that acts as a prequel. A great game for fans of the stealth genre, as well as fans of action packed spy stories.The Orange Box(Rated M; $19.99)If value is your primary motivation while choosing among the top 360 games, then this is your title. The Orange Box is actually five games in one, or at least two games and a mess of side games. The Orange Box was also released for the PS3, but the developer Valve did not create the port, instead leaving it to EA. The results make this a must-have for the 360, but a flawed title for the PS3.Beginning with the full version of the first-person shooter, Half-Life 2, The Orange Box also includes Half-Life 2: Episode One and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, which were originally released on PC as episodic downloads that continued the Half-Life story. On their own, they are short, but when paired with the original game they make for a lot of content. Along with the Half-Life 2 single player campaign, The Orange Box includes Team Fortress 2, an online multiplayer game, and perhaps most importantly, the game Portal. Portal is a first-person shooter that mixes action and puzzle elements into an award winning package that spawned its own franchise. It is a short game, but Portal alone is worth the purchase. Mix in Half-Life 2 and this game is an amazing value.
