Passenger strips rather than be molested    Orange :  CA :  USA|Nov 22, 2010By prabirghose        3 0     Views: 779      Groping and molestation are words that are being heard too often with regard to airport security checks. 'Pat down' is normally associated with criminals - does the airport security presume all passengers to be criminals? A gentleman was supposed to fly to Barbados but he did not want to undergo the full body scan. He was, therefore, directed to go through the 'pat down' process. At this, the person stripped down to his underwear - he did not want the security to touch him. He did not want to be molested. That did not go down well with the staff who detained him. The 'naked scan' at airports as a part of security checks is becoming a sort of terror for many passengers. There is fear that personnel conducting the searches might take things a bit too far and make the passengers uncomfortable under their probing fingers.         1 of 17         A security officer searches a passenger at Sanaa International Airport      prabirghose is based in Nshik, Maharashtra, India,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (69.6%) Russia (6.6%) United Kingdom (4.8%) India (4.0%) 17 other countries (11.4%)           READ MORE: naked scan, airport security, groping, molestation, pat down, Orange, security, air safety, travel-news   More News From: Orange :  CA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     mllovric|about 1 monthagoCould it be Mahmud Amadinejad?
