He was stopped at the Customs checkpoint where the custom officers found 47 boxes of joss sticks in his luggage bag.When customs checked the joss sticks by peeling the joss sticks wrapping, they found white crystals of ketamine. Najmudeen claims innocence, he denied awareness of the bag's contents. He said he is only ordered by his employer to carry and deliver the bag to somebody in Malaysia. His defence however, was rejected by Judge Siti Khadijah saying that it was illogical as Najmudeen knew the combination to his luggage and had opened it himself. Najmudeen was represented by Sreekant Pillai.As reported on 5th Jan. 2011, Najmudeen was sentenced to death by the High Court in Shah Alam, Malaysia for trafficking drugs. He was charged trafficking ketamine of 4041.3gm at KLIA (Kuala Lumpur International Airport) on August 8, 2008. On (Friday) January 7, 2011, Selangor narcotics has seized 3.5kg of syabu worth RM875,000 at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang from a Nigerian Student. Initial investigations reveal that the student was a drug mule and paid US$2,500 (RM7,750) for the trip, ACP Nordin said. The Nigerian student was detained after arriving from Doha, Qatar at about 3.30pm on Wednesday, 7th Jan. 2011. He is presently studying at a private higher learning Institution in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.What is syabu?Syabu is referred as "ice", "speed", "crystal", "glass", "meths" or "blue diamond" on the streets market. The colloquial name for the psycho-stimulant drug is called amphetamine. Amphetamine is related to drugs such as methamphetamine and dextroamphetamine.Long term usage of the drug 'syabu' causes brain damage, depression and other psychosomatic illnesses.Amphetamine increases energy and attention while it decreases appetite and fatigue. During World War II in the Vietnam War, it was reported that amphetamines were widely used as stimulants by soldiers . It gave them false confidence making them bold, daring and gives the invincible feeling even without sleep and less food.Today, syabu is generally taken as a recreational drug by night party goers. Also believed being used by those working in the fringes of society: prostitutes, GROs, robbers and gangsters, taxi and bus drivers, night club bouncers and mat rempits; the drugmakes them hyperactive all night long.
