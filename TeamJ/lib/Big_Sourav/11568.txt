Its early in the season I understand. Even with a cheating scandal, its just golf. A patricians game for the entitled. At some point, the finger pointing, the accusations and turmoil must wane. In order for the greens and fairways to be interesting boils down to when Tiger returns. We could spend time together bantering about whether or not the groves are square. We could talk about the resurgence of some guy with a putter. But the world needs and deserves now an interest in the gentlemens game. Commentary by the legends wont get it. Controversy about slipping in a wedge wont draw. Its simple. Tiger needs to give back. Humbly mind you. But his rants are missed. His flexes desired. The air misses his fist pump. There are sounds of his return for the Masters. But nobody knows. All you can hear is the sucking noise of the tour nowadays. Its louder that a victory at Torrey Pines. It volume overwhelms a Rivera charge. It doesnt matter if you are No.2, because the world knows where No.1 is not. With good luck the suffering, the strife, the turmoil will end soon enough. Its great that some writers want to judge. It wonderful that others make money selling balls with girls pictures. But again we have to fall back and realize that we all miss Tiger. He has set a standard that has changed every professional golfers pocketbook. Even the old guys get to talk about it. Would you be listening to Watson otherwise? Would it matter what Ogilvy says? Of course not. I thought Watson had passed to be honest. The hope is that he returns soon to add the dimension that makes it other than a silly game. His penance for mistakes has been served. We need Tiger.           1 of 1         Looking for something     Nathaniel Hines is based in Florianpolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (37.1%) Canada (29.7%) United Kingdom (24.9%) Israel (4.6%) 13 other countries (2.3%)           READ MORE: Golf, Tiger, Woods, Money, sports-news, Brazil, Florianopolis, Putter, Zoology, Environment, Pocketbook, Ecology, Torrey Pines, Ping, misses   More News From: Florianpolis :  Brazil     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 25            Reply  Posted By     Andy Mathisen|11 monthsagoTiger...the Gretzky of Golf?
