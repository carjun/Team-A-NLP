But three men in a sport utility vehicle grabbed her at gunpoint; they then sexually assaulted her.Dallas police are calling this a very violent act.It happened around 2:20 a.m. Saturday. Police said the victim did nothing wrong  she was simply walking with friends when she was grabbed, had a gun pointed to her head and was kidnapped.Manuel and Esteban Mariel said they were having a party with other athletes from SMU when they heard a lot of screaming and commotion."All this craziness and madness happening," said Esteban Mariel.Their friend, a fellow athlete, was kidnapped in the 1800 block of North Garrett Avenue. The kidnappers told the woman to stay down and be quiet and get in the back seat.The SUV took off; her friends tried to chase the men, but couldn't catch up. They stopped at a convenience store in the 2800 block of North Fitzhugh Avenue and called 911 for help.Police launched a search.According to investigators, the driver of the SUV pulled into a deserted lot where all three suspects forced the woman to have sex with them.  The suspects were speaking Spanish during the attack.They covered her eyes with duct tape and then robbed her.Then they shoved her out of the SUV in the 1300 block of South Haskell Avenue without any clothes.The woman knocked on several doors looking for help; eventually a man in a car stopped to assist.Because the crime did not happen on the SMU campus, there has been no comment so far from the university.E-mail rlopez@wfaa.comShare this article:23 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintNext article Texas prison employee linked to elderly rapes To add a comment, please register or login.Add another commentLeave your comment1000 characters remainingSubmitWe welcome your comments on this story's topic.

What if it was your mom? Why don't you get some compassion for others,....we are all gods people, and should we assume you were one of the many people that would not render aide to this young woman that was brutalized by not one but THREE SCUM BAGS! Well my friend is one OF THREE REAL MEN that stopped to help her when plenty of people would not give her the time of day! This world is sick and you are part of a plague! No better than the cowards that hurt her! On the drug note,...not even an addict deserves this trash talk or treatment by others! shame shame!33639044Flag this commentannabelleannie said on December 11, 2009 at 11:04 AMI apologize to all on all of the duplicate posts, my mistake.annabellshutup - you are not a friend of the victim don't pretend you are.  Publishing the graphic details of a story does not aid in bringing criminals to justice, nor is it ethical to use a victims traumatic experience to educate the public.  Most news organizations use sensitivity in choosing the details they print.  It is sensationalism journalism on WFAA's part.Kudos to the Dallas police department in catching these violent criminals so quickly...I hope they get what they deserve and more.33500957Flag this commenttxsheri said on December 10, 2009 at 6:45 PMThe attackers were ILLEGALS.33466914Flag this commentdallaspdx13 said on December 10, 2009 at 12:06 PMQuietman you are disgrace to the human kind. If you think this situation is remotely funny you need to re-asses your mental state. This is one of the most horrific stories I have heard in a long time and something that needs to be treated with sensitivity and respect. Since you are obviously a "man" / boy who has no mature emotions you have no idea what this girl went through. You nor I will ever be able to understand what this poor girl went through and I would hope that you would not take the opportunity to crack jokes at such a sad event. To the rapists I hope you get what you deserve in jail and to the SMU athlete my thoughts and prayers are with you...33444574Flag this commentanniebellshutup said on December 9, 2009 at 6:14 PMhonestly "anniebell" shut up. as an smu student im shocked and as a friend of the victim and those interviewed im angry about what happened. the story needed to be reported as it is. the world isnt a good place and if youre teaching your kids its all marshmellows and gum drops then youre a horrible mother. the news report didnt release her name, if they had then it would have gone to far. get a life and stop wasting our time with repeated posts that no one cares about nor agrees with. reporting the story aides in finding those responsible and bringing them to justice. ps. im sure wfaa couldnt care less about losing one viewer over doing the right thing33401214Flag this commentlucid_lynx said on December 9, 2009 at 12:32 PMI agree that this is a horrendous crime, but I don't agree with the statement that lines were crossed in reporting the story.As heartbreaking a story as it is, we must use these tragedies to educate ourselves and others on the hardships that await us the second we step out the front door of our residence.To those that would rather not hear or read of the details of stories such as this, continue to live in a world where nothing bad ever happens and everyone is cordial and polite. The rest of us will continue to toil with the obstacles we're presented.C'est la vie33380502Flag this commentmeankitty said on December 9, 2009 at 8:04 AMannabelleannie - you know, once is enough. Button it already. Holier than thou, aren't you?33361552Flag this commentanonymous00 said on December 9, 2009 at 12:17 AMTo those of you blaming the victim I would like you to take a moment and consider the consequences of your accusations. Your blatant naivate and to put blame on this woman is the reason most victims of sexual assault/rape do not come forward and consequently why these rapists are still on the street. Such accusations and disrespect only entice attackers. Although this girl was walking with friends and leaving a party its a far stretch, to say the least, to link her to drugs. Why is she suddenly the bad girl in the situation? As young women we are taught to take precaution but not to stop living our lives. That is exactly what this girl was doing; walking to a car with friends and spending the night with respected and devoted students of the SMU community. Furthermore I think that this young lady deserves to heal in privacy; I hope you realize the impact your words have had and how detrimental they are not only to this student but to all victims and future victims of sexual assault.33350407Flag this commentbuztanut said on December 8, 2009 at 8:14 PMExactly what line do you feel was crossed here.  The fact that WFAA did report the facts regarding this incident hopefully, will serve as a wake-up call and an informative reminder to everyone, not just young college students but everyone that doesnt already know exactly what kind of horror's are waiting for them in these areas, especially at this time of night.  Just maybe, now that the story has been told, there wont be another chance for these sub humans to repeat this  act on a new victim.  And to think, this is the culture that so many are demanding that we bend over backwards to embrace.  Just be careful of which way you bend or you'll be left with nothing to embrace33340139Flag this commentconstatine said on December 8, 2009 at 6:54 PMWe understand that mafia and cults are nothing to do with the multitude of chavas within the city....understanding the rules of criminology...it happens to not just be the responsibility of the police dept. because even the police dept. is not all solos..if you don't already know what i mean...when you is adults, you citizens have the right to know your legal mortal God given rights as self protection against violator offensive that are attacking or violent in very evidential probable cause...so mace or anything legal can always be found on internet or though a lawyer or your own nearest military special intelligences..just to be safe...go the Dept. stores themselves and just ask for proof of what is legal..they have a rule book...but to just let your friends suffer without believing that there is nothing you can do is just blasphemy...but don't worry you spanish speaking rapist...God knows and sees all, and knows just who you is and WE dont need mortals to assist to destroy you.Amen.33336147Flag this commentannabelleannie said on December 8, 2009 at 6:53 PMThanks for sharing with me the incident of the young woman from SMU in such graphic details.

Don't blame the victim. Not that athletes fault.  Yes Im sure she is going through alot and especially what if these are not the guys that did this crime and now something is out and they might now come after the Athlete since the word got out.  Not smart to me from the Police and the News.33334972Flag this commentdanta said on December 8, 2009 at 6:22 PMWhy was this SMU athlete at 1800 N. Garrett at 2:30 am walking along the street?
