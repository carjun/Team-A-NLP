And in doing so, they miss the point.6 commentsRead the full article Was the election good for the fish?November 4, 2010by David Helvarg / Blue Notes / November 3, 2010The November 2 election gave control of the House of Representatives to the Republican Party and expanded their base in the Senate. It will also likely expand the partisan rancor of our dysfunctional political system that was mocked by the quarter million folks who turned out for Comedy Centrals Rally to Restore Sanity the weekend before the election.But theres nothing funny about the declining state of our public seas from over-exploitation and pollution.0 commentsRead the full article Leave No One BehindOctober 17, 2010This 60 Minutes video from CBSnews.com was sent to us by a reader.Stand Down 2010In the middle of July this last summer, 947 homeless vets walked in to a three day event sponsored by Veterans Village of San Diego.

But some of us, from all walks of life and ideological backgrounds  including this white, straight, 57-year-old, former religious right wing agitator, now progressive writer and (given my background as the son of a famous evangelical leader) this unlikely Obama supporter  are sticking with our President.Why? because he is succeeding.18 commentsRead the full article The 2010 Fall Election Season  Part One: Dishonesty, Deceit and DeceptionSeptember 24, 2010In just a few short weeks, well be offered the opportunity to vote in State and local elections. Most of us wont vote. In the 2006 California mid-term election, nearly 60% of eligible voters declined to cast a ballot. While that statistic is lamentable, heres the silver lining: a relatively small number of motivated voters can determine the tone and direction of San Diego and California. That could be you!22 commentsRead the full article Early OB Rag  underground newspaper for OB  where the surf meets the hipSeptember 20, 2010(Originally posted Sept 29, 2009)1968: The Rowdy College-Surf Town Morphs Into Hippie Haven________________________OB was already well-known for its rowdy and irreverent culture of beach, surf & beer; but by 1968, it began its transformation into something more. 11 commentsRead the full article San Diego Food Bank reports requests for food at all-time highAugust 28, 2010Layoffs, bankruptcies and other effects of the naggingly ailing economy are leading a record number of county residents to seek out donated food, the countys leading food-relief organization reported Friday.The San Diego Food Bank said its distributions are at an all-time high.

Jim Hopkin.Our visit was like a fantasy, as there was a time in our lives when neither he or I could have imagined a scenario wherein someday I would cruise up to a sidewalk in a nice chine, as we used to say, in front of Southwest Airlines and he jumps in and I whisk him to a Comfort Inn and we end the day in one of the hippest Mexican Cafes in town  with nary a soul in any of these places wearing a P.U. frown.Back then we knew no one who had flown any where  the concept of a colored person staying in a hotel had not yet been implanted in our young minds  and we couldnt eat in a cafe unless the sign above it read Jacks Barbeque or Dukes Drive-In.8 commentsRead the full article OB Town Council Candidates and Their StatementsAugust 23, 2010The Ocean Beach Town Council is having an election starting this week to fill 7 seats that are being opened.

Oh, the feeling of loss raises its ugly head again. Not with fangs this time but its come with a bite.15 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
