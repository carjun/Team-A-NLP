One should not have the right to choose to murder another person.  Don't you think it is time we call abortion what it is?  It is pure and simple murder of a person who has a soul.  That is not a little puppy dog in there.  Puppy dogs get more protection in our society than human children.  This is a shame on our country.  Heaven help us all. Our country and its abortion laws makes Hitler look like Cinderella!

How do we stand by and let this keep happening. Abortion is barbaric and uncivilized at best. It should be a criminal act and that is the shame of this country that it is not.    If you count an aborted fetus as a human life, then yes, I see your point -- Americans "kill" more people than Hitler did if you are speaking only in terms of numbers. However the specific atrocities committed against living, breathing, CONSCIOUS and THINKING children and adults, while they either witnessed atrocities being done to others, suffered themselves, or as the case usually was, both, are far more horrible and defy comparison. You cannot reduce such evils down to sheer numbers.  Nazi soldiers would take a toddler by each leg and rip him in half in front of his parents and other witnesses. The toddler is a thinking, feeling human being and so are his parents as are the other witnesses. You cannot compare something like that (and that is only one teensy example) to the abortion of an 8 week old fetus who neither thinks nors feels. The evils of Nazi atrocities are unmatched in scope. This is true, no matter how horrible you may think abortion is.  There have been other evil tyrants who wreaked unspeakable atrocities on a large group of people -- Hitler is not the only one and the Jews are not the only victims. None of these can be compared to abortion.  Personally, I find abortion a moral issue that should involve a lot of soul searching and careful thought, but we have to stop with the moral equivalencies. Some things really are worse than others. p.s. As for Jews rioting and defending themselves, you need to learn about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Lot of good it did in the end. I know it's warm and fuzzy to think of babes in the womb as defenseless and Jews as guilty (though that is also an ignorant way of viewing the matter), but there were no Jews "guilty" enough to deserve what happened to them, and that seems to be what you are implying. p.s.s. Some women are raped -- so much for choosing the act that got them pregnant. Last I heard, pro-lifers were in favor of prohibiting abortion even in the case of rape.

How do we stand by and let this keep happening.  Abortion is barbaric and uncivilized at best.  It should be a criminal act and that is the shame of this country that it is not.    You do realize that, before Roe v Wade, it WAS a criminal act in many states?  Thankfully the SCOTUS ruled that a woman has the right to decide whether or not her body should be used as an incubator for a child she doesn't want.

Shame on the USA and its barbaric laws.    Murder is still illegal and rightfully so.  But abortion is not legally considered murder.  Because, whether you agree or not, a fetus is not considered legally a human being.

If doing so will reduce her chances of going through with the abortion, then what is the problem? We should be doing everything we can to reduce abortion rates and keep them at low levels.  I can certainly understand if the pregnancy was the result of rape or if the woman's life is danger or if the pregnancy will cause psychological problems, but if the woman is out having unprotected sex with multiple men and wanting to use abortion as the easy way out, then I personally don't see how that can be a valid reason for abortion. Pro-choice people mention about the woman's right to choice... if a woman became pregnant because she was having unprotected sex with many men, the woman is choosing to engage in those acts with men, unless it was rape. If she had chose to not have sex or if she had chose to use proper protection, then she wouldn't have become pregnant in the first place, but if not, she and the man who impregnated her should face the consequences of having unprotected sex.

The government should NEVER have a say in what a woman chooses to do with her body unless those who would have it otherwise agree to adopt every single unwanted child of incest and rape along with just plain unwanted babies. Every child a wanted child. It's really simple.             Please register to post and access all features of our very popular forum. It is free and quick.
