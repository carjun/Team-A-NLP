He says he thinks Americans are making great strides toward accepting homosexuality."Step-by-step, we have realized that this issue of homosexuality has the same adverse and progressive elements as when we dealt with the race issue 50 years ago  or 40 years ago."He said with the country acclimated to having a black or female president, it's only a matter of time before it is ready for a gay one.groups:News, Politics, Gay tags:Gays,Jimmy Carter |55 comments// Jimmy Carter's Ready for a Gay Presidenthide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

Who was the other one? 25 days agoflag  reply0JohnA  UtopianSky:Abraham Lincoln was gay?  My Father is a Lincoln Scholar and I never heard that. 25 days agoflag  reply0UtopianSky  JohnA:Ask your father about Abe's boyfriends: Billy Greene and Joshua Speed when he was young, and Capt. David Derickson while he was president.Billy Greene wrote often about Abe's body- he said "His thighs were as perfect as a human being could be."When Mary Todd was out of town, Derickson would share his bed, and wear Abe's nightshirt. 25 days agoflag  reply+2UtopianSky  ImConcerned:I believe you are confusing FBI director J Edgar Hoover, who was gay, with President Herbert Hoover who was straight. 25 days agoflag  reply0JohnA  UtopianSky:Oh my.

So far in left field it must be a scary, lonely place for you.Just because people want equality that does NOT mean we want vengeance.I read your article- it had no substance.Charged with a felony for preaching the gospel? I'm not even familiar with the case and I can already tell that's a bald-faced lie.That's like saying if a man straps a Bible to a brick and tosses it through a gay bar's window he was not arrested for vandalism, but for "distributing scripture".As soon as I see the phrase "Advancing the Homosexual Agenda" I know I'm looking at the website of a hate group.Try getting your news from someplace else, because it is obvious that was just a propaganda piece.When I was a kid, there was a nutty religious family who trained their elementary school children to memorize Bible passages, go to the public schools (they were home schooled) and SCREAM the passages at the other children at the top of their lungs.The children were told to stop, and were removed from school grounds.The parents made a fuss that somehow THEIR freedom of religion was being violated. 24 days agoflag  reply-1maasanova  UtopianSky:So that one family you knew represents all Christians? Yep I can sense vengance... 24 days agoflag  reply+1UtopianSky  maasanova:Wow, that was ALL your bigotry, not mine.Do you only see people as group labels, not as individuals?That family was an example of people complaining that their religious freedom was being violated, when they were ACTUALLY violating the rights of others.Just like the article you posted.All of that flew over your head to the point that you portrayed it as a characterization of all Christians.Did you understand any of what I wrote at all?How about the part about tossing a Bible on a brick through a window? Did you grasp that? Even a bit?No, I do not want vengeance, I want equality.Dude, you need help.First, stop reading bigoted hate-filled websites like the one you posted- that is where you get your groupthink mentality. 24 days agoflag  reply-1maasanova  UtopianSky:I said I had no problem with a gay president, and YOU injected race and religion into this conversation, but I'M the bigot?WTF Seems like it would be you who needs help lol 24 days agoflag  reply+1UtopianSky  maasanova:Yes, without a doubt you are a bigot.1.)  this statement:"imagine that many in the LGTB community, such as yourself I assume, would love to take advantage of a gay president as an opportunity to call for vengance and payback for all of the injustices for the past 200 years."The fear that minorities are all out to get you is bigotry.2.) This article:http://chalcedon.edu/research/articles/court-voids-pennsylvania-hate-crime-law/Which you thought was a "civil rights situation" that anyone in their right mind would have to "weigh in on" shows you have no idea what civil rights even ARE.Hey, you could act like a mature individual and state that you now realize you were wrong on either one of those things, but I doubt that is going to happen. 24 days agoflag  reply-1maasanova  UtopianSky:Well we can debate civil rights all day, but the facts are clear that YOU brought up those evil STRAIGHT WHITE, CHRISTIANS as if they are all out to get YOU, while I said I would have no problem with a gay president. 24 days agoflag  reply+1UtopianSky  maasanova:Nope- I did not bring them up as to say they are all out to get me.Again- that is YOUR projection.I brought them up because of YOUR hypocritical notion that I and other GLBT people would want to enact vengeance on straights, by pointing out that EVERY HUMAN BEING is in some demographic label. Do you think every human being is out to enact vengeance on all of the other labels?You read things INTO what you read because of your bigotry.And deep down, you know that.And that is why you did not address what I said about the article you wanted me to read and comment on. 24 days agoflag  reply0maasanova  UtopianSky:I didn't say that the LGTB community was out to get ME, YOU said that. I'm perfectly ok with the LGTB community and a gay president, so long as their leaders aren't demanding preferrencial treatment. Pretty straight forward and honest, no?It was YOU who let us know who YOU hate with YOUR comment on "WHITE STRAIGHT CHRISTIANS."I said what I said in reference to people like YOU, who have never been shy about showing your total disdain for Christians, would likely call for revenge against those who YOU feel are responsible for injustices ie STRAIGHT WHITE CHRISTIANS. YOU said it I didn't!There's no other way to interpret that, but you are going to try nontheless to hide your own bigotry aren't you?LOL no one can ever say that you aren't entertaining UtopianSky that's for sure. 24 days agoflag  reply-7Oba_min_ationNewsflash: We currently have a gay president Google "Larry Sinclair" and read about a limo ride he had with Barrack Obama. 25 days agoflag  reply+3littlwarrior  Oba_min_ation:not so sure that mr sinclair is the most reliable of sources. http://www.mahalo.com/larry-sinclair 25 days agoflag  reply+4onemalefla  Oba_min_ation:yesahno agenda here.... 25 days agoflag  reply+4UtopianSky  Oba_min_ation:Newsflash: morons like you will believe anything. 25 days agoflag  reply+1ozoneocean  Oba_min_ation:Who let you out? 25 days agoflag  reply+1BKsaysAction  Oba_min_ation:Photoshop. 25 days agoflag  reply+2BKsaysAction  BKsaysAction:Actually that's an insult to Photoshop lets go with Corel paint. 25 days agoflag  reply+3derkI look forward to the signs ... they're pretty much the only election-related material that makes me smile these days. 25 days agoflag  reply+5littlwarriorWell though I think this would be amazing, I think a gay president would get the same response as Mr. Obama has from the GOP. "We hate you because we hate you and even though we lost and the will of the people was made known well just ignore that and do everything we can to make them hate you." 25 days agoflag  reply+4ThatCrazyLibertarianSexuality, sex, color and all those things matter not.Whoever can end these wars and bring our economy back from the edge of the abyss has my vote. 25 days agoflag  reply+6tverdellIf he can balance the budget, then I'm game. 25 days agoflag  reply+2onemalefla  tverdell:does it have to be a gay male? 25 days agoflag  reply0tverdell  onemalefla:As long as he is cute. 25 days agoflag  reply+5TimALoftiswhile I generally agree with the former President, I don't think it going to happen in my lifetime...do hope I'm wrong though. 25 days agoflag  reply+3UtopianSky  TimALoftis:I think of it this way- when I was young, homosexuality was still classified as a mental illness. Gay bars were illegal, and were raided by cops the way meth labs are now.I NEVER would have thought same sex marriage would ever even be considered a possibility by anyone, ever.Yet now, it is an inevitability.Progress comes faster than we think! 25 days agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  UtopianSky:progress comes fast unless its a bill that has to go through congress... 25 days agoflag  replymore fromNews:Michael Vick More Important to Obama Than Family of Soldier Killed In Combat The #1 Work From Home Business Of 2011 . . .
