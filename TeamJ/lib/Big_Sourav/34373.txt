Christina Taylor Greene was among those killed in a tragic shooting in Tucson, Ariz. on Saturday. Born on September 11, 2001, Greene was excited about the political process, was on the student government, and went to the Giffords event today to learn more about the political process, family members say. The incident occurred at a public event held by U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in her home district. Local NBC affiliate KVOA reports that family members say Christina, who was a student at Mesa Verde Elementary School, went to the event because she wanted to learn more about the world of politics. A neighbor was going to the Giffords event and invited Christina along because she thought she would enjoy it, said her uncle, Greg Segalini. The Pima County SheriffSheriff's Office has released the identities of the six people killed in this morning's tragic shooting. Christina had just been elected to the student council at her school. The event, held outside a Safeway supermarket north of Tucson, was an opportunity for constituents to meet Giffords and talk about any concerns they had related to the federal government. Segalini told the Republic that his niece was involved many extracurricular activities ranging from ballet to baseball. KVOA notes that she loved the sport, as well as horseback riding and swimming. The suspect is being interviewed at PCSO headquarters currently, and will be transported to jail later this evening, deputies        27 of 27         Tucson, AZ 2010 - Eric and Christina     smzafar is based in Islamabad, Federal Capital Area, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (77.8%) Canada (6.0%) Pakistan (3.4%) Italy (1.7%) 10 other countries (8.5%)           READ MORE: Shaukat Masood Zafar, Pakistan, ISLAMABAD, Born on 9/11/2001, Christina Taylor Green, tragic shooting, died today, causes-news, tucson, Joe Arpaio, Christina of Sweden, Arizona, KVOA, Christina McKinney, Gabrielle Giffords, Heads of state, Greg Segalini, Christina Taylor Greene, S.
