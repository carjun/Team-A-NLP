In the wake of Saturday's shootings in Tucson, Arizona, Americans are split over whether gun control laws should be made stricter, according to a new CBS News Poll.  According to the poll, 47 percent of Americans believe that gun control laws should be more stringent in the wake of the Arizona shootings. Meanwhile, 36 percent believed the laws should remain the same, and 12 percent thought the laws should be made less strict in light of the shootings.  The percentage of those who favor stricter gun control laws is up seven percent from a similar CBS poll in March of 2010 in which 40 percent of respondents said they supported strengthening regulations on gun ownership. In the same poll, 16 percent said gun control laws should be less strict, and 42 percent said they should stay the same.But support is down from the levels seen in 2002 when 56 percent supported tighter gun control, and in 1994 when stricter gun control had 59 percent support. Special Section: Tragegy in Tucson  Despite the apparent increase in public support for stronger gun control laws, however, most Americans said that, either way, they didn't think any such laws would have effectively prevented the violence in Tucson this weekend.  Of those surveyed, 36 percent said they thought stricter laws would have done at least a little to prevent the violence. (Of that group, eighteen percent said they thought the regulations would have done "a lot" to prevent the shootings.) But 58 percent of respondents said they didn't think tougher regulations would have had any effect on the situation.  Gun owners, in particular, were less likely to believe that tougher regulations would have prevented the shootings.  Of the 58 percent who said stronger gun control laws would have been ineffective in preventing the Arizona shootings, 77 percent said they had a gun in the household. But of the 18 percent who said they thought tougher gun laws would have done "a little" to prevent the shootings, only ten percent said they had a gun in the house. Seven percent of those who thought stricter laws would have done "a lot" to prevent the shootings said there was a gun in the house.   In the aftermath of the violence in Tucson this past weekend, the debate over gun control has been brought back to the forefront of American political discourse.  Advocates of more stringent regulations argue that the case of Jared Lee Loughner - the 22-year-old man accused of killing 6 people and injuring 14 in the Arizona shootings - exemplifies the overly lax nature gun control laws throughout the country. (Loughner's alleged weapon of choice - a semi-automatic Glock - can be purchased legally in the United States.)  "The law says that drug abusers can't buy guns," said New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a strong gun control advocate who co-founded an organization of pro-gun control mayors. "Even though Jared Loughner was rejected by the military for drug use and arrested on drug charges, he was able to pass a background check and buy a gun."  However, others echo Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) who urged legislators not to "make rash decisions" in the wake of the shootings.  "The normal instinct, and rightfully so, and it's a good instinct, is to protect. As a legislator, you protect through legislation. I think that's healthy. I think that's normal. I think those intentions are all good. In that regard, I applaud my colleagues," Grimm said in an interview with POLITICO.   "The training tells you, 'Don't make rash decisions, especially right after the event,'" he continued, adding that "those [who] are opposed to guns and want to regulate guns to begin with may use this to bolster their arguments."  Poll: 45% Say Politics Motivated Jared LoughnerRead the Complete Poll This poll was conducted by telephone on January 9-10, 2011 among 673 adults nationwide who were first interviewed by CBS News December 17-20, 2010. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups is higher. This poll release conforms to the Standards of Disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.

Reply to this comment            by WaterBuffaloRider January 11, 2011 8:45 PM EST  Republicans aren't worried about gun control. They are only worried about damage control. Sarah Palin still has the same scorn and contempt for Giffords.     Reply to this comment            by JayR75 January 11, 2011 8:19 PM EST  I would expect Mayor Bloomberg and his irresponsible gang of gun-haters would be for tighter gun control. In fact, I would suspect he may have recommended plans to the current Administration to disarm all Americans. Except the criminals, of course. Bloomberg needs to be reminded America has a Constitution with legally passed Amendments and just because he has the NYPD carrying guns to protect him, the common man across America is responsible for looking out for himself and his family. Strangely, when seconds count, OUR police protection is 20 minutes away; NOT within arm's reach.

Democraps love polls Repubs hate them because they mean nothing. Mob Rule doesn't work very well. We found that out very early in our history. 1776 to 1795 or there abouts. We tried every form of government we could think of and finally decided on a Constitutional Republic. Democracy's did work very well. The people just voted themselves everything and broke the state governments.     Reply to this comment            by mgilbo1 January 11, 2011 7:58 PM EST  Oh please... Give me a break. Last time I knew the police show up to the crime scene AFTER it has been committed. You say you want no guns now but when this country really goes into chaos, which won't be too far off into the future, you are going to wish you did. Protecting yourself in your home is a UNIVERSAL RIGHT. Should people be carrying guns out in the open, NO. Should ALL people lose their right to defend themselves because of ONE guy? No. That is emotional thinking not educated thinking. All you have to do is look at Canada. They took the guns away from their LAW ABIDING citizens and their crime skyrocketed 25%+ overnight. For every person that has been killed by a gun, I could name hundreds that could have been saved by one if they were trained to use them and be responsible. Wake up folks. This is just another push by the nutjobs to take away more of your rights. Don't fall for it and don't let this guys crazy photo, which they seem fine posting on every news site all day long, scare you. If anything, the TSA scares me more than him.

Also our Bible tells us that these things are going to be and even worse until Jesus comes back and cleans this mess up and begins HIS millenial reign.GODS word tells us that Satan is the god of this world, and when Christ was here, he tempted him Luke4:5, And the devil taking him up into a high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.6 And the devil said unto him,'All this power will I give thee and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.7 If thou therefore will worship me, all shall be thine."So when you trace all the kingdoms and find evil at the base of it, remember God told you so,but the rest tells us of a glorious future if we will put our trust in JESUS and repent and give him our heart. I believe they will confiscate the guns and we will have complete chaos, and then the antichrist be revealed, then 3 & 1/2 years of tribulation such as never been before- then JESUS will conquer. About guns, I think its been proven that when everyone is armed the crime rate is low when it comes to assult of any kind. Most maniacs are not suicidal- intentionally.my opinion.                         by abby_del_abbey January 11, 2011 7:36 PM EST  Maybe America needs to examine how the UK handles the selling and registration of guns. Look at their statistics of gun crimes.I have had enough of America's love affair with guns. It's getting people killed.     Reply to this comment           by mecanik-2009 January 11, 2011 8:11 PM EST  I'm sure they sell tickets to the UK and if you really talk nice to them I'm sure they will make you a citizen, oh excuse me a "Subject"                         by gig76 January 11, 2011 7:33 PM EST  If not U.S. Military, not police, not county sheriff or deputies, then no need for clips, magazines and unbelievable types of artillery. Ordinary citizens have no need for these types of guns, bullets, and equipment. It's senseless to think an individual needs these guns for mutilating cacti in the desert. And for rattlesnakes, that's what buckshot is for. These folks who scream about 2nd Amendments Rights are on or over the edge. They don't need these types of guns and equipment. Absurd!

I though we ran all of you out of the country after the war. Some fled to Canada but a few snuck back in.
