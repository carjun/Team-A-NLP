I did come upon one site that explained this as a being about runoff, which in some areas can cause groundwater depletion, pollution, erosion, and damage to agriculture. Look at all the runoff that goes into the Gulf of Mexico making it a dead zone. People need to be more responsible for stormwater runoff, and in many cities there are already programs to deal with it. However, in many instances sewers and drainage areas are not handled responsibly and it is actually detrimental to the environment as well as human health. Now, if I find it is actually a tax on the rain that falls that we all have to pay, well that is one thing. I need to do more research, but I do doubt that.http://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/stormwater/EPA- Stormwater Managementhttp://epa.gov/npdes/pubs/icr_fedreg.pdfOk, this is from the Federal Register dated 10/2009. There is no mention at all of taxing rainwater. This appears to be about stormwater drainage/management and actually protecting waterways from pollution. And there was actually a comment period.How disingenuous to twist this as you did. I may not agree with Obama about a lot of things and the same goes for the EPA, but this in no way looks to me to be anything as you described it. 29 days agoflag  reply+1PressCore  JanforGore:Thanks for clarifying that point, Jan. I  usualy read the article at the link firstbefore I comment. I've been a citizen of Colorado, and expect to return to livein the mountains in Summer eventualy. Colorado has prosecuted its citizens before, as several other Western States have, for simply collecting rainwater. They may have changed their law since. I still have to research further whatI've read since...I guess I may have mis assessed this particular situation. I thought it was a tax on fresh water collection in lieu of a criminal prosecution from the appearance of the photo per se. Fresh water is a big, big thing out West from Texas to California. Always has been. It's usualy in the areas of the USA which have always had ample rainfall that they seem to take this vital natural resource for granted. With the impending world fresh water shortage I suppose I went off on a tangent. I'll watch that next time. 29 days agoflag  reply+1JanforGore  PressCore:Well, privitization is a huge issue and the taxing of freshwater that way ( just posted about a huge protest in Malaysia over privitization)  is something we do have to be vigilant of which is why commoditizing water on the market is something I am definitely against. However, this looks like it is putting forth regulations to properly manage stormwater, which is a problem.  However, you do make a point about the freshwater crisis and taxing rainwater and down the road I don't see it as impossible in some areas of the world based on what we have seen regarding other mechanisms. That is why we need conservation and proper handling of it in this regard. 29 days agoflag  reply+1BrushwithDeathToothpaste  JanforGore:Thank you for the additional detail. 29 days agoflag  reply+1PressCore  JanforGore:This is the expose a WCNY TV broadcast had Matt Damon narrate about the water situation in Lima, Peru. It's a classic example of what this world is heading for. There are 2 classes of citizens in Peru. The white people, then the native Indian population. The Indian people have always been farmers populating the mountain area. For thousands of years, they've used the fresh water from the Glacial melt to irrigate their crops,( which are the type of substantial food crops humans should be preserving for seed stock as non GMO.) The white people populating Lima decided to build a pipeline across Indian land, and steal their fresh water resources. They could have done the honest, equitable thing, and offered to buy Indian water. Or they could have built a pipeline to the nearby seacoast. General Electric, the company founded by Thomas Edison, is a world leader in R & D ing desalination tech. Had the white Peruvians gotten their Government to invest public tax funds in purchasing desalination technology, built a water treatment plant, and their pipeline from the other direction, they would have had in inexhaustible supply of usable water for drinking, bathing, cooking, industry. The Limans routinely waste fresh, pure water by operating elaborate water displays to attract tourists to stimulate their economy...And meanwhile the Indian highlanders are displaced from their land. Unable to farm, they're driven to the outskirts of Lima where they build shanty towns. The fortunate get jobs in the big city, then go back to live in slums where the white people have rationed them to 5 gallons of water a week which they have to pay for. There are Millions of human souls living in slums being extorted to pay for their own water, stolen from them by racist whites who waste it on light shows at night.  As a result, these Indian people are subjected to more sickness, and premature deaths due to infections of their people of more advanced age. This pattern ofracial Discrimination, forced poverty, sickness & death is the least of the tragedy. The time wasted by Corporate Fascism using the Government as a Mob to steal their water, then sell it back to the Larceny victims to profit the Corporation is a ticking time bomb. The French Revolution exploded because of the prolonged exploitation causing virtual starvation amongst the peasants. When Marie Antoinette suggested they eat cake, it was so ignorant of the life or death struggle of the have nots, that once they stormed the prison for political abductees they rioted openly, the lawful order of legitimate Government ended, and the lawless injustices of the Revolutionary Council ran rampant. Here in the USA, we'd already had our Revolution which our founding fathers won due to the support of the French such as General LaFayette. But only 1/3 of colonial Americans were Patriots who favored breaking away from England. The opposing 1/3, the Tories, fought against the American Revolutionary armybecause, to them the crimes occurring as the result of displacement of theCrown's law enforcement authority were atrocities worse than Crown oppression. Ultimately, these real horror stories from History will repeat themselves if we allow the merger of Corporations & Government to create the Mob Fascism which will steal anything they can through Piracy, to troll it's resale to us. Yes, water IS life. In the 2007 Documentary,: " WTF do WE know, anyway " A bona fide natural science experiment proved that the element created when H2O is combined is both as alive & intelligent as humans are.Truth is stranger than fiction. If you haven't already reviewed this documentary, Jan, you owe it to yourself to. Water is a gift from God. 28 days agoflag  reply0unimatrix0You tin foil hat wearing loons ought to check this out - if you care about the environment you should care about rain water run-off:A Sustainable Approach to  Stormwater ManagementWhen it rains, stormwater runoff that isn't properly managed can flow over impervious surfaces picking up pollutants along the way and washing them into rivers and streams. Stormwater runoff can also cause flooding and erosion, destroy habitat and contribute to combined sewer overflows.http://www.portlandonline.com/bes/index.cfm?c=34598 29 days agoflag  reply0unimatrix0This is just more masturbation material for the tin foil mafia.

The tax is on water runoff.  Check with your local water department and they will tell you that runoff is a major issue.  Those who contribute to it in areas that do not have proper drainage can cost your local town or city a lot of money.  But if you don't mind living downhill from a neighbor whose water collection runoff floods out your drainage or basement then feel free complain about this policy. 29 days agoflag  reply0unimatrix0  BrushwithDeathToothpaste:well said. 29 days agoflag  reply-3a619koand what are the people goin to do about this? 29 days agoflag  replymore fromNews:Latest Updates UniFirst CEO Ronald Croatti Louisiana officials: parts of coastline still heavily oiled Suspected CIA Banker Allen Stanfords Trial Indefinitely Delayed Online USA News: Fernanda Vasconcellos with her shoes most populartop rankednew & rising1Remember When Beck Ridiculed Pelosi For Speaking Out Agains... 2Obama lays blow to closing Guantanamo 3Obama Created More Jobs in One Year Than Bush Created in Eight 4Corporations or politicians hurting America? 5Congress to Reduce Free Speech? -- In Response to shooting 6The system suited everybody until the crisis hit  Ron Paul 7LIFE'S GOOD, SHUT UP ! 8Michael Vick More Important to Obama Than Family of Soldier... 9A Real Hero....
