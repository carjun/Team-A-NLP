Now I'm just wondering if she'll continue in this direction with her next album... When I think of Kelly Clarkson, I think of American Idol. I think of her movie (that I LIKED, even though it flopped), From Justin To Kelly: The Tale of Two American Idols. I think of her debut album, Thankful, which had the song A Moment Like This on it. You know, the song she sang on American Idol. Kelly Clarkson and American Idol are synonymous. And it's not really a good thing anymore.  I guess Kelly realized the same thing about her career, and when it was time to record material for her sophomore album, Breakaway, she figured she'd get as far away from American Idol and anything even remotely related to it as she could.  The result is a mature album, full of songs co-written by Kelly, and Evanescence sounding vocals- a complete departure from the Kelly Clarkson we used to relate with American Idol.   1) Breakaway  This is pretty much the only "light" or "fluffy" song on the album. Which makes me wonder why it's the tile track, because this song does not encompass the theme of the album at all. Hmmm....  Anyway this is a decent song about going after your dreams. It was on the Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack, and I remember seeing the music video on Nickelodeon, Noggin, and the Disney Channel all summer long. Which really makes this song remind me of the summer and good times, so that makes me like it more.  2) Since U Been Gone I really like this song. It starts off wonderfully, with Kelly singing "Here's the thing, we started off friends," and then the beat kicks in. By the chorus, the tempo picks up more, and Kelly is practically screaming. This song has so much energy in it...it's a great song to listen to when you're in the mood to jump around and dance.   3) Behind These Hazel Eyes Most reviews of this album have several Avril Lavinge comparisons in them, and this song is DEFINITELY Avril. I'm pretty sure if I had just listened to this for the first time, not knowing it was Kelly, I'd say it's a song by Avril. Kelly sort of sounds like her, and the whole way the song is composed is just Avril Lavinge. The heartbroken lyrics, the guitar-based chorus, the agony-ridden vocals...the whole thing reminds me of her. Which is a bit unfortunate 'cause I'm not a big Avril fan, so I usually skip this song.  4) Because Of You Here it is-the second comparison. This song reminds me (as well as several other reviewers) of something by Evanescence. The soft, piano based verses sound close to My Immortal, and then the chorus jumps up in tempo...just like most of Evanescense's songs. This could be due to the fact that one of their members, Ben Moody, co-wrote and produced this track.  Anyway, this is quite a good song. Kelly sings about a negative relationship with someone (I've heard it's about her parents?), and the impact they've had on her life. The lyrics are vulnerable and honest, for example, "Because of you/I'm ashamed of my life/Because it's empty/Because of you/I am afraid".  5) Gone This song has a peppy, 80's feel to it. It's upbeat and makes me want to dance, but besides that, it's not that great. The lyrics are pretty boring and Kelly doesn't sound special in it or anything. I usually skip this one, unless I'm in a hyper mood.  6) Addicted I LOVE this song. The song is very slow, and almost depressing, but it works well. And the lyrics are amazing. Some of my favorites are in the chorus ("It's like I can't breathe/Without you interrupting me") and during the bridge ("I'm hooked on you/I need a fix/I can't take it/Just one more hit/I promise I can deal with it"). The subject matter reminds me a bit of Christina Aguilera's song, Walk Away, but this track has a bit more edge to it. I love it!  7) Where Is Your Heart This song is the closest to anything you'll find on Thankful. It's the only ballad on the album, but it still comes off as being a lot more mature than anything on Kelly's debut. I think my favorite thing about this song is the honesty in the lyrics. Lines from the chorus, "Where is your heart?/Cause I don't really feel you" and "Is it so hard/To give me what I need/I want your heart to bleed/And that's all I'm asking for" as well as other parts in the song are ones I can personally relate to, so maybe that's why I like this song so much. When Kelly is singing this song, you can't help but feel that she is singing the words from her heart; that's she had this exact experience in real life, which makes the song even more likable.  8) Walk Away This song reminds me so much of Fefe Dobson. If you don't know who she is, she's like a watered down version of Avril Lavigne. And she released a single this summer called, Boys and Girls (I'm in LOVE with that song), and Walk Away reminds me so much of it. They both have an 80's pop feel, kind of like Gone, but this song is even MORE 80's. Walk Away is another fun song...it makes me want to dance around in some leg warmers and sing into my hairbrush while pretending it's a microphone. Good times.  9) You Found Me The album goes down hill here. This song is OK...it's not really a skip, but not good enough to stand out, either. It's just a bit boring.  10)I Hate Myself For Losing You This is probably the worst song on the album. I NEVER listen to it. It's over dramatic, the lyrics suck ("What do you do/When you look in the mirror/And staring at you/Is why he's not here"..::rolls eyes::), and even Kelly's voice can't do it justice. It kind of upsets me that they chose to put THIS song on the album, and skipped on such a great song as Don't (a song Kelly sang on tour with Clay...it was TONS better than this track!).  11) Hear Me I'm not sure why I like this song, but I do. Lyrically, there's not much different going on, but musically, it's great to listen to. It starts off slow and sweet, but picks up during the chorus, as Kelly sings "Hear me/I'm crying out/I'm ready now/Turn my world upside down/Find me!"  12) Beautiful Disaster (live) If you have Thankful then you know that this song is included on that album as well. This version is composed of just Kelly and the piano instead of all the production on the original, which works nicely. I do like this version better, but it is a bit unnecessary.

I'm so glad I bought this one.We all know Kelly has a powerhouse voice, but this CD shows that her talent has staying power. I have only listened to the CD all the way through 2 or 3 times so far, but I have liked nearly everything I have heard, and I like that there is some variety in the tempo.

Her debut 'Thankful' is good, but her follow-up is even better. On her first C.D. she showed she could master a variety of pop forms, but in some ways it was still a try-out. Here she showcases her ability to perform pop music fluidly and with great power. The singles are her best material, but the other songs, while usually not as great, are never filler.

She solely deserves all those awards she had rack up last year. Kelly has a lot of honesty on this album. She really put herself out there on songs like "Because Of You." I thought this album would be fill with typical ballads but Kelly has managed to do what I thought was impossible. She's impressed me and made me love her voice even more! Kelly had more than proven her vocal capabilities  more                                Comment                                Compliments (12)                review by MichaelN.March 04, 2006posted in Music MattersExcellent!I usually hate the contest shows on tv and do not watch them at all. Kelly Clarkson has gone way beyond anything that I thought could come out of one of those shows. The tracks Since You've Been Gone and Breakaway make the CD worth getting. The rest of the CD is excellent and shows that Kelly is probably one of the top female performers that will have staying power.

Cons: Dark, morose, depressing music.  The Bottom Line: Lets hope Breakaway is a phase, and not the direction all of Kellys music will take in the future.  There are two over-riding themes on Kelly Clarksons latest album Breakaway: agonizing heartbreak and heavy metal, both of which should be taken in small doses.

"Breakaway" is just that, a new direction for a very talented artist. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of stuff here for fans of her days on "American Idol" and her "Thankful" album. Clarkson provides for this in tunes like "Because Of You," "Where Is Your Heart" and "Beautiful Disaster." But the real gems here are her edgier tunes like "Breakaway," "Addicted" and "I Hate Myself For Losing You."

Most of these on the songs on this album are about different aspects of falling in love or breaking up with someone, but I enjoyed it anyway. My favorite song is the title track. It is a great song about asserting your own independence and living your own life. I have loved this song ever since it appeared on Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack this past summer. The other hit on this album is the song Since You Been Gone.

Instead she dug in her heels and allowed good sense (or a good manager) to steer, and somewhere Simon Fuller and the rest of the TV gang ought to be smiling. CreditBreakaway, which couldn't be more aptly titled--the sophomore effort represents a seismic split from the thin if pretty debut,Thankful. Here we encounter Clarkson as superstar, with the humility that made her likable on the first disc tucked tightly under her arm. First single and leadoff track "Breakaway" topped the pop charts on arrival, and its rock-friendly thumps, dips, and rolls don't wear out their welcome. Instead,they blend into the firestorm of beats and guitars that is "Since U Been Gone," another shout-it-out rocker. Those songs set the tone for the rest of the disc in all its fury: The innocence is long gone, "Addicted" and "Hear Me" say. The big, expressive voice ringed by the occasional high-pitch trill--the one that prompted millions to get behind her onIdol--doesn't dip entirely off the radar, though. On "Where Is Your Heart" and the stunning live closer "Beautiful Disaster," it's there in full force--a hint, maybe, that despite the wide, smart career stepBreakawayrepresents, her fans come first.-Tammy La Gorce            view wiki  TagsMusic, Pop, Rock And Pop, Albums, 2000s, Kelly Clarksonsee all  DetailsLabel:                               RCAArtist:                               Kelly ClarksonGenre:                               PopRelease Date:                               November 30, 2004First to ReviewRobertYokoyama"Breakaway is an excellent CD"MoviesBooksMusicFoodTv ShowsTechnologyPoliticsVideo GamesParentingFashionGreen LivingAll TagsAbout LunchPressFAQsContact UsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySitemapReport Abuse 2011 Lunch.com, LLC All Rights ReservedLunch.com - The Best Consumer Reviews Online()Follow MeThis is you!
