"Mohamed died yesterday (Tuesday) at 5:30 pm at the hospital in Ben Arous," said his brother Salem Bouazizi. He would be buried on Wednesday, he said. "It is a tragedy. The whole family is united at Mohamed's family home to wait for the arrival of the body," his uncle Mehdi Horchani added. Despite his education, Mohamed Bouazizi was forced to sell fruit and vegetables on the street in the Sidi Bouzid region of central Tunisia to earn a living. After police confiscated his produce because he did not have a proper permit, he burned himself in protest on December 17, rights groups said. UnrestUnrest and clashes erupted across tightly-controlled Tunisia, with a teenager shot dead by security forces in one protest, several people wounded and cars and buildings set alight. The Paris-based International Federation of Human Rights Leagues, announcing Bouazizi's death, said the underlying causes of the unrest should be looked into. "An investigation or a national commission is needed to determine the causes and the solutions of this social protest which has taken a tragic form," said the leader of the group, Souhayr Belhassen. "We have learned of the death of young Mohamed Bouazizi in the Ben Arous hospital from serious burns," the Committee for the Respect of Freedom and Human Rights in Tunisia said in Paris separately. The health ministry also announced his death in a statement on the official TAP news agency that recalled that President Zine El Abidine Ben AliZine El Abidine Ben Ali had visited Bouazizi in hospital late December. On December 22 another young man, Sidi Bouzid, climbed up an electricity pylon and electrocuted himself on the cables, saying he was fed up with being unemployed. The government would not confirm the suicide, but ordered a judicial investigation into the circumstances of his death. The worst day of the rioting was December 24, when thousands of people took to the streets and burned the local headquarters of the national guard, which responded with gunshots that killed an 18-year-old protestor.        1 of 6         President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, 2nd left, visits Mohamed Bouazizi, the young man who set himself on fire, at Ben Arous Burn and Trauma Centre, in Tunis 28 December 2010      shahzaib chaudhary is based in Islamabad, Federal Capital Area, Pakistan,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (55.0%) Pakistan (12.5%) Czech Republic (6.2%) United Kingdom (3.8%) 12 other countries (17.5%)           READ MORE: Mehdi Horchani, Salem Bouazizi, Tunisia, disasters-news, Tunis, Unrest (band), Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Sidi Bou Zid, geography, Disaster Accident, Ben Arous, Africa, social issues, Mohamed Bouazizi, Sidi Bouzid   More News From: Tunis :  Tunisia     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     Rashid Hussain|4 daysagonice reporting man, keep it up,            Reply  Posted By     mfaisalrafique|3 daysagonice reporting man, keep it up,                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         The Tunisian who set himself on fire dies from injuries By: karasiwo      The young man behind the popular protests against unemployment in Tunisia has died from his injuries.
