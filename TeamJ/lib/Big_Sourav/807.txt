So here we are then, I thought to myself, as I walked into the Sunrise Clinic. My first visit to the place that was going to give me back my looks that having been sliding towards my feet, since turning, well, that age! There was no going back now. I have been looking in the mirror over the last few weeks, and I had noticed my face looked a bit, well, old!, and however many facial exercises I did, it didn't seem to want to work in any way. The baggy saggy look that my eyes were beginning to mold into, just looked horrible, to say the least! Okay, I have had a few sleepless nights, like you do, but my skin always jumped back into place pretty quick, usually after a glass of water, and a couple of bottles of moisturiser! Swiftly followed by ten different vitamins. But this time, oh no, so I decided, enough was enough. I would go for it. I always thought that going to a beauty clinic was only for the rich and pretentious. Not for the likes of you and me. What was wrong with a face mask, moisturiser, or if in dire need, a carrier bag, ready to be swiftly placed over the head in times of emergency? Usually when you spot an old boyfriend coming around the corner with an immaculate girlfriend on his arm. But after careful consideration, I decided to take the bull by the horns and hot foot it down to the nearest Clinic, to see what could be done. Obviously I tried to find one that was quite cheap, but not lacking in care and consideration, as I didn't want to spend my hard earned money on a Salon that would not be up to scratch. So I drifted from one to the other, not quite sure which one to go too. I found that you have to have a feeling for it. I did try a few in the high street, but did not feel particularly comfortable. Why this was, I am not sure, maybe it was their attitude, or maybe it was because there were lots of younger people in there and I felt a bit out of place. I did have one funny moment when I called into a very exclusive clinic, and as I walked up the path, it was around the back of a row of shops, I thought to myself, if I fall over now, I will die of embarrassment! I could smell the money from the road! Anyway, I entered the building and the second I looked around the door, I realised that I had made a big mistake. This was rich! The ladies walking around casually, looked as though they had just stepped off of their yachts! I thought, oh my God, how do I get out of this one? I just knew that when I read their pamphlets, we would be talking serious money. So I smiled serenely at the lady behind the counter, put on my best voice, well I tried!, and slid gracefully into the waiting area chair. Picking up the booklet, I tried not to faint at the prices. Yeeks! A facial on its own would cost me a months grocery allowance! Run, run for the door, I thought! But no, I glanced through the book, oohing and ahhing at the appropriate treatments, one eye on the receptionist. Okay, here goes, I thought. Getting up, I smiled and said, thank you I will tell her about this, and I am sure she will be very interested!! I know what you are thinking. Coward! But in my favour, It was the only thing I could think of at that moment! So after scampering out of the door, I decided to try the one across the road. Thank goodness I did. As soon as I walked in, I realised that this was the one for me. It was smaller and friendlier. The actual waiting room and reception desk was clean and welcoming, this was important to me, as so many salons and hairdressers these days have a dusty look, if you know what I mean! So I made my first appointment. On the day of the treatment, I walked in, not knowing what to expect, but the girls were so friendly, it soon put me at my ease. I was taken to a treatment room, and was happily surprised to find that it was warm and light, with ambient music on in the background. Bear with me, as I said, I had never done this before! It did feel strange laying on the table, with the towels nearly up to my neck. At first I felt as though I was in the dentist! If the girl had said, say ahhhh, I would have legged it! But after a few moments I started to relax. It was odd though, I had never thought that I would feel strange having someone massage and warm my face. It really felt weird. Remember, I had never had this done before. The first treatment was Caci, this is a treatment where the beautician places electrical implements on your skin, to allow a small current to stimulate the collagen and muscles, this is to firm and tighten your face. These consisted of a pen like instrument, that was placed on strategic muscles, and pads that were placed under the chin. To start with I thought it might hurt around my mouth, as I had a home kit that, when it came into contact with the fillings in my teeth, caused me to jump and yell! But this is different. I could feel a slight tingling, but that was all. After the treatment, which had gone on for about forty minutes, warm flannels were put on my face, and that was magical! Then I was given a moisturiser and this made my face feel lovely. Some people have said that they could not feel or see any difference, but I could, because as I said, I had a home kit, so I knew what to look out for. After a few minutes, I was given microdermabrasion. Now this was the one that had frightened me! I had a horrible feeling that I would end up looking like a lobster dropped into boiling water! For some reason, I thought it would really hurt as it is another hand held instrument, that shoots tiny chrystals at your face, with the purpose of taking away the top dead layer of your skin. Ow, you might think! But no, in fact it was quite a pleasant feeling. Imagine gently rubbing an emery board across your face, and that is what it felt like. After she had finished, I had loads of lovely creams massaged into my face, and when I touched my skin, it felt so smooth, I couldn't believe it. I couldn't wait to get to a mirror to check it out. Obviously one session is not going to turn you back to thirty five years old, but trust me when I say, my face looked fresher and tighter. The dark patches under my eyes, that were beginning to look slightly papery, had gone! Maybe nobody else would notice it, but trust me, I did. I suddenly felt more confident again, and realised that with a bit of work, I would find the real me again! Everybody should try it. I found that the combination that I did, the Caci and the microdermabrasion together, really did the job. most people usually have one or the other treatments, or if they do have them, it is usually a few weeks apart. When I go next time, I will do the same again, as the combination of the two was not only a good idea, because it entailed more work on my skin, but it was an hour and a half relaxation! Can't be bad!The one thing that I didn't even think about, was how relaxed and warm I would feel when I had finished. I cannot remember the last time I relaxed to that extent. In this day of running about, getting stressed over the smallest thing, I have actually found my Eden! And trust me, that is just as important as looking good. I would just like to say thanks to the girls at the Sunrise Clinic, for making me feel good about myself again. I will be back.

Useful Funny Awesome (1)Beautiful (1)Commentsmsorensson9 months ago Oh.. how wonderful that you shared this with us.Thank you, Nell. It dispelled a few notions that I had.Nell Rose9 months ago Hi, msorensson, wow that was quick! thank you. I did try and download a picture of dermabrasion, but for some reason it is not working, but I will do it as soon as possible. Honestly, it was great. The dermabrasion was a surprise, as I thought it would hurt. But no, it was great, and even though other people may not have seen the difference, or maybe just did not look for it!, I felt a confidence that I had thought I had lost. great stuff, I highly recommend it. thank you for being so quick. cheers nellHello, hello,9 months ago A very interesting read but I am too much of a coward and knowing my luck it would go all wrong.  Thank you for your hub.Micky Dee9 months ago Luckily for me I'm eternally beautiful. All my wrinkles are in the proper places that give me "character". A few people have actually said I have too much "character"."Emprisome" (I think that's the spelling") by mannatech is excellent (of course I don't need it). Thank you Nell my belle!Keira79 months ago Lol, really funny and perfect hub:) Hi my lovely Nell !! Thank you for this wonderful journey I had at the clinic with you.:} I imagined you on the long chair relaxing and me waiting for the result.:) I am glad you had a brilliant experience. If that photo of yours on the avatar its recent. I think you look very young, and pretty. Sometimes we think we look old but others will find us young. Its like we are the only ones to see the wrinkles. But you done well to go for it,  confidence about beauty its very important for a women. And "because we are worth it". Thank you for sharing my dear Nell. Bless you my lovely friend.:)daisyjae9 months ago That sounded lovely! I would think it would hurt, too. I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.Green Lotus9 months ago Good for you Nell! If it made you feel pampered and relaxed that's excellent; if I gave you non-surgical "lift" even better. I feel more beautiful just having read about it!akirchner9 months ago Holy cow! You are brave....I would probably get the treatment where it went haywire and actually shot my face full of needles or something.  I'm glad it worked though - do they have treatments for other parts that need lifting - like your rear end?  Or how about boobs that used to be 38 and are now 38 longs?  Good grief!  Why is it so much fun to grow older?  I guess it beats the alternative though....Nell Rose9 months ago Hi, Hello Hello, thanks for reading it. I am sure you would be fine, microdermabrasion is very gentle, there is another sort which is when them go deeper to really get rid of wrinkles and facial deformaties, but this one is really just rubbing the top 'dirty' layer of. thanks again nellHi, Mickey, I am sure you are gorgeous, including all your 'fine' lines ha ha, I will check out the one you have put, and get back to you. thanks again, nellHi, Keira, thanks for the nice comments. My picture above, was one of about twenty I took, to try and get myself looking good! you should see the rest! ha ha, and I think that we should all do something like this once, just to see if we like it. if only for the relaxation! thanks again nellHi, daisyjae, I thought it would hurt, but that is when they use the strong version to correct faults on the face. I must admit that I was a bit scared of the electrical one though, because I used the one at home, and nearly jumped through the ceiling when it vibrated my fillings! ouch! I had turned it up to much..... ha ha thanks again nellHi, Green Lotus, it was relaxing, and the electrical one was really great, I must admit, I did clutch the edge of the table at first, thinking I was going to jump! but after about two minutes, I felt myself relaxing! phew! thanks again nellHi, Audrey, Ha Ha, I must admit I felt like that to start with! and yes you can get it done on the rest of your body. The electric treatment, I mean! they use the same instruments for your bust, bum and belly, also your back, I think! wow, I bet that hurts! not gonna try it, oh no no no.... thanks nellPollyannalana9 months ago I love anything like that, I'm not saying I like pain :( but it would take a lot to cause me pain physically, I love relaxing and letting ppl doing anything to relax me, long as they don't wake me up! I don't know if you know our Betty White,(a Golden Girl) she is in her 80's now but still going and I learned a lot of facial exercises from her I have tried to remember over the years to keep the face a little tighter.Nell Rose9 months ago Hiya, Pollyannalana, thanks again for reading it. The dermabrasion is very gentle, I think that it is the full dermabrasion that hurts, this is a bit like rubbing a rough flannel over your face. but it does work as it leaves the skin feeling really soft. I also do the face exercises as they do seem to help! (I hope) ha ha cheers nellMoney Glitch9 months ago Oh wow, Nell thanks for that wonderful virtual trip to the salon. This treatment sounds intriguing and is affordable. Ooohhh, the things women enduring for beauty. Thanks for sharing your experience. :)Nell Rose9 months ago Hi, Money Glitch, thanks for reading it, I loved it that day, and if I can afford it again, I will have another go, even if it is only to make me relax and nod of to sleep! ha ha thanks nellGranny's House9 months ago Great hub Nell.I am 52 now and I have noticed more and more my face changing. Maybe someday if I have the money I will try it too. Fun HubNell Rose9 months ago Hi, Granny's House, thanks again for reading it. I only went really out of curiosity, and because I decided on some me time for a change!! lol we don't get that very often, do we? At first it was really strange, I actually felt like I was going to the dentist! I was so nervous! but it was great. But not something I could afford or want to do very often. thanks again nellcatherine747 months ago Nice hub. Might consider the treatment myself. Thanks.Nell Rose7 months ago Hi, catherine, thanks for the comment, I appreciate it. Nellmulberry15 months ago I haven't tried any of this. I did buy an at home microdermabrasion kit, and even with that it's amazing how smooth your skin feels. I don't think there are any lasting effects from it, but it feels nice the rest of the day.Nell Rose5 months ago Hi, mulberry, thanks again for stopping over, I felt great after having this done, my face felt really smooth and younger. obviously it doesn't last long but at the time, well I looked terrific!! lol well I think so, but I am biased! ha ha but seriously, just the fact that I had a pampering, feeling completely relaxed, made my day. thanks again nellGmaGoldie5 months ago I wanted to buy one of these!  I had the microdermabrasion and loved it!  I have two treatments left.  AT 48, I my skin and my soul both needed a lift.  Great Hub!Nell Rose5 months ago HiGmaGoldie, Thank you for reading it, I had this done a while ago and feel like I need another one now! I have just turned 51 and I think we all deserve a good pampering sometimes, I definitely need another one just for the lift! thanks nelllindaadams373 months ago An interesting way to pamper yourself but do you think some other natural remedies or exercises like Yoga could have added a new and blissful dimension to Facial Microdermabrasion process?Nell Rose3 months ago Hi, Linda, You have got a really good point there, I do believe that the salon did have other treatments on offer, not sure about Yoga, but they did have aromatherapy and other facials. It would be a good idea maybe to spend a whole day just going from one thing to another, what bliss! lol thanks so much nellBeatsMe6 weeks ago Wow. Sounds like luxury to me. ;) Too bad the effects don't last.Nell Rose6 weeks ago Hi, BeatsMe, ha ha I know what you mean! that's why I carry a bag around with me, so when my face starts dropping again I can swiftly place it over my head! lol thanks again nellGypsy Willow12 days ago Thanks for the lovely hub. I think I deserve one of these treatments soon!! Glad you enjoyed it.Nell Rose11 days ago Hi, Gypsy Willow, it was great! even if it didn't do anything drastic, it certainly made me very relaxed! and my skin felt great! thanks so much nellSubmit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites100Nell Rose967 Followers104 HubsJoined 16 months agoRead more hubs by Nell RoseContact Nell RoseFollow Nell RoseSubscribe to Nell Rose's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk Nell Rose a question based on this Hub.Related Questionsis there a doctor who can help with my face lift free please anybody i feel real bad about the...asked by loreen gonzalez 5 weeks ago0 answersAnswer this questionHomemade face packs for glowing skinasked by dishyum 11 months ago4 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsOmnilux and Rejuvalight (Lumiere) Facial Reviews - face...by Marisa WrightTop 10 Anti Wrinkle Creams Reviewed 2010by wavegirl22Easy Homemade Face Mask Recipesby The Good CookCollagen the Anti Aging Truth by wavegirl22Skin Physics Photon Review: does it work?by Marisa WrightSpa-At-Home: Recipes for Puffy Eyes and Dark Circle Remediesby Maddie Ruud Skin Care ForumTopicRepliesBeauty regimenposted by annieloulaurel8Exfoliationposted by imatellmuva1Acneposted by Jessie Jatz40Post a new topic18 more topics Tagshealth skin treatment vitamin relaxation anti-aging Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
