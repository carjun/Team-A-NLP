I knew she was one of the main organizers of a car caravan to Phoenix to protest the new Arizona immigration law, SB 1070.  She is an energetic woman in her mid-forties who has a huge heart, a leader in the local Unitarian Universalist church, who also is the granddaughter of Lzaro Cardenas, one of the great former presidents of Mexico  in fact the FDR of our southern neighbor.On Friday, May 28th, she and about a hundred others departed from Chicano Park on their way to cross the desert and arrive in Phoenix for a protest rally and march to the Arizona state capital today. 5 commentsRead the full article An Open Letter to Rand Paul and His Libertarian RacismMay 27, 2010Dear Rand Paul:It is not possible to change a true bigots values. Much of that comes from generational views passed down from parents, grandparents, whatever.  But I want to address your recent remarks since you won the Kentucky GOP senate primary.I would have to agree to disagree with you on pretty much every  level. One argument you make is that you prefer to have racist business owners openly advertising their hatred, so that you can make an informed decision. My guess from this statement is that youve never been a victim of bigotry, or racism, or true hate.30 commentsRead the full article Unconfirmed: BP Oil Leak Said to be Temporarily StoppedMay 27, 2010Engineers have at least temporarily stopped the flow of oil and gas into the Gulf of Mexico from a gushing BP well, the federal governments top oil-spill commander, U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, said Thursday morning.The top kill effort, launched Wednesday afternoon by industry and government engineers, had pumped enough drilling fluid to block oil and gas spewing from the well, Allen said. The pressure from the well was very low, he said, but persisting. The top kill effort is not complete, officials caution.2 commentsRead the full article We are the Emperor and were nakedMay 27, 2010Political apathy? Nah, political crapathy!By Sarah Little / OB Rag / May 27, 2010After much introspection Ive concluded that Im not politically apathetic. I am politically horrified. Im socially horrified as well. I look around and see a nation of lemming-like creatures who gasp in horror when tragedy strikes as we turn our collective heads to some overriding power that is supposed to step in to avert or mitigate disaster. FEMA, local law enforcement, OSHA, the Coast Guard, Border Patrol, the School Board, the Constitution, the Pope God! Someone or something is supposed to make sure this doesnt happen and if it does the they are supposed to fix it!16 commentsRead the full article The War Is Making You Poor ActMay 26, 2010By Congressman Alan Grayson /MichaelMoore.com / May 21, 2010Next week, there is going to be a debate in Congress on yet another war funding bill. The bill is supposed to pass without debate, so no one will notice.What George Orwell wrote about in 1984 has come true. What Eisenhower warned us about concerning the military-industrial complex has come true. War is a permanent feature of our societal landscape, so much so that no one notices it anymore.But were going to change this. Today, were introducing a bill called The War Is Making You Poor Act. The purpose of this bill is to connect the dots, and to show people in a real and concrete way the cost of these endless wars.5 commentsRead the full article Most of the coastal waters in OB get an A+ ratingMay 26, 2010Heal the Bay, a Santa Monica conservation group that conducts coastal waters tests, has given part of Ocean Beach an A+ rating in its latest annual report. The water around the OB Pier in both dry and wet weather got this highest rating.  Dog Beach did not fare as well, as it remains a troubled area due to the run-off that comes down the San Diego River.High grades in the coastal water rating system demonstrate that there are less incidence of sickness from fecal bacterial in the surfzones for ocean users.2 commentsRead the full article California Primaries  Part 7: The Race for San Diego County Sheriff   Legacy, Labor and Lunacy Carry the DayMay 26, 2010Journalist Hunter S. Thompson arrived in Aspen, Colorado in the late 1960s with a live skunk in his care. Or so the story goes. With Thompson, later to be dubbed the founder of gonzo journalism, the truth depended on your perspective on reality.One of Thompsons more famous takes on reality involved his running for Sheriff of Aspen four decades ago on a Freak Power platform, which included:** Rip up all city streets with jackhammers and sod the streets at once.** Change the name Aspen to Fat City. This would prevent greed heads, land rapers, and other human jackals from capitalizing on the name Aspen.16 commentsRead the full article San Diego Police Ready to Be a Presence At the BeachMay 26, 2010By Stephen Luke / NBCSanDiego.com / May 26, 2010San Diego police are laying out their summer staffing plans for the citys beach areas. Starting this Friday with the Memorial Day weekend crowds, San Diegans will see a lot more officers near the coast.You know, when its summertime and theres more people, theres more opportunity for problems, Mission Beach resident Dave Cummings said.18 commentsRead the full article OB Church Parking Lot Provides Sanctuary for Feeding the HomelessMay 25, 2010It was a scene to behold.  There was Julie strumming the guitar  singing softly, there was David minding the hot dogs on the flaming grill, Cat handing out cups and paper plates, and there was Lupe Haley  dishing out her pasta dish, a fruit salad, a veggie salad and dessert. And the homeless and hungry stood patiently in line.It was a Monday, and as she has every Monday for the last 22 years, Lupe Haley came down to Ocean Beach to feed the homeless and whoever else showed up.Yet hamstrung by demands by local police officers  that she obtain the proper permit for public food handling, this Monday Lupe has set up her food line not at her usual site in Saratoga Park, right next to the sand, but in a friendly church parking lot off Sunset Cliffs Boulevard.17 commentsRead the full article OB Exposed spotlights local photog talentMay 24, 2010The Ocean Beach Historical Society hosted the 16th annual OB Exposed! photo contest at the Masonic Center on Friday, May 21. As usual, the event was an enjoyable celebration of local photographs and the shutterbugs who snap them.Over the course of a couple hours, more than 100 people perused the entries, voted for the peoples choice winner, and enjoyed free food and drink. Ocean Beach native Noah Tafolla, creator of the KPBS TV series Wonderland, announced the contest winners, which were selected by a panel of judges8 commentsRead the full article OB Heathens escape from exile to raise funds for summer partyMay 24, 2010When Ocean Beachs Heathens raise funds, they do it with style.On a recent Saturday night, the OB-based group of artists, street performers and other free spirits welcomed 150 people to a warehouse in Barrio Logan. The nights activities alternated back and forth between DJ-driven dance sessions and performance pieces featuring select members of the group.Escape from Heathens Island was the name given the nights festivities. Most guests wore costumes, the theme seeming to be a psychedelic blend of pirate and clown, with some tribal flavor tossed in.7 commentsRead the full article California Primary  Part 6: the School Board Races  Secret Societies, Oxymorons and the Evil Teachers UnionMay 24, 2010School board races are often overlooked and belittled. Not everybody has kids, the local press usually portrays school board members without nuance and the positions just arent as glamorous enough to warrant the kind of train-wreck television advertising that Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner are running. And it only pays $18 grand a year, even though most board members will tell you that its more than a full-time job.The position of school board member is so far down on the totem pole that a secretive group of local residents, supposedly showing their concern for education have been floating a proposal to expand the Board by bypassing the electorate and expanding it with a committee that will select new Board members.11 commentsRead the full article Listening to Nina Simone After Listening to Rand PaulMay 23, 2010Last performance today  Sunday at 4pm.A few nights ago I saw a premiere presentation of Nina: A Portrayal of the Life and Music of Nina Simone in an intimate theater setting in North Park. This work was created over a five year period and directed by Calvin Manson. It is a deeply moving, well executed and revelatory piece of theater, and the last day to see it is Sunday May 23.40 commentsRead the full article OB FLASHES: News, Calendar and Whatever  May 22, 2010May 22, 2010ALL STORIES AND LINKS INSIDE:* Red Bull Rivals: June 5th  OB Is Home to San Diegos North versus South County surf rivalry__________________________* Winstons Holds Benefit for OBcean Injured in Hit and Run  May 23rd____________________________* The National Football League says Ocean Beach businessman is illegally using the Chargers logo.___________________________* Pizza Port Finally Opens6 commentsRead the full article Coffee Party Action at Downtown Mega-Banks Reflects Sentiment for Bank Reform in Recent PollMay 22, 2010Downtown shoppers and office workers on their lunch break Friday, May 21, found a gaggle of Coffee Party activists and supporters agitating for bank reform.  A little over a dozen folks with signs, fliers, and chants were targeting four of the mega-banks in downtown  all within a few blocks of each other: Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and Citibank. The action was part of a nation-wide focus by the Coffee Party on banks and financial reform.  Over a third of the protesters were from OB.The Coffee Party action also reflected the sentiment expressed in a recent poll by this blog.  The poll found that three-quarters of the respondents wanted some kind of bank reform, everything from breaking them up to nationalizing them.3 commentsRead the full article New British Government Plans to Take Down Public Surveillance Systems and More May 20, 2010Editor: Verrrry interesting.

Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi-Bank, and Chase, will all be targeted by the protest. In a tour of the banking area, activists will be pointing out how much each bank received in the bailout, what they pay their CEOs and other important info.This is part of the nation-wide effort of the Coffee Party to clean up Wall Street and K Street (where the DC lobbyists all hang out) in favor of Main Street.Activists will show up  some in costume  at Horton Plaza at 11:30 a.m. by the Fountain, the staging point for the tour. Everyone is invited to join with the Coffee Party as its highlights the role of the huge, mammoth banking institutions that control our economy.7 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
