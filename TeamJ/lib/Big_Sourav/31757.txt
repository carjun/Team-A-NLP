Her name is Christina Taylor Green, and a neighbor had brought her along to the Safeway to meet Rep. Giffords because she thought she would enjoy it. Born on September 11, 2001, Christina Taylor Green was excited about the political process, was on the student government, and went to the Giffords event today to learn more about the political process, family members say.  The public yields a stunned assent. "She was born on 9-11 and died today? That's the most tragic thing I've ever heard," a Facebook comment asserts. Born on a day of national tragedy, Christina Taylor Green has now become part of national sorrow. Her grandfather, 76, managed the Phillies when they won the World Series in 1980. He also managed the Yankees and Mets and was general manager of the Chicago Cubs.
