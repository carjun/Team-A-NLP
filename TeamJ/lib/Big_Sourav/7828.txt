Some 135 million Brazilians take to the election booths in order to pick out its leader for the next four years. As a member of Lulas drive to eliminate poverty, Rousseff has worked hand-in-hand with the popular two-term leader as his chief of staff. Her main opponent, Jose Serra, has been unable to chip away at her commanding poll lead with what pundits have described as a lack luster campaign with little focus or any clear distinction between the two. Rousseff however cannot be guaranteed the victory without obtaining more that 50 percent of the electorate votes. A late charge by Green Party candidate Marina Silva, who is a former Lula administration member and unrelated to the president, may give Serra another bite at the apple. According to Brazilian election laws, if a candidate does not acquire the required 50 percent margin then a runoff election on October 31, must be conducted between to the two highest receivers of votes. In recent weeks, Rousseff has had to fend off allegations of corruption. Apparently, one of her staff members has been caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Yet, the allegations have done little to sway the backing of the populist Lula or his continued public support of the first-time politician Rousseff. The spoiler, Silva, has substantially improved her message as the environmental candidate as polls indicate a growing sentimentality toward the former rubber tree plantation worker who only learned to read and write in her teens. Because of Brazils use of electronic voting country wide, results are expected before Monday morning. Whether or not Brazil continues its economic march under the tutelage of Lula may very well depend on how well Silva does on todays ballots.

Even though I like Silva more, it's wonderful that they have two qualified candidates that vie for the spot.

Pretty impressive.            Reply  Posted By     Robert Weller|3 monthsagoExit polls indicate she has enough to avoid a runoff, but just barely. So it may be necessary.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|3 monthsagoI am posting actually results right now. It will be interesting to see if the exit polls reflect the actual. It looks to me like Silva has made more headway than anticipated.            Reply  Posted By     wykedengel|3 monthsagoWe as a society are progressing slowly, but this is good to see. I am hoping to see something like this in the US in 2012, or 2016.
