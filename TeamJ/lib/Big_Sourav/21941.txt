Martinez told Nuez, "It's probably the most important decision for Latinos in this state in 100 years." Martinez represents Tucson police officer Martin Escobar, one of two police officers who filed suit against SB 1070. Escobar added, "I think it sets up the tone for what's going to come up next. I think it's a very good ruling. As we had stated before, I didn't think it was right for something to go forward like this. I think it's a clear sign that the judge ruled and set precedent in a sense that I think it's probably going to get stricken down, down the road...at least, I hope so. I mean, that's the message I get from it"Shortly after 11:15 AM, the U.S. Department of Justice issued the following statement from DOJ spokeswoman Hannah August: "We believe the court ruled correctly when it prevented key provisions of SB1070 from taking effect. While we understand the frustration of Arizonans with the broken immigration system, a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement and would ultimately be counterproductive. States can and do play a role in cooperating with the federal government in its enforcement of the immigration laws, but they must do so within our constitutional framework. This administration takes its responsibility to secure our borders seriously and has dedicated unprecedented resources to that effort. We will continue to work toward smarter and more effective enforcement of our laws while pressing for a comprehensive approach that provides true security and strengthens accountability and responsibility in our immigration system at the national level."Governor Jan Brewer was placed at the center of the immigration debate after she signed SB 1070 into law in April. She had been confident the judge would rule in her favor and allow the law to take effect, with several key components. Brewer was in Tucson when the ruling came in. She told KGUN9's Jessica Chapin that the fight is not over yet. Brewer also issued the following statement, "I am disappointed by Judge Susan Bolton's ruling enjoining several provisions of 'The Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act' -- SB 1070; though I am heartened by some findings - including the ban on sanctuary cities. This fight is far from over. In fact, it is just the beginning, and at the end of what is certain to be a long legal struggle, Arizona will prevail in its right to protect our citizens. I am deeply grateful for the overwhelmingly support we have received from across our nation in our efforts to defend against the failures of the federal government." Brewer also says that she plans to file an expedited appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.One of Brewer's opponents for governor, Democratic Attorney General Terry Goddard, had this to say about the ruling: "Jan Brewer played politics with immigration, and she lost. Rather than providing the leadership Arizona needs to solve the immigration problem, Jan Brewer signed a bill she could not defend in court which has led to boycotts, jeopardized our tourism industry and polarized our state. It is time to look beyond election year grandstanding and begin to repair the damage to Arizona's image and economy. Perhaps now we in Arizona can focus on effective steps to fight border crime and keep our families safe. Now we can focus on steps, like I have been taking, to go after border crime and cut off the cash that flows to organized criminal cartels that smuggle thousands into the U.S. Now, we should start making smart decisions about immigration - beyond sound bites, fear mongering and political stunts."Another of Brewer's opponents for governor, Republican Buz Mills also weighed in, saying, "The judge's ruling is a disappointment. I urge Governor Brewer to appeal. I also urge the governor to step forward and commit state resources to secure the border. While 1070 would have been an effective tool for law enforcement, it does not secure the border. If we can secure our border, we won't have to rely on the whims of a federal government that appears more concerned with protecting illegal immigrants rather than protecting Arizona citizens."Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, Arizona's only Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security, says there are no winners here. "The courts may have ruled in favor of the federal government today, but the legal wrangling is just beginning. We have months and months of courtroom battles ahead of us, and Arizona's taxpayers are being forced to fund both sides - that is money that should be going towards protecting our communities," says Kirkpatrick. "There are no winners here - no matter what the courts ultimately decide, we will still have wasted millions of dollars and our borders will still not be secure. The Administration needs to stop pursuing this distraction, and start working with us to get the border region under control and develop a national immigration strategy."After reviewing the order of the United Stated District Court, Pima County Attorney Barbara LaWall issued the following statement: "Prior to this decision my Office had engaged in significant planning and training for the implementation of S.B. 1070 and stood ready to enforce the law. We are prepared to uphold the decision handed down today by the United States District Judge Susan Bolton."Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada told KGUN9's Claire Doan that he's relieved to hear that the judge has blocked the provision requiring an officer to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. "The biggest thing is a sense of relief for a lot of reasons and maybe you know redemption in a way because I've been criticized for my position," says Estrada. "In a way, it kind of justifies my reason for opposing this law, which I think is totally unfair and unjust."Meantime, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu is expressing his frustration over the ruling. "Incredibly, even though there is not one person who can legitimately claim to be harmed by a law that has not even taken effect, the result of an injunction is de facto amnesty through non-enforcement of laws against illegal immigration," says Babeu. "The federal government refuses to secure the border and leaves it to states like Arizona to bear the costs of its inaction. Yet, when we try to do the job they won't do, in a manner consistent with federal law, they stop us. You couldn't make up something this ridiculous."Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, released this statement in reaction to Bolton's ruling: "Today's ruling does not strike down SB1070. Her ruling only puts a hold on a few parts of the new law. That's why her actions today are called a preliminary injunction. Those who are here in this state illegally my deputies will still ask about their status in this country and will arrest on existing state and federal immigration violations. State violators will be booked into my jail and federal violators will be turned over to authorities for possible deportation. As for my office, deputies are being briefed on SB1070 relative to the judge's ruling today. In my jails, however, we will continue to investigate every person booked and if they are determined to be in the country illegally, they will be turned over to federal authorities (ICE). Anti-immigration protestors want amnesty and will taut today that 1070 is dead. It is not."Speaker Kirk Adams from the Arizona House of Representatives issued this response to the ruling: "We're disappointed with Judge Bolton's decision and we respectfully disagree. She was willing to find an 'inference of preemption' where Arizona's sole purpose is to enforce existing law. Congress has not forbidden states from helping to enforce immigration law, in fact it has welcomed the help. We wish the Obama Administration were as welcoming. Arizonans and all Americans deserve leadership that is committed to both securing the border and protecting the Rule of Law."AZGOP Chairman Randy Pullen believes that SB 1070 will eventually prevail. "While we are disappointed in the federal court's decision to issue a temporary injunction, it is often the case that a judge will initially approve a temporary injunction until they have an opportunity to hear and read arguments and legal research from both sides" says Pullen. "Our expectation is that Judge Bolton will rule in favor of SB 1070 as we believe that SB 1070 is constitutional."The author of SB 1070, Senator Russell Pearce of Mesa, believes that the number one priority of the law was upheld. "Striking down these sanctuary city policies has always been the number one priority of SB 1070," says Pearce. "Judge Bolton has made it clear. These policies are illegal, and cities in violation will face significant fines immediately. The political handcuffs are coming off law enforcement." Senator Pearce is also confident the portions of the law that Judge Bolton temporarily blocked will be successfully appealed.Representative Ral Grijalva, who stirred up controversy when he called for a boycott of Arizona over SB 1070, was pleased with today's ruling. "This is an important moment for the nation to pause and take a deep breath," says Grijalva. "We need to concentrate on the economy, the lack of jobs and teachers, and the other crucial issues facing Arizona and the rest of the country. As part of this pause, I am encouraging national groups to return their conventions and conferences to the state to help us change the political and economic climate."U.S. Senators John McCain and Jon Kyl issued a joint statement, saying, "We are deeply disappointed in the court's ruling today and disagree with the court's opinion that the Arizona's law will unduly 'burden' the enforcement of federal immigration law. Instead of wasting tax payer resources filing a lawsuit against Arizona and complaining that the law would be burdensome, the Obama Administration should have focused its efforts on working with Congress to provide the necessary resources to support the state in its efforts to act where the Federal government has failed to take responsibility. After this decision, it's even more important to implement our Ten-Point Border Security plan to protect Arizonans and our country."U.S. Senate Candidate J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) also voiced his disappointment with the ruling, saying, "Judge Bolton has gutted the Arizona law. She has put a hold on major sections of SB 1070 designed to eradicate sanctuary cities and require law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of those who commit crimes in our state. The vast majority of Americans and Arizonans want this law implemented and the judge's action simply circumvents the people's will."U.S. Representative Harry Mitchell (D-AZ) hopes that the federal government will address the immigration issue. "Today's ruling should not provide Washington any kind of excuse not to address the issue," says Mitchell. "Arizonans are justifiably fed up with the federal government's failure to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system, and are fed up with of all the political posturing and grandstanding on this issue."Congressional candidate Jonathan Paton (R) voted for SB 1070 in the state Senate. "I'm outraged by both the federal government's interference in our state rights and the court's decision to block key elements of a law I am proud to have voted for and helped pass," says Paton. "Arizonans need to be protected! If the federal government is going to refuse to protect its citizens, it's up to Arizona to protect itself. This unfortunate ruling sends a message to the world that we are not a country that values our Constitution and enforces our laws."Senate Democratic Leader Jorge Luis Garcia had this to say after the ruling: "For months, Senate Democrats have stated that SB 1070 only creates divisions within our communities, redirects local law enforcement and opens the doors to racial profiling. The injunction of portions of SB 1070 will allow the country to refocus on comprehensive solutions to immigration instead of creating thousands of unworkable standards."Several immigrant right groups were pleased with Judge Bolton's ruling. "Tomorrow promises to be a much brighter day in Arizona than anyone thought it would be just 24 hours ago," says Thomas A. Saenz, President and General Counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "Of course, even today's great victory must be tempered by the knowledge that any provision that remains in place is ripe for misuse. The hard work to vindicate fully our federal constitutional values must continue."As a plaintiff against the law, the injunction ruling is a victory for Chicanos Por La Causa. "Justice has prevailed today. As we requested in our lawsuit, sections of SB 1070 will not be implemented without further judicial review," says CPLC President and CEO Edmundo Hidalgo. "This is a huge step in the right direction for our state and our nation."Another plaintiff against the law, Border Action Network is also celebrating the ruling. "Arizonans released a collective sigh of relief with today's decision by Judge Bolton to enjoin Arizona for implementing 1070 tomorrow," says Executive Director Jennifer Allen. "The pressure and anxiety shouldered by Arizona families, businesses, churches and law enforcement agencies has been lifted for the time-being. While there are still provisions of the law that we are concerned with and will monitor, we are elated that Judge Bolton blocked the most discriminatory, far-reaching provisions."The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) also welcomed the decision. Miriam Weisman, ADL Arizona Regional Chair, and Jennifer Twitchell, ADL Arizona Assistant Regional Director, issued the following statement: "ADL is gratified by today's decision, which recognizes that key provisions of Arizona's new immigration law place an unacceptable burden on Arizona residents, including non-citizens lawfully present in Arizona. Border security is a legitimate concern, but we must find ways to improve our immigration system without increasing the probability that legal resident aliens will be wrongfully detained. SB 1070 is seriously flawed in this regard, and could deter many potential victims and witnesses of crimes from coming forward and talking to the police."CommentsTerms of Use: We welcome your participation in our community.
