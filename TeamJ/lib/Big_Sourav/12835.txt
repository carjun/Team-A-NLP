I just so happened to run across an old Black and White film called THE BIRD MAN OF ALCATRAZE.This movie pits  Burt Lancaster, a life time prisoner, against the warden, Karl Malden.  The conflict centers around their different approaches to guide a prisoner in the process of REHABILITATION.  There is a conversation between the Bird Man and the Warden near the end of the story.  I am paraphrasing:          Harvey, you havent learned a THING about Rehabilitation,          because you do not know what it means.  IT MEANS TO HELP          RESTORE AN INDIVIDUALS DIGNITY,  all you want to do is          MODIFY HIS BEHAVIOR AFTER YOUR CODE OF MORALITY, so he walks          out of here like a puppet, with you pulling the strings.          All the while, the Prisoner is STORING UP ANGER AND RAGE          INSIDE OF HIM BECAUSE OF YOUR BASIC DISRESPECT FOR HIM.          Even as you are trying to MANIPULATE HIM, he just acts out          in Rebellion against your Degrading and Disrespecting of him.          If he does get out, in most cases he ends up back in Prison.          His Anger and Rage he is carrying inside of him eventually          EXPLODES AGAIN.          Your System does not RESTORE HIM TO HEALTH OR A USEFUL LIFE,          so he can return to his former Good Name and Privileges.          Because you dont Understand This At All, ALL YOUR EFFORTS          END UP IN FAILURE.For one of the few times, the Warden stands Speechless with an open mouth and astonished look on his face.  Sure enough, a huge prison riot does break out.All within Bird Mans Block are a part of the Attempted take over of the Prison but Bird Man.  After the last of the men are killed, Bird Man takes a pistol and a  rifle and tells the Warden over the audio system that he is going to throw these two weapons out of the cell window because all of the men have been MURDERED.          Bird Man says over Loud Speaker, Harvey!  Why didnt          you just use a bomb, it would have been over much more          quickly?When one of the Security Guards says,          Warden, you aint gonna take no word of a Convict are you?          To which the Warden replies, That Convict has been a Thorn in          my side for over 35 years, but during that time, HE HAS NEVER          LIED TO ME.  Hold your fire.In 1959, Robert Stroud was released to a Minimum Security Prison; he lived to be 72 years of age.  In his study Canaries, he contributed more to Ornithologyin terms of his own research from his jail cell than did many PhD Scientists in the field.  He also wrote a Book On Penal Rehabilitation that if its Code of Conduct were followed, we would not having s many men and women RETURNING TO PRISON as we do because our Penal Rehab System is still more like Warden Harveys Hard-Nosed Style that that of Robert Strouds, which is based in Respect for the Individual who has lost his/her Dignity and in so doing have run afoul with the Law.The Way Warden Harvey ran his Prison is much the same way our own Society Treats People.  The Best Example of this Distorted Mirroring is still taking place not only in our Prisons but in our EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS WELL.Since the Blackboard Jungle, we have had MOVIE AFTER MOVIE which depicts theINEPTNESS of how we are teaching our CHILDREN, THE TREASURES OF OUR LIFE AND OUR FUTURE.  Yet, except for ISOLATED INSTANCES, which are getting a little publicity at the Paranoid FEAR OF UNIONS AND ADMINISTRATIONS OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS, our approach has changed very little as to how our children are educated.Just this week a study came out which revealed that by the age of SIX, OUR CURRENT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HAS SUCCESSFULLY STIFLED OUR CHILDREN FROM ASKING QUESTIONS.Why is it that the inquisitiveness of a two year old is stifled by the time this INQUIRING BRAIN IS BUT SIX YEARS OLD.  The answer is the same as Warden Harvey;  WE KNOW BEST WHAT IT IS YOU NEED TO KNOW.  THERE IS NOT TIME FOR ALL OF YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE WE JUST HAVE TOO MUCH INFORMATION WE NEED TO POUR INTO YOUR HEAD IN SUCH A LITTLE TIME PERIOD,Well, there are OUTLIERS, just like Bird Man was an Outlier.  The EXCEPTIONS are Schools like The Montessori Learning Centers.  LEARNING CENTERS AS OPPOSED TO EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS have for children various stations set up around the room.  The child is free to go from one Station to the Other at THEIR OWN PACE.The Adult Learner is there to ANSWER QUESTIONS and to GUIDE the child toward a particular Station he/she may not have gravitated to. THERE IDS INHERENT RESPECT FOR THE DIGNITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD.  Now, isnt that a Novel Idea!My best LEARNING EXPERIENCES were with Teachers who taught out of the Robert Maynard  Hutchinson Discussion Method.  Now the Teachers who use this Discussion Method must really know their INFORMATION and not just rely on a Yellow Pad of Lecture Notes used over year after year.  The teachers Goal is to get s, the Learner ENGAGED with the material at hand by not just REGURGITATING THE INFORMATION  BUT REFLECTING ON WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME.With Teachers like that THE CLASS ROOM CAME ALIVE.  We DID NOT SIT IN ROWS but rather around the table or even while I was at the U of Chicago, at Jimmys Bar, in a quiet room at the back.  LEARNING NOT ONLY CAME ALIVE BUT IT WAS ALSO FUN!WHAT?  LEARNING BEING FUN AND EXCITING.  Sorry Warden Harvey and MOST of the Primary and Secondary Schools across this land.HOWEVER, there is another reason why I think Our children are falling further and further behind the youth in much of the rest of the Civilized World.  When I was in High School in Beckley, W.Va., a town of about 20,000 and a High School of 1200.  There is a group of kids we referred to as THE COZY CORNER KIDS!  These were a much smaller group of kids, who were Affluent (yes, there was some Affluence even in W.Va.).The Cozy Corner was a little Soda Bar who welcomed and catered to high school kids after school who had money burning a hole in their  pockets.  However, the MAJORITY of us either had after school activities, went home to do chores or worked in grocery stores. Then we did our home work at night.Another movie I saw entitled SAVE A LIFE.  This is a story, based on true events, I think, that the OTHER PROBLEM is that this COZY CORNER Crowd of Kids has grown way out of control even as many are either rebelling against Parents who have not learned how to set Boundaries or lose their way due to Caving into Peer Pressure.In many ways SAVE A LIFE is a Deeply SPIRITUAL movie as these teenagers try to RECLAIM who they because their are lost under an AVALANCHE of Shallow Social Culture, Rigid Religion, Intense Peer Pressure and in some cases RACISM that is not so subtle.Because teenagers today have so much STUFF, Things, Money, Fancy Clothes, whichinvolve a Far Larger Percentage than the Cozy Corner Crowd of my High School  Days.  More families have BOTH PARENTS working.  I propose that it is the LACKOF PARENTAL GUIDANCE that is the main reason our teenagers have a Far HarderTime of it than my teenage years and even that of my daughter and so who are now 43 and 41.Both my young adult children decry the seemingly lack of PARENTS PROVIDING BOUNDARIES and allow their children to be DIS-RESPECTFUL AND LACKING IN MANNERS.There is  NO COMPASS providing adequate adult modeling because Parents seemingly are so caught up in their own Middle Class Busy Schedules that too often providing ther children what they need most:  THEIR TIME.  Instead theygive them STUFF AND MONEY.  They keep accumulating more and more STUFF to fill up AN EMPTINESS THAT THEY ARE NOT  REALLY AWARE.The movie begins with a young Black male committing SUICIDE.  He had grown up with the main male character in the movie who was a BASKET BALL JOCK and on his way to University of Louisville on a basket ball scholarship.  The most dashing of girls in his class, who was the drream of every teen of the school.So, he chose her over his Black Friend, because she did not ASSOCIATE WITH BLACKS.  It wasnt just because he was Black, but he had a limp and lacked thethe SOPHISTICATION of the Middle Class Blacks.  All made fun of his limp, which he got by saving this young Jocks Life when he knocked him out of the way of a truck, but he himself was injured.So, the movie points out the various ways that teenagers LOSE THEIR WAY ANDSUFFER FROM a lack of value clarification.  superficiality reigns all around them!The SUICIDE of his Former Friend and then his Failure to Stand Up for Him in the face  of Peer Pressure started to get to him.  He was losing himself in Drugs and Alcohol by Partying Heavy on the weekends, jeopordizing his chances of maintaing his Basketball Scholarship.Lucky for him, he met this young Youth Director who ran a Program which was Spiritual  but without being Religious.  Though there was God-Talk, it was more like a type of Meditation or Introspection  to discover that Your Body was Your Temple.  The purpose of Life was to RESPECT YOUR BODY AND BY SO DOING YOU WOULD LEAR HOW TO RESPECT YOURSELF.  This would in turn lead you to RESPECTING OTHERS.By finding an Adult Model, though he was only about 30 years of age, because this young man had got his own VALUES CLARIFIED, he knew how to be with these teens and to ask questions that slowly enabled them to Open their OWN TRAP DOORS.  They started respecting themselves and others; and they could then start STANDING OVER AGAINST THEIR INADEQUATE PARENTS, SHALLOW CULTURE AND BETTER RESIST THEIR PEER CULTURE.  They became FREE because they Learned that they did have Choice after all and did not have to just drift in a Shallow, Meaningless Culture Rushing like Lemmings off the Cliff, sooner rather than later.Now, I spent more time with these two movies than I intended.  However, we need to see JUST HOW LONG WE HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN THE WRONG PATH ADS A CULTURE AND HOW IT WAS FOR US TO BE DUPED BY THE SEMIWAR WARRIORS THAT BACEVICH REFERS TO IN WASHINGTON RULES.My Concern is NOT so much that OUR COUNTRY WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US BY THE SEMIWAR WARRIORS but that we had our heads in the sand and ALLOWED THEM TO DO IT!*  If we EVER get our Country back that has been HIJACKED by The Elite, The Wealthy, Wall Street, Corporate America and The Pentagon.Even a President as well intended as Barock Obama is learning JUST  HOW LIMITEDCONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT ARE.  cONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT STARTED RUBBER STAMPING WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY SHORTLY AFTER WW II ENDED AND IT IS NOW OUT OF CONTROL.  If WE THE PEOPLE do not take it to the Streets, we are all Doomed like the LEMMINGS to Follow the PIED PIPER OVER THE CLIFF AND TO OUR OWN SUICIDE IN THE SEA.I will just let Bacevich set the stage for ho this all began and then in my  next Essay to fill in some of the details that most of us have been UNAWARE because we were too busy racing our way INTO AFFLUENCE.A Funny Thing Happened Along the Way, we LOST THE AMERICA of Jefferson, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and FDR.  We also lost the America of Ralf Waldo Emerson, Henry W. Longfellow, Henry David Thoreau.  The America of THE INDIVIDUAL, SELF-RELIANCE, and we confused THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS WITH HAPPINESS AS THE ACCUMULATION OF THINGS, CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION, BUILT IN OBSOLESCENCE and Labor Day has come to mean just another long, three-day weekend.Bacevich reminds us how our Empire Building began after WW II.          The TRINITY:  Triad of Global Presence, Power Projection          and Interventionismwere made possible by TWO MEN:          ALLEN DULLES AND CURTIS LEMAYSEMIWARRIORS PAR          EXCELLENCE.          Dulles and LeMay were the ANTITHESIS OF INDIVIDUALISTS.          men who found Personal Fulfillment in the Building of          INSTITUTIONS          During the PIVOTAL DECADE of the 1960s they raised TWO          PROMINENT ORGANIZATIONS to the Highest of Levels  which          DEFINED THE MAXIMUMS BY WHICH WASHINGTON CAME TO OPERATE.          They went a long way toward Enforcing them as well:          In Dulles Case the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).          In LeMays Case the Strategic Air Command (SAC).Next time we will present how the CIA and SAC PROMULGATED a set of PRECEPTSthat left a DEEP AND LASTING IMPRINT on the Entire National Security State.from which the conclusion will be drawn that it is only a matter of time beforewe EXHAUST our Resources and NEGLECT OUR DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE that we will collapse just as did the Soviet Union, who NEGLECTED ITS OWN PEOPLES NEEDS in an Effort to brecome a Super Power.  Now, they live in shambles.This doesnt HAVE to happen to us, but it will take enough of WE THE PEOPLEtake to the Streets and Say WE ARE SICK AND TIRED AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANY MORE!  I only Hope that it is not too late.  Why should we be any different from any Empire who has gone before us.  The Patter lies with Rome, as it did with all Empires before and after Rome.  While Rome Burned Nero Fiddled.  Lets Hope WE THE PEOPLE do not wait until Washington Burns.However, if Washington Rules prevail, then it is just a matt3er of time.Earland___________________________________________________________________________________________________The opinions of contributors are wholly the authors, and are not endorsed by worldwidehippies.Want to write your own article?
