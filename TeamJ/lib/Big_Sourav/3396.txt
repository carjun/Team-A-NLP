Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) will introduce legislation next week capping ammunition magazines at 10 bullets, she announced Thursday.McCarthy, whose husband was killed during a commuter train shooting in 1993, has said all week that she'd be proposing legislation to ban high-capacity clips like those allegedly used in Saturday's shooting in Arizona. But she hadn't specified the maximum number of bullets, hoping instead that some flexibility on her part might entice GOP leaders to support the bill. Since the tragedy, however, Republican leaders have aligned themselves squarely against gun reforms proposed even by members of their own party. The 1994 assault-weapons ban included the same 10-bullet cap, but that law expired in 2004. Like the assault-weapons ban, McCarthy's bill will ban high-capacity magazines manufactured after the law is enacted  meaning it doesn't prohibit possession of those made beforehand. The New York Democrat said it's impossible to estimate the effects of her proposal, but it will "ultimately save lives.""The only purpose for the existence of these devices is to be able to shoot as many people as possible as quickly as possible," McCarthy wrote Thursday in a "Dear Colleague" letter to House members. "There is no reason that these devices should be available to the general public."McCarthy is scheduled to introduce the bill formally on Tuesday.

Now the USA is headed down the road to no right to firearms! Lets not "reform guns" lets "REFORM CONGRESS!" Evil people kill others.. the gun can be a good tool to protect ones self Just as it can be used tool of evil for an evil person!  Criminals can get there hands on illegal weapon! Now the 30 clip will be a "black-market items. Why doesn't Carolyn blame the CRIMNAL for the wrong act instead of inocent Americans who have rights under the US Constitution?.. With out  the RIGHT to BARE ARMS, we would never have become a NATION! How can you fight ENGLAND, without GUNS?Rep. McCarthey owes her freedom to the TROOPS who have guns! The Greatest Generation who won WWII! The Founding Fathers who broke-away from England and gave birth to the USA!If she doesn't like GUNS, she can tell her securty detail to throw theirs away! If nobody can have 30 bullett clip neither can those who protect the people at Capitol Building! Whats good for the goose is good for the gander! JLM!BY JUST LIKE MEXICO!on 01/13/2011 at 18:30So whats the limit? 10 rounds, 30 rounds, 5 rounds? It only takes one to kill. Why stop at 10? What will be enough for congress? The Gov. of Delaware wants more gun control because weapons from the US are making their way to Mexico. Which I think is already against the law. But we need more laws. Those bad criminals might break 1 law but they would never break 2 laws. Is murder against the law? So we need to charge a criminal with murder and possession of a illegal firearm magazine? Then the judge can give that criminal the death penalty twice. Just to make sure. Oh wait it says here in the story  "meaning it doesn't prohibit possession of those made beforehand." So this ban would only prohibit selling new high capacity mag. used ones are fine. Does any else find this proposed law crazy?"There is no reason that these devices should be available to the general public."  UM THE CONSTITUTIONBY No More Crazy Laws.on 01/13/2011 at 19:46We didn't beat German nazis and Japanese warlords with stern words and gun bans, we used rifles. Evil gives way only when its confronted by well armed good, and there seems to be no lack of evil predators wandering the streets these days my local newspaper is grim testament to that fact. Besides, a handgun has saved my life on a few occassions, thats hard to forget.BY Mikeon 01/13/2011 at 19:56The other day she had a press conf.  I just loved the beagle sunglass's and surronded by thugs.  Ms. McCarthy are you serious? You may want to hold your next press conf. looking more like grandma then a gangbangerBY gotmyioniton 01/13/2011 at 20:25This is hogwash.. Criminals will make extended magazines what needs to be done is that our leaders in congress and the senate, needs to vote the way their consituients want.. no back room deals.. they need to be responsible on their vote.. don't vote a certain way to recieve votes for their re-election. people are getting tired of the way the lawmakers are held unaccountable for their actions they voted for the health care reform.. yet they will not come under that legislation. they will have their own health care bull%&*$#. if it is so good. then they should have to have the same health care.. and what about their retirement?.. one term and then set for life.. no way should this come down like this. they are'nt no one speacial. and for special details to prottect them?.. if they are scared then resign your postFeed Up in TexasBY kcapnon 01/13/2011 at 20:45Our brilliant TX poster KCAPN says criminals will make extended magazines. The cost and effort not worth it compared to buying an automatic assault rifle on the black market. AK47s altered from semi to automatic is much easier than extended magazines. Jared the nutjob did not have the ability to alter either magazine or firing mechanism, so his argument falls apart. He is probably unaware congress has already authorized over a billion dollars for secret service to protect elected members covering only 60% of all threats (they cover only high probability).BY Jimbokingmakeron 01/13/2011 at 21:13Hey right wing fools.This law won't "take away your guns".Okay?BY joeon 01/13/2011 at 21:19Hey Joe,The 2nd Amendment says our right to bears arms shall not be infringed.
