I should also point out that I've limited this list to movies I've actually seen, and I'm certain I missed some terrific ones, e.g., Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart (and feel free to remind me of any others I forgot or didn't include). So, if it looks like I enjoy: a) Alistair MacLean, b) World War II, c) classic actors in classic roles, and d) the prison camp escape genre, well, you've probably got a point there.There was also no way for me to restrict this list to ten movies; there are just too many great ones out there. So the title here should probably read, "My favorite 14 war movies of all time." In order of release date, here they are.Sands Of Iwo Jima / Flying Tigers (Double Feature)Amazon Price: $6.50List Price: $14.98Sands of Iwo JimaAmazon Price: $7.68List Price: $14.98The Caine Mutiny (Combat Classics)Amazon Price: $7.38List Price: $19.94The Caine MutinyAmazon Price: $13.97List Price: $19.94Caine Mutiny [VHS]Amazon Price: $4.23List Price: $19.95The Bridge on the River Kwai [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $15.93List Price: $34.95The Bridge on the River KwaiAmazon Price: $11.98List Price: $19.94The Guns of NavaroneAmazon Price: $12.25List Price: $19.94The Guns of Navarone (Collector's Edition)Amazon Price: $14.49List Price: $24.96The Longest Day (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)Amazon Price: $10.73List Price: $19.98The Longest Day [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $20.99List Price: $34.99The Longest DayAmazon Price: $25.48List Price: $14.98The Longest Day (D-Day 50th Anniversary) [VHS]Amazon Price: $7.99List Price: $24.98Battle of the BulgeAmazon Price: $3.98List Price: $14.98The Great Escape (2-Disc Collector's Set)Amazon Price: $5.66List Price: $19.98The Great EscapeAmazon Price: $4.95List Price: $14.98The Great Escapes of WWIIAmazon Price: $5.72List Price: $14.95Von Ryan's ExpressAmazon Price: $6.94List Price: $14.98Von Ryan's Express (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)Amazon Price: $10.73List Price: $19.98Kelly's Heroes / The Dirty Dozen (Double Feature)Amazon Price: $7.21List Price: $14.98The Dirty Dozen (Two-Disc Special Edition)Amazon Price: $6.75List Price: $26.98Sands of Iwo Jima (1950). Stars John Wayne, John Agar, Forrest Tucker, and James Holden. Directed by Allan Dwan; script by Harry Brown and James Edward Grant. The classic story of that ferocious battle for the Japanese-held Pacific island. The flag used in the flag-raising scene over Mount Suribachi was the actual one raised by the real Marines, on loan from the U.S. Marine Corps Museum.The Caine Mutiny (1954). Stars Humphrey Bogart, Robert Francis, Lee Marvin, Fred MacMurray, Jose Ferrer, and Van Johnson. Directed by Edward Dmytryk; script by Stanley Roberts and Michael Blankfort, based on the 1951 Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Herman Wouk. One of Bogart's most riveting performances, he made this movie while ill with throat cancer, which killed him three years later. Wouk's original novel dealt more with the lead character's transition from spoiled youth into manhood, and as such continues for more than 100 pages past the emotionally climactic moment of the plotline; the movie centers more on the mutiny and the trial that followed, and therefore carries more of a direct punch.The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). Stars Alec Guinness, Sessue Hayakawa, William Holden, Jack Hawkins, and Geoffrey Horne. Directed by David Lean; script by Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, based on the French novel by Pierre Boulle. A true psychological thriller of a man consumed by an obsession, and the scene where the British POWs arrive in the camp whistling the Colonel Bogey March is a classic. This is one where the movie is actually better than the book.The Guns of Navarone (1961). Stars Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle, Irene Papas, Gia Scala, and Richard Harris. Directed by J. Lee Thompson; script by Carl Foreman, kinda loosely based on the novel by Alistair MacLean. Although the characters were drastically changed during the conversion to film, the plot held true. This is a showpiece for MacLean's ferocious talent as a war novelist.The Longest Day (1962). Stars John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, and Heinz Reincke as Oberst Josef Priller, one of only two Luftwaffe fighter pilots to break through the Allied air cover and strafe the Normandy invasion beachhead (and he did it with a hangover). Directed by Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, and Bernhard Wicki; script by Romain Gary, James Jones, David Pursall, Cornelius Ryan, and Jack Seddon, based on the nonfiction book by Cornelius Ryan. Historical accuracy here is very high. Many of the military consultants on this film actually fought on D-Day, and so did a number of the actors; Richard Todd played his own commanding officer, and the actor standing next to him, in the scene where the British paratroopers holding the Pegasus Bridge are awaiting relief, is playing Richard Todd. Dwight D. Eisenhower was originally cast as himself, but it was decided that even Hollywood makeup artists couldn't make the ex-president look that young again. All in all, an amazing bit of work.The Great Escape (1963). Stars Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, James Donald, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, and James Coburn. Directed by John Sturges; script by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett, based on the nonfiction book by Paul Brickhill, who was a prisoner of war in Stalag Luft III at the time the actual events took place. Another ex-prisoner, Wally Floody, served as technical advisor on the set. This is a ripping good escape yarn, even if all the British characters die and the American ones survive. McQueen performed most of his own stunts, including those incredible motorcycle scenes, which transformed this movie into a cult classic. The music, by Elmer Bernstein, is also noteworthy and has been used for background humor in several other movies.Von Ryan's Express (1965). Stars Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard. Directed by Mark Robson; script by Wendell Mayes, based on the novel by David Westheimer. Another fabulous escape yarn, although I haven't decided if the book's ending or the movie's is better. Old Blue Eyes insisted on changing it to suit his own ideas, cheating himself out of the sequel that the studio had been planning.The Dirty Dozen (1967). Stars Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, and Jim Brown. Directed by Robert Aldrich; script by Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller, based on the novel by E.M. Nathanson. Extremely violent for its date, this movie quickly became a cult classic, particularly amongst the young male population, helped by rumors that such an event had actually occurred in the final year of World War II.TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: World War II - Battlefront Europe (Kelly's Heroes / Where Eagles Dare / The Dirty Dozen / Battleground)Amazon Price: $6.60List Price: $27.92Where Eagles Dare (Clint Eastwood Collection)Amazon Price: $7.73List Price: $19.98The Eagle Has LandedAmazon Price: $3.26List Price: $9.98A Bridge Too Far (Collector's Edition)Amazon Price: $7.60List Price: $19.98A Bridge Too FarAmazon Price: $2.39List Price: $14.98Force 10 From NavaroneAmazon Price: $4.89List Price: $14.98Force 10 from Navarone [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $14.00List Price: $29.99Force 10 From NavaroneAmazon Price: $1.00MGM War Movie Collection (10 Films)Amazon Price: $28.66List Price: $34.98Where Eagles Dare (1968). Stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. Directed by Brian G. Hutton; both script and original novel written by Alistair MacLean in six weeks, even if he did cut the funny lines from the movie. The scene atop the cable car, in both print and film, is a ferocious nail-biter, and if you can keep up with all the plot twists during the first viewing, you're doing better than I did.The Eagle has Landed (1976). Stars Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, Robert Duvall, Jenny Agutter, Donald Pleasence, Anthony Quayle, Treat Williams, and Larry Hagman. Directed by John Sturges; script by Tom Mankiewicz, based on the novel by Jack Higgins. The story of a unit of German paratroopers who land in England in an attempt to assassinate or kidnap Winston Churchill, this one is best appreciated by reading the novel first.A Bridge Too Far (1977). Stars Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Anthony Hopkins, Hardy Kruger, Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford, Elliot Gould, Gene Hackman, Ryan O'Neal, and Maximilian Schell. Directed by Richard Attenborough; script by William Goldman, loosely based on the nonfiction book by Cornelius Ryan. A terrific movie of a doomed mission, and worth it for the all-star cast alone.Force 10 from Navarone (1978). Stars Robert Shaw, Edward Fox, Harrison Ford, Carl Weathers, and Barbara Bach. Directed by Guy Hamilton; script by Robin Chapman and George MacDonald Fraser, based very loosely on the novel by Alistair MacLean, which is fine, because the book is MacLean spoofing himself, if you're following me. The movie is classic MacLean, with mind-bending plot twists, strong tension, and some true laugh-out-loud moments. Not a hit at the box office, it subsequently became a cult classic.Apocalypse Now (Three-Disc Full Disclosure Edition) (Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now Redux / Hearts of Darkness) [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $39.95List Price: $59.99Apocalypse Now (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $23.00List Price: $39.99Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)Amazon Price: $11.73List Price: $19.98Schindler's List (Full Screen Edition)Amazon Price: $24.94List Price: $19.98Apocalypse Now (1979). Stars Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, and a minor appearance by Harrison Ford. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who also puts in a cameo appearance; script by John Milius and Coppola, in a gut-twisting modern retelling of Robert Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness. Too well-known to need much description from the likes of me, this film was originally panned and slammed by critics but is now considered to have transcended its genre.Schindler's List (1993). Stars Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, and Caroline Goodall. Directed by Steven Spielberg; script by Steven Zaillian, based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. Both heartbreaking and heartwarming, this movie deserved every Oscar it gathered. There's no describing it; you just gotta see it for yourself.vote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...? Useful Funny Awesome Beautiful CommentsCurdman2 years ago You have a really good list going here, more on the older side for me though haha.I've made a list of my favorites you could check out, mainly more recent!http://hubpages.com/hub/Top-10-War-Movies CherylTheWriter2 years ago I checked it out, Curdman, and as I said, I utterly forgot about The Patriot and The Hunt for Red October. The latter isn't technically a war movie, as it happened during the Cold War rather than an actual hot war, but hey, that's nit-picking.sixtyorso2 years ago This is an informative and comprehensive list. I have seen all of the movies listed and felt that they were all good. Guns of Navarone, The Dirty Dozen and The Great Escape are my personal favourites. What about D-day the 6th of June and Ice Cold in Alex?Great hubsixtyorso2 years ago Sorry I seem to have posted twice. But perhaps the hub is twice as good for me!glassvisage2 years ago Wow, I always thought I was a pretty good war movie buff... but apparently not! :( I've hardly seen any of these!CherylTheWriter2 years ago sixtyorso, I don't believe I've seen the two you mentioned. Ice Cold in Alex I found in Wikipedia and it sounds great, but D-Day the 6th of June I can't find any reference to. Help???glassvisage, this is the list of a person who's obviously older than she wants to admit! Treat yourself and give Alistair MacLean a shot, but I warn you--he's addictive. CherylTheWriter2 years ago My husband just reminded me of Casablanca and Pearl Harbor. What a pair of movies to forget!William F. Torpey2 years ago I commend your list of war movies, CherylTheWriter. If you haven't seen them I know you would enjoy "Five Graves to Cairo," "Destination Tokyo," "Sahara," "Bataan," "The Four Feathers," "Back to Bataan" "Run Silent, Run Deep," "13 Rue Madeleine," "Sergeant York," "The African Queen," "In Harm's Way," "Tora, Tora, Tora," "The Enemy Below," "Casablanca" and, my personal favorite, "Gunga Din."CherylTheWriter2 years ago Great list, WFT. Ages ago I read the novel of Run Silent, Run Deep, and I've seen The African Queen and Tora, Tora, Tora, but I think the rest are new to me.Ahem. Does Bing Crosby star in any of them?William F. Torpey2 years ago I don't blame you for being suspicious about Bing Crosby, but, strangely, Bing never made a "war movie." Nevertheless, here's a quote about Der Bingle from the Bing Crosby Internet Museum: "He made the largest number of V-discs and army broadcasts of any American entertainer and raised $14.5 million in war bonds (a Yank magazine poll declared him the individual who had done more for GI morale during World War II)."CherylTheWriter2 years ago I hadn't realized Bing had helped found Del Mar racecourse. I love Thoroughbred racing, too, and I believe that's considered one of the most beautiful tracks in the U.S.jeedgrey2 years ago Indeed, yes. A great list. Keep up the good work,keep your head down, your powder dry and trus tin the Lord, always.CherylTheWriter2 years ago Thanks, jedgrey. I appreciate your work, too.compu-smart2 years ago Im liking your list Cheryl! and above comments about Bing very amusing!!I have seen each and everyone of the above mentioned, and its quite impossible for anyone to name the top 10 when there are soo many great movies and we all have such different tastes, so its good to check out your 10 which should definitely be up there with the best!Thanks for answering this request;) CherylTheWriter2 years ago You're right compu-smart (what was it? Mr. Furry Pants?), there's no way to choose ten movies even considering only my own favorites, not to mention everybody else's! Thanks for posting this request--it was a fun one to answer!compu-smart2 years ago lol@Mr. Furry Pants!!I am still not sure that this name given to me by Shirley Anderson is a compliment or not!  lolCherylTheWriter2 years ago Who am I to say? She was fighting for her victory so anything's possible. But it's cute!sixtyorso2 years ago here is detail on the movie:D-Day: The Sixth of June (1956): Robert Taylor, Dana Wynter, and D-Day veteran Richard Todd star in this somewhat melodramatic romance set mostly in pre-D-Day Britain during the build-up to the Normandy invasion. Taylor plays a married U.S. Army colonel whos in love with Valerie Russell (Wynter), whos also involved with Lt. Col. John Wynter (Todd). The film is essentially an extended flashback as the two officers head to the Normandy beaches and exchange tales about the woman they are unwittingly both in love with.Perhaps as this was a British movie it did not figure. But I must admit i do not  always find wikipedia to be the best source of info.CherylTheWriter2 years ago sixtyorso, you should write an article for Wikipedia on this movie. And I'll see if I can find it. Thanks!oberbreckling2 years ago Hi cheryl I have watched some of the movies tou mentioned but I been watching alot of westerns and have found some of them there but there really nothing like a good black and white when it comes too a war movie I really like your topics and writing GOOD JOB! ~cool~ cyaRichard Stephen5 months ago It's hard to argue with the movies on your list.  Many of them would be on my top ten list as well.  I would encourage you to see Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart when you get the chance.  Many of the war flicks from the 1950s and 60s sanitize war.  I'm fond of Saving Private Ryan not because of the gore but because it does such a good job of portraying the human cost of war.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites88CherylTheWriterFrom Humble, Texas (the ultimate oxymoron)215 Followers15 HubsJoined 2 years agoRead more hubs by CherylTheWriterFollow CherylTheWriterSubscribe to CherylTheWriter's RSS feedAnswers The QuestionThe Top 10 War Movies of All Timeasked by compu-smart 2 years ago3 answersAnswer this question Ask a QuestionAsk CherylTheWriter a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsIs America winning the war on drugs?asked by J.Dizzle 4 months ago6 answersAnswer this questionWhat is the name of this book?asked by zoey24 4 months ago1 answerAnswer this questionRelated HubsFive Reasons To Watch Hawaii Five-0by kerrygThe World`s Oldest Television Channel.by Patty Inglish, MSTop 10 Hot Jobs in Shreveport LA - Open For Business!by Patty Inglish, MSHow to find Freelance Proofreading jobs the easy wayby Research AnalystBritish TV Shows: Misfitsby waynetLED TV Problems, Disadvantages and Complaintsby Writer GuyTagsentertainment movies videos television tv films Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
