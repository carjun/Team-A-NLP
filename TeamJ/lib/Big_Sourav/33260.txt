Scientists predict they will arrive in early 2011. UFO encounters continue to increase  as documented on WWN. And today scientists at SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), an independent non-commercial organization, made a major announcement: Three giant spaceships are heading towards Earth. The largest one of them is 200 miles wide. Two others are slightly smaller. At present, the objects are just moving past Jupiter. Judging by their speed, they should be on Earth by early 2011, said John Malley, the lead extraterrestrial expert at SETI. The spaceships were detected by HAARP search system. The system, based in Alaska, was designed to study the phenomenon of northern lights. According to SETI researchers, the objects are extraterrestrial spaceships. They will be visible in optical telescopes as soon as they reach Marss orbit  sometime in March of 2011. The US government has been reportedly informed about the event. SETI researchers have spent fifty years monitoring space. Professor Malley said that they have conclusively proven that we are just newcomers in this huge and unexplored world. Many believe that there are many other civilizations in space beside our own civilization. Wikileaks recenlty released many classified documents that prove that NASA and high-level U.S. official are aware of the three spaceships and are making plans to battle the spaceships. They have been concealing information from the U.S. public for decades. Wikileaks also confirms that the UFO sightings over the last three months prove that the alien invasions (long predicted by SETI) has begun. The three spaceships will mark the official beginning of the alien invasion. Malley said that recently a Chinese official, Mao Kan, had obtained over than 1,000 secret NASA photographs depicting not only human footprints, but even a human carcass on the surface of the Moon. Some of the bones in the carcass were missing, the official said. The human corpse must have been dropped on the Moon from an alien spaceship, whereas the extraterrestrials kept some tissue samples for research. Dr. Ken Johnston, former Manager of the Data and Photo Control Department at NASAs Lunar Receiving Laboratory, said that US astronauts had found and photographed ancient ruins of artificial origin on the Moon. US astronauts had seen large unknown mechanisms on the Moon. Both Johnston and Mao Kan agree that the alien spaceships are heading for Earth. Beginning in February of 2011 the U.N. will begin preparing citizens of the world for the attack of the three spaceships  which are believed to come from Planet Zeeba.
