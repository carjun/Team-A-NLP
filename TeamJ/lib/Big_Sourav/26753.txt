It is also an exercise that I have used to change negative people - Hahaha.. once they choose a single word... it's the only word that the rest of us are prepared to listen to lol. Cheers for calling by.. I want to come over to your place and borrow that awesome Crepes recipe soon! Take care.SomewayOuttaHere5 weeks ago ...excellent...Peace PD!  (nice way to start my day....reading your latest work)Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi Someway, thanks for reading this poem and your comment. I hope it reads okay...coz I wrote this with Pearl Jam's - Alive... at full volume.. Hahaha I hate it when my poetry influences good music!!! You have a good day.. it's head down time here!

We can all take hold of a word or phrase embracing it to keep us coming back to the positive place we long to remain in as all the world around us is dribbled with negative.  Thanks for the dose of positive and profound medicine which is good to my soul.  Love, Peace and Joy :) KatiePearldiver5 weeks ago Hi Someway... yep... Alive... A good word.. Take Care Mate!Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi Katie, thanks for reading this work and for your comments. Yes we can all take hold of a positive word or phrase, but not many do and as a result we have negative people in the world, to measure our positivity by, don't we? Cheers for calling in.. You Take Care..schoolmarm5 weeks ago I love this! My word is phenomenal - I've always loved to say it and it always makes me feel... well, phenomenal! :o) I have to admit I thought people would find me a bit strange for loving my word so I have only shared it with my daughter - until now. I'm thrilled to have found your  wonderful poem. Thank you!Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi schoolmarm, thank you for reading this poem of hope and your comments. Clearly, there is a lot in a word, isn't there? This poem can take away the negative influence of others who would, by their standards, consider it strange that another described themself so wonderfully in a word!Perhaps young children can also learn to be who they feel they are in a word. It is a great way of teaching others not to put up with those who they perceive to be in judgment of them. So... be phenomenal and always share that with others. I'm sure that in no time people will tell you that you are!My rational is: That if there are So Many Individual Words that can best describe negative people.... Why don't we emphasize single words to describe positive minded people?Good On You!! Take Care.50 Caliber5 weeks ago Pearldiver, I voted you up here, an awesome piece on one finding their peace and happy place in a word, mines "mum", peace, 50Micky Dee5 weeks ago Very well done.

What you seek is not so elusive Mickey; just really slippery... use your spurs.. get on and hang on beyond the mandatory 8 seconds. Peace is within you mate.. so many of us can see your peace shining far brighter than your turmoil.. it is a prerequisite to writing poetry isn't it? I must listen to my own words!! Take Care and be well mate.Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi erthfrend, thank you for those kind words and for taking the time to read this poem.. I'm glad you enjoyed it and if you found peace in it.. I hope you left some for Mickey Dee, who has been finding it elusive. It is always a pleasure to share uplifting words with you in the mornings when I'm UpSideDown lol.. it's the end of the day here! You have a good day and take care.Doug Turner Jr.5 weeks ago One word to change the world... what word would I give to others? ... Levitation.maven1015 weeks ago Beautifully done, Rob...You always bring wisdom and food for thought with your gently persuasive prose...Voted thumbs up and punched the awesome button, twice...My one word would be " enthusiasm "....remain always enthusiastic about life, love, and living in the moment...Carpe Diem, my friend, and always tight lines...Larryalways exploring5 weeks ago Your poetry is very beautiful.My one word would be enthusiasm.If i can stay enthusiastic my days are happy.Thank you.Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi Doug, thank you for reading this poem of hope and for your comment. Levitation is a great skill, yet one which I believe occurs in some cases; just before the crash! As a well practiced astral planer; I have found levitation to be most interesting and certainly does give a unique perspective on what we consider 'life' to be, as we realize that it is but our energy that fills and motivates that vessel or body below. Yes, Levitation would also give us the ability to rise above the pain or the lack of humility in this world. Cheers Doug, use your skill wisely like a smart trout; in that way you will never levitate towards a fly! Take Care.Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi Larry, thanks for reading this work and for your perfect word; enthusiasm. I know from all our communications how much you have made this you own and then shared it with others! I believe that I have been the recipient of your enthusiasm since I began here. Thanks for that also Larry.. you take care and always enjoy your life enthusiastically.dallas934445 weeks ago Happy! I have tried buying "happy," renting "happy," to learn one must earn happy... Happy is different for each of us... The wisdom is to know the dynamic needs to be happy...Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi there always exploring, thank you for reading my work and for your support. You share Larry's perspective.. well done.. enthusiasm is clearly contagious and well foundered for many in the pursuit of happiness, I see. Cheers for that. take care.Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hi dallas, thank you for reading this poem of hope and your great comment. Happy is not so elusive if you have a dictionary, is it?Did you consider that this poem was perhaps a poem of love for a sad person? As I said in the introduction, the poem can be interpreted in many different ways, yet the words remain the same! Sorry, I was in a deep place when I wrote this poem and I wanted to see how many ways people would/could interpret it.. all the answers so far are right and very apt. Thank you for yours.. take care.Deborah Demander5 weeks ago You present a great message beautifully.Namamste.Pearldiver5 weeks ago Hello DD, thank you for taking the time to read this work and your compliment... wow, yes well.. I had a good word in happy, to work with. Take care.SilentReed4 weeks ago If one word could change my life what would it be ?....hmmmNothing complicated and definitely nothing profoundI leave that to the religious and the seriously inclinedLife's too short to dwell upon the vast and immeasurableI leave that to God and to the many nut cases at the religious forumIt has to be simple and easy on the tongueA little bit naughty with sexual connotationsso with these parting wordsI leave that to your imagination ;))Pearldiver4 weeks ago Hi Silent Reed, thanks for reading this work and your comments. The word you seek may well be 'kinky!' But then this was not about me finding words that suited others who can so openly define what they are looking for. In life, I believe the best things are found when least searched for. I'm sure your 'right' word will also be found that way! For the purpose of this poem and the one it was dedicated to... the right word was 'Happy!' Cheers.. Take Care.Ashantina2 weeks ago My one word: 'YES' that I can, I will, I am unique, I seek... and on and on... You have a beautiful style of expression. I just feel like reading this over and over.. Thank you :)Pearldiver2 weeks ago Hi Ashantina, thanks for reading this poem of hope and your comments. Of course you can achieve anything that you focus on in life.. your word (hyphenated to it's best effect) would surely be self-belief. I'm glad that you enjoyed this work.. take care.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites94PearldiverFrom Bumble Town - NZ640 Followers52 HubsJoined 20 months agoRead more hubs by PearldiverContact PearldiverFollow PearldiverSubscribe to Pearldiver's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk Pearldiver a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsWhat's the difference between a friend, a true friend and a best friend?asked by Johnathan David 13 months ago7 answersAnswer this questionWhat is too cold for a dog to be outside?asked by weblog 10 months ago1 answerAnswer this questionRelated HubsThe 12 Steps of Pain: Amazing Poems of Love and Hope:...by PearldiverIntuition: Why do we Just Know? - (Part One)by Pearldiver"Secrets To Happiness"by lanealaneaAbstract & Psychedelic drawing: Way outside of the box.by GoodReadKellie Everts the former Stripper for God loses account at...by Bard of ElyPersonality Traits: Getting to Know the Aquarius Womanby Holly Matheson Friendship ForumTopicRepliesare you in loveposted by Butta636340When guy friends turn into something more...posted by CrazyMe19C'mon Give it UP!
