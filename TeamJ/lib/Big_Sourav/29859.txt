A Glock Model 19 9mm pistol. (AP)      Stories Wounded Giffords Staffer Returns to Work Authorities Release Detailed Loughner Timeline     (CBS)  STERLING, Va. - Beyond all the pain he caused last Saturday, Jared Loughner's barrage of gunfire - he hit 19 people using a 33 shot magazine - has reloaded the debate over gun control. Gun control proponents believe the wounding of a Congresswoman is a political game changer, reports CBS News correspondent Wyatt Andrews. "The fact that it's personal, one of their own I think is going to make a difference this time," said Paul Helmke, the president of the Brady Campaign, a nonpartisan group that works to fight gun violence.Special Report: Tragedy in TucsonAnd so in the wake of Tucson, Congressman Peter King, R-N.Y. would make it a Federal crime to carry a gun within 1,000 feet of a member of Congress. Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., wants more mandatory background checks at gun shows and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was the victim of gun violence, would ban the sale and import of gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.But a gun store in Virginia everyone CBS News spoke with said gun control won't work. Gun rights proponents say Congress should be focused on stopping the mentally ill from buying guns. "It's not the 10-round, 15-round magazines," said Earl Curtis, the owner of Blue Ridge Arsenal. "It's the system that failed."Most gun owners say restrictions on magazines won't make any difference to a determined killer, because semi-automatic guns, like the Glock used in Tucson, are easy to reload. And the political reality is that even after Tucson, both houses of Congress are largely pro-gun. Even Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, whose wounding made it personal, has boasted she's very good with her Glock.     MMXI, CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Who decides which people can vote. Who decides which people can exercise free speech. My point is, who's in charge here. Have we given the power of the people over to the government or are we still a free people to decide our own destiny. Are we being lazy and lacking courage as Thomas Jefferson said and letting the government run the people. The system wasn't set up that way. The brave will always control the weak. Thats why they call it "the land of the free and the home of the brave"     Reply to this comment            by ken1dall January 15, 2011 8:50 PM EST  This is your typical liberal, left-wing, media response to a crime that involves a firearm. The left would love to disarm Americans and will never give up trying. Next time you are in a dangerous situation call a cop, they'll show up after a crime is committed and take a report. Better that you can take care of yourself.

The "public," society, however you want to describe it -- is a collective entity, not a sentient being. It has no rights. We are members of the human race, not of an ant bed.In the end, we need one and only one law: Inflict no material harm upon another. That law needs only one exception: self-defense.Such a law is logically enforced by people with guns. They are not the police, not the military, not a militia. Such entities roam their respective territories under the presumption of having authority over anyone they encounter and they do so looking for trouble. This can result in only one outcome. They find trouble.The "people with guns" who enforce such a law are those who would otherwise be the victims of that material harm. They are, in other words, individuals acting in self-defense.     Reply to this comment           by troutfishyman January 15, 2011 8:54 PM EST  Of course the public has rights .... ever heard of "eminent domain"?Individual rights do not always trump the public good.                      by Void-Master January 15, 2011 8:59 PM EST  Eminent domain is not a right. It's an act of larceny.

I think the solution lies in expanding the background check to include some sort of sanity test--if you will? Not a hard one--mind you---but a test that might uncover the kinds of quirks that clearly existed in this guy's head. As I said a few days ago, after passing the normal criminal background check--- an applicant might then be required to sit for an interview given by a member of the local police force. (BTW--the applicant would have to pay for this interview--as local police are not a part of the national government.) If a person can sit across the table from a cop---and answer simple questions about why he/she wants a gun---then I don't see why they should not be allowed to guy a handgun under the existing laws. Will this completely eliminate gun violence--NO IT WILL NOT. Will it help--- anything has to be better than what we have now. Now since guns are covered under the 2rd amendement-- but clips are not--then by all means ban 30 shot clips.     Reply to this comment            by troutfishyman January 15, 2011 3:20 PM EST  common sense laws:1) require background check for ANY gun sale - no loopholes2) add mental health database to background check3) no high capacity magazines for easily concealed weaponsThese simple things would help tremendously.     Reply to this comment            by mecanik-2009 January 15, 2011 3:14 PM EST  Oh I'm sure there will be some feel good politics going on here. The Democrats are eager to please the voters on there side just to stay in office. I don't think anyone with half a brain is really convinced that any gun control legislation will stop these kind of crimes. Legislation doesn't do anything if you don't enforce the laws. And thats what we have now is lots and lots of laws that no one is enforcing unless its in there face and they have to. We just past legislation that would make a persons mental health records available so that they could be considered for a persons suitability to own a firearm. Where did that go. If there not going to make those records available to the BATF or if the BATF is going to just shrug there shoulders about it then why go any further with legislation.

How about that big ol' gas-guzzler? I don't think so - I think you should bicycle to work. How about those 14 pizzas, 5 lbs of fudge and the 10 cases of ice-cream in your freezer? Well, I don't think any of those things got 20 people shot!!!! But nice try.     Reply to this comment            by troutfishyman January 15, 2011 1:35 PM EST  by AndyDallas January 15, 2011 1:29 PM EST  As it is... now we're coming out swinging. We're tired of "feel-good" legislation which aims (pardon the pun) to make politicians look like they're doing something - when all that it affects are the law-abiding - and I for one am sick to death of taking the blame for the actions of a criminal.I will tell you straight out. You ARE responsible for these things when you oppose common sense gun laws. You need to recognize that we have mentally unstable people in this country, and that your personal rights to own whatever you want does not trump the greater public good.     Reply to this comment           by AndyDallas January 15, 2011 1:56 PM EST  "You ARE responsible for these things when you oppose common sense gun laws"I would support laws that actually have an effect - I don't support drivel, guised as "common sense" or not. Saying that something is common sense doesn't make it so - sorry."You need to recognize that we have mentally unstable people in this country"But I do - and I believe that they should be seen as such and made to get help - your implication that I don't is misleading and incorrect. So, how are we going to get the mentally-ill the help that they need?"your personal rights to own whatever you want does not trump the greater public good."Ahhhh, the greater good :))My rights to own whatever I want (when there are over 30,000 laws in place already which will nail me to the wall should I break them, should not be affected by the actions of a criminal lunatic) - any more than my kitchen knives should be taken from me because Richard Speck killed 8 nurses in a single night with one in Chicago in 1966 (as one example).                      by troutfishyman January 15, 2011 1:59 PM EST  Andy, you seem like a nice fellow, and I appreciate your civil approach to the debate. I guess we will agree to disagree on this one. Common sense gun laws are needed, as we see time after time as these incidents occur. Your right to own whatever you want does not trump the rights of those 20 people shot!

My personal needs or wants don't come into that particular issue, because I will NOT sell out other gun owners who do have a use for them.There is not legitimate need for a 30 round pistol clip. What if gun owners decide they have "a use" for a rocket launcher? Or a 50 cal machine gun and 1 million rounds of ammo?     Reply to this comment           by AndyDallas January 15, 2011 1:46 PM EST  I know a number of folks with machine-guns - 1 is a self-described "Yellow dog Democrat" from North Texas who owns a number of them - his son has an M60 and an M79 grenade launcher, by the way. I don't care for them myself - I got my fill of full-auto weapons in the military and in Iraq.As for ammo - who cares how much they have? As long as they store it safely and use it responsibly, what does it matter?While we're on the subject of machine-guns - find me one single case of a legally-owned machine-gun being used to commit a crime since 1936. Find me one case - I bet you can't :)Ah, here we go about "need" - I love these arguments :)Nobody needs 30 rounds in a magazine - or 15 - or 10 - or 5 - or 1. The problem is, where do we draw the line?Second, the word "need" is rather peculiar. It presupposes that we have to justify a purpose for something that we own - and justify it *to* someone - Big Brother, perhaps? And what criteria will he use to say yay or nay?Let's extrapolate. Do you need that shiny new bass-boat? Nope. How about that big ol' gas-guzzler? I don't think so - I think you should bicycle to work. How about those 14 pizzas, 5 lbs of fudge and the 10 cases of ice-cream in your freezer? You don't need those - you need to lose weight, IMO (just an example, not you personally). I don't think you need to listen to heavy metal or hip-hop - here, have some Baroque. I don't think you need the art on your walls, or to own more than a single guitar - why would you need two? You can only play one at a time anyway, right?I think you'll find that if we use the word "need" as an excuse to take things away from people, the American lifestyle would be deader'n a doornail :)                         by troutfishyman January 15, 2011 1:21 PM EST  Andy,The "slippery slope" argument is always the weakest debate technique.I can argue against ANYTHING using that one, LOL.     Reply to this comment           by AndyDallas January 15, 2011 1:29 PM EST  That might very well be true, absolutely. However - our distrust of politicians in this regard was earned by their own actions; if they'd simply dealt in good faith in the past, getting a "hi-cap" ban now would have been pretty painless.As it is... now we're coming out swinging. We're tired of "feel-good" legislation which aims (pardon the pun) to make politicians look like they're doing something - when all that it affects are the law-abiding - and I for one am sick to death of taking the blame for the actions of a criminal.                     1 2 3 4 next  See all 86 Comments     Add a comment    Comment  Subscribe to this comment thread by email  SUBMIT         Click here to add another comment.
