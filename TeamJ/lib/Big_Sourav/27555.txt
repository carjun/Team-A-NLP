Kuala Lumpur :  Malaysia|Dec 22, 2010By toreksulong        1 0     Views: 271      Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) are common viruses that can cause warts. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Most are harmless, but about 30 types put you at risk for cancer. These types affect the genitals and you get them through sexual contact with an infected partner. They are classified as either low-risk or high-risk. Low-risk HPV can cause genital warts. High-risk HPV can lead to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, and anus in women. In men, it can lead to cancers of the anus and penis. Although some people develop genital warts from HPV infection, others have no symptoms. Your health care provider can treat or remove the warts. In women, Pap smears can detect changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. A vaccine can protect against several types of HPV, including some that can cause cancer. In Malaysia, a total of 129.207 or 141.684 91.2 percent of female students at all levels of the country have written permission from parents to receive free vaccination injections Human Papilloma Virus(HPV). Deputy Health Minister, Datuk Rosnah AbdulRashid said, the statistics on 13December last year involved an 13-year-old students who registered for this year. "For the first dose, the injection was given to a total of 127.946 or 125.471, while 90.31 percent of the students or 88.56 percent had received two doses of vaccination,"she said.     toreksulong is based in Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (56.2%) India (12.4%) Malaysia (11.8%) Taiwan (6.5%) 12 other countries (9.8%)           READ MORE: HPV, vaccinaton, health-news, human papillomavirus, free injection, medicine, injection human, papillomavirus, free vaccination, biology, vaccination injection, Health Medical Pharma, Malaysia, Datuk Rosnah, Kuala Lumpur, microbiology, Papilloma, cancer, Genital wart, hpv vaccine, Wart, pap test, Female Students, Gardasil   More News From: Kuala Lumpur :  Malaysia     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     stdslove|17 daysagoI have HPV and I am an engineer who works for the largest STD dating and support site positivefish. com.
