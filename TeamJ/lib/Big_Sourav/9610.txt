Thoughts on the economic stimulus package and we the peopleFebruary 28, 2009by Anna DanielsA woman came up to the information desk where I work at the Central Library downtown and asked me how to get her stimulus funds.  This is of course an excellent question- the 787 billion dollar budget for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) includes provisions for education and training, protecting the vulnerable, energy, state and local fiscal relief, tax relief, health care, infrastructure and science and other.  In addition, California,  the most populous state in the union will receive the largest amount of those funds destined to the states.  0 commentsRead the full article Ocean Beach in the 1970s  How an armed police camp led to reforms in police practicesFebruary 27, 2009In my earlier post, I described how all hell broke loose 35 years ago on February 22, 1974.  It was the day that Pete Mahone tried to commit suicide by cop  a guy many of us active in OBs progressive community knew.  The subsequent armed take-over of Ocean Beach by the San Diego Police in response to the shooting led to an outrage among residents, an outrage that manifested itself into a campaign for human rights and reforms in police practices  a campaign that eventually did win some changes.11 commentsRead the full article Neighborhood Pride  Making the OB Brand A RealityFebruary 27, 2009by Doug PorterOnly a fool would deny that the economy, both locally and nationally, is in the tank. By every measure the future looks mighty bleak, with or without a stimulus. Rising unemployment, sagging industrial production, ever-tightening credit and the collapse of the housing market all add up to a very grim picture, particularly if you are a retail merchant located in Ocean Beach, San Diego, California.3 commentsRead the full article READER RANT: Why the Stupid Freakin Banks Dont Deserve My Bailout MoneyFebruary 26, 2009Hi. Im your neighbor, the guy in the front apartment that opens to the parking lot. And Im a (hopefully) soon to be former homeowner. Why hopefully? Because the bank still hasnt filed a Notice of Default, the document sent to the county recorder that starts the foreclosure process, even though I havent paid my mortgage since I moved out about six months ago and I told them even before that that theyd seen the last of my money. Why former homeowner? Longer story6 commentsRead the full article Pentagon ends media ban on coffinsFebruary 26, 2009Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced today that he is lifting a 1991 ban on news coverage of the return of the remains of fallen service members to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, although he will leave the decision about press coverage up to the family of the dead.The controversial ban on photography and other media coverage of the solemn return of flag-draped coffins  upheld by both Republican and Democratic administrations  has generated lawsuits as well as conflicting emotions on the part of military familiies.1 commentRead the full article Dr Jefe Answers His Critics On the Closing of Rock Paper ScissorsFebruary 25, 2009by Frank Gormlie(Reposted from Feb.19th) I finally sat down with Dr Jefe inside the hollow chamber once known as Rock Paper Scissors and got his side of the controversies surrounding the closing of the popular arts and crafts store. It had suddenly closed without notice earlier this month.65 commentsRead the full article Disappointing Turnout From OB at City Committee Budget MeetingFebruary 25, 2009There was a disappointing turnout of Ocean Beach residents and businesspeople today at the Citys Budget and Finance Committee hearing. There was literally two OB residents present at this mornings meeting.  The Clairemont  library had a number of supporters, plus sitting in the back of the large room were organizers from the city-wide library coalition-in-forming.5 commentsRead the full article Blondstone vs OB Farmers Market, Part Three   Just Grow Up!February 24, 2009To re-cap:Flyers were passed out at the OB Farmers Market suggesting that the owners of Blondstone were seeking to have the market shut down by way of a letter writing campaign to various governmental agencies that resulted in increased scrutiny.We met with Blondstone owner Shane Smith who asserted that his objective was never to shut down the Farmers Market. 25 commentsRead the full article Oscar, Progressive Politics a Sign of the Future of the Film Industry? Bravo!February 23, 2009As a writer and once upon a time film student, I found this years Academy Awards to be an exemplary display of the breadth of possibility that Hollywoods insular, but nonetheless public, progressive political scene presents. This year, the Academy rewarded actors not just for being beautiful people in rented jewelry and expensive clothing, but for the emotions they conjured and the political movements that their roles represented. 5 commentsRead the full article The Campaign to Save the Ocean Beach LibraryFebruary 23, 2009On the corner of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and Santa Monica Avenue resides a historic landmark, one that has served the Ocean Beach community and surrounding areas as both a valuable storehouse of knowledge and a tranquil study haven for over 80 years. This unique site is the home of the Ocean Beach branch of the San Diego Public Library, and today, it faces threats of possible closure.On November 6th, 2008, San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders announced the tentative closure of the Ocean Beach branch due to budget cuts, along with 6 other libraries, 9 recreation centers and a gym. An astounding response from the community has led to the mayors decision to forego the issue and revisit it this spring.4 commentsRead the full article Cancer cluster at UCSDFebruary 23, 2009A higher-than-normal rate of cancer diagnoses in the building that houses UCSDs literature department has been the subject of near-constant discussion in recent months, but its an issue thats been on the departments radar for years.Weve been talking about this in the hallways for almost as long as Ive been here, said Anna Joy Springer, a creative-writing professor whos been teaching at UCSD for six years.Between 2000 and 2006, faculty and staff who work in the building reported at least eight individual cases of breast cancer. Of these people, two have died. 0 commentsRead the full article Eye-Popin News from San Diego: Outrage at Border Agents and PowerlinkFebruary 22, 2009BORDER AGENTS BLOCK MARCHERSIn the end, immigration activists never made it to the site of yesterdays planned demonstration, a plaza dubbed Friendship Park that sits on a bluff overlooking the ocean at Border Field State Park.  For the first time, Border Patrol agents formally sealed off access on the U.S. side to the plaza, for years a popular meeting place on the U.S.-Mexico border for families to visit through the fence.__________________POWERLINK CAUSES OUTRAGEJody Morgan cherishes his 100-acre property in El Monte Valley, where El Cajon Mountain rises above the rural community thats home to a dairy and horse farms. At a Lakeside planning group meeting Wednesday night, Morgan held up a photo he created of what the valley would look like if the proposed Sunrise Powerlink transmission line were built there.0 commentsRead the full article OB Farmers Market Story Continued.Blondstone: Just Dont Hurt UsFebruary 22, 2009[Republished due to popular demand.]Last week we ran a report about flyers handed out on Newport Avenue that pointed the finger at the owners of Blondstone as being behind a letter writing campaign that could lead to closing down the OB Farmers Market, the Holiday Parade, and other events that include craft fairs. That report prompted numerous people to comment on this site. Shane Smith and Heidi Holman, the husband-wife team that owns the store, also contacted us, asking for an opportunity to express their point of view. I sat down with Shane; this story is a result of that get-together.55 commentsRead the full article When the people lead the leaders follow- an Update on the Community Input Meetings on the FY10 BudgetFebruary 22, 2009by Anna DanielsThe third community input meeting on the upcoming budget was held this Saturday, February 21, at Hoover High School in City Heights.  The auditorium was packed to overflowing! Fifty seven citizens provided public testimony about what services they considered essential and non-essential as well as ideas on how to save money and generate more general fund revenue.  Fifty of those citizens said libraries and park and recreation services are essential because they provide kids with safe meaningful alternatives to the streets and opportunities for their future.3 commentsRead the full article Urgent Action: Needy Families Will Suffer Significant ConsequencesFebruary 19, 2009Through my work alongside social service and mental health professionals, I am occasionally presented the opportunity to do more than provide direct services. Today I came across a call to action for all San Diego community leaders, and in my opinion that includes anyone who takes part in the OB Rag  either as a contributor, a reader, or both.As a result of the slumping economy and the California Legislatures longstanding inability to agree on a viable budget, there will be a number of far-reaching consequences. One of those consequences is in direct relation to the well-being of San Diegos poor, namely those receiving cash aid or food stamps. 1 commentRead the full article You are what you eat: San Diego Food Blogs ExploredFebruary 19, 2009by Doug PorterSo many restaurants, so little time.San Diegans love to eat and they also love to write about what they eat. There are dozens and dozens of San Diego based blogs out there on the inter-tubes talking about filling the ol pie hole.I recently spent waaay too much time exploring this world and am offering up these short reviews of foodie blogs that I found of interest. In order to qualify for this list, bloggers had to post regularly, be based in and write about San Diegos culinary offering, and have been discovered by me before my vision started to blur. Im sure that there are many more worthy blogs out there.4 commentsRead the full article The rocky closure of Rock Paper ScissorsFebruary 19, 2009Weve learned that the popular crafts store Rock Paper Scissors, which shut its doors suddenly a couple weeks ago, had a very rocky closure, indeed.  The stores closure was so rocky, that many of the stores vendors feel ripped-off and say the stores owner, Jeff Fagan, owes them thousands of dollars.  Some of the vendors are talking about suing Fagan.Accusations are flying, anger is rising.  When he closed the store, Fagan gave the vendors insufficient notice; he hasnt paid back February rents, or even for some vendors January rents, or for some monies from December, or the original deposits.  He owes his vendors thousands, tens of thousands; one estimate is a quarter million. 25 commentsRead the full article Food Stamps in San Diego County  a Disgrace!  Heres how to get them:February 18, 2009At a time when jobless rates are hovering around 8%, one in ten homeowners cant afford their mortgage payments, and the average cost of staple foods have risen astronomically, we should all be proud to know that those of us living in San Diego County reside in a region with the lowest accessibility to food stamps in the ENTIRE COUNTRY.According to the Food Research and Action Center, only 29% of eligible recipients receive Food Stamp benefits, good for last among the 24 largest metropolitan areas in the country.27 commentsRead the full article Our San Diego County Government  What does it do and what is it good for?February 18, 2009by Frank GormlieResidents in this County, when asked what San Diego County government does, are often hard-pressed I have found, to list more than a couple of things. Uh, collect taxes theyll respond,  uh, run the sheriffs office, uh,  and then there will be a long, thoughtful pause. And maybe theyll add one or two other services.Well, the County does collect property and other taxes, and it does finance the Sheriffs Office  although the Sheriff is elected separately. But the County does so much more.17 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
