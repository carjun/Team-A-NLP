See all 7 photosI Had to Come Back Again.Life Circles: Poems of Hope: About My Darling Sweet Obsession by Pearldiver is an inspirational poem that honors the power of love and lovers. A Life Circle will always move forward from its source; we as people who live in hope; are that source, love is the tangible hope that we find we need in our lives and really can not live our lives to their fullest, without. My Darling Sweet Obsession is a powerful view of a special love between two lovers who only meet when the moon is full and the tides are at their highest. Enjoy My Darling Sweet Obsession.=+=I just had to come backAnd be with you againMy sweet obsession =+=Taken is my soul; Lost by your depth; The tranquility in your eyesI know all your raging moods; They have washed away better menBut this primal need for pleasure;This summer moon full Is far too great; too strong Always pulling me towards you=+=Across An Empty Sandy Bay. I Know All Your Raging Moods. Our hearts; I hear them poundingTothe need to be Completely; just to be; forever Completely; immersed within youFamiliar lovers entwined; immersed;Drenched in the beating pulse Of salty waves perspiredSilently he knows; this magnetic moon; Dancing; with his shimmering smileAcross our empty sandy bay=+=I could never really consider When I am with you like thisThat life could ever exist; without youBeyond these nights; these times That we join together in our loveThe pains of missing you are so true=+=I just had to come backAnd be with you againMy sweet obsessionWe have this whole night Familiar lovers entwinedUntil morning brings parting wavesWith our energy spent; a low tide=+=So we blend into our moonlightThis wild love really enhances My every sense; my every beingOn a washed beach; just before the dawnMy obsession shows no sign of fleeingBut this sand; it sparkles in the light And feels cold upon my back Moving; moving higher nowAbove the sweep of the tideWet and tangled from the loveWe have shared; now we just sit Be still my love; so I can see all ofThe moonlight dancing over you=+=Above The Sweep of The Tide. Sitting Now; Just Out of Reach. Who Are We To Know Best? I just know you so wellI must go; but Im sitting here nowJust out of reach I watch your slender fingers Searching; beyond the tideSuch a determined silky wet touchGoodbye my love; I already miss youSo my love; no matter what we doI must always come back To just be with you again My darling sweet obsessionYou hold my heart; that is true=+=I could never really consider When we have spent a night like thisThat my life on earth could exist Without your loveWithout your ebb and flow Without the life that you give So much hope and wondermentAmong your treasures; are the heartsOf all faithful lovers; just like meMy darling sweet obsessionI just have to come back again soonTo you; my sweet obsession May I never loose the love I feelFor this darling obsessionYou make me restless, alive and free=+=But with you; darling sweet obsessionI feel as though you take me homeYou have so much power over me So please tell me this; my love Can any mere mortal man not beTruly captured and enchanted;Truly engrossed and in love like meCaught within the currents that you areYes darling sweet obsession; caught I'll always bePlease; always take me homeFor you; also faithful I'll always be; My darling sweet obsession; I will be faithful to; your oceans and your tearsAnd you will always own my obsessive loyal heartFor I just have to always come back to just beWith you again; my love; my gentle raging sea.oo0oo Copyright 2010 Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rights reserved.=+=I hope that you have enjoyed this short poem for lovers of the sea and lovers in general. Thank you for reading Life Circles: Poems of Hope: About My Darling Sweet Obsession. Where would we be without hope and where would we be without the Sea? She puts up with so much from people, oil and fishing companies and we tend to ignore the fact that our oceans are the life blood of our world.The ocean waters that you see when you look at the beach today; will tomorrow flow through another place in the world. The sea is always moving through currents that circumvent the globe. Don't let those currents carry pollutants and rubbish to the places that also rely on the purity of those oceans, to support other precious life forms that may no longer survive if their environment and ecosystem has been ruined by man. Think about that the next time you see someone thoughtlessly discard plastic rubbish into the sea or on the beach. It's too late when our seas are polluted; extinction has already occurred. It's a pity that we allow others to do that because we are too apathetic and we let those oil companies destroy so much... so arrogantly.... as if it is their right. They justify the rape by quoting supply and demand: Look the public wants petrol and we do.... because the public is obsessed with fossil fuels.. and it is truly this cruel, bitter obsession; that is stronger than the public desire to share the beautiful places that we unwittingly take from our children.

Thank you.Pearldiver5 months ago Ah How Lucky I am that the first to comment on my poem called My Darling Sweet Obsession, is from the one that reminds us all what could be Paradise. Thank you for always taking the time to read my works and to always encourage the pearldiver to dive deeper in search of greater pearls. Take Care.MPG Narratives5 months ago Beautiful, just beautiful. Being surrounded by water (like you) we understand how important the seas are, we all need to look after our oceans today and forever. Thanks PD, this was a great read.Pearldiver5 months ago Hi MPGN, Thanks for taking the time to read this poem and your kind comments. Our seas support more than we currently know and I feel it would be nice to find out exactly what lives so close to us. Besides I also enjoy fishing and boating, so the sea is quite important in my life.. it's hard to ignore something that greets you everyday. Be Well and Take Care.dallas934445 months ago Most of our cities "dump" their sewer water into our seas... The danger. T. gondii is a parasite and infects everything warm-blooded. There is no cure. Sewage plants do not "kill" T. gondii. Most of us have it.. It effects our behaviors...Pearldiver5 months ago Hi dallas, yes that tends to be the sad fact with 'outflows'.. but I thought that parasitic bug was only carried by town and city councillers. Thanks for commenting on this seriously important and highly crappy human discharge. We really do abuse the sea don't we?Take Care and be well dallas.Micky Dee5 months ago Great thoughts. I'm afraid my brain has over-ruled my obsessions! Bravo!Pearldiver5 months ago Hi Micky Dee, I'm afraid mine has as well mate... Hahaha I was remembering when, I think. I remembered that the first obsession given up was pushing granny when she was shaving, as it left me traumatised for weeks. Thanks for reading this MD.. Take Care and Be Well as you peddle through the bus lanes of life.rebekahELLE5 months ago well, of course, I'm going to read a poem with such a beautiful title, My Darling Sweet Obsession. as soon as I started reading it, I understood. there is something about the sea that inspires hope and a fervant love for something bigger than our own lives.your poetry is so beautiful, it's a pleasure to read.I also wrote a poem years ago about the moon and the tides and a woman. The moon and the woman fell in love and she became a star in the sky..thanks for sharing these beautiful poems of hope.ps. the photo of the fjords reminds me of Lord of the Rings. Your country is so amazing.. someday I hope to see it.Pearldiver5 months ago Hi Rebekah, Hahaha yes I used that title especially for you... knowing that your curiousity would lead you here. I couldn't help it.. the Sea has influenced my whole life, plus I'm a water sign, so I guess and hope it will continue that way.  Thanks for reading this work and thanks for your ever positive compliment.The coves in that photo are amazing as there are amoung the rocky bays, these awesome little white sand beaches, that no one knows about. We do have some brilliant places here if you get off the tourist track and give yourself the chance to feel the natural pulse. Did you publish that poem Rebekah? You take care and be well.. thanks again.Deborah Demander5 months ago Lovely poem Pearldiver. I am glad to have found you.Namaste.Freya Cesare5 months ago "I could never really considerWhen I am with you like thisThat life could exist without youBeyond these nights; these timesThat we join in our loveThe pains of missing are so true"sooooo lovely!Pearldiver5 months ago Hi DD, thanks for reading this work and your kind comments. I'm so glad that you have found me as well; cheers I have been searching for many years for that guy wearing my clothes. Take Care and be well.Pearldiver5 months ago Hi Freya, thank you for reading and enjoying this poem. I think it's fascinating how we each interprete a poem; I had not written those lines as a standalone statement and didn't really look at them that way until you played them back to me! They are nice lines.. thank you for shifting my perspective... this is a fun learning experience. Take care and be well.always exploring5 months ago A true pleasure to read your intriguing thoughts put into words.CheersPearldiver5 months ago Hi always exploring, thank you for reading this piece and your kind comment.

I look forward to reading more of your workPearldiver5 months ago Hi Sassypoetic, thanks for reading my work and your kind compliment.

You be well and take care.maven1014 months ago Hi Rob...Such splendid prose that makes the heart ache with desire and need...reading through it a second time I picked up on the essential emotional thread...a burning passion...I wish you many more ebb tide mornings my friend....Incidentally. how did you fare with that monster earth shake down there...Hope all is well with you and yours...LarryPearldiver4 months ago Hi Larry, thank you for asking mate.. this quake was in the other island and at a time that ensured that no one was wiped out.. just bricks and morter; which of course can always be replaced.Cheers for reading this Sir.. I always enjoy your objective, constructive critique/compliments. I really like this poem myself. Is that allowed? Thanks for calling by mate, I appreciate your friendship.. You Take Care and be well.erthfrend3 months ago This poem was simply amazing, so beautifully written, so visual. I truly enjoyed it. And thank you for speaking so fullheartedly about the ocean at the end of the poem, about pollution and the environment. Its so very important and it makes me so happy whenever I hear of someone that cares as much as I do.Pearldiver3 months ago Hi Erthfrend, thank you for taking the time to read this work. So glad you enjoyed it. Pollution of our oceans is so often ignored by people as they choose apathetically to not see the results of their rubbishing. So many sea creatures and birds are affected by that ignorance. Grrr... Take care.maven1012 months ago Rob...Reading through again, I was struck by the thought of making love on the beach...that sand can be a real challenge in the moonlight...but then, passion overcomes all...LarryPearldiver2 months ago Hahaha Touche Larry, I thought they taught the Marines to Grit their teeth and Grin when they bare it, even under fire? I think perhaps if one makes a lover of the sea, they must constantly concern themselves with potentially waking up after a moonlit romp with sea lice, more than worrying about the sand! But mind you.. I've always been cautious about girls called Sandy also. Take Care mate and be well.epigramman2 months ago ...not too many people receive five 'wells' from the epigramman - so here goes - well well well well well - when I go 'diving' for pearls of poetic wisdom and divinity just look what I find - your hubs jammed with the most wonderful writing that one can imagine ......Pearldiver2 months ago Hi Epigramman, Thanks for choosing this dive site to dive in. How can I answer such a compliment? Wow thank you for such powerful words of support. My works are only jammed full of me and I guess, a well of experience that I can draw from. Cheers for that mate.. You be well and take care.Doug Turner Jr.8 weeks ago I noticed a few people mentioned it here already, but you are a true poet. Your words and imagery are completely engulfing, much like your beloved sea. My only humble critique is that I wish the poem were shorter. The last third of the poem, I felt caught up and "on top" of it, if you will. Whereas up until the line "you hold my heart, that is true" I was holding my breath and caught up in the whirlwind of imagery. The last third didn't read with as much poignancy for me. Nice work.Pearldiver8 weeks ago Hi DTjnr, thanks for reading this work and your comments. You have noticed the change. Yes I did this rather badly, as I wrote this in two separate sessions on different days. That is a no-no as each day one's flow is always likely to be different. So you are quite right and I will make that adjustment. Cheers for that ... take care.acaetnna6 weeks ago Gosh this was beautiful, I am so pleased I found your inspirational writing.Pearldiver6 weeks ago Hi acaetnna, thanks for reading this poem of hope and of course for.. finding me!! I have to say at times that I have a lot of difficulty doing that myself. I'm pleased that you find my poetry inspirational.. if so, then it is worthy of the time taken to create it.. cheers for that. This poem... is unusual in that I am not sure, as a result of the difference of opinions, whether I need to shorten it or not? Thanks again for your kind compliment. Take Care.Eaglekiwi5 weeks ago Wow ,love the way you used words to  evoke/caress emotions ,and tenderly rocked images back n forth ,then like a tide let it gently ebb away again, least thats how I felt.Thankyou ,was awesome!Sometimes I think Id love to write poetry ,specially when I hear the wind whisper words in my ear,then I think ,yikes if I tell someone here theyd rush me off to some clinic-hahahaPearldiver5 weeks ago Hello EagleKiwiMainlander, How are you in the big sky? Thanks for reading this work and enduring my poety without getting seasick :)... You know some of the greatest writers and poets have gained their inspiration from the wind EK... Sure you might get straitjacketed but think about how wonderfully you will be able to ask for help!Hahaha take care..
