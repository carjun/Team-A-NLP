If you'd read the article in the very first post of this thread then this would be a clear cut answer.    Quote:   "Analysis of crania is the traditional approach to assessing ancient population origins, relationships, and diversity. In studies based on anatomical traits and measurements of crania, similarities have been found between Nile Valley crania from 30,000, 20,000 and 12,000 years ago and various African remains from more recent times (see Thoma 1984; Brauer and Rimbach 1990; Angel and Kelley 1986; Keita 1993). Studies of crania from southern predynastic Egypt, from the formative period (4000-3100 B.C.), show them usually to be more similar to the crania of ancient Nubians, Ku****es, Saharans, or modern groups from the Horn of Africa than to those of dynastic northern Egyptians or ancient or modern southern Europeans." (S. O. Y and A.J. Boyce, "The Geographical Origins and Population Relationships of Early Ancient Egyptians", in Egypt in Africa, Theodore Celenko (ed), Indiana University Press, 1996, pp. 20-33)   From the above it's proven that Early Upper Egyptian (the originators of Egypt) crania overlaps with other more Southerly Northeast African populations (all overlapping with one another) whom have always been referred to as 'black'.     Quote:   The Egyptians were indigeneous Africans but does that automaticlly mean Black-African especially when dealing with north Africans?   A flaw with this statement is that the sources presented state more than "They were indigenous Africans" they list which particular indigenous African populations that the Ancient Egyptians overlap with, and that particular population happens to be more Southerly Northeast Africans (I.e modern Horn populations like Somalis and Ethiopians).   Quote:   The Berber people are indigenous north Africans but aren't considered Black-Africans. Some believe the ancient Egyptians were similar to the Berbers as far as being an non Black indigenous north African group.   Berber is a language and culture that originated in East Africa (with East Africans) not a race meaning that anyone who speaks Berber is a Berber whether they be Black Africans, people of Eurasian descent, or most commonly a mix of the both.  Secondly according to the largest genetic study on Africans and African Americans in History (Tishkoff '09), North Africans (including Berber speakers) are a 50/50 mix of various indigenous African clusters (all originating in Sub Saharan Africa) and the Eurasian cluster (light Blue).    So from this information stating that the light skinned mulatto (black-white mix) phenotype generally found throughout North Africa is "indigenous" to the continent of Africa should be taken very lightly with this finding.                                04-13-2010, 08:49 PM          Louisvilleslugger  Senior Member            Join Date: May 2007 309 posts, read 492,683 times Reputation: 140           Quote:    Originally Posted by dusk99   Its a controversial subjec, but Egypt was a cosmopolitan society with many different types of people.

Compare those to this Nubian mummy.    Quote:   Ramesses II Father: Seti I, Mother: Queen Mut-TuyRounded forehead with sagittal plateau. Slight, rounded glabella. Proclined upper incisors; receding chin with high ANB. Rather long ramus with weak inclination of mandible. Orthognathous...  In terms of head shape, the XVIV and XX dynasties look more like the early Nubian skulls from the mesolithic with low vaults and sloping, curved foreheads. The XVII and XVIII dynasty skulls are shaped more like modern Nubians with globular skulls and high vaults. Merenptah, Siptah and Ramesses V all have pronounced glabellae. Ramesses IV has a bulging occiput similar to the "Elder Lady." Ramesses II and his son, Merenptah, both have rather weakly inclined mandibles with long ramus. Ramesses II's father, Seti I, does not possess this feature, though, suggesting that this was inherited from Ramesses II's mother, Queen Mut-Tuy. The gonial angle of Seti I is 116.3 compared to 107.9 and 109 for Ramesses II and Merenptah respectively. (An X-ray atlas of the royal mummies. Edited by J.E. Harris and E.F. Wente.

At least not for me. Things looked different back then.

Aren't they supposed to be related to the Nubians? So wouldn't the Egyptians of the early periods have a similar look as the Nubians?                    04-13-2010, 09:05 PM          dusk99  Senior Member            Join Date: Aug 2009 467 posts, read 151,284 times Reputation: 213           Quote:    Originally Posted by Louisvilleslugger   It became a "cosmopolitan society" overtime, but it's origins lies to the South.

Black Africans come in many different hues ranging from Pitch black (like the Dinka of the Sudan) to Light Brown (the Khoisan of Southern Africa). Dark reddish brown I think fits within that range don't you?  Which one of these Northeast Africans would you not consider black?         Quote:    The inscription describes a ferocious invasion of Egypt by armies from Kush and its allies from the south, including the land of Punt, on the southern coast of the Red Sea. It says that vast territories were affected and describes Sobeknakhts heroic role in organising a counter-attack.     The text takes the form of an address to the living by Sobeknakht: Listen you, who are alive upon earth . . . Kush came . . . aroused along his length, he having stirred up the tribes of Wawat . . . the land of Punt and the MedjawNotice the Egyptian Pharaoh is depicted as the same hue as half of the Nubians he is slaughtering. Some of the Sudanese Nubians who were pitch black (Dinka) while others (Beja) and Ethiopian Nubians were brown skinned like the Egyptians.

There is no doubt that ancient Egypt's demographics changed over time as a result of mixing with slaves and surrounding populations.  However the point is that the earliest Pharaohs show caucasoid traits, which indicates that the civilization was founded by a people who came from elsewhere.  This is similar to the invaders of India who set up Hinduism.  Over time heavy admixture has occurred but signs of their genetic presence are evident in the north and higher castes.

Nothing in my source states that their was a "foreign" pre-existing population in the Nile Valley. What my peer reviewed evidence does state however is that the creators of Ancient Egypt (Upper Egyptians) overlap with more Southerly Northeast African populations, both ancient and modern populations. The significance of those ancient population overlapping with the modern Northeast African populations (Somalis and Ethiopians) is that it gives you an idea of what the Ancient populations looked like. An interesting question that you should probably ask yourself (since you're in such doubt about this conclusive finding) is if the early Ancient Egyptians were a mix of Africans and Near Easterners and or just Near Easterners, then why don't they show biological affinities towards Near Eastern populations? Instead why do they overlap with more Southerly Black Horn Africans?    Quote:    Once again I'll post this picture, all you have to do is look at it and tell me what type of person this looks like. Pharaoh Seti I   Once again actual anthropologist did a first hand assessment of Seti's corpse and found his crania to have Nubian affinities   material taken from X-ray Atlas of the Royal Mummies   Quote:   Below: The male cranium above is from Wadi al-Halfa on the Sudan-Egypt border. Dating from the Mesolithic-Holocene period, it is typical of crania in Sudan and surrounding regions from that time frame. More recent Nubian crania from the Christian period have more rounded skulls without the sloping frontal bone. However, the vertical zygomatic arch, prominent glabella, sagittal plateau, and occipital bun (less pronounced) are retained. The cranium above [now below] has pronounced facial prognathism, but moderate dental protrusion. The chin is vertical with a angular mandible and very squat ramus. (Image from David Lee Greene and George Armelagos. The Wadi Halfa mesolithic population. (Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1972) In terms of head shape, the XVIV and XX dynasties look more like the early Nubian skulls from the mesolithic with low vaults and sloping, curved foreheads. Seti I - Father: Ramesses I, Mother: Queen SitreProjecting, arched glabella. Zygomatic arches are rather forward giving prominent cheekbones. Very straight upper incisors; receding chin; moderately steep mandible and broad ramus. Sloping, rather flattened forehead. Occipital region is similar to Pharaohs of XVIII Dynasty.    Quote:   Does it look like an African-American to you?   No one mentioned African Americans so why are you?   Quote:   Because thats really what this whole debate is about, the controversy surrounding the "race" of the ancient Egyptians.   The Controversy and question isn't over what 'race' (no longer valid in Science) were the Ancient Egyptians. Their is overwhelming irrefutable evidence as to who the early Ancient Egyptians have overlapping biological and cultural affinities with and that happens to be more Southerly Northeast Africans. The question is why do some feel the need to scramble to dilute this fact, and paint a false picture of Egypt having a Near Eastern and or multiple origins (African and Near Eastern) when there is no evidence in existence suggesting this theory. Why can't some people who don't consider themselves racist or having racist thoughts just admit that people whom they wouldn't hesitate to label 'Black' (in either a social sense or simply being descriptive) were the originators of this ancient African civilization. That is the reason why this is in the political controversies section.

For some reason I get the feeling that you've ignored the conclusive evidence I've posted confirming that the original Egyptians overlapped (were of the same stock) with more Southerly African populations and not Near Easterners, I hope I'm wrong.   Quote:   However the point is that the earliest Pharaohs show caucasoid traits,   Dude you can't be serious? The only thing you're referencing for their statement is their hair after it's been altered by the embalming process. I mean come on you can't seriously think that some bleach blond Nordic guy ruled over this Ancient African civilization. You aren't that naive are you? If so then you probably think that these red head mummified Native South American was also a descendant of some pre-columbus migration of Europeans to the Americas?     Quote:   which indicates that the civilization was founded by a people who came from elsewhere.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 87:245-254)"   Your theory is discredited from a shear lack of evidence. Also you see that first dynasty royal remains were of Northeast African stock further discrediting your claim of them having "caucasian traits".
