Mouret has often been asked if he's the man behind the former Spice Girl's designs -- and this week a journalist worked his last nerve. Mouret reportedly exploded, "Oh my God, that question! Politicians, movie stars, it's always the first things they want to know and I'm like, why? Why would I want to design a collection for Victoria Beckham?" He added, "Yes she is a friend and yes she asks for advice and yes I told her the name of a pattern cutter, but she has lots of friends she asks for advice -- Marc Jacobs. I like to help people that's all." Okay.

Wants to own all the RE in the US but is satisfied if it can accomplish a deal, even if it means reducing the real estate around it.  When that is sufficiently low enough, then they will try to buy it at bargain basement.  Eddie, Eddie, Eddie............            JR_Jake: I love J.

I am a 28 year old woman. I love J Crew and I buy a good majority of my clothes there, especially work clothes, outerwear, shoes, denim, and sweaters.
