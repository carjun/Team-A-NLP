General Vang Pao, biggest hero of Vietnam War, dies at 81     Los Angeles :  CA :  USA|Jan 06, 2011By Richard Harrison        1 1     Views: 404      Vang Pao, a highly admired ex-general in the Laos Royal Army, has died at the age of 81 years, reports said. Vang Pao was admitted to hospital 10 days ago and he passed away on Thursday. Reports suggest that Vang Pao died as a result of pneumonia. It should be noted that Vang Pao had served the secret army backed by CIA during the Vietnam War. Vang Pao had led guerrillas in support of the CIA-backed mission. Vang Pao immigrated to U.S.A. after the communist regime took hold of Laos in 1975. Vang Pao was celebrated as a great leader and general by the refugees of Laos who were settled in California. It should be noted that Vang Pao fought the Japanese as a teenager during World War II when the Japanese attempted to take over Laos. Vang Pao served the mission of CIA for around 15 years. Willian Colby, ex-chief of CIA, called Vang Pao "the biggest hero of the Vietnam War". "He's the last of his kind, the last of the leadership that carries that reference that everyone holds dear," said Blong Xiong, the first Hmong-American Fresno city councilman. "Whether they're young or old, they hear his name, there's the respect that goes with it", he added.        1 of 28         Hmong refugees in Thailand      Richard Harrison is based in California, California, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (74.6%) India (12.8%) France (2.3%) Senegal (1.9%) 19 other countries (7.1%)           READ MORE: general vang pao, CIA activities in Asia and the Pacific, CIA, Foreign relations of Laos, Laos Royal Army, Laotian Civil War, vietnam war, Vang, Hedmark, world war, Laotian coup d'tat conspiracy allegation, communist regime, human interest, Secret Army, Laos, called vang, Politics of Laos, obituaries-news, fresno city, Asia, los angeles, U.S.A, Blong Xiong, Hmong, Vang Pao, Willian Colby, political-news   More News From: Los Angeles :  CA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 1            Reply  Posted By     vauldine|2 daysagoCondolences go out to relatives and freinds.
