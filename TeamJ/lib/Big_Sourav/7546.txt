Carrying a small box, he walks up the Drais residence sidewalk, looks directly into her camera,  and then swipes the three packages that had just been deliveredThe man leaves an empty decoy package behind."The driver was a woman," Drais said. "We know that because we heard her in the drivers seat giggling, 'Oh! Look at what we got! Oh, wow, big packages!'"Furious, Drais posted the video online, hoping to prevent others from becoming prey of the parcel pilferers."Every day is Christmas to them where they can go and get peoples' packages off their door and open it like it's Christmas," Drais said.She adds that she'll never again purchase anything online without signature delivery  especially since she's learned that delivery companies are not usually responsible for packages stolen after they were successfully delivered."Online places, too, need to let you opt for a signature," Drais said. "They don't even offer that. They are a retailer, so you can say they are signature-required  maybe that would help, too."McKinney police said they are actively investigating the incident.E-mail sgables@wfaa.com Share this article:28 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Authorities identify Dallas man killed by self-inflicted gunshot while fleeing policeNext article Trooper's excessive force trial to resume FridayTo add a comment, please register or login.Add another commentLeave your comment1000 characters remainingSubmitWe welcome your comments on this story's topic.

UPS does not stand by there insurance of even $100 with proof either. Toys R Us said they will not ship our order that was stolen after saying wednesday that is would. The status with them says it is allocated and they will not ship us my daughters trike and doll house that was stolen! This just gets worse and worse over the theft!!! I am so stressed out and frustrated. We will update if we find the guy and/or get our packages.57304489Flag this commentbelfastnow said on December 12, 2010 at 2:01 PMThe crims better take heed. More and more neighborhoods are investing in cameras and the neighborhood police keep track of who has cameras and have caught many a dirtbags this way. I think  it is totally unfair to expect delivery personnel to try and hide the packages you ordered. Their job is delivery and this time of year they work long hours. A little consideration and thank you's for the delivery personnel would be nice. Cameras also catch burglars and the trashy teenagers that think it is great sport to destroy the property of others. Wouldn't mind giving them a knock around myself.57234529Flag this commentscottfwtx said on December 12, 2010 at 12:07 PMWhy buy on-line and have it shipped knowing you won't be home when delivered? Remember the old days when people actually went to a store to shop?57229974Flag this commentbrickhouse said on December 11, 2010 at 7:21 AMIf the thief has a driver's licence, then the State has his finger prints.  But as backlogged as Dallas is, I doubt they have the time to look.  Ms. Drais, I hope they catch the  thief who stole not only your packages, but your Christmas joy.  My neighborhood has a community mail box and will post his picture on it to warn others.57182014Flag this commentplanogirl said on December 10, 2010 at 11:15 PMkkaggie, I do agree about being proactive and hiding the packages.  It is smarter than just leaving them out in the open.  I was just pointing out that there are criminals who make a small career this time of year following delivery trucks.  It beats driving around neighborhoods hoping to get lucky.  It's a given that delivery trucks will be working overtime from now to Christmas to get packages delivered, and while the nicer delivery guys might try to put it out of sight, not all of them care enough.  I think people who wait around and take something that you have worked and paid for are just scum.57174589Flag this commentdanta said on December 10, 2010 at 6:31 PMEven out in the sticks where you have to drive onto someone property a quarter  mile to get to the house, theft does happen. As stated before, crime of opportunity.  Now, there is a much greater risk of not making it off the p[roperty alive out here and if you have a good set of neighbors, most theft becomes a really final thing.  I was going to say something on the illegality of boobytraps, but madash has the best solution short of a 12 gauge. I now have a use for those red wasps.  Anyone want a nest of them free?  Yours for the taking but it's self serve.57165122Flag this commentlovelylala said on December 10, 2010 at 5:43 PMThis is terrible, I can't stand a thief! I hope things get better for this family. To anyone who wants to come on my property and take something of mines, I have a gun and i'm not afraid to use it.57163222Flag this commentcandee75 said on December 10, 2010 at 3:59 PMI am not sure where the one commenter who said they live in a nice neighborhood and this wont happen to them. I am the person this happened too and did the interview. I DO NOT live in a BAD neighborhood for this to happen. This can happen to anyone. I have been depressed over this happening since this morning. It is not about the money we lost (not getting anywhere w/ ups on getting $ back) it is about the x-mas spirit. Mine is lost and I am praying for a miracle to bring it back. I did 2 news interviews about this and then just seeing the youtube and knowing this really happened has so affected me. I know this sounds bad... cuz I am grateful we have him on camera.. but still kind of wish we just knew it was delivered and not have a face to put with whom did it. This thiefs face is something I will never for57158239Flag this commentrjs123 said on December 10, 2010 at 12:39 PMmadash, i like it.57146802Flag this commentkkaggie said on December 10, 2010 at 12:21 PM@planogirl, it might not work for some of the "smarter" criminals, but it sure would for the lazy ones.  And most of them are. They won't even bother getting out of the car to "hunt" for packages. By having a package in plain sight, it becomes a crime of opportunity.  It never hurts to be proactive, and a cheap pot and plant from Garden Ridge is alot less expensive than installing cameras around your property.  What I am saying is, don't make things easier for them.  The signature delivery is great, but if you are single and work away from home, who is going to sign for you? I have that problem with a wine club. I have it sent to my parents house instead as they are always at home.  You could have packages delivered to your place of business, but that has disadvantages too: what if they deliver on Saturday?  and who wants the whole office to know where and what you're ordering? And then have to cart it 4 blocks to where you are parked?57145734Flag this commentmadash said on December 10, 2010 at 11:34 AMBees, hornets, scorpions hey just mother nature in a box! Bet they wouldn't be hard to find! Ran into the light pole or something down the street. They could even get free medical treatment in Jail! No return adress on the box must have been one of my that enemies sent it to me, glad you opened for me, Thanks, you can keep it!57142879Flag this commentplanogirl said on December 10, 2010 at 11:26 AMkkaggie,  I don't think hiding packages works.  I once lived in a small town where packages were being stolen like that in the best neighborhoods off the front porches, and once the thieves were caught, they admitted they not only targeted the better neighborhoods because they believed the delivered goods would be more expensive, but they followed the UPS trucks and watched them put packages on the porches.  Maybe cameras ought to be installed on the trucks to film the front and rear once they turn onto residential streets so they can photograph vehicles that park down the street and wait for the packages to be dropped off.57142361Flag this commentrjs123 said on December 10, 2010 at 11:07 AMmakes me want to set out dummy packages that when the theif opens them up something not very nice will happen to them.  kinda like the explading ink pak money the banks use but maybe even more extreme.  but atlas then the theif would want to sue me for harming him.57141243Flag this commentkkaggie said on December 10, 2010 at 11:01 AM@bro77dog, I really don't think where you live matters. Actually, I would think crooks like this would target nicer neighborhoods, more expensive goodies.  I do alot of online ordering, and as of yet have had nothing stolen.  The UPS and postal carriers usually try to "hide" the packages as best they can. I am lucky, I have a gated front porch, and they usually leave them inside the gate, so they are not visible from the street. I would suggest that if you have an open porch, maybe place a large potted plant, decoration, whatever, so that packages can be placed behind them!57140818Flag this commentfa75023 said on December 10, 2010 at 10:59 AMTime to start shooting anyone walking up to your door.57140704Flag this commenttheantitipper said on December 10, 2010 at 10:54 AMThis happens enough that I am baffled by wfaa saying installing cameras is an extreme route. For me the police recognized the guy and he did 4 years. Suddenly the stealing in my neighborhood stopped. So it is not extreme if you can afford the cost, it is a public service.57140304Flag this commentdanta said on December 10, 2010 at 10:08 AMI'm should be amazed that the police haven't caught up to the crooks, but with the amount of crime in and around Dallas, no time for petty thieves. Does anyone know if we can nominate someone to the FBC Dallas Grinch list? I think I found two candidates in this one story with comments.57137114Flag this commentbro77dog said on December 10, 2010 at 9:58 AMI'm thankful I live in a nice neighborhood where I can have the convienence of delivery people leaving packages at my door with no worries.57136419Flag this commentcarrieg said on December 10, 2010 at 8:44 AMSome people are just idiots...

DOPE!!!57124134Flag this commentpaigeburress said on December 10, 2010 at 6:39 AMI'm surprised this kind of thing didn't happen to us last week. We had two boxes ((the same thing, one for me and one for my sister)) on the front porch that were literally lime green and plastered with pictures of the expensive product, with its name in large, bold lettering written several times as well. Not only did it ruin my Christmas surprise ((I came home before my mom did, and she hadn't expected the boxes to look like they came from the store)), but I later realized that it was a recipe for disaster. Anyone driving by with bad intentions would immediately have their attention grabbed by the lime green, and then would be lured in by the expensive items. I live in McKinney, and with people like this roaming around, it makes me more thankful that something like this hasn't happened to us. I feel for the family and hope that the police are able to find these Grinches.57123992Flag this commentdiviners_sage said on December 10, 2010 at 1:08 AMThis guy should be brought around the barn and shot.

We just got lucky to catch them on video. It was not the most fun thing to go through and something I will never forget. Hopefully you don't have it happen to you and someone leave a comment saying you set the whole thing up. I have more things to do then wanting to be on the news ever. I only did the news story to help people avoid this happening to them. My daughter had two of her presents stolen for over $250. My holiday spirit has been ruined by this happening and something I will never forget. Thanks for you sweet thoughts of something that was terrible for my family this year. I hope your x-mas will be better then ours.57117824Flag this commenttracij29 said on December 9, 2010 at 9:28 PMUm, it's a whole lot cheaper to do the Signature Required thing BEFORE you install cameras.  Personally, I think it sounds like a set up for a news story, but that's just me.  What is the deal with people and cameras all over the place?57112084Flag this comment12Next 15 CommentsSign OutProfileMobileRSS FeedsSpecial OffersNewslettersTwitterFacebookCrime VideoArizona congresswoman still sedated after assassin's attack Lawmakers, aides urged to take safety precautions  Funeral for Arlington shooting victim Kimberly Carter Reaction to Rep.
