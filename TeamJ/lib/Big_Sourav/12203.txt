These macros affect how our computer then views the world.  Affirmations are an attempt to change the macros.  For fastest changing of the macros, they need to be written like 100x each day before bedtime so that the new thought process starts to overwrite the old destructive one and being the last thoughts of the day.    By writing it instead of just thinking it, the brain must slow down the thought to the speed of the muscles doing the writing.  At this point, the new macro is also being learned as muscle memory.  Once the new macros of self worth have overwritten the old macros of no self worth, we are now working with a computer that at least believes in itself>>Anonymous10/09/28(Tue)11:14No.66John, this is an interesting way of looking at it. I've always found that things stuck better when you process them in more than one way. I like to work thoughts out on paper. It's fun. It doesn't have to be self worth or anything else, literally I think most ideas and statements that stem from a quick thought need to be processed fully in order to get the most from them. So I get what you mean.Thread 45 hidden.evilgene10/04/30(Fri)22:48No.45[Reply]i see you yourself have an idea what evil is.>>john10/05/01(Sat)07:09No.47No, but where it comes from.  Greed and selfishness of humans create evil. Our apathetic behavior as a society breeds more evil. Accountability of actions is needed, not the God/Devil told me to do it.

I just read Pittsburgh in the 60s and it got me thinking of my own childhood. I was born in 1961 so, since they say we have no real cognizant memory before the age of 5, 1966 and forward are the things I remember. By 1966 the world was already a pretty screwed up place I just didnt know it racial this, war, that, and all the other things adults paid attention to. The worst thing for me was being forced to go outside all summer long because mom had to clean the house. Wow a pretty harsh punishment running and playing with my friends all day only going in for lunch, dinner, and bed time. I had such cruel parents. Then came school probably the first step in the aging process, now all things werent play the world threw some work at me yet not enough to put a real crimp in my life of play. The author mentions watching Three Rivers Stadium being built, I grew up 20 miles south of the city of Chicago and watched a field that stretched probably a mile or so from our little town to the next disappear. Progress was coming, I- 294 had to come through and along with it a HO JO Oasis went over the top of it, up went big brick walls and I could no longer see the town on the other side. But after the walls were built they put in a park with a basketball court that doubled as an ice skating rink in the winter, between the ice skating rink and the hills in the woods I dont think my feet were ever anything but red and cold all winter long. So up to now nothing traumatic childhood innocence still pretty much in tact we still ran and played, could actually garbage pick bicycles and fix them up, roller skates and skate boards had steel wheels, and we were allowed to throw giant darts around the yard. Then it happened first 4 years of school behind me and that sudden urge to grow up. The older kids all smoked and didnt mind sharing their cigarettes with us and there never seemed to be a shortage of parents who wouldnt miss a pack of smokes. And all of the sudden there were these other creatures called girls who turned into magnets from which we seemed unable to free ourselves from. Still having fun at this point no responsibilities school still noMessage too long.

Is it true Hebrew has no swear words?Is it true that Israel became a nation in one day May 14th, 1948. Since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, 700 general assemble resolutions passed nearly 450 of them condemn Israel, non against any Arab country, or any Arab terrorist organization, Out of 190 nations in UN OVER 60% OR ALL GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTIONS REBUKE JUST ONE MEMBER, Israel! Anti-Semitism worldwide has been anticipated. Jerusalem is Israels capital. Is it not true Jerusalem is or has been rebuilt on its own ruins, this has been foretold. Did you know 34 species of raptors(birds of prey)migrate over Israel, and it has been foretold that birds of prey would eat the flesh of the enemy armies that fall in battle against Israel..There are some lessons for all people to learn, in any event we must stay on the side of Israels people , they will learn the real truth as all of us will know real truth soon.

No not that kind, even though considering the amount of mind expanding drugs I did I should have had one of those by now, a flash back to childhood. Being the middle of May it is usually warmer here in Kentucky but last night the temperature was upper 50s to lower 60s and it made me think of the changing of the seasons as a kid. I thought mostly of summer easing into fall and the looming of the school year. Mom getting out the wind breaker, which usually took 30 minutes to find before you could go in at night, playing kick the can or hide and seek like our lives depended on it because time was growing short. Even though I had spent plenty of my summer laying in the shade of  tree with a buddy both us saying hey you wanna and the other saying nahhh, now time was of the essence. Having been born in 61 summer vacation ran from late June until early September, because schools werent air conditioned then, heck most houses werent, so school was out during the hottest months. So as those first cool nights began to show up we all knew that soon freedom would end and we would be trudging off to school once again. So during these last few critical weeks as soon as mothers started calling for their kids come in there was tons of foot stomping and pleading awwww come on ma just another half hour. It was if we all tried to pretend it wasnt happening even though we had all been off to K-Mart or J.C. Pennys for our school clothes and supplies it was all just a bad dream.  And last night as I sat there just staring blankly down the street it seemed to transform into the corner with the street light where the can sat or the person who was it had to count. I could almost see the little 7 and 8 year olds running wildly to duck behind a bush or tree and the one poor slob head against the lamp post counting too 100. I guess these things come with getting older but to me it was a very peaceful experience. We are forced to live in the here and now but a visit to the there and then dont hurt one bit.

I have that end of summer feeling every weekend when I know work is coming in the morning, every week night, when I'm finally unwound and not worried about the day I just had, I'm brushing my teeth getting ready for the next day. Then I find my self staying up later and later just clinging to that feeling. Although maybe I'm just crazy because I remember that feeling every day since I was young.Thread 12 hidden.File126858028627.jpg- (38.71KB, 314x307, P1010006.jpg)What do you think?joe10/03/14(Sun)08:24No.12[Reply]I am really sick of the Obama defenders. Let me say I did vote for Him and would again. Just to keep the Republicans out.Providing we are stuck with the two parties we  have now.I do think we need a Third party though. My vote would then go to the best Candidate.Look this Congressional stalemate is bullshit. We are again supposed to believe that this Health care bill is the best we can hope for. Lies, lies and more lies.What do you think?>>Grin 10/03/22(Mon)10:43No.20The one thing that sticks out in my mind is...that the people running our country have "NO" concept of what it is like to be the middle class man, they have no idea of what it's like to make ends meet...u think if everyone (the 32 million uninsured) pays in say 300.00 a month thats gonna make the insurance companys say 960,000,000 a month?? Sounds like a good way to buy a secound term...>>friendshipgene10/06/16(Wed)20:56No.60what do you think, i better not say you will stop loving me, oh wait a minute you have cause of my views, still love you joe have a good life love you man, good luck>>Anonymous10/09/28(Tue)10:50No.61Obama defenders get a bit ridiculous. I think the thing we need to realize is that the Republicans cling to success because they cling to every freakin fringe weirdgroup they find that likes them because of jeebus and death and they cling! While the democrats stay as far away from real progressives as possible. Like here in California, The young democrats group comes out in full support of legalizing the herb, and the old standard democrat group here, says they do not support it. Why the hell now, it's a wedge issue like crazy and they could pick up so many of those weird individual liberty libertarian guys. Oh man it's absurd. So basically it's because democrats don't stand upfor their dyed in the wool progressive backing. They just abandon us for everything from Jesus to business. We don't have aparty, regardless of what about 4 democrats say. We're not going to win unless we organize.Thread 55 hidden.File127458481022.jpg- (1.92KB, 127x85, pipespewing.jpg)Oh sure like I'm Really going to take a picture of my buttBruce Vickers10/05/22(Sat)20:20No.55[Reply]As much as I try I cant keep my mouth shut and today is no exception. I dont watch T.V. especially news, I have CDs in my truck so no radio, and I do not read periodicals because news sucks. But Bruce dont you want to be informed on the issues and whats currently happening in the world? NO I will sum it up BP is currently sending an entire eco system back to the stone ages, we have a Nobel Peace Prize winning president who is sending more people too die, and the same president announced today that he is renaming the Bush boys New World Order something else. People are starving to death while we launch 500k missiles at others, we create more ways to take a life than save one, and some people are happy while others are sad. And you might ask well how do you know any of these things? Because I am too stupid to use Google as my home page so news pops up and I am compelled to read at least some of it, and we got a good one today. Watch the oil spew out of the BP abortion on live camera streamed straight to your pc f*ck me. Kevin Costner says he has a machine that could do XYZ to separate oil from water and some MIT muckity muck starts poking holes in Costners claims. Who cares, if it does  of what Costner says it can send them down there and get them plugged in for the love of all things holy. I am not going back to find this other video clip about some expert on oil clean ups assessment of the situation, quit ass essing it and help fix it. I got a Kenneth Star feeling here a man who spends 700 million dollars to prove a guy got a knobber in the White House, even while people in this country were starving on a daily basis. News should almost be outlawed because we spend far too much money grabbing for the front page when it could certainly be used elsewhere. And one last unrelated thing why does it cost 10s if not 100s of millions of dollars to elect a president when it is usually picking the lesser of 2 evils, if either candidate was worthy why all the money spent? F*ck me some more. Back to cameras showing the oil spewing into the gulf. Help me out because I aint the sharpest knife in the drawer, but we can get cameras in position to watch this thing Message too long.
