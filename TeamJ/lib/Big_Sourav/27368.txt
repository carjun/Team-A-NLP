"You still ain't got a jobAnd I work in a market as a checkout girlI know things will get betterYou'll find work and I'll get promotedWe'll move out of the shelterBuy a big house and live in the suburbsYou got a fast carAnd I got a job that pays all our billsYou stay out drinking late at the barSee more of your friends than you do of your kidsI'd always hoped for betterThought maybe together you and me would find itI got no plans I ain't going nowhere"And "Amazing Grace" was written by the ex-captain of a slaving ship who had a revelation during a storm that black people were God's children too and immediately became an abolitionist... not sure what he'd make of today's conservatives.

William Blake's text Jerusalem, with its reference to the peculiarEnglish folk-story that Jesus the Nazarene visited England, its Luddite complaint against the Industrial Revolution, and its utopian cry to take up arms to build Jerusalem anew in England. Blake, who scandalized everyone! whose executors destroyed most of his plates, so that no one could be offended by his sexual notions! A poem that would best be read as a call to revolution -- except that after a century of neglect it was suddenly put to use to support the war effort in 1916 And did those feet, in ancient time, walk upon Englands mountains green. And was the holy Lamb of God on England's pleasant pastures seen!And did the Countenance Divine shine forth upon our clouded hills?And was Jerusalem builded here among these dark Satanic Mills?Bring me my Bow of burning gold. Bring me my Arrows of desire.Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold! Bring me my Chariot of fire!I will not cease from Mental Fight, nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand,Till we have built Jerusalem in England's green & pleasant Landhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKaJ4b0XYmI Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topstruggle4progress      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 01:38 PMResponse to Reply #1718.LOL! Armstrong's Go down, Moses! A song that remembers a very ancient storyof a slave revolt, the song itself the product of slaves in the American South, reworked as jazz, that Jim Crow era innovation!Nothing here is conservative: the ancient tale rebels against the status quo, the spiritual rebels against American slavery and threatens violent revolt against the ruling class ("Thus spoke the Lord," bold Moses said: "Let my people go! If not I'll smite, your firstborns dead!  ), Armstrong's confident jazz rebels against the more plaintive traditional tunehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP5EfwBWgg0  Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topdawg      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 04:50 PMResponse to Original message20.You know what really pisses me off ...Those idiots think that any song that is pro-marriage or pro-God or pro-country is "conservative".  Morons.Where's your hit songs about lowering the capital gains tax?  The ones that glorify greed?  (Well, Rush might have written one or two of those way back when, before Neil saw the light.)Many, if not most, of those songs were written by honest-to-god liberals.  Are they so stupid they don't realize that?  Some of those choices ..... just ......damn!BTW, it's obvious that whoever made that list is a prog fan.  Well, good for him for that.  But the bizarre attempts to interpret a song like "No Son of Mine" by Genesis as a conservative anthem just boggles the mine.  What's conservative about it?  The abusive home situation?... the singers decision to leave? .... or the asshole father's refusal to be open to an attempted reconciliation years down the road?  Come to think of it, maybe it does define conservatism.I'm with the other poster.

And as another poster said up above, they don't get the arts at all.Ever listen to a conservative comedian? They're awful and not funny. And not because of the material - it's because they don't how to construct a joke or a thought in a thoughtful, funny, or interesting way.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcherish44      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 07:05 PMResponse to Original message25.The Clash were MarxistsI read that somewhere :pPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopRabrrrrrr      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 07:10 PMResponse to Original message26."You can't hurry love" is about abstinence?

Most famously, the Pretenders "My City Was Gone" having been co-opted by Rush Limbaugh, much to the chagrin of Chrissy Hynde.The irony is, I think they "loop" short segments of these songs and avoid paying royalties because of some loophole in the broadcast license laws.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcemaphonic      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 12:50 AMResponse to Original message30.Ah, there's Taxman - it always shows up on these lists.Thing is, the "1 for you, 19 for me" line wasn't hyperbole.
