He has written, co-written and produced many of pop's best selling songs.  You may be like many of us who didn't know that some of the quintessential mega-hit songs performed by Britney Spears, N'SYNC, Back Street Boys, Celine Dion, Bon Jovi, Kelly Clarkson, Jessica Folcker, Pink, Katy Perry, Usher, Ke$ha, Leona Lewis and many others all have one person in common with their success, Martin Karl Sandburg, known professionally by his name, Max Martin. (Britney's new single will debut on 1-11-11. Get ready for another Martin/Dr. Luke monster hit. The Pop Princess is back!) Max MartinMax Martin, Denniz PoP and Cherion RecordsBorn in Stockholm, Sweden, Martin has been pumping out some of our favorite club songs since the mid- nineties.  He had his own band, It's Alive, playing glam-metal during the late-eighties/early nineties.  The band was signed to Cherion Records, an affiliate of BMG,  by Denniz PoP.  While their second album didn't make the sales they expected, PoP saw Martin's talent for songwriting and brougt him into the studio to start learning the basics of producing music.  Leaving It's Alive in 1995, he started collaborating with PoP.  They both worked on the second album by Ace of Base, Bridges, which has sold more than six million copies worldwide.  It's easy to say that since those early days of working with Denniz PoP, the road was paved for Max Martin to rise to the top with his songwriting skills and his ability to know the magic formula to make a song a hit.  In the mid 90's they were working with the Back Street Boys, who made it big in Europe before returning to the United States with some of their biggest hits, including, I Want It That Way.  Denniz PoP died of cancer in 1998 and Martin took over as head of Cherion Studios and started working with the writer/producer, Rami Yacoub. Let's take a look at some of his work since 1998-99, which were big years for him, working with the Back Street Boys and Britney Spears.  As Simon Cowell has said, "If you've got Max Martin as your writer, you have a better chance of having a worldwide hit than with anyone else."  So grab your headphones and listen to all that's going on in these songs.

Martin co-wrote and co-produced 7 out of 12 songs on MillenniumMax Martin and Maratone- Mega SuccessMartin started up a new production company in Jan. of 2001 with his partner Tom Taloma. Cherion Studios was closed and a new beginning was necessary to continue expanding and experimenting with new sounds. The new company is now Maratone still based in Sweden. The artists come to him. He spends time with the artists, getting a feel for what they're like, what music they listen to in order to capture the chemistry needed to make it their song. Martin has stated; "I want the input because that makes the chemistry of the song." Every song should get people moving, anyone, every kind of person, the woman at the cash register, the truck driver, the couple on the dance floor. It's impossible not to move when you hear his music!Kelly Clarkson MusicBreakawayAmazon Price: $5.00List Price: $9.99Behind These Hazel EyesAmazon Price: $1.29My DecemberAmazon Price: $9.99Since U Been Gone- Kelly Clarksonreleased Dec. 2004written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwalda song about feeling alive again after a failed relationshipEuroPop funk beat hit #1 for 2 weeksremained in the top 10 for 20 weeks in the USClarkson won a Grammy Award in 2006 for Best Female Pop Vocal PerformanceClarkson's biggest hit Pink MusicSo What (Explicit)Amazon Price: $1.29I'm Not DeadAmazon Price: $6.30List Price: $9.99FunhouseAmazon Price: $9.46List Price: $13.96So What- Pinkreleased Aug. 2008written by Max Martin, Pink, Shellback; produced by MartinPink's first #1 in USreached #1 in 25 countries#1 Adult Top 40 & Hot Dance Airplay in US4X Platinum worldwide selling over 8,500,00 digital downloads/singlesUsher MusicDJ Got Us Fallin' In LoveAmazon Price: $1.29VersusAmazon Price: $5.95List Price: $9.98Here I StandAmazon Price: $1.48List Price: $9.98DJ Got Us Fallin In Love- Usherreleased June 2010written by Max Martin, Shellback, Kotecha, Pitbull; produced by Martin, Shellbacksynthpop, europop club song; 120 beats per minute/metronome  (highly danceable!)reached Top Ten on 19 charts worldwideone of Usher's most successful singles#4 Billboard Hot 10Max Martin's Awards Swedish Grammis Award in 1998 ASCAP's Songwriter of the Year in 1999 ASCAP's Songwriter of the Year in 2000 ASCAP's Songwriter of the Year in 2001Martin is the first songwriter to receive this prestigious award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers three years in a row.My advice to upcoming talent in this business is "work harder than everyone else."  MartinHold It Against Me- Britney Spears Newest SingleGet Ready for the Tuesday, January 11 release of Britney Spear's newest single, Hold It Against Me, produced by Max Martin and Dr. Luke.  The album has a March, 2011 release date! Martin and Pop Music-  #1 HitmakerRani Hancock of RCA Records said, "He has an amazing sense of lyric and melody and he always comes up with these brilliant lyric concepts that are not only hits, but are very identifiable."  Louis Walsh is quoted as saying, "his songs are worldwide pop monsters".  And they are.  Few people realize how much of today's pop music is written and produced by this Swedish hitmaker.  We identify this music with the artists who perform it so well, but behind these mega hits is a genius who wants every part of the song perfect.  Listen with a new ear if this is your first introduction to Max Martin, the pop music hitmaker.  Max Martin fans,  thanks for reading.   "I don't consider myself a poet, I just write what I feel."

I'm a musician myself, so its always good to read of the success of guys like this.  I first started hearing his name a couple years ago with N*Sync and Britney.Twilight Lawns4 weeks ago I have just read the hub and was impressed by the way it was written and the information presented so clearly.  Not being into pop music at all, I was nonetheless inspired to click on each available like to YouTube.  Horrors! Because of copyright limitations, I am not permitted to watch even one.  But you hub has encouraged me to "improve my education".  Thanks.rebekahELLE4 weeks ago Thanks for reading therepublicoflife. I think musicians and songwriters can easily see his talent and the sense of energy in his songs. I think there are a lot of closet pop music lovers, not ready to admit that this is decent music, but it is. good luck with your music! I have two musician sons, so music is very much a part of our lives. I can't imagine life without music.Twilight, I was hoping the copyright limitation wouldn't happen outside of the US! I may have to find some alternative videos. I picked these particular songs to show some of his best hits, and yet all with a different twist. But I think within these songs, they're easily identifiable as his work. His work with melody and different sounds, layering the vocals are all part of what makes his music so popular. thanks for reading!rebekahELLE4 weeks ago twilight, I'm inserting more links in the same order as above, hoping these may work for you and others.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCMzBH0or4Ihttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbGdK6EOJqYhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdBoUlBo_6khttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6atHxFCtEhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qydp6OIIAcwlet me know is these work for you.Pamela994 weeks ago Great hub.  It is always nice to read about success.  You did a great job with the videos and information as the hub looked great.  Thanks for the information.kozmicbluej4 weeks ago Must be something about being Swedish and being able to write pop songs, ABBA seemed to manage a couple...!rebekahELLE4 weeks ago thanks Pamela for reading and leaving a comment. I chose those particular videos because they're the official music video for the song. Martin does the writing/producing of the actual song. He has nothing to do with the video production. Happy you enjoyed the hub!@kozmic, I think you're right. If you do a bit of googling Swedish producers, there's a lot going on over there. ABBA did write a number of great songs.thanks for coming by and leaving a comment.prasetio304 weeks ago My friend, I never knew about Max Martin. But after read this hub, I thought he is very famous singer and very talented too. Thanks for share about him. I'll search more about his album. Thank you very much. Take care!Prasetio:)rebekahELLE4 weeks ago yes, he was the singer/frontman for It's Alive, a Swedish band from the late 80's/90's. He went by the name of Martin White in the band. Earthquake Visions is the name of their second album which was released from the Cherion Studio label in 1993. He then began working for the Cherion with Denniz Pop. Now he produces all of the above artists and many more. Thanks for stopping by, always nice to see you.cookingdiva4 weeks ago rebekahElle,I knew these songs but I did not know much about Max martin, so thanks for the knowledge!
