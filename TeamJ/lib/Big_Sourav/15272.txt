Weight Management  The Monster Called Fat    Los Angeles :  CA :  USA|Jan 07, 2011By Frank Amptmeijer        4 0     Views: 240      We are all aware that too much fat will lead to all sorts of diseases; however we are ignorant about the facts. Most people have tried to do something about their ever increasing fat mass, but after a few weeks give up as results are not visible or fast enough. Weight management is not a two week or two month program, weight management is a life time program and requires commitment. Weight management is body maintenance, just like brushing teeth or washing armpits it needs to be done every day. One weight management is understood through a little education, it is easy and it becomes a natural process, , just like brushing teeth or washing armpits. Fat is the problem. For most of us, fat is not a problem in our early teens; however it starts to become a problem once the twenties are reached. The reason why is simple, the body is by its twenties fully grown, and on its way to decay. Most people live active lives in their childhood and teens. Activity equals burning fats. The more active we are, the more able we are to build and maintain our muscle mass, and the muscle mass is the one controlling our fat mass. Only a healthy active muscle mass is able to burn fat. Water can not burn fat, bones can not burn fat, organs can not burn fat and fat can not burn fat. Only Muscle mass can reduce the amount of fat mass. A decaying muscle mass happens to all of us the older we get. The older we get, the less active we get, with this our muscle mass is decaying fast and the muscle mass is unable to keep up with the ever growing fat mass. The fat now turns into a monster that is hard to fight. The reason why is because we focus on the wrong thing. We focus on reducing fat and weight, rather then focusing on activating and building a strong healthy muscle mass, which at a later state will reduce the fat mass. And will leave us with a lean body. The power of proteins is what can safe us from greater harm. The solution is to break the cycle of increasing fat mass. Fat comes from the amount of sugars or carbohydrates we eat. And looking at our daily food, there are way to many carbohydrates available. Now if we reduce the amount of carbohydrates, what do we eat then? Our body requires a good amount of fuel to get us through the day. The answer is proteins, the positives about proteins is that they are low in calories and high in energy plus the feed and build the muscle mass. By eating more proteins in our diets we are able to increase the amount of muscle mass and with that reduce the amount of fat mass.  The good news is fat can be reduced. If fat can be gained, it also can be reduced, but give it time. Increasing happens over time, reductions takes the same time or even more. Most people gain weight over a ten year time frame and want to reduce it in four weeks. That is not really realistic. The monster called fat can be fought when we break the sugar (carbohydrates) cycle and make clear choices to increase the amount of proteins in our diets.        1 of 3         Most people struggle with an ever increasing fat mass and with that an increasing weight problem. Learn how you can make a change by fighting the monster called fat.
