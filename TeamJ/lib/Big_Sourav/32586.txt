Who is watching MSNBC?  Sherrif Clarence Dupnik (my hero!)Edited on Sat Jan-08-11 08:32 PM by vaberellaWow.  Wow..  Who is watching MSNBC?  The Sherrif is really suggesting that the teapartiers are causing problems.  He says..."People who are mentally ill are particularly susceptible to political vitriol in which people are talking about tearing down the government." All words in bold are the words he used.  I just stayed as close to the direct quote as possible with the key words.  So along with Bob Franken and Ed Schultz show we know that the media, or at least MSNBC is definitely pushing the real story. We've got people instigating violence with their bullshit making the political environment not only something, we've come to know to be volatile and counterproductive, but to be out right dangerous and deadly.---The Sherrif also suggests that the gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, was not working alone.  Although the sherrif is not going into those details.  He did say though that the other man is around in his 50s and is also a white male.  This is the Sherrif that spoke directly to MSNBC.  Because he suggested this viewpoint on the phone earlier today with MSNBC's anchor.   He's the man who assured us that NPR---With their shit news---was mistaken and that Congresswoman Grifford was alive. His quote on MSNBC is that "Arizona has become a mecca for prejudice and bigotry." There is a lot going on here.   And it seems more and more even by the Sherrif's statements that they know or at least suspect that this may be related to the political vitriol---despite some of MSNBC reporters to suggest otherwise or dispel that factor.  The sherrif seems to be saying otherwise.

I'm grateful that he IS calling it instead of waffling.When people like Beck and Palin and many of the other well-paid loud mouth of the right-wing suggest that Democrats hate the country or that we need to reload, mentally unstable aren't necessarily going to "get" the whole metaphor thing.

An Arizona sheriff says authorities are investigating a suspicious package sent to the headquarters of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was wounded in a shooting rampage.Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik gave few other details about the possible package, which he says was found after the attack on Giffords at the parking lot of a Tucson, Ariz., supermarket.No other details were available.Giffords was holding a forum for constituents when the violence erupted Saturday, killing six and wounding several others, including Giffords.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topvaberella      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 09:07 PMResponse to Reply #2125.I remember this statement.

What has passed for "talk" has become a stream of hate all over the media, an indecent forum where violence is encouraged and law and order are mocked.Talk America DOES NOT REPRESENT America! It appeals to the lowest common denominator, the warped and the delusional. It's looooong past time to hold TalkAmerica in all its vile configurations accountable.Props to the sheriffPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topglinda      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 02:27 AMResponse to Original message36.He is amazing.
