As his sister's casket was wheeled into the church, Dallas Green looked up at the cloudless sky. His eyes filled with the sight of the huge American flag dangling above.It had flown over the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, the day Christina-Taylor Green was born. Now the 20-by-30-foot patched-up flag was flying over her hearse, strung between the ladders of two fire trucks.It seemed the whole world was mourning Dallas' sister, the youngest victim of last Saturday's shooting rampage. The funeral cortege had passed hundreds of people lining the dusty road to the church. They silently clutched roses, Kleenex and crosses.At a memorial service the night before, 20,000 people rose to their feet when President Obama said he wants America to be as good as Christina imagined it to be. Her birth on 9-11 made her a face of hope. Her death made her the face of ... you name it.Christina had become the youngest symbol for hope, gun control, civility, Palin bashing, baseball dreams. You had to wonder what was going through Dallas' 11-year-old mind as he walked behind the little red oak casket.Forget the symbolism, all he knew was his little sister had an omelet for breakfast last Saturday and took off with a neighbor. Christina had just been elected to student council. She wanted to meet Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and ask about government. Then she was hit in the chest by a 22-cent bullet and was dead before her family got to the hospital.Who wouldn't be touched by that? Every child is special, but Christina left a trail of joy and amazement. Who wouldn't ask why this little girl's life had to end?"These things I do not know," John Green said as he eulogized his daughter. "But I do know I love you."Green is a Dodgers scout. Christina's grandfather, Dallas, was one of the more notable managers of the past 30 years. He guided the Phillies to the 1980 World Series championship, doing it with his famously confrontational style."I'm a screamer, a cusser and a yeller," he once said. "I never hold back."The 76-year-old was easy to spot Thursday. Still a sturdy 6-foot-5 with white hair, Green gingerly followed his namesake grandson into the church. He did a better job of holding back the tears than his wife, Sylvia.St. Elizabeth Ann Seton church was packed with friends, family and baseball power brokers. In the reception hall, TVs showed photographs of Christina.She was in a pink tutu, doing a ballerina's pirouette ... goofing around with an orange slice in her mouth ... hunting Easter eggs ... making cookies with her grandmother ... waving an American flag, her little arms struggling to hold it up.Christina had learned what her birthday signified. She was born at 12:53 p.m., just four hours after the first hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center. The juxtaposition of new life on such a deadly day inspired the book, "Faces of Hope: Babies Born on 9-11."One child from each of the 50 states appeared in the book. Their baby photos were accompanied by a message."I hope you help those in need. I hope you see rainbows," Christina's page read. "I hope you know all the words to the national anthem and sing it with your hand over your heart. I hope you jump in rain puddles."Christina did all that. The pictures Tuesday showed her riding a pony ... frolicking in waves ... wearing a Santa hat ... hugging her granddad, whose face beamed as if he'd just won another World Series.Christina wanted to become the first female in the major leagues. Given her genes and her gumption, it didn't seem all that silly.She was the only girl on her Little League team. She played a mean second base and was among the team leaders in RBI. Playing against boys never fazed her, though it might have bugged a few of the guys.In one at-bat last season she fouled off six or seven pitches. The exasperated pitcher finally plunked her with a throw. In her league, players can choose whether to take first base or continue hitting. Christina dusted herself off."I want to hit," she said.The next pitch was turned into a line drive.The TV showed a picture of her holding that aluminum bat ... running with her brother ... opening birthday presents ... dressing up as a cheerleader for Halloween.In every shot, her big brown eyes looked right into the camera. She really did look full of joy and life and potential. Then a poem appeared on the TV."If every tear we shed for you became a star above, you'd stroll in an Angel's garden lit by everlasting love."In the main sanctuary, Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas tried to explain the unexplainable to the family. There is sadness and despair, but there is hope they'll see Christina again.A bagpipe played "Amazing Grace" as the casket was wheeled back out toward the big American flag. Six pallbearers helped push it along. Christina's brother was one of them.Maybe he was just numb or overwhelmed or simply out of tears. But like the older Dallas, his little namesake managed to keep his composure. Most other family members weren't as stoic.To them, Christina wasn't just a face of hope or a rallying point. She was the little girl in all those pictures, and there will never be any more.Heaven must have needed a really special second baseman.Read More:  arizona+shooting, arizona+shooting+memorial, arizona+shooting+victims, arizona+shootings, christina+taylor+green, christina+taylor+green+dallas+green, dallas+green13CommentsSay Something  Email ThisFanHouse's Most Shared Spike TVFanHouse Writer Makes Acting Debut in 'Blue Mountain State'George Karl Thinks 'Melo Trade Could Fall ThroughNFL Picks, Divisional Round: Put Up or Shut UpOutside the 'HouseAPNFL Divisional Playoffs Breakdowns -- SI.comJay Cutler Misunderstood by the Media -- FanNationOklahoma Tops Early Look at 2011 College Football Top 25 -- SI.comMLB Hall of Famer Hospitalized -- Huffington PostTop 25 Ill-Advised Sports Promotions -- Bleacher ReportKyle Singler Demonstrates Perfect Duke Flop -- YardbarkerComments (Page 1 of 1)daytimedaddo 1-13-2011 10:40PMthis is a tragedy..i would hope,by the grace of god,this child has entered into the kingdom.....sadly,i wonder if mr whitley would even care,if this child wasnt dallas greens grandbaby...    replyGabe Clark 1-14-2011 8:49AMThat is a disgusting comment, daytimedaddo. Why would you even wonder something like that about the writer of this column? You need to get your heart in the right place because clearly it isn't there at present.NolesFan79 1-14-2011 9:34AMdaytimedaddo, what does your ugly comment about wondering whether or not the writer of this column would care if this wasn't Dallas Green's granddaughter have to do with anything? What a disgusting comment. Perhaps you should be asking yourself whether or not YOU would care if this was not Dallas Green's granddaughter. I know that it's easy to make asinine comments on these sites, but for God's sake, try to have some basis for what you stupidly write. Oh, and learn how to use commas correctly.jdschan 1-15-2011 2:11PMExactly!!!  I couldn't have said it better!  This writer is a dirtbag!  Gives the title of the Grandpa, then confusingly talks about the brother, Dallas.  Christina has an incredible story to tell in her short life.  Let's hope better writers do it in the future.  May God bless her family!Lakergregg 1-13-2011 11:08PMLike most others I never met her, but I'll never forget her or her family.    replyRob 1-14-2011 1:51PM"To them, Christina wasn't just a face of hope or a rallying point. She was the little girl in all those pictures, and there will never be any more."So true, so well-said.  My heart breaks for the family...rest in peace, Christina...sounds like you loved life.    replyuga98rg 1-15-2011 12:53PMGun Control, Palin bashing? Why does the writer choose to get political? Shame on this idiot for using the death of a precious child to expoit his foolishness.    replyMannyUF96 1-15-2011 6:52PMuga98rg...clearly you either did not read Whitley's column OR you don't understand it. I'm betting it's the latter. He did not "get political". He was simply pointing out how other people have used this child's death to make their own political points. Idiots like you need to lay off the keyboard.GRAMMY VERNA 1-15-2011 1:43PMGOD'S BLESSINGS TO THE CHRISTINA GREEN'S FAMILY.

WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOUR BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER AND SISTER.  MAY GOD WATCH OVER EACH OF YOU AND COMFORT YOU ALWAYS AND FOREVER.  LOVE AND PRAYERS,  VERNA AND HAROLD J.

We will all of  her family in our prayers...and may God Bless you and help you through this absolutely unbearable time...Our hearts ache for all of you.   Sincerely, Bob and Jonie Adams    replykmchafin 1-15-2011 5:13PMI would hope that out of this tragedy, we would recognize the lives and importance of all children in our country.  Too many children are dying here from abuse, neglect and sheer violence.  Their little lives are forgotten too soon.Perhaps Christina has a new community to fight for now, and perhaps she can be the voice for ALL the children who die from violence.  They all had lives full of promise ended far too soon.  Prayers to the family.    replyavtougaloo 1-15-2011 8:32PMI noticed that Christ is the beginning part of  Christina's first name. Her birth date shows God's use of her for his  good purpose. Since her death she has already saved another child's life. Her family will continue to share her Christ like contributions to mankind.
