Mushroom (Talk) 21:20, 26 February 2009 (UTC)[edit] April 2009 Welcome to Wikipedia. The recent edit you made to the page Current members of the United States House of Representatives has been reverted, as it appears to be unconstructive. Use the sandbox for testing; if you believe the edit was constructive, please ensure that you provide an informative edit summary. You may also wish to read the introduction to editing. Thank you. Ono (talk) 23:22, 29 April 2009 (UTC)Aung_san_suu_kyi page has had vandalism reverted. Please can you check and reapply your updates. Ablonus (talk) 18:19, 4 June 2009 (UTC)[edit] ReignHello, Tktru! Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange, does not reign as Prince of Orange. Orange is not an independent country, so nobody can reign as Prince of Orange. Same for Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and the others. Please don't make infoboxes misleading. Surtsicna (talk) 13:48, 7 June 2009 (UTC)[edit] United States order of precedenceI've backed out your change on United States order of precedence, which you made in the mistaken impression that you were reverting vandalism (rvv). Please read the discussion page to understand the change before reverting in the future. The order of precedence does indeed include foreign heads of state and royalty. (If the president, the Queen of England and the vice president are attending a diplomatic event in the US, they will follow one another in that order.) Thanks, Celestra (talk) 21:40, 11 July 2009 (UTC)[edit] Order of Precedence of the United States of AmericaThanks for correcting my mistake. Celestra (talk) 00:42, 20 July 2009 (UTC)[edit] Joe BidenWould you mind looking at this and sharing your thoughts? The idea is to move the presidential line of succession away from the order of precedence and to correct the order to include the foreign heads of state without too much change. Thanks, Celestra (talk) 01:08, 20 July 2009 (UTC)[edit] Vajiralongkorn, Crown Prince of ThailandI had to revert a change you made on 'May 28, 2009'. The crown prince doesn't reign, only the 'King of Thailand' reigns. GoodDay (talk) 18:51, 24 August 2009 (UTC)[edit] edit summaryHello. Please don't forget to provide an edit summary. Thanks, and happy editing.--74.14.19.4 (talk) 06:01, 26 August 2009 (UTC)[edit] United States Senate elections, 2010Regarding your edit marking Kennedy's seat as "safe democratic": Wikipedia only allows those kinds of statements if there is reliable sources saying that. BrianY (talk) 23:42, 26 August 2009 (UTC)[edit] October 2009 Please refrain from making unconstructive edits to Wikipedia, as you did to War in Afghanistan (2001present). Your edits appear to constitute vandalism and have been reverted. If you would like to experiment, please use the sandbox. Thank you. Stifle (talk) 21:20, 8 October 2009 (UTC) Thank you for your contributions to Wikipedia. When you make a change to an article, please provide an edit summary for your edits. Doing so helps everyone to understand the intention of your edit and is especially useful when reading the edit history of the page. Thank you. Timmeh 21:13, 15 October 2009 (UTC) Please refrain from making unconstructive edits to Wikipedia, as you did to Kenneth McClintock. Before removing an image discuss the situation and your concerns in the article's talk page. Your edits have been reverted. If you would like to experiment, please use the sandbox. Thank you. Tony the Marine (talk) 08:04, 16 October 2009 (UTC)[edit] Mark Sanford on 2012 Republican Primary Page?I think the Sanford debate will never end, lol. I have 3 sources that are still discussing Mark Sanford in conjunction to 2012 that are less than 6 months old, but JerzeyKydd is still insisting that discussion for him has ceased for 6 months. The sources I added are less than 6 months. I agreed to take down Ensign because no one is talking him in conjunction 2012, but why are people still talking about Sanford in conjunction 2012? I was wondering if maybe you wanted to add your feedback to this discussion http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Republican_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_2012. Thanks. --Diamond Dave (talk) 22:14, 25 October 2009 (UTC)[edit] NowCommons: File:Judy Chu Official Portrait.jpgFile:Judy Chu Official Portrait.jpg is now available on Wikimedia Commons as Commons:File:Judy Chu official portrait.jpg.

Please discuss in future first before moving these, thank you. Gryffindor (talk) 12:58, 13 November 2009 (UTC)[edit] Shi MingyiHi there, I removed your recent edits you made to Shi Mingyi as the references you quoted do not mention the points you made. Also to note is that the info is being repeated in the article, when one singular mention would have sufficed. We have to be careful with articles regarding biographies of living persons. If you do find a reliable reference which includes those points do feel to ad the point back in, thanks. Zhanzhao (talk) 04:23, 18 November 2009 (UTC)[edit] Tournament of RosesWellington Chen is not the president of the Tournament of Roses. He is the president of the foundation, which is the charity arm of the Tournament of Roses Association. Jeffrey Throop, acting president of the Tournament of Roses, will become the president for 2010-11 on the third week of January. Bband11th (talk) 02:58, 28 November 2009 (UTC)[edit] Coat of ArmsHello there Tktru! Pardon my ignorance in the matter, but regarding the use of the coat-of-arms in Sebastian Pinera's page, is it improper to use on President-elects? I googled and see it varies from country to country. Do you have any formal references you can share with me that will state the guidelines clearly? I would appreciate it!:) --Neon Sky (talk) 18:31, 19 January 2010 (UTC)[edit] Edits to Jill Biden and Michelle ObamaI'm not sure what you're trying to do with the whole "royalty and heads of state" thing, but propose major changes like that on the talk page first in a case where there is no precedent (that I know of) for making such changes.

Courcelles (talk) 17:52, 18 June 2010 (UTC)[edit] Wow, how long was that there..Looking at this edit, Kevin Rudd was appointed by Michael Jeffrey, who was the Governor-General at the time of the election. That fact doesn't change. Gillard will be appointed by Quentin Bryce, the current Governor-General. Monarch, head of state, head of government, all female. --Pete (talk) 00:53, 24 June 2010 (UTC)[edit] King Pu-tsungHi!

ForeverDusk (talk) 05:19, 14 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] Order of PrecedenceHi. I just noticed your change at Joe Biden and I wanted to catch you before you went elsewhere. The next person after the VP would be the governor of the state in which the event was held. That is a single person and that single person is on no particular order.:) Later in the order of precedence are the governors of the other states in the order in which they joined the union. Regards, Celestra (talk) 22:14, 20 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] Orphaned non-free image File:CueCardForConan.pngThanks for uploading File:CueCardForConan.png.

DASHBot (talk) 05:56, 30 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] By order of statehoodHi. I thought I had been clear before, but I must not have been. The order of precedence applies to events, so it varies by the location of the event. The person who follows the VP in the order of precedence is the Governor of the state in which the event is held. That is an individual. An individual can not be in any order as there is no one else with whom to be ordered. Please undo your changes which add an order to this individual. Thanks, Celestra (talk) 00:38, 2 October 2010 (UTC)Hi. You've edited since my previous post, so I assume you read it. It has been two weeks since I commented on your change to Joe Biden and you have neither corrected it nor offered any reason for keeping that content. If you aren't going to correct this, I'll have to correct it myself. Thanks, Celestra (talk) 16:03, 2 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] InfoboxesHello. Just so you know, the best way to produce the Senate sections in infoboxes is|jr/sr=  [anything can be written, but there must be something)|state=XThat way, changes meant to be applied to all US senator articles from the template. -Rrius (talk) 06:23, 3 November 2010 (UTC)[edit] Edit summaries Thank you for your contributions to Wikipedia.
