A dumping of up to 20 inches had been forecast for Philadelphia, where the Eagles-Vikings NFL game was postponed because of the storm, but by early evening meteorologists said the city would end up getting no more than a foot.More than 1,400 flights had been canceled out of the New York City area's three major airports alone, and more cancellations were expected Monday.For many people, however, the storm's timing was perfect: the day after Christmas, a Sunday, no school for at least a week."Love snowy days when I don't have to go anywhere. Staying in -- just me and my cozy new socks," author Neesha Meminger wrote on Twitter from her home in the Bronx.She told the AP she's able to savor the moment because her children, ages 6 and 9, are on holiday break: "If this was during the school week, I would be cursing."Colleen and Graham James of Montclair, N.J., represented the other side of the coin. They were at Newark Airport with their two young children and their dachshund, trying to reach family in Iowa, but their connecting flight to Chicago was delayed more than two and a half hours."We left the day after Christmas to avoid the Christmas craze. I guess that didn't work out so well," Colleen James said.Graham James was resigning himself to postponing their trip a month. "Now we're worried about just driving home because of the crazy snow," he said.Airlines canceled flights throughout the Northeast and at airports in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago and the Carolinas. They expected more cancellations Monday, but were trying to rebook passengers and hoped to resume normal operations Tuesday.U.S. Airways had already canceled 110 Monday flights by Sunday afternoon -- spokesman Jim Olson said that was to try to keep passengers and crews from getting stranded at airports.New York's Kennedy Airport was calm, apparently because many would-be travelers elected not to trudge to the terminal in hopes of getting rebooked.Andrew Brent's flight to Florida was repeatedly pushed back, and the New York mayoral spokesman thought he might have to wait until Monday to meet up with his wife and son for vacation. But he added, "I'll get down there eventually so I'm not terribly worried."Amtrak, meanwhile, canceled train service from New York to Maine on Sunday evening, after doing the same earlier for several trains in Virginia. Bus companies canceled routes up and down the East Coast, affecting thousands of travelers.Kate Lindquist, on her way home from New Hampshire to New York City, was greeted with a handwritten sign at a Boston bus station: "Sorry, we are closed today.""To have this happen on a Sunday during a holiday weekend is incredibly frustrating," she told the AP in an e-mail.The Northeast received the brunt of the storm. Forecasters issued blizzard warnings for parts of New Jersey and New York City for Sunday and Monday. By Sunday night, 18 inches of snow had fallen in southern New Jersey's Cape May County.Forecasters were expecting 12 to 20 inches in most areas along the Jersey shore by the time the snow stopped.A blizzard warning was also in effect for Rhode Island and most of eastern Massachusetts, where 12 to 16 inches of snow was expected by the time flurries taper off Monday morning, said William Babcock, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass. A blizzard warning is issued when snow is accompanied by sustained winds or gusts over 35 mph.Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter declared a snow emergency and urged residents to stay off the roads.Before any snow actually accumulated in the city, the NFL moved the Philadelphia Eagles' game against the Minnesota Vikings from Sunday night to Tuesday because of "public safety concerns." Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who does football commentaries after Eagles games, was not amused and said fans could have handled it."This is football; football's played in bad weather," Rendell told KYW-TV. "I, for one, was looking forward to sitting in the stands throughout the snow and seeing an old-time football game."In Boston, Mayor Thomas Menino declared a snow emergency that bans parking on all major streets, and the New England Aquarium bubble-wrapped its four 5-foot-tall penguin ice sculptures to protect them from the wind and snow.More than 2,400 sanitation workers were working in 12-hour shifts to clear New York City's 6,000 miles of streets. Not that Mayor Michael Bloomberg wanted people to use them."I understand that a lot of families need to get home after a weekend away, but please don't get on the roads unless you absolutely have to," Bloomberg said.In Rhode Island, emergency officials encouraged businesses to let employees report to work late Monday, saying road conditions for the early morning commute Monday would be treacherous.In southern New Jersey's Philadelphia suburbs, supermarkets were crowded early in the day and there was a run on snow shovels. Stores were quiet by late afternoon -- though there was a line at the Red Box video kiosk outside a Walgreen's store in Cherry Hill.The snow was easier to take for people who just stayed home."Since we've no place to go, I'm gonna uncork a Bordeaux," Paul White said on Twitter from his home in Point Lookout, N.Y. In a phone interview, the lawyer -- who was indeed sipping a glass of red wine -- said the snow gave his family a chance to be together and cozy another day.The weather deterred some people from hitting day-after-Christmas sales, but that appeared to be a relatively light blow for retailers coming off a strong shopping season."People will just wait a day to do exchanges and use their gift cards. It's no big deal," said Greg Maloney, CEO of the retail practice of Jones Lang LaSalle, which manages malls across the country.There were more snow plows than shoppers at Jackson Premium Outlets in Jackson, N.J., but the weather didn't keep Shoba Dorai from making the trip from Edison with a girlfriend and her friend's two toddlers. Several stores closed by 3 p.m."It was not that bad when we left this morning around 10:30," Dorai said. "I guess it was not a great idea, though."The monster storm is the result of a low pressure system off the North Carolina coast and strengthened as it moved northeast, according to the National Weather Service.The storm defied forecasts and largely bypassed Washington, D.C., leaving the National Mall with only a light dusting.Walking with their family toward the Washington Monument, 10-year-old twins Daniel and Gabriel Concha of Aventura, Fla., said were disappointed they didn't get to see snow on their trip. Weather-hardened Northerners and Midwesterners, meanwhile, expressed amusement with all the hubbub over a few flurries.Travel misery began a day earlier in parts of the South, which was hit with a white Christmas for the record books.Columbia, S.C., had its first significant Christmas snow since weather records were first kept in 1887. Atlanta had just over an inch of snow -- the first measurable accumulation on Christmas Day since the 1880s. About a foot of snow fell in Norfolk, Va., the most seen there since a February 1989 storm dumped nearly 15 inches.Utility companies in the Carolinas said more than 100,000 people lost power because of the storm, and only about a third had service restored by midday Sunday.The National Weather Service said 8.5 inches of snow fell in Franklinton, N.C., about 30 miles north of Raleigh, from Saturday through Sunday.Diane Smith, 55, said her power was out for about four hours there Sunday morning, but she and her husband have a generator. Relatives, including two grandchildren, who live nearby came over for breakfast and to get warm before going home after power was restored."It's beautiful," Smith said. "As long as I have power, I love it."Copyright  2011, Los Angeles Times E-mail Print Digg Twitter Facebook Read This LaterComments (15)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQMikeWk at 6:43 PM December 26, 2010                Whether the planet is warming is irrelevant to the need to get off fossil fuels.The economic, geopolitical and environmental benefits will kick in even without a CO2 benefit.

Snow? On the ground? At Christmas? Absolutely unheard of. 5 years ago, I grilled steaks in my shirtsleeves for Christmas, and today I'm snowbound under 14 inches of snow and declining stocks of Sam Adams.This is a pattern that has become more familiar here over the past half decade. Colder in winter. More snow that has fallen in ever increasing accumulations. Additionally, summers are without doubt warmer (4 consecutively hottest summers ever recorded) and more dry each year. Is it Climate Change? I'm not smart enough to know, but I am smart enough to understand the difference between weather amd the potential evidence indicating something is going on.I refuse to descend into the familiar "Red State/Blue State" paradigm argument. But here's the thing: We can't afford to get this wrong. This is the only rock we have to live on, and if we screw it up, then it's a long swim for everybody. Prudence then dictates that we assume that Earth's climate may be changing and accordingly take pro-active steps to insure we have someplace to live.MightyAlweg at 2:38 PM December 26, 2010                I just looked at weather.com... It's now snowing in Charleston, South Carolina this afternoon! I lived in Charleston in the 1990's, and snow is unheard of there, about the same as getting snow in Santa Barbara. It's snowing in Charleston?!? Global Warming!Comments are filtered for language and registration is required. The Times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy.
