Breaking News Facebook Says: "We're Not Shutting Down" Ends Dubious Rumor              Single Ticketing System Proposed for Traffic Violators    Manila :  Philippines|Dec 03, 2010By jpatrick7308        2 0     Views: 60       The Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) welcomed Friday suggestions from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to simplify the processing of traffic violation tickets in the metropolis. MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino has been batting for the use of a single ticketing system for traffic violations made within in Metro Manila and the establishment of a one-stop redemption facility for confiscated drivers licenses. Both LTO Director for Law Enforcement Edgar Cabase and LTFRB Chairman Nelson Laluces concurred with the suggestions of MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino to unify the process of issuing traffic violation citations and centralize the redemption of confiscated licenses, adding that it will benefit both the government and the transacting public. At present, the LTO issues temporary operator's permit (TOP) while the MMDA and traffic enforcers of local government units (LGUs) issue different versions of traffic citation tickets (TCT) to motorists apprehended for traffic violations. The creation of a single-ticketing system for traffic apprehensions is a win-win solution for the LTO, LTFRB, MMDA and the LGUs. The only question is which system will be used, the TOP or the TCT? This matter will definitely be part of further deliberations," Cabase said. For his part, Laluces urged government to implement the single ticketing system for traffic violation at the same time that it will set up the proposed one-stop redemption facility manned by personnel of LTO, LTFRB and the MMDA. The setting up of a one-stop redemption facility is a very good suggestion since it will speed up transactions for redeeming confiscated licenses. It will be better if the two suggestions are implemented all at once, Laluces said. During Friday's Transport and Traffic Summit held at the Philippine Social Science Center in Quezon City, Tolentino also proposed several ammendments to Republic Act 4136, which created the LTO, and Executive 202, which defines the mandate of the LTFRB. Cabase said the agency is concurring with Tolentino's proposal to amend RA 4136 to make it more responsive and attuned to the needs of the current transport and traffic situation in the country. Cabase said the LTO backs Tolentino in proposing Congress to require applicants for student, non-professional, professional driver's license and motorcycle driver's license to attend health and environment seminars and to submit medical examination from physicians accredited by the Department of Health. Tolentino also suggested LTO to criminalize operation of colorum (unauthorized) vehicles and to impose stiffer sanctions against reckless driving, use of mobile phones while driving, overspeeding, illegal parking, and drunk driving. These suggestions will help LTO to issue licenses only to skilled, law-abiding, and medically fit drivers, Cabase said. But unlike Cabase, Laluces was still reserved with Tolentino's suggestion for LTFRB to require public utility franchise applicants to seek clearance from the MMDA and LGUs prior to the issuance of certificate of public convenience. Laluces said the agency remains open for further dialogue on Tolentino's suggestion to appoint the Vice Chairman of the Metro Manila Council as part of the LTFRB for the National Capital Region.        1 of 1         Manila City Hall - Traffic Violations     jpatrick7308 is based in Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (45.5%) Senegal (27.3%) Philippines (12.1%) India (3.0%) 3 other countries (6.1%)           READ MORE: Francis Tolentino, MMDA, traffic violation, LTFRB, Edgar Cabase, Nelson Laluces, single ticketing, political-news, redemption facility, Philippines, stop redemption, manila, LTO   More News From: Manila :  Philippines     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 1            Reply  Posted By     rmang|about 1 monthagoInteresting news.
