The Cavs have lost their last 3 games after cutting the big Z. But really, they can afford to lose 3. They could proabably afford to lose 10 if you want to get cocky! The Cleveland Cavaliers are in position to not only make the playoffs in 2010, but to make something really special happen. But the clock is ticking on the Lebron James show. He's the small town kid that Cleveland welcomed and stamped into their lives. But the Lebron show must go on, and he's ready to take it to the big Broadway stage if the small town can't supply a championship. Tonight Antawn JamisonAntawn Jamison will start along side the greatest player I've ever seen in person. Jamison adds a different element that could work extremely well with Lebrons game. Antawn will become the biceps to James's triceps, and they will muscle their way together into the NBA Finals. Whether the Cavs win it all or not this season will be key to where Lebron signs his next big contract. I wouldn't bet against them though, even if the Lakers return to steal another one from the Ohio King. This could be the trade of the decade!        1 of 2         Washington Waizards April 2009      Ryan Finney is based in Hayward, California, United States of America,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (85.8%) Canada (10.0%) Taiwan (3.3%) Germany (0.8%)           READ MORE: Antawn Jamison, LeBron James, Cleveland, Cavaliers, NBA, Lakers, The Finals, Lebrons, Cleveland Cavaliers, sports-news, Hayward, The LeBrons, Jamison, 200607 Cleveland Cavaliers season, Sports in the United States, 200506 Cleveland Cavaliers season, National Basketball Association, James   More News From: Hayward :  CA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     JamesBz|10 monthsagoI'm from Ohio but you've obviously never seen Kobe Bryant. In terms of physical gifts, yeah, Lebron is tops but he's never dominated in a playoff setting (start to finish) the way D. Wade has or, of course, Kobe. Until Lebron does that ring thing or truly excels in the playoffs, it's a little bit of a reach to call him the greatest.            Reply  Reply By     Ryan Finney|10 monthsagoI've yet to see Kobe in person, but I have seen D. Wade a couple of times. I don't disagree with what you're saying, he's just the best that I've seen. He was draining shots from half court in the pre-game warm-ups! To see a Lakers game is next on my checklist...maybe after I see Kobe I will edit this article.
