Well, time to take your head out of the clouds for a minute and go on a surf on Google's latest, potentially revolutionary project, The Wave.   The Wave is actually just another part of the cloud, but unlike most other cloud computing mediums, it also has a social media aspect to it and if I were twitter, Facebook or an instant messenger client, I'd totally be shivering in my boots over this new release. In case you need a little catching up about what Google Wave is, check out this video of 15 features of the Wave:       "    Over the weekend, I was lucky enough to be one of the first to check out the preview release of Google Wave. Those who have been keeping up with tech blogs know that an invitation to preview this new Google product is a hot ticket, garnering the same hype as Gmail did when it was first released several years ago, invite-only as well. So when @justiceerolin was kind enough to extend one to me, I was stoked (by the way, please don't bother him for an invite. I'm pretty sure he's out by now anyways!).  So how sought after is an invite to the Wave? Here's how sought after it is: right after I got on the Wave, I updated my status update to "is on Google Wave". I don't have too, too many friends on Facebook, yet almost instantaneously, mostly within half an hour, about 15 of my friends came out of the woodwork through direct wall post replies, private messages, IM, text messages, and best of all, a couple of phone calls from friends who had "called to catch up", only to coyly mention that they had seen my FB status and that he or she wouldn't mind an invite if I had one. For shame, you guys. For shame!  How does the Wave compare to other social media mediums? My Wave page is pretty stark right now, but this is what I've gathered from it thus far: The Wave reminds me of Facebook in that the waves are like wall posts; ideas in plain text, videos, links, pictures, etc, can be shared. The major distinction, though, is that people can be added to, and removed from a wave and it becomes something like a private thread, great for covert collaborations and conversations. Just think of it as a much more interactive Facebook.  It's also like instant messaging because these real time updates pop up on the screen and you can actually see when and what other people on the wave are typing.  In a way, the Wave also reminds me of twitter because it can potentially be noisy if too many people are on the same wave. However, wave noise can be controlled as it is also reminiscent of tweetdeck in that every wave is like a customized column.  Cool features of the Wave:  Through the rich text editor, I can embed images and videos. One can also reply inline (apparently, this was proper form to reply to an email back in the day). There's a simple Google search button on the Wave RTE where I can search for videos and images to add to a wave. If I'm planning a trip or a get-together, I can embedGoogle Maps into a wave with a click of a button in the RTE as well. Another fun and handy feature (or I guess it could potentially be nightmarish/embarrassing depending on how you look at it): everything is documented and archived. Heck, you can even replay the entire wave like a video or go play by play.   What I hope for Google Wave in the future The user interface is a bit lackluster right now and almost nothing is self-explanatory on the Wave. I'm just going through the Wave through trial and error, using my contacts as lab rats. I've been sending in feedback, though, on what I'd like to see and how my user experience could be better (other people on the Wave should do this, too!).   So far, I only have three contacts on the Wave, so it's no surprise that I haven't been getting much action on it nor have been able to poke around too much. I can see that it has a ton of potential though, and that once more of my friends and acquaintances are able to join, it will be much more fun and useful. I can't wait till I get more contacts on the Wave. It's literally x's on my calender until Google hands out more invites!  And just for the lulz... I thought I'd throw in these epic Google Wave interpretations that were made by a friend of a friend... of a friend. They were featured in this TechCrunch article. If you're a movie buff as well as a nerd, a nerdy movie buff if you will, then you'll probably appreciate these videos, which were made to help people see the functionality of the Wave in a fiercely hilarious way. Beware though, they're NSFW. The second video especially has a lot of profanity and screaming.  From the Google Wave Cinema, I present to you...

Google has always been on the cutting edge of technology. They've been innovating how the internet works... from Gmail to Google Maps.  But this time, Google has created a whole new beast on its own.  Wave is a communications tool. It allows multiple users to collaborate on a single "wave"--a topic, item, or whatever--in real time.   more                                Comments (5)                                Compliments (74)                review by Crystal.December 01, 2009Google Wave: What's the hype?Okay... I'm going against the grain here and stating that Idon't get it. I simply do not get the hype surrounding Google Wave. After figuring out that you had to have an invite (yeah I got one - thanks B3) and sitting through the most boring, over an hour (you read that right) tutorial, I sat down to give it a go. It reminds me of an early-day AOLchat room gone bad converged with a modern-day wiki-like communications environment.

A little weird but familiar to me at the same time. The wave can also be persistant and other people can read it too, which is interesting, it can also play video inside as well, so its great for sharing links and just BSing with friends.   more                                Comments (1)                                Compliments (44)                Quick Tip by kaderly.June 19, 2010A Quick Tip by kaderlyfuture of communication and calibration!

Once google opens it up to its apps users than I can give it a higher rating. Small business will benefit the most from the app in my opinion. It allows small business one central place to communicate and collaborate on projects.

This changes the way we will talk to each other and will change how we get together simply by using widgets.  Google wave uses widgets/bots to make make stuff easier for all of us, for example if you want to know who will be coming to the to a wedding, you can just add the yes or no gadgets to your wave and people can click yes no or maybe instead of responding  more                                Comment                                Compliments (2)                Quick Tip by TheBox193.March 12, 2010A Quick Tip by TheBox193Need major work still. but a good idea.

It started out as a small murmur amongst techies and is gradually becoming more and more talk-worthy. Not everyone cares to understand or use this new process of online communication, but with inundation of social media in today's society, even internet novices are curiously asking  more                                Comments (1)                                Compliments (10)                Quick Tip by thomasknoll.February 28, 2010A Quick Tip by thomasknollFor now, it gets a +1.

A "wave" is equal parts conversation and document, where users can instantly communicate and work together with richly formatted text, photos, videos, maps, and more. The concurrency control technology will let participants reply anywhere in the message, edit the content at the same time and add participants at any point in the process. The program also allows anyone to rewind the wave to see how it has evolved.   Google Wave is also a platform with a rich set of open APIs that allow developers to embed waves in other web services and to build extensions that work inside waves.
