Not surprisingly, his embattled boss, Jeff Zucker, backs his play, Capus says.Jeff told us to go off and do great work, says Capus. I dont blink at spending the kind of money we need to spend.Capus also jumped to Zuckers defense in a searing piece about the NBC czars role in the late-night imbroglio in Sundays New York Times (Page 1, no less.) Capus accused the media of overblowing Leno v. OBrien, given the misery in Haiti.The sideshow that is the late-night wars is of no interest to the news division, Capus tells TVNewser. Its a soap opera. Nobody walks around the floors of NBC News talking about it. The magnitude of the Haiti story has had our complete focus.NBC anchor Brian Williams recently returned from the scene of devastation, as did CBSs Katie Couric and ABCs Diane Sawyer.Sawyer, for example, began planning her second trip almost immediately, says World News executive producer Jon Banner.As anchor for less than a month, Sawyers coverage exceeded my expectations, says Banner, who traveled with her for a week, from Kabul to Port-au-Prince.Clearly, she is first and foremost a reporter, Banner adds. Her abilities in the field are remarkable. Shes also a producer, and has the ability to put together a piece. Its fascinating to be part of that.As he did after Katrina, Williams is struggling a little bit in readjusting to New York, according to Capus. Its about the haves and the have nots, and feeling guilty about your surroundings. Still, hes eager to go back, Capus says.The ethical issue of journalists getting involved in stories theyre covering has become moot in Haiti. Read moreCommentsShareGeneralitiesIs a Line Being Crossed in Haiti ?By kevin on January 19, 2010 3:55 PMMuch has been made of the recent involvement of news organizations going beyond standard journalistic roles while covering the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti.Thats been especially true for the TV doctors. Bob Steele, a journalism values scholar at the Poynter Institute, tells the LA Times Matea Gold, I think its very hard for an individual who is professionally and emotionally engaged in saving lives to be able to simultaneously step back from the medical work and practice independent journalistic truth-telling.I may blur the rules of dispassionate journalism, ABC News correspondent Dr. Richard Besser tells Gold, but I think it would be impossible to be a true physician working as a journalist and not help when you can contribute.During his Monday Webchat, WaPos Howard Kurtz was asked, Are there ethical questions  both medical and journalistic  that are being ignored here? Kurtz says he has mixed feelings about it.Gawker has raised, more sarcastically, its own questions about whether there is something off-putting about CNNs on-camera heroics. While the NYTimes Alessandra Stanley wrote over the weekend,t The line between compassion and self-congratulation is thin on television; in a calamity this vast and acute, many viewers flinch at any sign of reportorial showboating. Mediaites Steve Krakauer, writing about Anderson Coopers co-hosting of this Fridays multi-network telethon asks, Has CNN entered gray area of becoming, not just reporting, the story in Haiti?In general, how do you feel about intervention by anchors and reporters in Haiti?(survey)CommentsShareGeneralitiesTVNewsers Heading To HaitiBy Chris Ariens on January 13, 2010 9:13 AMContinually Updated: Well update this post as we hear more about who is heading to Hispaniola, either the Dominican Republic or Haiti (if the airport is reopened) to cover yesterdays 7.0 earthquake.CBS Katie CouricNBCs Al Roker and Ann CurryABCs Kate SnowCNNs Anderson Cooper (Update)FNCs Orlando Salinas and Steve HarriganNBCs Brian WilliamsCBS Dave PriceABCs Richard Besser and Dan HarrisNBCs Kerry Sanders, Michelle Kosinski and Ron AllenFNCs Bill HemmerCBS Jeff Glor, Byron Pitts, and Kelly CobiellaCNNs Ivan Watson, Susan Candiotti.

So if something happens, youre going to be very well taken care of, and the whole world is going to know about it.Last night, CNNs Dr. Sanjay Gupta threw a party in midtown Manhattan for the release of his new book, Cheating Death.Pictured above, you can see Fox News Dr. Manny Alvarez, NBCs Dr. Nancy Snyderman, Dr. Mehmet Oz of Oprah fame, ABC News Dr. Richard Besser, and Deepak Chopra.The CNNers were out in full-force, with morning show hosts John Roberts, Kiran Chetry, and HLNs Robin Meade, who was in town from Atlanta, among the guests.  Larry King also stopped in, as did Soledad OBrien and T.J. Holmes.CNN/US President Jon Klein told the crowd that the turnout was attributable to Guptas reputation as both a good reporter and a good colleague.  Klein said Gupta, who travels the world for CNN and still practices medicine every week, had taken the time recently to help him find a surgeon for his father.Guptas Cheating Death recently made the WSJ list of best health books of 2009 (along with ABC News contributor Marie Savards Ask Dr. Marie), and Gupta said he was inspired by the larger role he thinks medical reporting can play.There are instances where I think media can help lead medicine, he told the crowd. But when we talk about reporting on things around the world, we typically think of that as news. In certain instances it can it can actually lead the charge.TVNewser caught up with Gupta at the party to ask him about his new book, the politicization of medical reporting, and his decision to pass up the surgeon general job.  We also used to opportunity to solicit some free medical advice.CommentsShareABCDr. Besser Keeping Busy at ABCBy kevin on October 15, 2009 8:16 AMThe NY Daily News has a short profile of Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control turned correspondent, and his H1N1 coverage.  He joined the ABC News staff as Senior Health and Medical Editor in July. Besser described to the Daily News some of his problems with medical news coverage:One of the things we have to watch out for in the media is giving a platform to the fringe perspective, Besser says. You may have an issue that splits in the medical community 90 to 10. But, he says, when that gets on air, the dramatic differences of opinion may be evened out in the presentation.Good thing he doesnt have to cover politics.Apparently, ABC was very accommodating when he came on board.  They even installed new furniture: Im freakishly tallOn the Good Morning America set, they have these little lounge chairs for the interviews. I looked like Gulliver. So they very quickly built new furniture.CommentsShareNEXT PAGE >>You must have javascript enabled to use these forms.Send an anonymous tipTwitterMobileRSSInterested in advertising on TVNewser?Find a JobResearch Manager, DigitalNational Public RadioWashington, DCResearch Manager, Business and Corporate DevelopmtNational Public RadioWashington, DCAdvertising Sales Representative - Inside SalesPandora Internet Radio - Oakland, CAOakland, CAMarketing Research Analystwww.pandora.comOakland, CASee all jobs | Post a risk-free job listing for $279TVNewser StaffChris AriensManaging EditorAlex WeprinCo-EditorMolly Stark DeanCo-EditorGail ShisterColumnistAlissa KrinskyContributorNadine CheungEditor, The Job PostTVNewser on TwitterTVNewser Twitter feed loading...Follow TVNewser on TwitterTopicsCable News RatingsABCCBSCNNFox NewsMSNBCNBCmore...LinksBroadcasting & CableBuzzMachineFTVLiveInside Cable NewsJohnny Dollar's PlaceMedia DecoderMedia MobMediaiteMonsters & Critics  TVNewsBluesNewscastStudioNewslabRomeneskoThe Live FeedTV BarnTV by the NumbersTVNewsCheckTVSpy WatercoolerTVWeekVarietyZ on TVArchivesJanuary 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010more...
