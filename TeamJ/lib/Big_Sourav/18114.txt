Gabrielle Giffords, online sleuths turned up pages of rambling text and videos he had created. A wave of amateur diagnoses soon followed, most of which concluded that Loughner was not so much a political extremist as a man suffering from "paranoid schizophrenia."For many, the investigation will stop there. No need to explore personal motives, out-of-control grievances or distorted political anger. The mere mention of mental illness is explanation enough. This presumed link between psychiatric disorders and violence has become so entrenched in the public consciousness that the entire weight of the medical evidence is unable to shift it. Severe mental illness, on its own, is not an explanation for violence, but don't expect to hear that from the media in the coming weeks.

Rather than looking at individual cases, or even single studies, Fazel's team analyzed all the scientific findings they could find. As a result, they can say with confidence that psychiatric diagnoses tell us next to nothing about someone's propensity or motive for violence.A 2009 analysisof nearly 20,000 individuals concluded that increased risk of violence was associated with drug and alcohol problems, regardless of whether the person had schizophrenia. Two similaranalyseson bipolar patients showed, along similar lines, that the risk of violent crime is fractionally increased by the illness, while it goes up substantially among those who are dependent on intoxicating substances. In other words, it's likely that some of the people in your local bar are at greater risk of committing murder than your average person with mental illness.Related from NBC Open Channel: Few assassins fit the 'profile.' Most had no mental health treatment.Of course, like the rest of the population, some people with mental illness do become violent, and some may be riskier when they're experiencing delusions and hallucinations. But these infrequent cases do not make "schizophrenia" or "bipolar" a helpful general-purpose explanation for criminal behavior. If that doesn't make sense to you, here's an analogy: Soccer hooligans are much more likely to be violent when they attend a match, but if you tell me that your friend has gone to a soccer match, I'll know nothing about how violent a person he is. Similarly, if you tell me your friend punched someone, the fact that he goes to soccer matches tells me nothing about what caused the confrontation. This puts recent speculation about the Arizona suspect in a distinctly different light: If you found evidence on the Web that Jared Lee Loughner or some other suspected killer was obsessed with soccer or football or hockey and suggested it might be an explanation for his crime, you'd be laughed at. But do the same with "schizophrenia" and people nod in solemn agreement. This is despite the fact that your chance of being murdered by a stranger with schizophrenia is so vanishingly small that a recent studyof four Western countries put the figure at one in 14.3 million. To put it in perspective, statisticsshow you are about three times more likely to be killed by a lightning strike.The fact that mental illness is so often used to explain violent acts despite the evidence to the contrary almost certainly flows from how such cases are handled in the media. Numerous studiesshow that crimes by people with psychiatric problems are over-reported, usually with gross inaccuracies that give a false impression of risk. With this constant misrepresentation, it's not surprising that the public sees mental illness as an easy explanation for heartbreaking events. We haven't yet learned all the details of the tragic shooting in Arizona, but I suspect mental illness will be falsely accused many times over. 2011 Slate.comAdvertise | AdChoicesAdvertise | AdChoicesAdvertise | AdChoicesVideo: Experts: Suspect showed signs of schizophreniaOpen in new window                        More from                        TODAY show        Snooki on CTL (cast, tan, laziness)        Snooki: Fuggedaboutit, moms  Shore not for kids        Tiger Mother talks Chinese parenting         Obama to attend Tucson memorial service        After Ariz. shootings, Palin at a crossroadsMost popular videos                         on msnbc.com         Doctor: Giffords appears to be defying odds        Massive floods ravage Australia        Deadly 'walls of water' ravage Australia        Squirrel escapes tiger's paw at NY zoo        Flash floods add to Australia misery More from:TODAYNightly NewsMeet the PressDatelineMorning JoeHardballCountdownRachel Maddowmsnbc tvSearchShow more videos    Photos: Mourning follows deadly shooting in ArizonaOpen in new windowloading photos...        previous        next jump to photo #0jump to photo #1jump to photo #2jump to photo #3jump to photo #4jump to photo #5jump to photo #6jump to photo #7jump to photo #8jump to photo #9jump to photo #10jump to photo #11jump to photo #12jump to photo #13jump to photo #14jump to photo #15jump to photo #16jump to photo #17jump to photo #18jump to photo #19jump to photo #20jump to photo #21jump to photo #221 of         22Related slideshows        President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama observe a moment of silence with White House staff members on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Monday.
