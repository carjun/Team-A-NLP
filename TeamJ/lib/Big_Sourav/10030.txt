The leak was probably from an underground section of piping encased in concrete at Pump Station 1, Alyeska said and that "Crews are currently on site to assess the situation and isolate the source of the leak,". There were no injuries and no immediate impact to the enviornment. Construction of the pipeline was complted on May 31, 1977 and was designed to transport oil from the North Slope of Alaska to the northern most ice-free port in Valdez. Alaska. The pipe is 800 miles long and cost $8 billion dollars to build. It transports 642,261 barrels of oil during a normal day of operation. The pipeline carries 15 percent of the U.S crude oil output. Bloomberg Businessweek reports that New York crude, which traded at $88.03 a barrel on Jan. 7, may climb further if the pipeline problem isnt fixed, said Gavin Wendt, founding director at MineLife Pty Ltd. in Sydney. If theres no resolution by tomorrow, we may see prices heading towards $90 a barrel or higher, Wendt said.
