Posted by Neil Katz, David W Freeman  77 comments         Tweet  Share E-mail Print  Font       Jared Loughner may be suffering from schizophrenia, experts say.(CBS) If Jared Loughner, the man accused of killing six and injuring 12 in Arizona last Saturday, turns out to be suffering from schizophrenia, as many doctors have surmised, why shouldn't the state have had the power to lock him in a mental ward BEFORE he went on a rampage?That might sound like common sense, but the law in most places is designed principally to protect individual rights. If you don't appear to be an immediate threat and you haven't broken the law, authorities are hard-pressed to commit you for more than a few days. But some prominent doctors are starting to question that logic. Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of psychiatry at Columbia University, is one of them. "We are a country where individual freedom is prized and held as almost sacred," Lieberman told CBS News. But, he says, "People who have a clearly diagnosed, severe mental disorder that are psychotic in nature - for these individuals there should be a real set of incentives, if not requirements, that they be given treatment, not waiting until they do something to themselves or someone else."Lieberman cautions that he hasn't evaluated Loughner, but "there is a very high likelihood that he suffers from a psychotic disorder and most likely it is schizophrenia," he says.The irony, says Dr. Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance of Mental Illness, is that "in Arizona a person assessing him would have had more freedom to hospitalize him than in other states."According to Duckworth, Arizona law says people can be hospitalized against their will if they are "in need of treatment and may benefit from treatment." The standard in most other states is "acute danger to self or others," a much higher bar.Duckworth says there is another problem here - limited access to care. Arizona has the second lowest number of psychiatric beds in the country, just 5.9 per 100,000 people, according to a 2008 study from the Treatment Advocacy Center, which advocates for the mentally ill. From what we know so far, Loughner was never evaluated by a mental health professional, despite erratic behavior at school and with friends."When someone collapses in a room people know to call 911 or do CPR," says Leiberman. "But when someone has a mental disturbance, people don't know what to do."Lieberman believes it's vital to teach family members and the public how to recognize the signs of psychotic behavior so they will know how to react and how to work with someone to get help.As for patients' civil rights?"The last person to have benefited from his civil rights was Loughner," says Lieberman. "His life wasn't a happy life. He wasn't getting an education or a career and now he's gotten himself into a situation where there is no prospect for the future but for prison or a mental institution."WHAT DO YOU THINK?What's more important? The public's right to safety or a patient's civil liberties?

Those 'facilities' have been horrible-when societies try to control those who are different man, this is just wrong. Those who are older will remember when Geraldo Rivera had a documentary on mental health facilities in the 60s-70s. They ended up being closed down. Anything the government does is fupped. This action should never be considered ever again. If the feds\state government cannot lock up a person who has threatened to kill his\her spouse until something happens then the mentally ill should NEVER be locked up. Equitable.

Would a doctor place this label on someone they find somewhat offensive? yes.Joe Lewis the famous boxer was driven crazy by Americas Secret Police! This is a fact I doubt that anyone else will tell you this. His crime of course was wiping Max Schmeling. I read about this part of Joe Lewis's life in a book called "GOING CRAZY" written by Otto Friedrich. I know enough about secret police tactics to read this about Joe Lewis and add 1 + 1 and get 2.The United States is a extremely sick nation, if you were to lock up everyone with mental illness, there would not be enough people left to care for them all. The authorities, are the most sick of them all. It is to the point where someone without any symptom of Mental Illness, and who understands full well what is going on, this person is considered sick.     Reply to this comment           by Saint_Frankenstein January 11, 2011 11:53 PM EST  Exactly. If you were to lock up everyone with a mental or emotional problem, the vast majority of people would be locked up! Not to mention the vast majority of our 'leaders'. American society would collapse. Lol."The authorities, are the most sick of them all."Yup. Psychopathy and megalomania are rampant at the highest echelons of power.                      by Saint_Frankenstein January 11, 2011 11:55 PM EST  What I'm most concerned about is if they brand anyone with an alternate view of reality or anyone who really understands what's going on in this world as 'mentally ill'. That's where this seems to be heading. Frightening.                         by ConcernedArmyWife January 11, 2011 11:01 PM EST  Lets not blame this on societies views of violence,sex and drugs. Or the possibility of drug induced psychosis. Noooo, lets blame it on mental illnesses. Here is alittle education for ya. By law an individual is an adult at age 18, at that time a parent can not force a child to take their medication (even if a mental illness is part that that childs history). If a parent wants that responsibility then they must have a legal document signed by them,the courts and the child while they are in the right state of mind (ie on medication). Otherwise, if the child goes off their medication there is NOTHING the parent can do but sit and worry. People are scared of things they dont know or understand. So, please try to understand and try to educate yourselves on mental illnesses before you make idiotic statements. I know people whose CHILDREN have schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and you will never understand unless you have personally experienced it.     Reply to this comment            by skepticalJM January 11, 2011 10:55 PM EST  So one day they say your crazy, and lock you away for life? That is exactly what the Fascists want to do with this country. Anyone that doesn't agree with you should be locked away for life!We are in deep trouble when a proposition like this is even contemplated!On the other hand, sick people should not be abandoned to end up trying to hurt themselves or others; they can be monitored and have people to provide for them when they need help. If you just let them starve in some corner, like many homeless are doing today, someday they may cause trouble. If we continue to be a society that abandons its own, we are going to have a lot of trouble in the future. That so many people just think that locking people away is an answer is part of the problem. That we have a whole political party that feels that way is even more of a problem. Hitler 1936; the next thing you know we'll be sending people to the gas chambers for showers!

What's next, a call for a new T4 program?                         by Saint_Frankenstein January 11, 2011 9:48 PM EST  What a smear campaign this is. These doctors are just talking out of their ass. Loughner is obviously mentally ill, of course. But mental illness can be induced by a number of external methods. From what the people who know him seem to be saying, he didn't start manifesting severe psychological problems until his late teens. Now I know that some psychological disorders don't manifest themselves until later in life, but we should take the possibly that somehow his mental problems were caused by external manipulation or factors into consideration. It is not fair that now they're fearmongering about the mentally disabled because of the actions of one young man who appears to be a human robot. The vast majority of those with mental illnesses are quite harmless, and it is a violation of their human rights to be forcibly drugged using powerful psychiatric drugs that rewire the brain and can cause brain damage and electroshocked against their will. This is not the USSR.

Darn... you're no fun!Sarcasm/off (It's a joke)                      by Saint_Frankenstein January 11, 2011 10:05 PM EST  No, I'm sorry. We can't. :P                         by PatriotMike3 January 11, 2011 9:36 PM EST  Thanks, liberals, for protecting the lunatics at the expense of 9 year-olds. Thanks for making sure that the insane in our midst are free to commit mass murder because, after all, their freedom is more important than the life of a child. We owe the liberals a debt of gratitude for being able to bury that little girl.

Reply to this comment            by mnbrant January 11, 2011 9:34 PM EST  Where do people get the idea he is psychotic. I dont see that at all. Maybe a drug user. I really dont like the idea of the government forcing me to take dangerous meds that could possibly kill me with uncertain efficacy even if there is a possibility I might be hospitalize if I am not taking the,. If fact the lawsuits that would pop up would probably take whatever is left of our countries resources. I don't know where people get the idea that the mentally ill are all stupid and without resources.     Reply to this comment            by jimbot1957 January 11, 2011 9:21 PM EST  Mental Illness is a lot like Obscenity, not always recognized and very rarely agreed upon. If Mr.s Giffords were NOT in Congress, this particular circumstance would have hardly made a ripple in the MSM. As someone pointed out, what about all the little brown children that are being killed in Afghanistan on a daily basis? Sorry, but the US Govt kills more people than this each and every minute of the day -- get some perspective.     Reply to this comment           by Saint_Frankenstein January 11, 2011 9:52 PM EST  Using their logic, a large amount of the people in military, politics, business and law enforcement should be forcibly hopitalized because of their sociopathy.                         by cbsblogger January 11, 2011 8:55 PM EST  NO and where would we put them? Reagan closed all of the mental health institutions so that he could cut taxes for the rich. He moved them to the streets by giving them SSI, providing Section 8 subsidies to slum landlords and putting the burden on the Social Security trust. I do think that those who have had mental health issues should be required to get a clean slate before they can buy firearms.
