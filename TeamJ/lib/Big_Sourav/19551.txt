His disapproval rating reached as high as 54 percent in September  when the five-month Gulf Coast oil spill saga ended  and clocked in at 50 percent in November.The president also received more support for his policies than at any other time since mid-2009. Fifty-five percent of Americans said the country would head in the right direction under policies proposed by Obama; in May 2009, 63 percent of those surveyed said Obamas policies would lead the country in the right direction. In January, the last time pollsters asked about Obamas policies, just 49 percent said they would improve the country.The Republican leadership in the House and Senate didnt fare as well. In the poll, 44 percent of Americans said the GOPs proposed policies would lead the country in the right direction, while 51 percent said they would take the country in the wrong direction. Policy proposals from congressional Democrats were supported by 48 percent of those polled..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesApproval Poll numbers, Barack Obama, CNN/Opinion Research, Decessions, Democrats in Congress, Obama more popular, Polls, President Obama, Republican's in CongressRead moreMerry Christmas or Happy Holidays? .December 19, 2010jamesb1014 commentsIf you know someone celebrates Christmas you go with oneIf not..You go with the other.SimpleRight?As if Americans werent divided enough, even in this season celebrating peace and good will, the public is split over whether shops should greet customers by saying Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays.Just under half (49 percent) of those surveyed in a new poll said stores should have a Merry Christmas greeting policy, while 44 percent say businesses should opt for the more generic Happy Holidays or Seasons Greetings out of respect for people of different faiths.Robert Putnam of Harvard, a leading scholar of religion and co-author of American Grace: How Religion Unites and Divides Us, said he was surprised at the popularity of the inclusive holiday greeting.That represents a major change over the last 50 years toward greater interfaith sensitivity, Putnam toldReligion News Service..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Media, Other Things, UpdatesHappy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Polls, Religion, Which one is safe and proper?Read moreThe Zeitgeist (Economic Data ) for the week of December 17th, 2010..December 17, 2010jamesb101No commentsThe Zeitgeist ( Economic Data ) From the Atlantic Magazine for December 17, 2010THE ZEITGEIST45.0%Obama Average Job Approval49.8%Obama Favorability28.8% / 62.8%Right Direction / Wrong Track11.0%Congressional Approval91.7%Small Business Optimism Index-45Consumer Comfort Index-421,000Initial Weekly Jobless Claims332,172Newly foreclosed properties in October9.8%UnemploymentSourcesShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, Polls, The Economy, Updates12/17/10, Economic Data (Zeitgeist), Polls, The Zeitgeist, Unemployment numberRead morePresident Obamas Job Approval 12/7/10December 7, 2010jamesb101No commentsPresident Obamas Poll numbers..From Realclearpolitics.President Obama Job ApprovalPolling DataPollDateSampleApproveDisapproveSpreadRCP Average11/15  12/646.048.5-2.5Gallup12/4  12/61547 A4647-1Rasmussen Reports12/4  12/61500 LV4752-5CBS News11/29  12/21067 A4842+6USA Today/Gallup11/19  11/211037 A4254-12Associated Press/CNBC11/18  11/221000 A4848TieMcClatchy/Marist11/15  11/18810 RV4548-3See All President Obama Job Approval Polling DataRCP POLL AVERAGEPresident Obama Job Approval46.0Approve48.5DisapproveShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesPolls, President Obama Job Approval 12/7/10, RealclearpoliticsRead moreThe Tax cut Dilemma for the DemocratsNate Silver..December 5, 2010jamesb1016 commentsNate. your FOURTH choice is gospel in Congress.You nailed that oneThe RICH win.AGAIN.As Always..***The Democrats Tax Cut DilemmaByNATE SILVERSaturday afternoon, the Senatefailed to achieve cloture on a proposal to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for family incomes below $250,000 but end them for incomes above this threshold.Perhaps the most likely outcome, according to reporting by The Times and other news organizations, is that the tax cuts  which expire at the end of the year if Congress takes no action  will eventually be extended at least temporarily for everyone, including high-income earners, as the White House seeks to cut its losses.Theres been quite a bit of debate in the blogosphere about how Democrats have handled the negotiations. Some liberal-leaning writers, in particular, have suggested that Democrats have played a poor game of poker, having folded their hand before they really needed to.Im more inclined toagree with my colleague David Leonhardt, however: the Democrats position  while perhaps not backing them all the way into a corner  is not very strong.There are essentially three possible outcomes in the debate: first, that the tax cuts are extended for everyone; second, that they are extended for no one; and third, that they are extended only below some threshold, most likely $250,000 for couples (although alternatives like $500,000 and $1 million have been proposed).The way in which Republicans would rank these outcomes is clear. Their first preference would be to extend the tax cuts for everyone. But presumably, when push comes to shove, theyd prefer to extend some of the tax cuts  on incomes below $250,000  instead of ending all of them.Its a little bit more difficult to identify the preferences of Democrats, because there are more divisions within the party: between the president and Congress, between moderate Democrats and liberal ones, between Democrats who are electorally vulnerable and those who arent. It is safe to say, however, that on balance, the Democrats would prefer to extend the tax cuts only below the $250,000 threshold, and not above it.This is also the most popular choice among the general public.Four recent polls  from CBS News, Gallup, The Associated Press, and CNN  find an average of 49 percent of Americans preferring this position, versus 33 percent who would rather see all of the tax cuts extended and 14 percent who would like to see all of them expire. (Another 4 percent are undecided.)So, the theory goes, if Democrats would prefer extending the tax cuts for incomes below $250,000 to letting all of them expire, and so would Republicans  and so, for that matter, would the general public  then what, exactly, is the rub? Not that victories in Congress ever come easily, but shouldnt this be a fight that the Democrats can win?The problem with this theory is that it relies, implicitly, on the assumption that the Democrats can take the third option  extending the tax cuts for everyone  off the table. If the Democrats could do this, then they would be in a very strong position. But this is not so easy to do.Read moreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Politics, The Economy, Updates2010 Midterm Election results, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Politics, Polls, President Obama, Republicans/GOP, The House, The Tax cut Dilemma for the DemocratsRead morePPP Poll: Romney Trails Obama By 9 Points In Massachusetts..December 3, 2010jamesb1011 commentObama beating the top GOP prospect in HIS own state. 2 Years out.Oh Snap!The new survey of Massachusetts fromPublic Policy Polling (D) shows President Obama continuing to lead various possible Republican challengers in this deep-blue state including former Gov. Mitt Romney, who comes the closest to Obama but still trails by a significant margin.Obama leads Newt Gingrich by 57%-33%; Mike Huckabee by 57%-33%; and extends his lead to 61%-32% against Sarah Palin. Against Romney, who was governor of the state from 2003-2007  and did not seek re-election in 2006 in order to run for president in the 2008 cycle  Obama leads by 52%-43%.Obamas approval rating in Massachusetts is 55%, with disapproval at 40%. By contrast, Romneys personal favorable rating is only 40%, with 51% viewing him unfavorably. It should be kept in mind that, in his 2008 run, Romney often courted conservative audiences by contrasting his positions with the most liberal state in the country (as it wascalled in one ad) where hed been governor.The survey ofregistered voters has a 4.4%margin of error..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesMassachusetts, Polls, Romney/ObamaRead moreThe Zeitgeist (Economic Data ) for the week of December 2th, 2010..December 2, 2010jamesb101No commentsThe Zeitgeist ( Economic Data ) From the Atlantic Magazine for December 2, 2010THE ZEITGEIST45.5%Obama Average Job Approval48.6%Obama Favorability29.8% / 61.1%Right Direction / Wrong Track14.5%Congressional Approval91.7%Small Business Optimism Index-47Consumer Comfort Index-407,000Initial Weekly Jobless Claims332,172Newly foreclosed properties in October9.6%UnemploymentSourcesShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, Polls, The Economy, UpdatesEconomic Data (Zeitgeist), Polls, Unemployment figuresRead morePresident Obamas Job Approval 11/30/10December 1, 2010jamesb101No commentsPresident Obamas Poll numbers..From Realclearpolitics.President Obama Job ApprovalPolling DataPollDateSampleApproveDisapproveSpreadRCP Average11/8  11/2945.949.3-3.4Gallup11/27  11/291547 A4745+2Rasmussen Reports11/23  11/291500 LV4653-7Associated Press/CNBC11/18  11/221000 A4848TieUSA Today/Gallup11/19  11/211037 A4254-12McClatchy/Marist11/15  11/18810 RV4548-3NBC News/Wall St. Jrnl11/11  11/151000 A4747TieCNN/Opinion Research11/11  11/141014 A4850-2Quinnipiac11/8  11/152424 RV4449-5See All President Obama Job Approval Polling DataRCP POLL AVERAGEPresident Obama Job Approval45.9Approve49.3DisapproveShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesPolls, President Obama Job Approval 11/30/10, RealclearpoliticsRead morePage 1 of 52123...52Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (145) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on Will the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..Scott P on Will the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?Scott P on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSD Your Ad Here 2011 Politicaldog101.ComDesign by SRS Solutions
