Wikipedia:Requests for permissions - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWikipedia:Requests for permissionsFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation,search"WP:PERM" redirects here. You may be looking for Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission.Requests for permissionsShortcuts:WP:PERMWP:RPEWP:RFRWP:RFPEWP:RFPERMThis page enables administrators to handle requests for permissions on the English Wikipedia. Administrators are able to modify rollback, reviewer, account creator, confirmed, and autopatrolled rights.Editors wishing to request a permission flag here should do so following the procedure below. Processed requests are automatically archived. Editors requesting permissions are advised to periodically revisit the requests page, as notifications will not always be given after a decision is made.If this page has been recently modified, it may not reflect the most recent changes.Please purge this page to view the most recent changes.PermissionsReviewer: As part of the pending changes trial, users in this group can review other users' edits on pages subject to protection by pending changes. Potential reviewers should recognize vandalism, be familiar with basic content policies such as the policy on living people, and have reasonable level of experience editing Wikipedia. It is recommended to read the reviewing guideline, where the reviewing process is detailed, as well as expectations for a reviewer.Rollback: Rollback enables users to remove vandalism much more quickly and efficiently than by undoing it. Users who do not demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes capable vandalism fighting, either because they have no or little history of doing so, or show a poor ability to discern between good and bad faith edits will not be granted this right. For a more detailed explanation of rollback and information about when it is appropriate to use the tool, see Wikipedia:Rollback feature. For information about the technical details of the feature, see here.Account creator: The account creator flag is granted to users who are active in the account request process. The flag removes the limit on the maximum number of new accounts that can be created in a 24 hour period. It also allows users to make accounts with names similar to other accounts. The account creator flag is only given to users who participate in the ACC process and may be removed without notice should a user's participation in the account creation process cease.Autopatrolled: The autopatrolled flag is granted to users who are active in the creation of new articles. This tool is granted so their creations are auto patrolled in Special:NewPages. Unlike other requests, any user may nominate an editor for Autopatrolled, even without that user's consent. A user who wishes to have this flag must be trusted, experienced, and must have demonstrated they are familiar with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, especially WP:BLP and WP:Notability.Confirmed: The confirmed flag is granted to new users who have not hit the threshold for autoconfirmed status of yet. These are users who have not had both 10 edits and 4 days experience. People with this flag can upload files and edit semi-protected pages without hitting the autoconfirmed flag. A user requesting this flag must indicate a reason for requiring the flag.Edit filter: Requests for access to the Edit filter manager group should be made at Wikipedia talk:Edit filter. Requests may take in general up to seven days to process; more in case appropriate consensus, or lack of it, is not clear.AutoWikiBrowser: AutoWikiBrowser is a semi-automated MediaWiki editor for Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista designed to make tedious repetitive tasks quicker and easier. It is essentially a browser that automatically opens up a new page when the last is saved. When set to do so, it suggests some changes (typically formatting) that are generally meant to be incidental to the main change. Please read the quick guide on the main page before requesting permission. In applying for AWB access, you indicate that you will abide by that agreement. Also, this page is for requesting AWB Access for this wiki (English Wikipedia) only. Other projects have their own check pages and you should ask local sysops to add you there. Note that users with under 500 mainspace edits are RARELY approved. Also, you only need to give a reason for wanting AWB access if you have fewer than 500 mainspace edits! If approved, your name will be added to the CheckPage.Administrator and bureaucrat access: Requests for administrator or bureaucrat access need to be posted at requests for adminship and requests for bureaucratship, respectively.Note: While the IP-block-exempt right can also be granted by admins, this should not be requested here. Requests for the IP-block exempt right should be sent to the unblock-en mailing list or, if there are significant privacy concerns, to the CheckUser list.Removal of permissionsIf you wish to have any of your permission flags removed, you should contact an administrator.This is not the place to request review of another user's rights. If you believe someone's actions merit removal of a permission flag, you should raise your concern at the incidents noticeboard.Note: The administrator, bureaucrat, checkuser and oversight flags cannot be removed using this process page; those need to be posted at m:Steward requests/permissions. Stewards will typically not carry out such requests unless they come from members of the Arbitration Committee or a user who is requesting their own access be removed.ProcessRequestorsTo make a request for a permission, click "add request" next to the appropriate header and fill in the reason for wanting permission.Do not simply edit this page and add your request, or it may be removed. Any editor may comment on requests for permission.Jump to: Reviewer  Rollback  Account creator  Autopatrolled  Confirmed  AutoWikiBrowserAdministratorsAdministrators are permitted to grant rollback and/or account creator flags to any user who meets the criteria explained above and can be trusted not to abuse the tool(s). They should review a user's contributions (i.e. reversion history) or account creation logs to ensure the tools will be used appropriately and check for any indication of potential misuse.Once an administrator has granted a permission or decided to deny a request, they should add {{done}} or {{not done}} respectively under the request with their comments. The request will then be archived automatically: approved requests for this month will be placed here. Declined requests for this month will go here.Current requestsReviewer (add request)User:FormerIPFormerIP  (talk  contribs  deleted  cross-wiki  wikichecker  count  pages created  logs  blocklog  lu  rfar  rfc  rfcu  ssp  spi  search an, ani, cn, an3) (assign permissions)I have a fairly good WP history and just came upon the first occasion where I wanted to review a PC but couldn't FormerIP (talk) 19:32, 6 January 2011 (UTC)Y Done HJMitchell | Penny for your thoughts? 00:30, 7 January 2011 (UTC)User:SteveStrummerSteveStrummer  (talk  contribs  deleted  cross-wiki  wikichecker  count  pages created  logs  blocklog  lu  rfar  rfc  rfcu  ssp  spi  search an, ani, cn, an3) (assign permissions)I've been an editor for about three years and I do regular anti-vandal work so I'd like to join in this trial feature.

I usually patrol newpages and am very familiar with CSD and AFD, I regularly read RFAs, the village pump, and ANI to gain a better understanding of what will be acceptable behavior should I be granted additional privileges. I have reverted in haste prior, and I now take significantly more caution and restraint in undoing the actions and work of others.

DP76764 (Talk) 22:18, 7 January 2011 (UTC)You've done a good job reverting vandalism, but you don't seem to be warning vandals. If you are granted rollback, will you do a better job of this? Dabomb87 (talk) 01:36, 8 January 2011 (UTC)Sure, I will make more effort on that.

Breawycker (talk) 21:17, 8 January 2011 (UTC)It doesn't look like you have enough experience reverting vandalism. Most of your reverts have been self-reverts to userspace drafts. If you want to have experience reverting vandalism, my advice is to take a look at the Recent changes page.

A while ago I requested Rollback, but I was denied for the reason that I had not reverted enough vandalism. In recent times, however, I have reverted a great deal of vandalism, and in some of those cases rollback would have been quite useful.
