Have youever wanted to be involved in activism that promotes awareness aboutviolence and abuse? Or join movements to lobby the world's governments about changing lawsand policies to effectively bring lasting change? Many think that theywill not be able to make a difference despite wishing they could, sothey never really look into activism. The reality is, however, thatthere are many things we can all do to become active in the fight toend violence and abuse. There are many ways to contribute towards the fight for change. Individual participation can take place at many levels, and through many mediums. Anybody can make a difference! Do not forget: ONE drop raises the ocean! Domestic violence &child abuse is reaching plague proportions in our society. Individuallywe can support and inspire victims, as well as enlighten others by raising awareness. Each of us can participate at many levels, fromgetting involved through our personal associations, right through to being active in global wide networks. Even the choices available of ways in which we can participate are plentiful. Some may wishto participate through creative expression, others through practical, community based projects or web-based intellectualactivism.Those with a creative flare may wish to ad their might to the fight using mediums such as art, music, creative writing, poetry, digital media (photography, video, graphic design), and have the option of promoting their unique brands in person amongst their local community, through established local publications or via online social networking and self publication websites. In our immediate socialcircles and family groups, we can offer emotional support, spreadawareness, and most importantly, model the right way to behave. In ourlocal communities, we can participate in awareness and educationcampaigns, apply for government funding to set up resource points thatprovide access to information, practical aid and financial support forvictims who seek help. Online, we can work together in social networkssuch as facebook  to raise awareness by providing easily accessibleeducational and practical information, and much needed inspiration andemotional support. In our cultural groups we can inspire, enlighten,advocate tolerance and equality, and lead by example.At a politicallevel we can form groups to conduct campaigns and lobby our localcouncils, state and federal governments and members of parliament for changes inlaws, social policies and resource allocation.

In contrast, women were less likely to bephysically assaulted by a stranger (22%) than bysomeone they knew (82%). Almost a third (31%) of women physicallyassaulted said that the perpetrator was a current or previous partner,and37% reported their attacker as being a family member or friend (seeAustralian Social Trends 2007, Women's experience of partner violence).Women were also most likely to be sexually assaulted by someone knownto them (89%), with 29% of those sexually assaulted reporting that theperpetrator was a current or previous partner, and 39% a family memberor friend."
