Wikipedia:Username policy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWikipedia:Username policyFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation,searchFor the guidelines on user pages, see Wikipedia:User page.  For the United Nations WikiProject, see Wikipedia:WikiProject United Nations.This page documents an English Wikipedia policy, a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus.Shortcuts:WP:UWP:UNWP:USERNAMEWP:NICKNAMEWP:UPOLICYThis page in a nutshell: When choosing an account name, do not choose names which may be offensive, misleading, disruptive, or promotional. In general, one username should represent one person.The Five PillarsEnforcement policiesAdministratorsBanning policyBlocking policyBot policyHarassmentProtection policySock puppetryUsername policyVandalismviewtalkeditIntroductory video clip "Username": some acceptable usernames.The username policy describes accepted practices and behavior in naming and operating a user account on Wikipedia.You may wish to create an account if you do not already have one. Creating an account provides a number of benefits; in particular, your contributions are attributed to your username. See Help:Logging in for help with logging in to an existing account.Contents1 Appropriate usernames1.1 How your name will appear1.2 Real names1.3 Internet addresses1.4 Company/group names1.5 Non-English usernames1.6 Similar usernames2 Dealing with inappropriate usernames2.1 Confusing usernames2.2 Usernames for Administrator Attention guidelines3 Changing your username3.1 Deleting an account4 Sharing accounts5 Using multiple accounts6 See alsoAppropriate usernamesNote: This section, and all of its subsections, are aimed at new users. It does not make recommendations about how to enforce the username policy; that section is below.Your username is a nickname that will identify all of your contributions to Wikipedia. It can even be your real name, if you so choose, but you should be aware of the risks involved in editing under your real name.Whatever name you choose, it should be a name that other contributors are comfortable with and which does not interfere with the project. A controversial name may give a bad impression to other users, and avoiding this is in your own interest.There are four kinds of usernames that are specifically disallowed:Misleading usernames imply relevant, misleading things about the contributor. The types of names which can be misleading are too numerous to list, but definitely include usernames that imply you are in a position of authority over Wikipedia, usernames that impersonate other people, or usernames which can be confusing within the Wikipedia signature format, such as usernames which resemble IP addresses or timestamps.Promotional usernames are used to promote a group, company, product or website on Wikipedia.Offensive usernames are those that offend other contributors, making harmonious editing difficult or impossible.Disruptive usernames include outright trolling or personal attacks, include profanities or otherwise show a clear intent to disrupt Wikipedia.If you choose such a username, that account may be blocked  you are welcome to create a new and acceptable username. If you've inadvertently chosen an inappropriate username, you can change it  see below at Changing your username. If your username is considered borderline, you may be asked to change it voluntarily.As part of the rule against misleading usernames, your username must not give the impression that your account has permissions which it does not have. Thus it may not contain the terms "administrator", "bureaucrat", "steward", "checkuser", "oversight", or similar terms like "admin", "sysop" or "moderator". Also, unless your account is an approved bot, your name should not end with "bot", which is used to identify bot accounts, nor should it be easily misunderstood to refer to a bot. Usernames should also not include the phrase "wikipedia", "wikimedia", "wiktionary", etc, which could imply the account was officially affiliated with the Foundation or one of its projects.These criteria apply to both usernames and signatures. Remember that the purpose of your username and your signature is to identify you as a contributor. If your username or signature is unnecessarily confusing, editors may request that you change it.Usernames that are inappropriate in another language, or that represent an inappropriate name with misspellings and substitutions, or do so indirectly or by implication, are still considered inappropriate. Ultimately, the line between acceptable and unacceptable usernames is based on the opinions of other editors. If you want to seek approval for a username, you can do so by filing a request at Wikipedia:Request an account.How your name will appearWikipedia usernames are case sensitive, and the first letter of every username is automatically capitalized. By default, your username appears in your signature on posts to discussion pages; for details on signatures and how to customize them, see Wikipedia:Signatures.Your username comes with a "user page", whose title is of the form "User:Yourname", and a "user talk page" entitled "User talk:Yourname" that people will use to contact you. If your username is commonly misspelled, consider helping people by adding a redirect from the misspelled username to your actual username. While a user page can be created by any contributor, whether an associated account exists or not, you may wish to consider registering that username as a doppelgnger account to prevent it from being registered and used by another person.Real namesPolicy shortcut:WP:REALNAMEUse of a real name allows contributions to be more easily traced to an individual. This may make a contributor more vulnerable to issues such as harassment. You should consider the benefits and drawbacks of making substantial contributions under your real name before doing so, especially if you plan on editing or discussing potentially controversial subjects in Wikipedia articles or on any of the associated project or talk pages. While it is possible to rename accounts (see Changing your username below), a record of the previous name will still exist.Do not edit under the name of a well-known living person unless it is your real name, and you either are that well-known person or you make it clear that you are not. Such usernames may be blocked as a precaution.If you have been blocked for using your real name, please don't take offense; we're trying to prevent somebody from impersonating you! You are welcome to use your real name, but in some cases, you will need to prove you are who you say you are. You can do this by sending an e-mail to info-en@wikimedia.org; be aware that the volunteer response team that handles e-mail is operated entirely by volunteers, and an immediate reply may not be possible.Internet addressesConflating your Wikipedia identity with the identity of something else on the Internet can cause problems.E-mail addresses and URLs are not valid usernames. Plain domain names (without .com, .co.kr, etc) are sometimes acceptable, such as when the purpose of the domain is simply to identify you as a person, but they are inappropriate if they promote a commercial Web page. Some users choose to make usernames based on their static IP addresses, but this is not recommended.Company/group namesPolicy shortcuts:WP:CORPNAMEWP:GROUPNAMEWP:ORGNAMEWP:PRODNAMEWP:SPAMNAMESee also: Wikipedia:Sock puppetry#Role accountsUnambiguous use of a name or URL of a company, group or product as a username is not permitted. A username that is the name of a company or group implies the intent to promote this group. Accordingly, such usernames may be indefinitely blocked. Even if the name is ambiguous, accounts with a company or group name as a username may be indefinitely blocked if their editing behavior appears to be promotional.Accounts that represent an entire group or company are not permitted no matter the name; see Sharing accounts below. Please note that promotional editing is not permitted regardless of user name, and avoid editing articles with which you may have a conflict of interest. If you choose to edit articles that are in any way related to your company or group, you will need to carefully follow Wikipedia's guide to editing with a conflict of interest.Non-English usernamesSee also: Wikipedia:Signatures#Non-LatinThere is no requirement that usernames be in English. Furthermore, contributors are welcome to use usernames that are not spelled using the Latin alphabet, but should bear in mind that scripts of non-Latin languages (such as Arabic, Cyrillic, Chinese, Greek or Japanese) are illegible to most contributors to the English Wikipedia. To avoid confusion and aid navigation, users with such usernames are encouraged to use Latin characters in their signature.Similar usernamesUsernames that are very similar to existing ones can only be created by administrators and Account Creators; if you wish to use such a username, you may request its creation at Wikipedia:Request an account. You must not use a username that could easily be confused with that of an active contributor; a username that is similar only to unused or inactive accounts should not be a problem. Special:Listusers can be used to check for such usernames. The program that checks for similarity is a bit over-sensitiveif the username is different enough as to prevent other people from confusing the two users, the account should be approved regardless of how active the existing account is.If your username is similar to that of another contributor or an article, you may wish to provide some form of disambiguation, for example by adding {{thisuser}} to the top of your user page. Linking to user pages within articles is not permitted.Dealing with inappropriate usernamesPolicy shortcut:WP:BADNAMEIf you have encountered an inappropriate username  in particular, a username that is misleading, promotional, offensive, or disruptive as described above, you have several different options for how to proceed. You should choose one based on the severity of the problem, and based on what resolution would be the best for Wikipedia. Use common sense in making your choice, and avoid biting the newbies.Talk to the userMany users who create new usernames have not read this policy. If you see a username that is problematic but was not obviously created in bad faith, you should make an attempt to encourage the user to create a new account with a better username. Often, the problem can be cleared up in an amicable way. If you want, you can use the {{subst:uw-username}} template for this.Request for CommentIf you are uncertain about whether a user should be blocked over their username  for example, if you have discussed a problem with their username with them, but they refuse to change it  you can open a Request for Comment on the username, inviting other users to discuss whether to allow or block the name. Ensure that you have first attempted dialogue with the user regarding the name issue on their talk page, and that you have given them time to respond. As always, consider leaving well enough alone and assume good faith when dealing with usernames that do not unambiguously step out of bounds.Blatant violationsIf you think a username needs to be immediately blocked and is an obvious case, you should report it to Usernames for administrator attention noticeboard.Conflict of interestIf the username simply indicates that the user has a conflict of interest, without otherwise being an inappropriate username, report it at the Conflict of Interest Noticeboard. Additionally, you can use the template {{subst:uw-coi-username}}.Other policiesThe username policy does not have to override other policies. If you find a user who is spamming or vandalizing under a bad username, for example, you should follow up using the spam or vandalism policy.Except in very clear-cut cases, it is preferable that you report users to these noticeboards only when they have made at least one recent edit. This avoids spending unnecessary effort on blocking accounts that are never going to be used again, or used at all. Having at least one edit to examine also helps by providing some evidence of whether or not the user intends to edit in good faith.If the problem is not with the username, but the fact that the username draws attention to another problem such as vandalism, it is usually better to block for the bigger problem and not the smaller one. A vandal or spammer with a confusing username, for example, should be reported to the Administrator intervention against vandalism noticeboard so they can be blocked for vandalism or spam. The username will help to clarify that they are editing disruptively.Confusing usernamesPolicy shortcut:WP:UNCONFSome usernames appear problematic without fitting clearly into one of the four categories. This is often the case with confusing or extremely lengthy usernames, which are highly discouraged but which are not so inappropriate on their own that they require an immediate block.Confusing usernames can often be a red flag for other problems. An editor with a confusing username or signature may be blocked sooner than usual for other inappropriate behavior such as disruption or vandalism, if their confusing username contributes to the disruption. As with all other blocks, admins should use their discretion and common sense.Usernames for Administrator Attention guidelinesUsernames for administrator attention is a noticeboard for drawing attention to abusive usernames quickly. See Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention/Instructions for information on how to place or resolve UAA reports, including the options that are available to administrators.Changing your usernamePolicy shortcut:WP:UNCUsernames can be changed by bureaucrats; requests should be made at Wikipedia:Changing username. User accounts with few or no edits will not normally be renamed, as it is quicker and easier to simply create a new account.Once a username has been changed, existing contributions will be listed under the new name in page histories, diffs, logs, and user contributions. Signatures on discussion pages will continue to use the old name; while these can be changed manually, it is not recommended unless a contributor wishes to remove as much information as possible about their former name for privacy reasons. In such situations the old name will still be available in old versions of discussion pages. Username changes are listed in the user rename log.Deleting an accountIt is not possible to delete user accounts, as all contributions must be assigned to some identifier; either a username or, in the case of anonymous contributions, an IP address. Editors seeking privacy per their right to vanish can have their accounts renamed and their user pages and (in some cases) user talk pages deleted.Sharing accountsPolicy shortcut:WP:NOSHAREUser accounts can only represent individuals. Sharing an account  or the password to an account  with others is not permitted, and doing so will result in the account being blocked.Exceptions to this rule are limited to accounts that directly represent the Wikimedia Foundation or internal Wikipedia committees, and bot accounts that are maintained by more than one contributor, provided the existence of such an arrangement is made clear and has consensus.Using multiple accountsPolicy shortcut:WP:MULTIPLEMain page: Wikipedia:Sock puppetryIt is recommended that contributors not use multiple accounts without good reason. For example, a user may wish to create an alternate account for use on public computers as a precaution to keep their primary account more secure. Contributors operating any sort of automated editing process should do so under an alternative bot account. It is recommended that multiple accounts be identified as such on their user pages; templates such as {{User Alternate Acct}} may be used for this purpose.The use of multiple accounts outside of established policy for doing so is known as sock puppetry, and is not permitted. For example, multiple accounts may not be used to comment on proposals or requests, cast votes, or engage in edit warring.Policies apply to individuals, not accounts. Blocked or banned users must not use sock puppets to circumvent a block; doing so will result in an extension of the block or ban.See alsoWikipedia:User pageHelp:Logging inWikipedia:Changing usernameWikipedia:Sock puppetryWikipedia:Usernames for administrator attentionWikipedia:Requests for comment/User namesWikipedia:Identification{{Namewarning}}vdeSock puppetryGuidanceLegitimate uses Inappropriate uses Meat puppetry Canvassing Username policy Clean start Single-purpose accountSignsMotivations List of signs Duck test An obvious sock is obvious Don't be quick to assume that someone is a sockpuppet LurkersInvestigationsTriggers Administrators instructions Requests for checkuser CheckUser criteriaConsequencesBlock BanRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Username_policy"Categories: Wikipedia policy | Wikipedia sock puppetry | Wikipedia user conduct | Wikipedia enforcement policyHidden categories: Semi-protected project pages | Wikipedia move-protected project pages Personal toolsLog in / create accountNamespacesProject pageDiscussionVariantsViewsReadView sourceView historyActionsSearchNavigationMain pageContentsFeatured contentCurrent eventsRandom articleDonate to WikipediaInteractionHelpAbout WikipediaCommunity portalRecent changesContact WikipediaToolboxWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPrint/exportCreate a bookDownload as PDFPrintable version LanguagesBosanskieskyDanskEspaolEuskaraFranaisHrvatskiBahasa IndonesiaslenskaItalianoBasa JawaMagyarBahasa MelayuPolskiRomnSimple EnglishSloveninaSloveninaSuomiSvenskaTrkeTing Vit This page was last modified on 9 January 2011 at 23:23.Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;additional terms may apply.See Terms of Use for details.Wikipedia is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization.Contact usPrivacy policyAbout WikipediaDisclaimers
