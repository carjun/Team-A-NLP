It is in their instinct to hunt down and kill. Even   though you provide a gourmet diet for kitty, he still needs to practice his   hunting skills whether you like it or not. Predatory behavior is often   characterized by long periods of lying in wait and stalking followed by an   explosion of activity - the attack. It's common for a cat to creep up to a   sleeping owner and playfully attack them in bed. Some cats sit quietly, staring   at a wiggling toe then with lightening speed, they pounce and attack. Other cats   lie in wait under furniture until a foot passes by, then their claw reaches out   and grabs. Cat play is an extension of their predatory nature. It provides the   cat with the opportunity to develop and sharpen its hunting skills, even if it   never needs to go out and catch its own dinner. Although your cat may be   playing, playful bites can still hurt and cause injury.  Fear and Anger Aggression  Cats that have not been adequately gentled and socialized during kitten hood   are generally suspicious and fearful of people. If they don't like being   approached, touched, handled or picked up, they often tell you so by biting and   scratching. Even cats that are socialized can become angry or frightened in certain   situations. Maybe they don't like being picked up by a stranger (the vet) and   getting jabbed with a needle (routine vaccination). Some cats are fine until its   bath time. Every cat has its limits. The more gentling and socialization kitty   receives during kitten hood, the less likely a situation will come up that will   frighten or anger the cat.  Once a cat learns that its aggressive display is successful at warding off   the perceived threat, the more likely the cat will act aggressive again. In   other words, the cat is rewarded for acting aggressive because the threat or   annoyance goes away. In this case, we have unintentionally trained the cat to be   aggressive. If I reached out to pet a cat and it aggressively struck out at me,   I most certainly would obediently withdraw. I don't want to get scratched or   bitten. Now the behavior becomes even more difficult to cure and the cat more   dangerous to handle. This almost sounds like a no-win situation, but never fear,   remedies for this type of behavior will be covered, so read on!  Territorial and Protective Aggression  This type of aggression is usually very specific and the result of lack of   socialization. If a cat had been socialized with people coming and going into   his space - but never had another animal trespass onto his territory in his   presence, he will fight ferociously and furiously for their territory. A mother   cat may also fight or attack to protect her kittens  Over Stimulation and Excitement Aggression  An often perplexing case history involves a cat that one moment lies   peacefully purring on the owner's lap, happily accepting affection; and the next   moment, erupts into a rage of claws and teeth. The owner is shocked by the   sudden attack. It's actually normal behavior for cats to have quick reversals of   mood and behavior. There's a fine line between enjoyable petting and irritating   handling. Once the petting reaches a certain threshold, the cat will reject any   further touching. The cat says, "Stop it!" by biting or scratching. Perhaps a   sensitive or painful area was unknowingly touched. Continuous pleasurable   stimulation can overexcite the cat causing aggressive behavior. The cat becomes   sexually excited and the resulting aggression is a part of normal sexual   behavior.  Health  Sometimes a cat will suddenly act aggressive for medical reasons. Any   abnormal behavior or sudden change in behavior should be checked out by your   veterinarian as soon as possible. If you spend time with your cat and get to   know him, you will notice any changes in his behavior and habits right away. If   there is a sudden change, don't assume your cat is misbehaving. Check with your   veterinarian first. If kitty gets a clean bill of health, then look at it from   the behavioral viewpoint.  Remedies for Aggression and Cat Biting Common Sense  When trying to solve any problem, especially with cats, it is important to be   realistic and patient. Don't push your cat beyond his limits then get frustrated   because he isn't living up to your expectations. Give him some considerations   and don't expect him to necessarily change to suit you.  If your cat often becomes over-stimulated with 5 minutes of petting and   stroking, then stop at 3 minutes. Don't push him over the edge and then wonder   why he bit you! In this type of situation, cats usually give other warning signs   that they are going to bite. Watch your cat and notice his body language when he   gets over stimulated or irritated. Usually the ears will flatten, he will turn   and stare at you, or his tail will start to flick. If your cat has lived all his   life in a quiet, private home and you suddenly bring in a bus load of noisy,   rambunctious children, don't expect your cat to accept this.  Training a cat to stop play biting is relatively easy with both adult cats   and kittens. However, training a cat not to bite in fear and anger is best and   most easily accomplished in kitten hood. If you have an older cat who has been   biting for many years, it is going to take much more time and energy to cure it.   But this doesn't mean you shouldn't start. Many older cats can be taught to   accept situations without reacting aggressively. It just takes longer and   requires more of your patience. However, the payoff is tremendously gratifying.    No Biting Allowed  Play sessions provide the best opportunity to teach your cat not to bite,   scratch or play- attack you. Playtime is the best time to teach your cat that he   must be careful and gentle. The cat is only allowed to play using his paws, not   his claws. He should learn never to bite you.  Start by enticing kitty into a gentle game of play fighting. Continuously   praise the cat all the time he remains gentle. Gradually increase the excitement   and intensity of the game, keeping your eyes glued to kitty. As soon as you see   that the cat is getting too excited or he begins to expose his claws or teeth,   immediately freeze and "play dead." This usually causes a cat to calm down and   retract its claws. If kitty complies, then resume playing. If not, the play must   not resume until kitty calms down and retracts his claws. If kitty bites hard or   scratches you, sharply scream "OUCH," immediately stop playing, walk away and   ignore him.  Cats, especially kittens, love to play. Abruptly ending a play session is an   extremely powerful reprimand. With a few repetitions, kitty will learn that it   is his own overly rambunctious or aggressive behavior that brings an end to all   the fun. While your cat is learning not to bite and claw you, it is equally as   important that you provide kitty with something he can pounce on, attack, grab   with his claws and sink his teeth into.  Unless your cat has real prey to hunt, you are going to have to provide the   play prey. If you simply toss a few toys on the floor, your cat may give them a   few swats then quickly lose interest. It is up to you to make the toys fun. Play   should be an interactive game between you and your cat. Tie a toy to the end of   a length of string. Drag it around your house with kitty in pouncing pursuit.   Pet stores are full of both inexpensive and exotic toys for your cat. Use your   imagination and create your own toys. The idea is to stimulate your cat's   interest and participation. Two 15 minute play sessions a day will work wonders   in venting your cats excess energy as well as fulfilling his predatory   instincts.  Socialization  If you do not want your cat to be fearful of or aggressive towards people   (including children), other cats or even dogs, it is best to socialize them as   kittens. Socialization in kitten hood has a pronounced and long lasting effect   on the cat's personality. If a kitten is raised in a large active home with   several children, other pets and frequent visitors coming and going, then as an   adult, it will readily accept strangers. If the cat grows up in a quiet home   with a single owner, then as an adult, it will most likely react adversely when   approached and touched by strangers.  If you want your cat to socialize freely and happily, you must give it plenty   of opportunity as a kitten to socialize and play with different people, friendly   cats and dogs. Most kittens are not threatened by strangers, so socializing them   is easy. It is essential that these early experiences are fun and rewarding. If   your cat has a terrifying experience as a kitten, then it will most likely   remain fearful of these events into adulthood. Don't wait until your cat is in   emergency need of veterinary attention before getting it used to a veterinary   exam. Don't wait until your cat's hair is matted before getting it used to being   groomed. Start socializing and getting your cat used to being touched and   handled before your cat has any unpleasant experiences. To assure that your cat   doesn't become permanently frightened of strangers, vet exams, grooming   procedures, etc., make sure that it learns to enjoy these experiences early in   life.  Take time to acquaint kitty with being touched and handled everywhere. Teach   your cat to enjoy being picked up and hugged. First these exercises need to be   done by the adult owners of the cat. Then the exercises need to be done by other   friendly adults. When the cat is comfortable with being touched, examined and   hugged by strangers, it is now time to teach children how to touch and handle   the cat under your supervision. For adult cats that already feel threatened by   the presence of strangers, the socialization process is much more time   consuming. Adult cats must be given more time to familiarize themselves with   strangers. If your cat is nervous around people, don't let these people approach   your cat. They will just further frighten him. You should also not force your   cat to meet strangers. Instead, give your cat the opportunity to approach the   stranger on his own. It may take hours, it may take weeks. But until your cat   approaches on his own terms, and finds that nothing bad happens, he will not   develop his own confidence to trust people. You can speed up the process by   starting with a hungry cat and a trail of extremely tasty treats leading up to   the stranger. Each step the cat takes toward the person is rewarded with a   treat. With this set up, you and the other person should sit quietly and let the   cat approach. The hungrier the cat and the better the treat, the quicker the cat   will approach and overcome its fear.  However, if the cat is so fearful that it is inhibited from eating in front   of the stranger, then the person should be several rooms away while the cat is   eating its treats. Food treats should only be available when a visitor is in the   house. As the cat becomes used to eating with someone else in the house, then   the cat and person can slowly be brought closer and closer together. The first   week they are 3 rooms away from each other, the second week they are 2 rooms   away, and so on until they can both be present in the same room. Then you can   start to trail the treats up to the visitor.  Once your cat is comfortable with the presence of strangers, the next step   will be to accustom your cat to being touched. The ultimate goal is to ensure   that your cat will never react badly when handled or restrained. Begin the   exercises when your cat is relaxed and content. Start off by handling the cat in   ways that it already finds pleasurable, such as scratching the top of the head   or on its back at the base of the tail. As the exercise proceeds, the stroking,   touching and petting should become more vigorous and include more of the cat's   body. All the time the cat remains relaxed, praise him profusely. Work slowly   and gradually increase the area of the cat's body that is touched. You can   continue the handling exercises whenever your cat is hungry. Offer a special   treat in exchange for the cat allowing you to give his teeth a quick   examination. Offer another treat in exchange for the cat allowing you to peek   inside his ear. Examine between kitty's toes then immediately reward him with   another of his special food treats. When your cat is in a playful mood,   incorporate handling and touching with a play session. Convince kitty that being   touched is all part of the fun and games. He should not be able to distinguish   between play and grooming or between affection and restraint (hugging).  If at anytime kitty objects to these exercises, you simply deny the treat or   stop the play session. Eventually your cat will learn to enjoy being touched and   handled. This will happen extremely quickly with a kitten. It will take more   time with an adult cat and even more time and patience with an already fearful   cat. Again, first work on developing your cat's trust and confidence in   yourself. Then introduce adult strangers, then children under your supervision.   When introducing your cat to another pet, make sure the other cat or dog is one   that is already friendly and well socialized with cats.  copyright 1995-2004 Gwen Bohnenkamp, Perfect Pawshttp://www.perfectpaws.com/agg.htmlCopyright  2007, Pets911.comNEWSLocal NewsTexas HeadlinesNational NewsInternational NewsStrange NewsFood For ThoughtDayBreak TodayWEATHERInteractive RadarMaps and Media CenterPersonal Forecast ToolsExpanded CoverageWeather PetsHEALTHWISESpecial TopicsHealthWise at 5SPORTS                    Mascot Mania                    End ZoneI Beat PetePee Wee TVRaiderZone.comCOMMUNITYBest of West 2010Noon NotebookEvent CalendarContestsRecipesKCBD.com E-InfoPROGRAMMINGCONTACT USKCBD StaffKCBD JobsAll content  Copyright 2000 - 2011 WorldNow and KCBD, a Raycom Media Station.
