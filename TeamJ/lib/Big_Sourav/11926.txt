To make this thread more current, I did find this article from yesterday:  Kentucky Senate OKs Ultrasound Before Abortion Bill | LifeNews.com    It seems ignorance is a major problem amongst those who choose to abort:    Now, pro-abortion activists like to say that this ultrasound is medically unnecessary but that is simply not true. A pee test does not confirm a viable pregnancy. Even a blood test does not confirm a viable pregnancy. hCG levels can rise even when there is an ectopic pregnancy (which can become life-threatening), a molar pregnancy (which can pose a cancer danger) or a blighted ovum (hormones are produced but no fetal pole develops and thus, no baby). An ultrasound is the ONLY way to accurately diagnose a pregnancy, and thus, doctors must perform these before they can even say "Yes, there is a pregnancy. Would you like to abort?" This whole issue came to mind yesterday, we just found out I am pregnant and I had my first ultrasound at 6 weeks. The heart is already beating at 118 bpm and it is CLEARLY visible on the ultrasound screen. It was one of the most awesome things I have ever seen.  I also want to point out that 6 weeks along is only two weeks after the missed period, and I practically had to force my way into the OB's office to be seen this early.  Most girls who are pregnant would probably be AT LEAST at this stage of the game before they even figured out that they are pregnant, and thus, yes, the heart would be beating and would be clearly visible on the monitor.  After I saw our child's heart beating yesterday, I started to wonder how anybody could terminate a pregnancy after having seen that. Well, 80% of women considering an abortion don't terminate a pregnancy after seeing that. Therefore, I as a pro-lifer, I believe that this legislation would help in reducing the number of abortions. What does everyone think? How would this legislation help or harm the women, the children and the medical community? If you saw your child's heart beating, would you still be able to have an abortion?    I think a woman has a right to choose what to do with her uterus and her eyeballs. Let's just make it the whole body.  Oh, edit, I wonder if we should have a doctor show some films of a man and womn with one kid, having a good time, and a man and woman and TWO kids, having a good time, before the man gets a vasectomy. DUDE, WHAT IF? I can see it from the pro life side - killing is wrong. And I can see it from the pro-choice side, and I don't think I have the right.... wait, let me put it this way.  If you were married and your husband told you that you can't have an abortion, you wouldn't right? Because he said so, right? It's the law of the husband, right? Just do what he says, and things will be OK. Replace husband with government and it's still just as stupid-sounding. God, what a terrible choice for a woman to have to make. Of course, there are some who believe women should have no choice. About this. Choices about voting, equal rights, etc., what about those? Oh, sure.. but it's a BABY!  God ordered armies to kill babies in the Bible.   Isaiah 13:15-18    Context  13:15 Everyone who is caught will be stabbed;everyone who is seized 1 will die 2 by the sword.  13:16 Their children will be smashed to pieces before their very eyes;their houses will be lootedand their wives raped.  13:17 Look, I am stirring up the Medes to attack them; 3 they are not concerned about silver,nor are they interested in gold. 4   13:18 Their arrows will cut young men to ribbons; 5 they have no compassion on a persons offspring, 6 they will not 7 look with pity on children.

That assumes fetus have rights other then those specifically carved out by state, or federal legislatures e.g. the right to inherit property in certain circumstances.  This is not the case.

Just that you should look that baby in the face and wish it a wonderful journey into the after life before you kill it. Do you have a problem with making people responsible for their actions? The rape and incest argument means nothing to me as they account for less than 1/10th of 1 percent off all abortions.

That may be what you want, but the government should not be run according to what an individual, or even a majority of people want, if that involves interfering with an individual's stated rights.

Again I am not for removing the right of abortion. Read my posts. You want an abortion fine, here is what you need to do. Look at the life you are killing. If you weren't educated to this fact already, there are limitations and restrictions on every one's rights. If not then Obama would have no problem with me growing my own pot for my own consumption. Oh wait I can't its against federal law.

If you saw your child's heart beating, would you still be able to have an abortion?    Amazing that you lived in Florida and didn't know "this" was going on in ft. Pierce........did you recently have an opportunity to see the documentary? Of course REQUIRING a person to have an ultrasound is intended only to influence that decision.(see "Anne's favorite quotes below)....as anti-choice people well know, and in fact USE as a deceptive practice to TRY to influence a person's decision, as clearly shown in the documentary)......so, YES, absolutely such legislation would clearly be just another tactic to interfer with a woman's right to CHOOSE.  12th & Delaware.........excellent....on HBO.   Marcia G. Yerman: '12th & Delaware' Joins the HBO Summer Documentary Series On August 2, the 80-minute cinema verite production 12th & Delaware has its debut... This time they explore the white-hot struggle over abortion. 12th & Delaware utilizes a street intersection in Fort Pierce, Florida, to illustrate the deep ideological divide between two camps of thought. The metaphor emanates from the physical proximity of two facilities located across the road from each other. One is an abortion clinic called A Woman's World. The other is an office named the Pregnancy Care Center We meet Anne, the director of the Pregnancy Care Center, who explains her commitment to her work... The center's offer of a free ultrasound is particularly persuasive, especially for those without insurance.The camera follows Anne during her intake consultations, and then monitors her comments to her staff. "She's abortion-minded," or "Let's look for a heartbeat to influence her decision," are favorites.

Oh wait I can't its against federal law.    There are limitations to people's rights, but the government must have an arguably valid reason as to why it is in the public's interest to place limits on those rights.  There is no valid reason here, a health reason was given, but if that was the case shouldn't the law require ultrasounds for all pregnancies instead of specifically singling out people seeking abortions?  You cannot just restrict people rights, because of what you think is fair, or moral.                    Yesterday, 12:54 PM          70Ford  Oh, yeah!
