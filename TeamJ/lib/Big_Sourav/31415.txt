While digging, I came across a memo that shows once more how deeply invested Tanton really has been in the white nationalist movement. Dated March 2, 1993, the memo is entitled SECOND DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR LEADERs.The document, housed in a university library in Michigan, is addressed to three principals of Americas white nationalist movement: Sam Francis, the late editor of the Citizens Informer journal, which is published by the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC); Jared Taylor, editor of the race-science newsletter American Renaissance; and Wayne Lutton, a member of several hate groups who is a former editorial advisor to the CCC and a current board member of American Renaissances parent organization, the New Century Foundation. Most importantly, Lutton has worked for years from the same office as Tanton in Petoskey, Mich., where the men put out the nativist hate journal, The Social Contract.Tantons 1993 memo, along with an accompanying draft proposal, are a summation of the discussions these men had over the creation of a new organization dreamed up by Tanton and tentatively called the League for European-American Defense, Education and Research or, to use Tantons shorthand, LEADERs. The memo suggests that the group knew LEADERs, which never came into being, would be controversial and that all involved needed to be careful with their words. Tanton warned that the organization should have a cultural denotation, not a racial one, even if the two are roughly equivalent: European-American rather than white.

He also declined to say if the device was intended to be detonated remotely or by a timer.It had the potential to detonate during a unity march on the King Holiday, so, obviously it had political or social overtones, Harrill said.

The federal trial of three police officers accused of trying to cover up the murder of an undocumented Mexican immigrant  a hate crime that drew the nations attention to violence against Hispanics two years ago  opened this week with a focus on the small Northeast Pennsylvania coal town of Shenandoah. There, prosecutors say, police offered special consideration for its favored white sons and their parents, instead of following the dictates of the law.Former Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and two others in the department  Lt. William Moyer and Patrolman Jason Hayes  face a host of federal charges, including conspiracy and obstruction of justice for orchestrating what prosecutors say was a swift cover-up of the circumstances of Ramirezs death.In her opening statement, federal prosecutor Myesha Braden said the 2008 beating death of Luis Ramirez was swept under the rug to protect his assailants from embarrassment and prosecution. Like teachers and doctors, police officers are intimately connected with American culture. They are expected to protect and serve. This is a case of police officers who decided to do the opposite of what they were expected to do, Braden told the all-white jury.The fatal fight happened on July 12, 2008, when Derrick Donchak , Brandon Piekarsky, Colin Walsh and Brian Scully were among a group of teenagers who had left a block party where they had been drinking. They came across Ramirez in a park with a white girl and started calling Ramirez a fucking spic, and taunting him with threats such as Go back to Mexico, and Tell your fucking Mexican friends to get the fuck out of Shenandoah, according to testimony and the federal indictment. A fight erupted and the teens, some grasping chunks of metal to harden the impact of their punches, ganged up on Ramirez until he was knocked unconscious. Piekarsky was convicted of kicking Ramirez in the head when he was down  later determined to have been the fatal strike.

Its another thing altogether to claim that an organization isnt what it is.In the immediate wake of the Jan. 9 Tucson shooting  in which six people died and 13, including Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, were injured Fox News ran with a document supposedly leaked from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security suggesting that the presumed shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, had ties to the white nationalist journal American Renaissance (AR).That report turned out to be erroneous; the document didnt come from DHS but the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center, a local law enforcement agency. The documents contents, meant only for internal consumption, were speculative and, ultimately, almost certainly inaccurate. Fox News later had to refute its own scoop.Right-wing propagandist extraordinaire Cliff Kincaid, principal of the ironically named Accuracy in Media website, quickly seized on Foxs gaffe. But it wasnt to criticize weak journalism or to refute the idea that Loughner might have been a racially motivated killer. It was to take up the American Renaissance banner.

However, along with its long-time support for birther arguments and dark warnings about the Federal Reserve, the site also is thick with hard-line anti-gay propagandizing. In November 2010, for example, WND released an edition of its magazine devoted entirely to Americas Gay Obsession. It included articles by long-time anti-gay propagandists like Peter LaBarbera, who directs the hate group Americans for Truth about Homosexuality and was recently heard fretting about gay TSA agents accosting people in security lines. But thats par for the course for an online publication that once ran a six-part series on how soy products cause homosexuality.So it should come as no surprise that WND is now selling a new edition of the anti-gay fairy tale, The Pink Swastika, via its website.Written by Kevin Abrams and anti-gay activist Scott Lively, whose Abiding Truth Ministries is an SPLC-designated hate group, the book claims that the Nazi Party was full of homosexual men who largely orchestrated the Holocaust. In fact, according to the books authors, the Nazi party was entirely controlled by militaristic male homosexuals throughout its short history. Furthermore, Lively and Abrams argue, persecution of homosexuals during Nazi Germany is largely a myth.

Gabrielle Giffords.In a flier posted to the WBC website, the group, whose members plan to picket the funerals of those murdered, writes, God appointed this rod for your sins! God sent the shooter! The flier continues, Your federal judge is dead and your (fag-promoting, baby-killing, proud-sinner) Congresswoman fights for her life. God is avenging Himself on this rebellious house! WBC prays for your destruction  more shooters, more dead carcasses piling up, young, old, leader and commoner  all. Your doom is upon you!Blatant support for the alleged shooter, Jared Loughner, also came from Bostjan Avsec, who put up a facebook page FREE Jared Loughner NOW!!!! Avsec, who describes himself as a nationalist by right of my European ancestors, ascribes Loughners actions to having found himself like [sic] entire Arizona in what was just yesterday a predominately white habitat to what is today non English Mexican/black/Jewish terror state!!!!A posting on the shootings at the neo-Nazi White Revolutions website is nearly as poisonous. Under the headline Another Jew-related Mass Murder, Giffords is described as a Jewess feminist whose Jewish roots run deep. The post alleges that Jews are prone to mass murder and speculates that Loughner was Jewish as well. Amy Bishop, a Jewish biology professor at the University of Alabama, shot three persons to death less than a year ago, the site reminds its neo-Nazi supporters.

Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, a right-wing extremist?Its hard to say. When you look at the Internet material he purportedly produced, the first impression you get is that the 22-year-old now in custody for the shooting of 20 people in Tucson was completely out of his mind, or at least mildly deranged. His writings will be virtually impossible for most people to understand, what with his runs of unexplained numbers, his fondness for weird syllogisms, his mysterious references and his apparent semi-literacy.That said, there are some clues.At one point, Loughner refers disparagingly to currency thats not backed by gold or silver. The idea that silver and gold are the only constitutional money is widespread in the antigovernment Patriot movement that produced so much violence in the 1990s. Its linked to the core Patriot theory that the Federal Reserve is actually a private corporation run for the benefit of unnamed international bankers. So-called Patriots say paper money  what they refer to with a sneer as Federal Reserve notes  is not lawful.

And, indeed, many of its contributors are military veterans or veterans advocates from across the political spectrum. VT also offers some information about veterans benefits (lifted from the Veterans Administration) and links to home and other loans for vets.But start reading the posts, and youll find something else entirely: myriad claims that there was a conspiracy behind 9/11 (Israel orchestrated it, in cahoots with the American government), that the American government is a puppet (of Israel), that the Holocaust never happened or was greatly exaggerated (Jews made it up to manipulate non-Jews), and, most recently, that Julian Assange, the man behind Wikileaks, is a pawn (of Israel).Notice a theme?

Years after the trial, White listed personal and contact information about the juror on his website and wrote that he played a leading role in inciting both the conviction and the harsh sentence that followed, although he did not directly propose violence against him. The jury today found that even though he didnt call for a specific attack on Hale juror A, that didnt matter in the context of other postings on the site.A judge in 2009 had dismissed the charge against White, saying he broke no laws because the information he posted was publicly available. But the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, finding that a jury should hear the case.

The group seeks to end the amendments provision of birthright citizenship, which assured that the children of slaves could not be denied citizenship, and ensures that almost all children born on U.S. soil are automatically granted American citizenship.Children born to the undocumented have long been a bugaboo for the anti-immigrant movement, which derisively refers to these new American citizens as anchor babies  purportedly used by their parents to gain U.S. citizenship for themselves.SLLI is a coalition of about 70 legislators in 38 states dedicated to eliminating economic attractions for immigrants and their unlawful invasion of the U.S. SLLI leader Daryl Metcalf of Pennsylvania has a long history of making nasty anti-immigrant comments, including referring to undocumented immigrants as foreign invaders and their children as anchor bab[ies]. In October, Metcalf announced a new SLLI task force to attack birthright citizenship. This ongoing distortion and twisting of the 14th Amendment greatly incentivized foreign invaders to violate our border, Metcalf said at an October press conference.This harsh rhetoric isnt surprising given the relationship between Metcalf, SLLI and the anti-immigrant hate group, Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). SLLI is often described as the legislative arm of FAIR, which is apt given the group says on its website that it has a working partnership with FAIR. SLLIs legislators are the main instigators behind favored FAIR initiatives, including attempts at the state level to deny immigrants various rights through laws modeled on Arizonas S.B. 1070.
