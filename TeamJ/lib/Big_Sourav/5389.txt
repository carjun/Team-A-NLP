Gates to China    Chengdu :  China|Jan 06, 2011By T. Job Anbalagan        2 0     Views: 337      Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, on a mission to resuscitate moribund military relations with China, is likely to arrive in Beijing for talks with the nation's top military leaders on Sunday. But at an airfield in Chengdu, China's military leaders have already rolled out a welcome for him by displaying their J-20, a radar-evading jet fighter that has the same two angled tailfins that are the trademark of the Pentagon's own stealth fighter, the F-22 Raptor. China has developed this jet after many years. It is China's first stealth plane. It has undergone preliminary tests and has been made public. Now it is going to be tested during this week on the runway of the Aviation Design Institute in Chengdu, a site chosen by China to showcase its military prowess. They want to show the U. S., show Mr. Gates, their muscle. Though it is generally claimed by military analysts that China remains a generation or more behind the United States in military technology, and even further behind in deploying battle-tested versions of its most sophisticated naval and air capabilities. China has the intention of becoming a peer military power of the United States. Though it denies its intentions over the years, it is now unveiling capabilities that suggest that it intends, sooner or later, to be able to challenge American forces in the Pacific.  The timing of this display is no coincidence with the visit of the US dignitary. After years of top-secret development, the jet -- China's first stealth plane -- was put through what appear to be preliminary, but also very public, tests this week on the runway of the Aviation Design Institute in Chengdu, a site so open that aircraft enthusiasts often gather there to snap photos. It is also reported that apart from the J-20, China has designed a midair-refuelable, missile-capable jet designed to fly far beyond Chinese borders and is now refitting a Soviet-era Ukrainian aircraft carrier -- China's first such power-projecting ship. China is presently constructing one or more carriers in in Shanghai. China could launch several carriers by 2020, the Pentagon stated in a 2009 report.  The military's nuclear deterrent, estimated by experts to be numbering more than 160 warheads, has been redeployed since 2008 onto mobile launchers and advanced submarines that no longer are sitting ducks for attackers. Multiple-warhead missiles are widely presumed to come next. China's 60-boat submarine fleet, already Asia's largest, is being refurbished with super-quiet nuclear-powered vessels and a second generation of ballistic-missile-equipped subs. Above all, a widely anticipated antiship ballistic missile, called a "carrier-killer" with its power to strike the big carriers at the heart of the American naval presence in the Pacific, appears to be approaching deployment.

In that view, the Pentagon's long-term strategy is to cement in Central Asia the sorts of partnerships it has built on China's eastern flank in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.      T.
