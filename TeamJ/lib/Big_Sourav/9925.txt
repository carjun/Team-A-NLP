The reader can use the free information in this Library topic, along with other Library topics that are referencedthe not for profitThe process you use to form a not-for profit organization also known as an organization without share capital will depend upon the rules and regulations in effect where you reside.  The links accompanying this hub will help those who live in the United States or Canada get the formalities rolling.  However, before you start reading the legal jargon or filling our forms, I want to share the experience I have gained through setting up not-for-profits organizations over a 25 years span.   The first and perhaps most important step is to have a clear understanding of why you want to create a not-for-profit. Are you planning to champion a cause, poverty, the environment, violence or another issue that is dear to yoru heart?  Or are you planning to create a charity to raise funds for a good cause?  There is a legal difference between an organization that raises funds for good works and an organization that advocates for political justice.    So why do you want to create this organization? If you plan to raise funds you will want to register as a charity so that you can give tax receipts to the donors, but if you also do political work you may not be allowed to register as a charity. Find out what the rules are where you live. A trip to the public library can help.  You are going to need to develop a mission statement and your ability to articulate why you want to set up the organization in the first place will go along way to getting that done. The mission statement is a brief statement of the purpose of your organization.  This next step is the one I believe is the most important unlike a for profit business an individual cannot setup a not for profit organization. Once again depending upon the rules in place where you live you will need from three to five people including you.  This group will at first be the organizations steering committee; the people who guide the not for profit through the process from dream to reality. They may also become the agencys first board members or will help recruit board members.  Once you have the reason worked out why you want to create a not for profit look for people who will share this interest and have a degree of passion for the project.  Passion is important because in the early stages no one is getting paid.  The development of a not for profit is not an overnight activity and it is well worth it to take the time to find people you can and want to work with as it will save you heartache and disappointment down the road.  If you already have your members then you are well on your way.  Once you have the steering committee in place you can work on your mission statement. From the mission statement will flow the organizations goals and objectives.  You will also need a set of bylaws to govern the agency. The bylaws set out the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors, how frequent meetings of the Board take palce and other operational issues.  This is the point were a lawyer comes in handy, especially if you are going for charitable status but regardless of that, you want to get the wording correct and be sure that you have dotted all the Is and crossed all the Ts.  If you think about the not for profit incorporation process as being similar to preparing a business plan you will be in the right head space to bring it all together.  Are you planning to be an employee of this organization; in other words are you doing the work to create a job for yourself?  If the answer is yes consider setting up a company to do the same thing.  Why? A not for profit is governed by a Board of Directors who do the staffing, especially in the beginning. You cannot sit on the Board and apply for a job at the same time.  This brings us back to the purpose of setting up a not for profit, the why. I have worked and am working with people who want to address various issues, in some case a not for profit was necessary, but in others, there was little need for the formal organization.  Then, if you still want to proceed find out the rules and regulations governing the start up and registration of a corporation without share capital or a not for profit; now proceed one step at a time. vote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...? Useful (6)Funny Awesome Beautiful CommentsScottie JD2 years ago Really good article Bob, very usefulBob Ewing2 years ago Thanks Scottie.Dorsi2 years ago Thanks Bob for answering this request. Since you have experience in this maybe I can pick your brain a bit. I am thinking of starting a non-profit bringing art programs into the community. My idea is that the classes are free for parents, so that all kids can have access to art. Yes I do want to create a job for myself however, preferably in the actual teaching- but I do have several people that would help me, and serve on a board. The idea is to have several teachers, different mediums to work with, which of course all cost money. So what do you think?This is a passion of mine, I really don't want to start another "regular" business, I want these art classes to be free. So I guess I would need to be out there writing for grant funds and such. Bob Ewing2 years ago This appears to be a good idea and if you have the board members then you could be the employee; you may still have to go through a formal hiring process,especially if government/ the peoples' money is involved.finding the first round of funding can be difficult especially for a new organization. It is hard to shrink this down into this space but I'd start with detailing the benefits the program will bring, then who will use the program and are there any other similar programs in the region. lori7632 years ago It's good to have resources.  Thanks.Bob Ewing2 years ago True enough thanks for the visit.earnestshub23 months ago Thanks Bob, I am in Australia, but I read this anyway, and it seems the rules are at least similar here.Funding is probably a bit thin here at the momentBob Ewing23 months ago I sense funding is tight everywhere which means the one needs to be well prepared when seeking funds. Glad this hub was useful. Thanks for stopping by.one day22 months ago Question; When do you HAVE to register for your organization?Bob Ewing22 months ago The rules depend upon where you live. Usually you do not register until you have the paperwork complete.One Day22 months ago I live in Canada, and just started a Organization called One Day.. (we're focused on diversity) and I have a friend told me that "I don't have to register" but I'm researching to make sure.. Bob Ewing22 months ago Is it a federal or provincial organization?Meskarune19 months ago Thanks for writting this. There is certainly a lot of paper work and bussinesss sense involved with creating non-profits. Getting a lawyers help (exspeically in the US) might be a good idea for some people too.

I live in northern Indiana, can I do this?  I am currently enrolled in online college in HealthcareAdministration, any suggetsions?Bob Ewing4 months ago Check the state laws, a visit to a nearby public library is a good start. Ask them for information re: start up of non-profit.Lifeallstar13 months ago Bob, great hub! I'm curious about something you said. The part about employee vs board is a little confusing to me. If you're an officer of a non profit corp, can't you get paid for all the time you need to put in? You want the control of your organization and you also need to put in a lot of time so another job would be out of the question. Can't you get paid to cover your personal expenses like a job? Thanks for your help. JessBob Ewing3 months ago As  member of the board you do not get a salary.Adrian3 months ago Hello Bob,this is a great overview of the mindset and what is required to start a non-profit organization. I am just wondering if you know of a step-by-step guide to aid in the process of starting such an organization?Bob Ewing3 months ago which country?Adrian3 months ago for Canada.ThanksBob Ewing3 months ago try this http://www.charityvillage.com/cv/guides/guide4.aspmandie3 months ago this is all very usefull. after reading a few comments, im thinking i dont fall under a npo. i want to start an orgainzations that helps soldiers and their loved ones. there are alot of girlfriends and fiances that have no resorces for help cuz to the govt we dont matter. we didnt rush in to get married like some others before our soldiers deployed.. im the one that has created the idea and i have a few others that believe the same as i, but im scared of having a board, so then would i just have to become a business and incorporate?Bob Ewing3 months ago If you become a business what would you sell; or how would you make the money to run the organization. You may want to do this on a volunteer basis.Jeff4 weeks ago Interesting article.If I start off a non profit organization, and being on the board at the start, while everything we do is volunteer work, but a year or 2 down the line, it becomes a full time job, that requires one of the board members to become an employee, how would that work?Bob Ewing4 weeks ago 1st check local regulations, however, board member would have to resign board position. Why would the full time position require a board member?Jeff4 weeks ago Thanks for the quick answer Bob, I guess I am confused about the whole board member responsibility.I thought if I am starting up a non profit, with a few people that believe in my project, the board is a requirement. So logically I would start off as a board member?We will do most of the work on a volunteer basis, but if everything does go according to plan, then it will require a full time position and volunteering is just not possible anymore.I guess I don't understand why a board member cannot be an employee. So does this mean, that whomever sits on the board of any non profit company, never draws a salary?Bob Ewing4 weeks ago Board members do not draw a salary, they are volunteers who oversee the organization, in order to ensure that it is fisicaly responsible and stays true to its mandate.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites97Bob EwingFrom New Brunswick1316 Followers602 HubsJoined 3 years agoRead more hubs by Bob EwingContact Bob EwingFollow Bob EwingSubscribe to Bob Ewing's RSS feedAnswers The QuestionHow do you start a non-profit organization?asked by Dorsi 2 years ago2 answersAnswer this question Ask a QuestionAsk Bob Ewing a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsWhat are the benefits of giving donations to non-profit organizations.asked by ProCW 2 years ago4 answersAnswer this questionHow do I know if an organization is legit.
