The VA only gives me 50 strips every three months for my other meter. The strips for that meter are about $1 each. When you have little real income and no other health coverage you buy where you can afford.

You have to watch them all the time though - they tripped me up on some dried 1lb legumes a few weeks ago - 1.18 a bag.  Safeway had them for .88.  Kind of pissed me off and once again I vowed not to buy anything I didn't check on at Safeway first.  sigh.They really are NOT cheaper for the majority of groceries.

Plus as we have seen from this thread there are DUers who are employed by Walmart.  What, are they supposed to quit their jobs because it upsets other DUers.Please, have the courage of your convictions--just don't try to impose them on others or judge others because they do not share your convictions.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLucian      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 08:49 PMResponse to Reply #1921.Oh I share their convictions.I've done a lot of research on Walmart, and many of their clothes, especially their Faded Glory brand, are made in children's sweatshops in China and Bangladesh. Children make two cents for every pair of jeans they make, and they're supposed to make between 10 to 20 per hour.Walmart treats their employees like dog poop, management makes us work past our scheduled time (it even goes against Walmart's own policies), and they make us do work that's not even related to our job description. It's not even a reasonable request.As soon as I can afford not to, I'm never shopping at a Walmart again. But for now, I'll have to tough it up and work there for the time being.

The law was passed in response to the construction of a Home Depot 10 years ago (right next to where they're building the WalMart.) Local anon. agitators are now postering and graffiting the neighborhood of their intentions to burn both down. So glad I work on the other side of town and live in the 'burbs.

In fact, I have gotten stuff for free, or had them pay me to take stuff on several occasions.  Anything I can't get at the grocery store, I can get at Target, Roses, drug stores, Home Depot or Lowes for as good, if not better prices.  I spent 20 minutes in the Walmart looking for their "extra low prices".  I never saw them.
