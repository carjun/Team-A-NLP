What I am defending is the real rights of women. A woman should have the right to be in the home as a wife and mother. Phyllis SchlaflySchlaflys discussion reveals a paradox.

And he was the only OBcean who had personally met the Outer Space People when they came visiting, and he alone was authorized to sell tickets for spaceship rides when they returned.8 commentsRead the full article US Drones patrol border as part of militarization of regionSeptember 27, 2010As Mexicans celebrated the 200th anniversary of their independence from Spain last week, evoking a history of resistance against colonialism, a disturbing development unfolds on the countrys northern border: a fleet of US Predator B drones has been deployed on constant patrol.4 commentsRead the full article I was Like a Whale Swimming in the Middle of the Sea in OBSeptember 27, 2010Man, did I have a good timein OB,much like the time a whaleI saw in a watercoloron a tablein the middle of the streetseemed to be havingto me -8 commentsRead the full article Obama Will Triumph  So Will AmericaSeptember 26, 2010Editor: Despite the following being nine months old, we thought wed share it.By Frank SchaefferBefore hed served even one year President Obama lost the support of the easily distracted left and engendered the white hot rage of the hate-filled right.

If he had hit either of these two things no doubt the car would have split in two, he was doing at least 70 mph at this time.

Most of us wont vote. In the 2006 California mid-term election, nearly 60% of eligible voters declined to cast a ballot. While that statistic is lamentable, heres the silver lining: a relatively small number of motivated voters can determine the tone and direction of San Diego and California.
