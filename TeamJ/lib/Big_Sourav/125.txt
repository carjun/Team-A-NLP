Since the regions became part of Indonesia in 1963,[3] the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka / OPM) has conducted a low-level struggle.[4] Flying Papuan Morning Star flag and peaceful protests are illegal and suppressed.[5][6] The area is rich in resources, fueling the conflict.[7]Contents1 Overview2 Timeline2.1 1970s2.2 1980 - 20002.3 2000s2.4 2010s3 See also4 References5 Further reading[edit] OverviewThe Free Papua Movement (Indonesian: Organisasi Papua Merdeka, abbreviated OPM) is an indigenous organization established in 1965 to promote self-determination and secession of West Papua from the Republic of Indonesia.The movement is outlawed in Indonesia, and raising the Morning Star flag and speaking in support of OPM goals are outlawed activities in Indonesia, which may incur charges of "makar" (treason).[8] Since its inception the OPM has attempted diplomatic dialogue, conducted West Papuan flag raising ceremonies (illegal under Indonesian law), and undertaken militant actions as part of the Papua Conflict. Supporters routinely display the Morning Star flag and other symbols of Papuan unity which had been adopted in the period 1961 until Indonesian administration began in May 1963 under the New York Agreement.Supporters of the organization allege the Papuan people have no ethnic, cultural or geographic ties with Indonesia; that they are a colonial people under United Nations Resolution 1541 and that they are entitled to provisions of United Nations Resolution 1514. According to OPM supporters, Indonesian administration of West Papua is a military occupation.The Indonesian government asserts that the region voted for incorporation into the Republic of Indonesia by a referendum known as the Act of Free Choice in 1969. This assertion is denied by the supporters of the organization who allege the Act of Free Choice was not voluntary and did not represent the population.[edit] Timeline1966-67: Aerial bombing of Arfak MountainsJan-Mar 1967: Aerial bombing of Ayamaru and Teminabuan areas1967: Operasi Tumpas (operation obliteration). 1,500 alleged dead in Ayamaru, Teminabuan and Inanuatan.Apr 1969: Aerial bombing of Wissel Lake District (Paniai and Enarotali area); 14,000 survivors escape into the jungle.[edit] 1970sMay 1970: Massacre of women and children by Indonesian troops.
