Gabrielle Giffords after the tragic shooting on Saturday that left her in critical condition and claimed the lives of six of her supporters. Dr. Peter Rhee, trauma medical director at the University Medical Center, and Dr. Michael Lemole, the universitys chief of neurosurgery told reporters at a press conference Sunday afternoon that a bullet went through the left side of Giffords brain, but she was still able to respond nonverbally to simple commands. It could be anything as simple as please squeeze your hand or show us two fingers  very simple  but one thing I want to emphasize here is we take those kinds of simple commands for granted, but they imply a very high level of function in the brain, Lemole said. Officials at the University Medical Center credited several reasons for Giffords survival, including good luck and the fact that she was in the operating room only 38 minutes from the time of the shooting where doctors worked to reduce pressure and swelling in her head by removing bone fragments and a small amount of damaged tissue. Dr. Manny Alvarez, senior managing health editor at FoxNews.com said this type of procedure is key to survival with severe head trauma patients. After you go and clean the broken pieces of bone fragments after a gunshot wound, typically you cauterize any broken vessels, you remove any small particles that you find, and a lot of times, what they do is put an ICP Monitor (intracranial pressure monitor) to monitor the swelling, Alvarez said. Surgeons had to remove part of Giffords skull, most likely employing whats called a decompressive craniectomy, to allow the swelling brain to expand without being squeezed  something Alvarez said is indicative to the severity of the injury. Right now, in half of her brain, she doesn't have a skull, Rhee told reporters. Its preserved in the hospital right now so we can re-implant that later on.        8 of 8         RIP Gabrielle Giffords & others     Majid Qureshi is based in Karchi, Sind, Pakistan,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (36.5%) Pakistan (10.6%) Taiwan (7.1%) Italy (5.9%) 13 other countries (34.1%)           READ MORE: Peter Rhee, Dr. Manny Alvarez, Michael Lemole, health-news, Pakistan, Karachi, Gabrielle Giffords, Neurosurgery, Decompressive craniectomy, medicine, head injury, Neurotrauma, Manny Alvarez, surgery, University Medical Center, Health Medical Pharma   More News From: Karchi :  Pakistan     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Gabrielle Giffords is Able to Communicate By: sawangr8      U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona remains in critical condition after being shot in the head by a man who opened fire at her community meeting in Tucson, killing six people including a federal judge.Doctors treating Giffords report that they are very, very encouraged by her ability to respond to simple commands ...  about 6 hours ago     Federal Charges Filed Against Suspected Arizona Gunman By: KaziMajid      Federal charges have been filed against Jared Lee Loughner, the suspected gunman in a shooting rampage at a Safeway supermarket in Arizona that left six dead and 13 wounded, including Rep.
