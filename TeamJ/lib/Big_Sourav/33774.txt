We call ourselves Cats in Action or CIA for short. We conduct most of our important work when our people are asleep at night and just like that other CIA that we have heard about on the news, we do the majority of our duty work in secret.My name is Peaches and I am going to tell this story because Dusty has already had his chance to put his thoughts on paper. If you want to read some of what he has had to say you can look at his hub: http://hubpages.com/hub/My-Life-as-the-Top-Cat BTW...he thinks that he is the "top cat" and he tries to act like it, but I have him curled around my dainty front paw and that is the truth of the matter.I had my mommy put some of our pictures in this hub so that you can see just how pretty we are and how much we make our people happy. They like taking photographs and looking at our cat pictures for some reason. I don't really understand it since they have the real thing...us!...to hold and cuddle.

Well, my first ride since I've been here. Pat seemed to think I might enjoy one and she was right.   She had to go to town during her... - 3 months agoOnce a year our two legged people (poor things...only having two legs!) celebrate a birthday. They think it is a big deal. Today, May 27th is one of those days.It is no big deal to us because we have so many lives that we don't even try and keep track of them! They even named a can of cat food after our noted longevity. It is called 9 Lives!Well, I had better get to the subject at paws...Our mother has not been feeling really good lately. She stuck a funny thing in her mouth that she called a thermometer and we heard her tell our daddy that she had a sub-normal temperature. Because of that, she has been sleeping in the other room at night away from our daddy in his big bed. She said that she did not want him to get sick.Dusty and I talked it over and we thought that she was really being nice to our daddy. We didn't want him to get sick either. Then we would have double the work to do! Mommy has a television in what she calls the guest room and she has had it on at night when she cannot sleep. Because Dusty and I think that we should keep her company, we have been listening to all kinds of shows with lots of serious sounding people on them. Charlie Rose is one person my mommy listens to on that talking box. Something called CSPAN is another television show.The other night as we were lounging about within ear distance, we heard our club, the CIA mentioned! Of course our ears were extra perky and we tried to make heads or tails out of what we were hearing.It seems that someone called Nancy Pelosi has said bad things about the CIA. We listened really hard and really do not understand why she said that the CIA did not inform something called Congress about all the things that they were doing. Other people think that this Nancy is not telling the truth. Some people want this matter investigated further.This is not a purring matter!We thought that our secret alliance, Cats in Action, was unique. Now we find out that there is another group doing something like we do. Amazing! What Dusty and I really do not understand is why they had to copy our CIA club name. Couldn't they come up with something else to call themselves?Both of us lounge around during the day getting enough sleep so that we can prowl around at night staying alert and keeping our people safe while they are sleeping. We hold our jobs to be of the utmost importance and very secret. We won't be telling Congress or anyone else for that matter what we do for our people to keep them safe. It is our secret and will stay that way.Sometimes we leave little tell tale signs around so that our people can appreciate all the work we do. We shed our hair so that they can appreciate all the places that have been under surveillance both day and night.We have trained our mommy to leave the closet door in the guest bedroom cracked open so that we can make sure things in there are OK also. We hate to have to wake her up by meowing in the middle of the night to do that for us, but we will if she forgets. Who knows what could be in the recesses of that closet? And lately, Dusty has wanted to make sure that things outside the window are also how they should be overnight. So he has started batting at the blinds at night so mommy will pull them up and he can lay on top of the dresser and keep watch.Our people should feel so safe with us around to watch out after them!Since TODAY is our mommy's birthday, we thought that we should get her up earlier than normal so that she could enjoy more hours with us doing our best to show her that we love her.She had forgotten to pull the blind up last night so Dusty could do his sentry duty. So at 4:30 this morning he started rattling the blinds until she got out of bed. He just wanted her to be extra safe especially on her special day!Since I knew that she was awake, I leaped up in bed and started licking her showing her how much I loved her. I cuddled and did some of my most excellent purring.Dusty and I know that she still has some hubs to write to meet that challenge of doing 30 in 30 days. We have heard her talking about it to our daddy. We decided that we would take turns keeping her company when she is at the computer. I decided that I'll let Dusty have that honor first and when he wants to stretch his legs, I'll take up that important duty.We heard our parents talking earlier today about maybe going out to dinner tonight. It seems to us that there is plenty of food in the house. Neither Dusty nor I know why they would have to go elsewhere to celebrate? After all, we are here for them! Isn't that enough?We'll just have to wait and see what happens. If they all leave the house, we have to stand guard and be ready to greet them at the back door when they get back home. This interrupts some of our sleep, but I guess that is the least we can do for them.They are pretty good people, even if they do only have two legs. They seem to love us and we do our best to care for them in our special ways.I'll have to do some extra rubbing against my mommy today and stay close by and do some extra purring for her birthday. She should like that!After this gets published, I just want those CIA people to know Cats in Action will continue doing our best to do our duty to help protect our special people. It is Dusty's and my honor bound pledge to protect those we love.. I just hope that if we hear more about you on television, we hear that you are doing an equally good job. The two of us can only do so much!Have your cats become members of the CIA? Yes, ours are also members of Cats in Action! Nope...ours are still in the dark.
