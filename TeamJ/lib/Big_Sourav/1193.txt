President Barack Obama sees "glimmers of hope" in the US economy, citing a pick-up in lending to small businesses and lower mortgage rates as signs that the country is weathering the financial crisis. Obama said that reports the economy is growing again and that more than 1 million jobs were saved or created by his stimulus plan show "we are moving in the right direction."  He used his weekly radio and Internet address Saturday to discuss the latest economic news and press for bipartisan action in the newly divided Congress on measures to spur growth. Obama presented the December jobs report in a positive light even though it fell short of what economists had been looking for and even though the drop in unemployment came partly because some people stopped looking for work. Obama attributed increasingly optimistic economic forecasts in part to the tax cut deal he negotiated last month with Republicans to extend BushBush-era tax rates for all, along with unemployment benefits, a payroll tax cut and other tax breaks. Lets build on that admirable example. Republicans devoted their weekly address to spotlighting steps being taken by the new Republican House of Representatives majority, including trimming House members operating budgets and, more importantly, moving to repeal Obamas signature health care law. The Republican party contends the law extending coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans is a budget-busting job-killer, although the Congressional Budget Office said this week that repealing it would cost billions because the laws numerous taxes, fees and cuts in Medicare spending would be lost. Although the repeal is not expected to pass the Senate and would certainly be vetoed by Obama, new House majority leader, Republican Rep. Eric CantorEric Cantor pledged that Republicans would try to replace it with a new vision to improve our health-care system without bankrupting our country. We will provide Americans with the mainstream solutions they were denied when Democrats used dubious procedural tactics to jam through the bill along strictly partisan lines, Cantor said. He urged businesses to take advantage of provisions including one that allows businesses to write off 100 percent of their capital investment expenses in 2011. And the president said that the deal stands as an example of how Washington should work as he confronts a Congress where Republicans just assumed the majority in the House and expanded their ranks in the Senate. "What we can't do is refight the battles of the past two years that distract us from the hard work of moving our economy forward. What we can't do is engage in the kinds of symbolic battles that so often consume Washington while the rest of America waits for us to solve problems," the president said. "The tax cuts and other progress we made in December were a much-needed departure from that pattern. Let's build on that admirable example." Looking ahead, the best boost that Congress can provide to the economy is to send a credible signal that we are serious about cutting spending and eliminating job-killing regulations, he said. Our surging debt burden hangs over the economy like a dark cloud, waiting to unleash a storm of inflation, higher taxes and higher borrowing costs upon businesses and families. Only when the cloud is lifted can we get on the path to long-term growth.  Barack Obama will sketch new ideas for creating jobs in the unemployment-scarred economy, amid signs of tempered optimism in the White House after a brutal economic year. Obama will give a major speech on the economy at the Brookings Institution in Washington, encouraged by data showing growth returning, and the rise in job losses slowing to a crawl.        1 of 35         US House Republican Leaders Boehner and Cantor talk to reporters at the US Capitol in Washington      smzafar is based in Islamabad, Federal Capital Area, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (75.0%) India (9.4%) Pakistan (9.4%) New Zealand (3.1%) Norway (3.1%)           READ MORE: Shaukat Masood Zafar, Pakistan, ISLAMABAD, USA, Obama, Economy, growth, unemployment, Punahou School alumni, Barack Obama, Republican Party of Florida, right direction, Democratic Party, used economy, United States presidential election, Congressional Budget Office, Politics of the United States, economy moving, political-news, Washington, tax cut, Seattle, Obama&rsquo, Eric Cantor, business-news, George W.
