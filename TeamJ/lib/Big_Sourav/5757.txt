January 7th is Xmas according to Julian calendar    Brandon :  Canada|Jan 07, 2011By northsunm32        4 0     Views: 353       Many Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas according to the Julian calendar on January 7th. New Years will be on the 14th. Last night the sixth was Xmas Eve.  There are fesitivites held in many places including BethlehemBethlehem at the Church of the Nativity.In Moscow President Medvedev and his wife attended services in Moscow. Not just Russian but Romanian Ukrainian and other orthodox Christian groups celebrate Xmas at this time.  Here in our village of Oakburn the population is mostly of Ukrainian descent in spite of the Scotch name. As a result Xmas lights stay up until after January 7th since quite a few still celebrate then. Many leave the lights up until New Years on the 14th.   The lights brighten up the long winter nights. The village itself mounts displays as well as those on local houses. A rather unique feature is the Disney Xmas display. I guess that is an Orthodox Disney Celebration. I have a photo as the report image. I also include several local houses that are decorated and the town welcome sign. Happy Orthodox Xmas everyone.        1 of 5              Celbration of Orthodox Xmas      northsunm32 is based in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (45.9%) United Kingdom (10.4%) Canada (8.1%) France (6.7%) 24 other countries (22.2%)           READ MORE: Orthodox Xmas, xmas lights, Walt Disney, Canada, Manitoba, Religion Belief, arts culture, Bethlehem, xmas, Ukraine, new year, orthodox church, Dmitry Medvedev, christmas, julian calendar   More News From: Brandon :  Canada     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     Gino C.
