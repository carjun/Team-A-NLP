Useful (1)Funny Awesome Beautiful History of the Domesticated DogDogs are Not AccessoriesCommentsWrite On!2 years ago Whitney -This is an excellent overview of how to choose and care for a new puppy, or dog.  Great links for everything a perspective pet owner will need to know to get things started.I am all about pet adoption.  So many pets need homes today.  I recently heard a local report in California about this very need.  Apparently, Riverside County is having the worse time nationwide with foreclosures on homes.This has created a huge problem for the county.  People have been abandoning thier animals left and right... just like the homes that they can no longer afford, nor choose to be accountable for.  Pretty sad, huh?Great hub.Write On!

It was a long one to gather up all the previously written hubs about the subject, and as you can see I have 3 more on my que to write up (plus a few APBT ones not listed here).I think it is sad that people are having to put their dogs up for adoption because of foreclosures.
