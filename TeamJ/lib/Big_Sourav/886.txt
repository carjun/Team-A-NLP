It first went on sale in the United Kingdom in 1905.Contents1 History1.1 2003 relaunch2 Production2.1 Fairtrade3 Pre-2007 advertising4 Glass and a Half Full Productions4.1 Glass and a Half Full Records5 Recalls6 Varieties6.1 India6.2 Pakistan6.3 United Kingdom6.4 Ireland6.5 Australia and New Zealand6.6 Canada7 References8 External links[edit] HistoryIn June 1905, Cadbury launched its first Dairy Milk bar, with a higher proportion of milk than previous chocolate bars, and it became the company's best selling product by 1913. George Cadbury Jnr, responsible for the development of the bar, has said "All sorts of names were suggested: Highland Milk, Jersey and Dairy Maid. But when a customers daughter suggested Dairy Milk, the name stuck.".[1] Fruit and Nut was introduced as part of the Dairy Milk line in 1928, soon followed by Whole Nut in 1933. In 1933 dairy milk went out of production briefly then came back in 1934. By this point, Cadbury's was the brand leader in the United Kingdom.[2] In 1928, Cadbury's introduced the "glass and a half" slogan to accompany the Dairy Milk bar.[3] I[edit] 2003 relaunch[edit] ProductionMany of the newer Dairy Milk varieties are now manufactured in the Republic of Ireland, France and Poland. Aficionados[who?] complain that the product no longer tastes as good and has lost its creamy texture. Dairy Milk itself is also manufactured in France and these products are sold in the UK. In early 2006, Cadbury changed the weight of its medium bars from 200g to 250g, effectively phasing out the 200g "Wafer" bar, as the way it was manufactured did not allow for it to be manufactured as a 250g bar.[citation needed] Several reformulated versions are sold in the United States as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not allow products that replace cocoa butter with vegetable fat to be called chocolate.In Australia, Cadbury Dairy Milk was reformulated in 2006 and again in 2009, with the addition of palm oil as a replacement for some cocoa butter. This occurred in conjunction with a weight reduction of the standard block from 250g to 200g. There has been some outcry over the reduction in block size while the price stayed the same, although Cadbury states that the wholesale cost per gram should be the same and the retailers may not have adjusted their prices.[4][5] In August 2009, Cadbury announced it would return to a Cocoa Butter only formula due to a poor response from consumers.[6]Dairy Milk is sold in the United States under the Cadbury label, but it is manufactured by The Hershey Company in Pennsylvania.[edit] FairtradeCadbury secured Fairtrade certification for solid-chocolate Dairy Milk bars in the UK and Ireland in 2009, with the first bars bearing the Fairtrade Mark produced on 21 July 2009.[7] The company has since announced plans to roll out Fairtrade-certified Dairy Milk bars in Australia and New Zealand (and by extension Japan) in spring 2010, and in Canada that summer.[8][edit] Pre-2007 advertisingDairy Milk has always tried to keep a strong association with milk, with slogans such as "a glass and a half of full cream milk in every half pound" and advertisements that feature a glass of milk pouring out and forming the bar.A campaign for the Fruit & Nut variety ("everyone's a fruit and nutcase") was particularly memorable and featured the writer, radio and television personality Frank Muir.On 9 March 1976, American singer Neil Diamond performed a concert televised throughout Australia during which he did a humorous live commercial for Dairy Milk. This concert, including the ad as a bonus selection, was released on DVD on 1 July 2008.In 2004, Cadbury started a series of television advertisements in the United Kingdom and Ireland featuring a person and an animal representing the person's happiness debating whether to eat one of a range of bars including Dairy Milk.[edit] Glass and a Half Full ProductionsIn 2007, Cadbury launched a new advertising campaign entitled Gorilla, from a new in-house production company called "Glass And A Half Full Productions".[9] The advert was premired during the season finale of Big Brother 2007, and consists of a gorilla at a drum kit, drumming along to the Phil Collins song "In the Air Tonight".[10] It is supposed to relate the joy of playing drums to that of eating a chocolate bar.[11] The advert has now become extremely popular with over three million views on Youtube, and put the Phil Collins hit back into the UK charts.On 28 March 2008, the second Dairy Milk advert produced by Glass and a Half Full Productions aired. It features several trucks at night on an empty runway at a airport racing to the tune of Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now".[12] The ad campaign ran at the same time as the problems at Heathrow Terminal 5 with baggage handling; in the advert baggage was scattered across the runway.[13]On 5 September 2008, the Gorilla advert was relaunched with a new soundtrack Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart" a reference to online mash-ups of the commercial. Similarly, a version of the truck advert appeared, using Bon Jovi's song "Livin' on a Prayer". Both remakes premiered once again during the finale of Big Brother 2008[14]In January 2009, another new advert was released, of two children moving their eyebrows up and down rapidly to a set electro-funk beat: "Don't Stop the Rock" by Freestyle.[15]In April 2010 a fifth advert aired, containing a scientist mixing milk and chocolate to make a dairy milk bar to the tune of ' The Only One I Know ' by The Charlatans.[edit] Glass and a Half Full RecordsA new 'record label' was launched as part of the Glass and a Half Full Productions campaign. The first song released was Zingolo featuring Tinny, to promote Fairtrade Dairy Milk. A full music video was made incorporating the 60 second ads, as well as a Facebook page.[edit] RecallsCadbury was fined GB1 million in July 2007 due to its products having been found to have been at risk of infection with salmonella (at a factory in Marlbrook, Herefordshire). They spent a further 30 million decontaminating the factory.[16]On 14 September 2007, Cadbury Schweppes investigated a manufacturing error over allergy warnings, recalling for the second time in two years thousands of chocolate bars. A printing mistake at the Keynsham factory resulted in the omission of nut allergy labels from 250g Dairy Milk Double Chocolate bars.The 2008 Chinese milk scandal did not leave Cadbury unaffected, after many mainland Chinese manufactured Dairy Milk (trademark of Cadbury) were tainted with melamine. Melamine is a toxic chemical, particularly to infants, which may be safely used in plastic manufacturing. Recycled melamine typically cannot be used for plastic manufacturing hence is rather cheap to purchase ($100USD/tonne) and thus is often used in mainland Chinese dairy manufacturing to "trick" protein content testing methods to suggest a higher than actual protein level exists.[17][edit] VarietiesLists of miscellaneous information should be avoided.
