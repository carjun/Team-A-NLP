With the score tied at 4, Damon took the batters box. After battling Philadelphia Phillies ace Brad LidgeBrad Lidge through a nine-pitch, two-out duel, Damon slapped a single to left to board first base.  The next turn of events didnt seem like something of the World Baseball Champion caliber by the Phillies. With Mark TeixeiraMark Teixeira facing Lidge, the entire Phillies squad shifted right to protect against the heavy pulling first baseman. This left the Third baseman Pedro FelizPedro Feliz as the virtual Shortstop and the stop gap in the event Damon tried to steal second. In fact, Damon not only tried but succeeded. But, on the throw to second base Damon realized that nobody was covering third so he stole that one too. Two for one. The air of 46,000 Philadelphia fans collectively stopped. "It all happened so fast," Lidge told ESPN after the game. The double steal wreaked havoc on any momentum Philadelphia had until that point. Lidge beamed Teixeira and Yankees Third baseman Alex RodriguezAlex Rodriguez wacked a solid double down the left field line. Damon scored and positioned Teixeira at third. Cather Jorge PosadaJorge Posada singled to bring in the last two Yankee scores. Uber reliever Mariano RiveraMariano Rivera closed out any hopes of Philadelphia to square the Series with three straight outs. Even longtime coach and veteran player Tony Pena had to shake his head at Damons move. "You know how people always tell you that they've been in baseball for 40 years, 50 years, and things happen every game that they never saw?" the Yankees coach said, after his Sunday night had turned into Monday morning and he was still trying to digest one of the most astonishing finishes to any game in his 35 seasons in baseball. "Well, I've never seen that before," said Pena. "I never saw that before in my life."
