John McCain (R-AZ), she blamed the controversy over her use of gun imagery on the media. We know violence isnt the answer, Palin said before a group of about two thousand people. When we take up our arms, were talking about our vote. This B.S. coming from the lamestream media lately about us inciting violence, dont let the conversation be subverted, dont let a conversation like that get you off track.She knew it was about guns and is admitting so here.

This is an example of the level of development of a kid under the age of seven or so, whose fear of getting punished by someone from the outside is the main driving force, rather than a sense that something is intrinsically right and wrong.  A kid at that stage will lie, will actually believe their imaginary friend did it, will reinvent history, will think magic can make it unhappen, etc.  In an adult or in a societal norm it's sociopathy.

She urged teams to "shoot with accuracy; aim high and remember it takes blood, sweat and tears to win." She says "bombing through the press" is part of what teams must do to help reach their goals."To the teams that desire making it this far next year: Gear up! In the battle, set your sights on next season's targets! From the shot across the bow  the first second's tip-off  your leaders will be in the enemy's crosshairs, so you must execute strong defensive tactics," she wrote. "You won't win only playing defense, so get on offense!""If the other side tries to push back," she added later, "your attitude should be 'go for it.' Get in their faces and argue with them."Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbigpenguin      (108 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:20 PMResponse to Original message32.This alsois disgusting in the fact that I never wanted to see the words "Palin" and "taint" in the same post.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 10:10 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss General DiscussionPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
