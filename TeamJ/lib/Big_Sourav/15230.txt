He bounced in and out of private, public, and home school systems before finally dropping out about halfway through his third freshman year of junior college.  Politicized at an early age by his father, his interest has always been in opposition politics, though his slant toward progressive ideas developed later.  At 13, he started working in a bicycle shop and had his own parts-and-repair business operating by 16.  After a brief stint in banking (he was fired for performing his job too effectively), he's returned to the family real estate brokerage with his father and sister.  He currently resides in the southern portion of OB with his partner and elementary-age daughter.Dave has written 18 articles for the OB Rag!An Ode to My Cat (or why my Christmas was a downer).December 26, 2010Its 5:35 in the morning, December 26, when I finally begin to type. Ive been sitting here for almost four hours now, operating on something like three hours sleep in as many days waiting for the words to start flowing, or for the bottle of rum at my side to take effect and begin to lull me off to a dreamless sleep.Last night was Christmas Eve  even though were not a true Christian family as much as we are a sloppy mixture of agnosticism and Wicca with a dose of traditional Christian values thrown in 6 commentsRead the full article Terriers lightening round: Recaps of Episodes 6  9November 24, 2010Episode #12 is on tonight, Wednesday, November 24th, on FX (ch 43 on Cox Cable) at 10:00 pm.

Theres a new episode airing tonight, check it outheres another recap from a couple weeks back that well call Manifest Destiny, (mainly because thats what the writers would like us to call it)and if you find yourself confused click here.We leave our heroes heading down to the police station for questioning about the disappearance of Robert Lindus (which they know nothing about), with Steph hovering over his corpse in Hanks bathtub. Down at the station, the boys deny all of Mrs. Lindus story, including the true part about their abducting Lindus thats verified by the couples two children.3 commentsRead the full article Terriers  Recap of Episode #4  FustercluckNovember 8, 2010Welcome back, brave souls whove endured my first three rambling diatribes! I see no reason to bore you with much off-topic banter, so lets launch into Fustercluck, the fourth installment in the new Terriers series.If youre new and lost, click on my name at the top of the article and youll be linked to previous articles that will bring you up to date, along with other things Ive written that, due to the quality of content, should not be viewed by anyone.We open to Hank, sleepless at half past four, trying to catch the rats that hes been hearing scurrying around in the night and presumably eating all his food. Bummed out with his kill rate of zero, he cruises down to the Old Townhouse Restaurant to meet Britt for breakfast.4 commentsRead the full article Recap of Terriers Episode #3November 4, 2010Hi kids! Welcome to our third and much-delayed Terriers recap.The series by now is really starting to take shape, and going forward focuses a little less on character development and more on the weekly plot, making me think my initial classification of the show as a soap opera mightve been a bit dramatic. As other (professional) critics have decided, this is a show that can be picked up and watched one episode at a time, though the back story tying the series together is what turns the show into something I really want to watch. Some of the best dialogue I can remember seeing on TV and the occasional hey, I hang out there! moments dont hurt either.6 commentsRead the full article Terriers  Episode 2 RecapNovember 3, 2010Welcome to week two of what looks to be, should it survive through the end of the season, the longest-running TV show set in Ocean Beach. I dont think its going to overtake Almost Famous as the most prominent showcase of our town on film, but its still garnering some attention. Whether thats a good thing or a bad thing, and whether we the townspeople as a whole benefit or suffer as a result is certainly debatable, but for right now Im focusing this article series on the show itself, for those that would rather just catch Cliffs Notes on the storyline.4 commentsRead the full article Catchin up on Terriers: The Pilot  First EpisodeOctober 26, 2010As a rule, I hate soap operas for several reasons. First, Im not that big on TV in the first place, and when I do watch I tend toward news or other politically relevant programming. Since I dont watch a lot of television, I cant be counted on to plop my butt on the couch at precisely the same time week after week to vegetate for an hour or more, so I think I should be able to pick up and put down a show as I please. South Park works for this, but if I miss an episode or three of a soap, Im lost and might as well go find a magazine article or Rag post to feed my decidedly inattentive attention span.11 commentsRead the full article OB Planning Board: Kevin and the Amazing Technicolor ToiletJuly 8, 2010by Dave RiceIn a proposal originally scheduled to run from 6:10 to 6:30 at the Ocean Beach Planning Board this Wednesday evening, Kevin deFreitas, a local architect based in Point Loma, delivered a nearly hour-long sermon on his vision of blending local landscape, culture, and . . . feces.North OB has been without public facilities since late last year, when the original bathrooms constructed in 1964 were demolished due to concerns about the structural integrity of the roof.77 commentsRead the full article Another Local Bank FailsMay 19, 2010On May 7, the FDIC placed 1st Pacific Bank, headquartered in San Diego, into receivership, effectively ending the banks operations. They then immediately turned over the banks assets, including $291 million in deposits at seven area branches, to City National Bank. City National previously operated 73 branches, mostly in New York City, the San Francisco Bay area, and Los Angeles.4 commentsRead the full article Were Watching You  Surveillance Cameras to Be Installed On OB Pier and Around Mission BayMarch 22, 2010City Government Enters Official Bid Process for Public Surveillance System In Beach Areas  Including OB PierWinston Smith, youd better touch those toes. And dont bend your knees to do it either, because Big Brothers watching, and if you cheat, hes gonna know. [Editor: in case you are not familiar with the novel, Winston Smith is the main character in George Orwell's "1984."]It may be a couple decades late, but 1984 has finally arrived  government surveillance cameras are soon to be installed in a handful of locations along the San Diego coast, kicking off a program that seems destined for expansion into a spectrum that could one day encompass every public space in America (and whatever private spaces arent protected by a heat-shielding drawn curtain). It might soon be time to bust out those tin-foil-lined hats.56 commentsRead the full article More thoughts on the tsunami tea party rallyFebruary 28, 2010I went down to check out this whole Tea Party extravaganza today. This is my take on it, or at least a list of random thoughts I had and a list of things I saw todayI headed down a bit late, probably shouldve been out by 10:15 instead of 10:40. Oh well. Street parking was scarce, but there were some terrific displays of capitalism, namely empty Ace parking lots charging $10 to get in. I parked a mile or so away and walked first along the bay side of Harbor drive, about 10 minutes after the 11 a.m. rally was scheduled to begin. I dont know how many the teabaggers were claiming would attend or how many theyre going to claim did, but by my estimate they got maybe 250  I heard some other estimates in the low 300s, which are entirely feasible too, as a few more people trickled in until noon or so.15 commentsRead the full article More on the rich, the middle class, taxes and the tea baggersFebruary 20, 2010Perfectly Legal by David Cay Johnston and Whats the Matter With Kansas? by Thomas Frank  great starting points on whats fed up with our current tax system and why the wealthy have been able to sell a good chunk of the middle class on keeping things in their current atrocious state. Ill lend either to anyone whos interested, wouldnt mind swinging by to pick them up, and promises to either return them or pass them on to someone else.Class warfare isnt about rich vs. poor, its about middle class vs. poor. The people who are truly rich dont really care one way or another, they have enough for themselves and thats all that matters. Look at Barron Hilton  hes ran the hotel chain his family built into the ground but hes got enough money that hell never run out and his kids dont even have to bother trying to make anything of themselves ever. And if (shudder) they have kids, same deal.52 commentsRead the full article Credit Rules Change: Consumer Protections Killing Those Intended to Benefit?August 31, 2009Do you carry a credit card balance?

Can you watch a newscast without some mention of what bank is receiving TARP funds, what they are (or, rather, arent) doing with them, whos criticizing who got them, and who has a better idea about how to end the recession whilst dancing around the taboo D word decribing our current situation? How about a different look at whats going on with the banks, namely the ones that fail?5 commentsRead the full article Follow Us!
