He had come home without salary or pension. He had no income or support from the federal government other than his Army pension of $112.56 a month ... Truman had been forced to take out a loan at the National Bank in Washington in his last weeks as president to tide him over."Barack Obama bid a grateful farewell to Robert Gibbs Wednesday by stressing to The New York Times that his press secretary "had a six-year stretch now where basically he's been going 24/7 with relatively modest pay." As a senior White House aide, Gibbs modestly earned $172,200 last year. That income alone -- leaving out any earnings by his wife -- would put Gibbs in the upper 8 percent of all American families, according to 2009 Census figures.Entire article @ link:  http://www.politicsdaily.com/2011/01/06/the-underpaid-r...

Gibbs also knew all that.       "Yes, Washington and its close-in suburbs are expensive places to live. But it is a safe guess that most print reporters who pepper Gibbs with questions at his daily briefings make less than $172,000 a year -- and they somehow manage to live in Washington as well.

MOST people in Washington pay outrageous prices at the grocery store and have to budget and sacrifice in order to feed their families and keep a roof over their heads.  MOST people in Washington carry debt, and MOST people in Washington pay exorbitant prices for health insurance, or don't have insurance at all.You are describing MOST of the rich with whom President Obama and Robert Gibbs spend most of their time.

With a spouse working, that could increase the family income to $250,000 or more. Sounds like they're trying hard to define $172,000 as being a member of the elite.What next, criticizing $100,000 as being in the top 15 percent? The fact is that Gibbs' salary is equivalent to the salary of members of Congress.  Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopIgel      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 12:56 AMResponse to Reply #1920.Because "rich" was the *household* income of $250k and above.If you want to look at individuals it's half that, IIRC. $125k and above. Working spouse. Gibbs' household income is almost certainly >$250k for 2010.Gibbs salary is equivalent to that of the rank-and-file member of Congress (well, within spitting distance). With the caveat that members of Congress are required to maintain residences in their home districts. They get a per diem, but that doesn't usually cover all their DC expenses. In other words, the Congressional salaries are easier to justify at that level than Gibbs, even if we assume that Gibbs has the same kind of responsibility as elected Congressional representatives do. (I'm not going to venture that far, by any means.)The media, IMHO, is hyperventilating because wages in so much of the country are so much lower, because so many people are unemployed, because there's so much animosity towards those in the top 10% of income earners, esp. if those earners were in business, banking, industry. Meanwhile, for one of their own, some media folk thought that $172k, putting Gibbs in the top 10% of households, was modest. Insensitivity, lack of empathy, hypocrisy/double-standards. Surprised they didn't somehow claim that his salary, since it would go to so many restaurants and service providers, didn't count as some sort of stimulus package.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopEV_Ares      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 11:21 AMResponse to Reply #1923.The media is simply pointing out & asking the question is his salary reallymodest.
