We wanted to share images of the $26 million pedestrian bridge that Bauder mentions. Groundbreaking ceremonies on the Harbor Drive Pedestrian Bridge just occurred back on October 23rd. It will allow Petco Park visitors  baseball fans  easier access to the ballpark from across Harbor Drive.  San Diego says Yes to baseball. CCDC is driving this project. Now what with the Chargers revival, all of this is even more relevant.  This bridge is way more important for our civic life than branch libraries or even a new downtown one.  Easy access to baseball but not to books.3 commentsRead the full article The 10 Most Awesomely Bad Moments of the Bush PresidencyDecember 30, 2008In a lot of ways, choosing the Bush administrations 10 greatest moments  disastrous failures, all  is about as pointless as picking out your 10 least favorite hemorrhoids: There are entirely too many of them, and taken together they all add up to a throbbing mass of pain. But unfortunately, history demands that we at least make the effort so that future generations will understand why we perform voodoo rituals cursing Bushs memory before we go to bed every night.0 commentsRead the full article Book Review: Behind Enemy LinesDecember 30, 2008Author/Activist Michael Steinberg has patched together over sixty posts from over the last half dozen years, written mostly for Independent Media Centers around the country, along with a few published right here at the OB Rag.  His narratives, mostly written with a feeling of being in the heat of the moment, are grouped together into five parts: the Anti-Iraq War Movement, Post Katrina New Orleans, the Battle for Public Housing in New Orleans, Entergy Corporation and Their Nuclear Ambitions, and various Bay area protests, including the No on Prop 98 Campaign waged last year in defense of rent control in California.2 commentsRead the full article First Hand Account of Coal Ash Disaster in TennesseeDecember 30, 2008This is a monumental and unprecedented environmental catastrophe. The TVA disaster is now estimated at 5.3 million cubic yards of coal ash, or almost twice as large as the 2.8 million cubic yards generated by the World Trade Center collapse.  This spill is affecting two tributaries of the Tennessee River. The Tennessee is a major river system and a drinking water source for millions of people downstream in Chattanooga, plus Alabama, west Tennessee and Kentucky. Coal ash is the waste material captured after the coal is burned for electricity  burning coal generates about half of Americas electricity.2 commentsRead the full article National Lawyers Guild Condemns Israeli Bombardment of Gaza  San Diego Actions In ProtestDecember 29, 2008The National Lawyers Guild (NLG) condemns Israel s massive bombardment of the Gaza Strip which has left over 300 dead and 1,400 wounded, with the tolls mounting. The Israeli Air Force dropped more than 100 bombs in dozens of locations throughout the Gaza Strip as children left school on Saturday. The dead include men, women and children in school uniforms.5 commentsRead the full article A.G. Jerry Browns reversal on Prop 8: Politically courageous act of the year?December 29, 2008As the year winds down, Id like to note what I consider to be the most politically courageous act of 2008: Attorney General Jerry Browns decision to reverse his position and urge the California Supreme Court to overturn Prop. 8.2 commentsRead the full article Why is there so little mainstream coverage of death of Mike Connell  longtime Bush / Rove IT guru?December 26, 2008Mike Connell was allegedly a linchpin in the biggest maze of White House scandal this countrys ever seen, yet the national news media is a no-show. What caused Connells crash is only one piece of this story. 1 commentRead the full article Christmas Morning 2008 in the Laguna MountainsDecember 26, 2008At about the time lots of folks were sitting down to a Christmas breakfast or cleaning up the remnants of a gift exchange, Frank and I were headed east, hoping to get a break in the weather and  take a drive in our local mountains.  Heres a few shots of what we found, a winter wonderland, right here in the southland.3 commentsRead the full article Thinking About Going to DC for the Inauguration?December 26, 2008In just a few short weeks the Bush-Cheney era will be drawing to a close.  Its a pretty exciting time; lots of Americans are making plans to visit Washington DC to participate in some fashion in the inauguration of the forty-fourth President of the United States.5 commentsRead the full article Not one penny for a premature license renewal feasibility study for  San OnofreDecember 24, 2008Statewide and national media reported that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced it would be increasing oversight at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) upon discovering that an emergency backup battery system had been inoperable for the past four years due to inadequate maintenance. 0 commentsRead the full article Coal Slurry Spill Poisons Tennessee RiverDecember 24, 2008Early Monday morning a coal slurry impoundment at the TVA Kingston Power Plant near Harriman, TN burst, allowing approximately 500 million gallons of toxic coal ash to rush into the surrounding community.  There were no serious injuries  perhaps the only victory in this ordeal. Mondays spill is forty times larger than even the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, the most memorable of these unnatural disasters.3 commentsRead the full article Does Obama have the Blues? Does Santa live underwater? Slow Whales, Good Props and more December 23, 2008President-Elect Obamas initial choices for his environmental team look promising in terms of their commitment to climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, fund green jobs and develop renewable energy systems. They are certainly a breath of fresh air compared to the Lame Ducks last minute pollution exemptions. 0 commentsRead the full article Dick Cheney: The Right To Dissolve The ConstitutionDecember 22, 2008What Cheney has advanced is that the president has the right to dissolve the constitution permanently. That he has the right to commit war crimes with impunity. That there is no legal authority to which he is ever required to pay deference in a war that is his and his alone to declare and end. Now when you consider that, in Cheneys view, these war-powers are limitless, and that war is declared not by the Congress but by the president, and can be defined against a broad, amorphous enemy such as terrorism, and never end, you begin to see what a dangerous man he is, and how much danger we have all been in since he seized control of the government seven years ago.2 commentsRead the full article Republican Tech Guru and Key Witness In Ohio Election Fraud Case Killed In Suspicious CrashDecember 22, 2008Late last Friday, December 19th, Republican tech guru Mike Connell was killed in a private plane crash in Lake Township, Ohio. He was reportedly the only one on board, and no one on the ground was injured when it went down in a residential neighborhood. Best known as the well-connected GOP computer operative who had been at the center of every Republican scandal over the past 8 years, Mike Connell was a key witness in the King-Lincoln v. Blackwell lawsuit regarding fraud in the 2004 Presidential Election in Ohio.  3 commentsRead the full article Will scandal over a shady land deal between a college district and developers be buried under the rug after the DA exonerates everyone?December 20, 2008On Saturday, December 13th, the Union-Tribune ran an innocuous article entitled, DA ends probe of land sale to college, over on page B-3.  Staff writer Jennifer Vigil described very matter-of-fact-ly how the District Attorney had cleared everyone involved in a land sale to the San Diego Community College District that benefited two politically connected developers.  Does this bury the scandal? Its such a small scandal and involved our former ballpark czar Mike Madigan.5 commentsRead the full article State commission approves Sunrise Powerlink project  opponents set to appealDecember 19, 2008The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday cleared the way for construction of the Sunrise Powerlink, a contentious transmission line that promises to bring more reliable and renewable power from the Imperial Valley to San Diego. The 4-1 vote allows San Diego Gas & Electric Co. to move forward with the 123-mile, $1.9 billion power-line project, which could deliver enough electricity to serve 650,000 households.  At the same time, it was a disappointment to for many environmentalists, who worry about the effects of 150-foot-tall towers on unspoiled deserts and mountains. Corporate profit won out today, said the Sierra Clubs Micah Mitrosky.0 commentsRead the full article The Rise of Locavores   The Movement for Local Cuisine (revised)December 19, 2008President-elect Obamas choice of former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack to be Agriculture Secretary has drawn a collective thumbs down amongst progressive bloggers, perhaps best characterized by the headline at Eating Liberally: Maybe Vilsack Wont Suck?.  Gov. Vilsack is considered by many to be too close to the agribusiness industry to be able to enable the changes needed to reshape our national nutritional and food safety priorities.  Author Michael Pollan was quoted on NPR as saying: I was very disappointed in that news conference  not to hear Vilsack use the word food  or eaters. 1 commentRead the full article The Other Side of Deep Throat: He Spied On My FriendsDecember 19, 2008Ill never know for sure, but its possible that I was once on, ahem, extremely intimate terms with W. Mark Felt, the leak artist formerly known as Deep Throat who has now passed away.  Journalists and many others lionizing the former FBI official  rightly  for his contribution in helping to bring down Richard Nixon, should not overlook the fact that Felt was one of the architects of the bureaus notorious COINTELPRO domestic spying-and-burglary campaign. 0 commentsRead the full article Mark Felt  Deep Throat of Watergate Fame  Dies: American Hero or ?December 19, 2008W. Mark Felt, who was the No. 2 official at the F.B.I. when he helped bring down President Richard M. Nixon by resisting the Watergate cover-up and becoming Deep Throat, the most famous anonymous source in American history, died Thursday. He was 95 and lived in Santa Rosa, Calif.His death was confirmed by Rob Jones, his grandson.  In 2005, Mr. Felt revealed that he was the one who had secretly supplied Bob Woodward of The Washington Post with crucial leads in the Watergate affair in the early 1970s.0 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
