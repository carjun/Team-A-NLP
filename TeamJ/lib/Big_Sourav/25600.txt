Photo GalleryNovember 4, 2010The surf rolled into town on Tuesday, election day, and stayed with us over the last couple of days. At 4 pm it hit and on Wednesday morning it was a solid 8 at the pier, so reports Jim Grant  who took these amazing photos. The cliffs had some bigger sets.Jjim reported:The buoy that USED to sit off the Ocean Beach Pier started to wash ashore this evening (Wednesday) at 5:30 or so.San Diego Life Guards went out and drug it in so that surfers would not get tangled up in the long rope that was attached to a V8 motor which acted as the anchor to the buoy !!! Pretty damm funny..4 commentsRead the full article San Diegans in Big Surs CourtOctober 5, 2010It was a rainy and humid day when we packed up and headed for Big Sur last Thursday.  Patty had never driven the famous Highway 1  Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), nor had she ever seen Big Sur, and had never been to Hearst Castle. And I aimed to change all that.  With camping tent, propane stove, food for 4 days and 2 plastic chairs, we packed up the PT Cruiser and headed out of town with a big sigh  finally- !11 commentsRead the full article Jesus Comes To Comic-Con, A Photo GalleryJuly 23, 2010The kids at Comic-Con organized a spontaneous counter-demonstration in response to the pickets from the Kansas based hate group today.

I went early today and missed out on what one my usual sources called a flood of douchebags from Pacific Beach. I wonder how he knew? Do PB people have tattoos that give away their douchiness?Early turned out to be a good call as I got to see OB Oktoberfest with kind of a corny and small town feelif it were being shot for a Fellini movie.Over at the Gitmo Memorial Beer Garden, the early drinking crowds were sparse, and the staff was able to have a little fun, dancing around in their authentic Germanish costumes and posing for pictures. The best costume of the morning, however, was up on the stage, where the lead singer from a band called Way Cool, Jr. was dressed up like a Deutschland Dominatrix ala Berlin back in the day.55 commentsRead the full article Photo Gallery from Spring Valley Town Hall MeetingAugust 30, 2009Photos by Patty JonesSPRING VALLEY, CA.  Throngs came out to chant, yell, wave signs and discuss health care reform. Both the left-wing and the right-wing sent their legions to fill the auditorium in Spring Valley.  Congresswoman Susan Davis had called the town hall meeting  the only event of its kind in Southern California.These photos were taken by Patty Jones.5 commentsRead the full article Musicians Add to the OB Farmers Market FlavorAugust 20, 2009by Doug PorterSince a significant number of our readers participating in the latest OB Rag weekly poll told us that they love the music played at the OB Farmers Market, I went down on August 19th & met a few of the players.  The faces change some each week, but the vibe is always mellow.  Dont forget to leave a little spare change (or bills) in their tip jars if you enjoy the music.2 commentsRead the full article San Diego Town Hall  We Got The Last LaughAugust 18, 2009by Doug PorterCongresswoman Susan Davis spoke about health care at a town hall meeting last night (8/11/09) in the Hillcrest neighborhood of San Diego. Nearly 500 people showed up prior to the doors opening; the hall held maybe 300, lacked adequate ventilation and was supplied with a sound system that made it difficult to hear beyond the first few rows of seats. A couple of disruptors made it into the hall, but, for the most part, things ran smoothly inside.I was there along with other associates of the OB Rag . 15 commentsRead the full article Tony Messadri Surf Classic Makes a Splash at the OB PierAugust 18, 2009On Saturday August 15th, Ocean Beach witnessed the Tony Mezzadri Surf Classic at the Pier.

Acknowledging that it has been on-going here in OB since at least the early 1970s, it is important to understand it and to appreciate it when it rears its head.Many neighborhoods in major cities across the country have experienced gentrification, where older housing is torn down to make way for newer, spiffier, and more expensive homes, condos, and apartments.  The process often displaces the poorer  and in many cases  ethnic minorities  from neighborhoods that have historically been theirs.26 commentsRead the full article San Diego Gay Pride 2009July 19, 2009By Wireless MikeSaturday, July 18 marked the 35th Annual San Diego Gay Pride Parade and Festival. The parade is an annual event that draws about 160,000 spectators and 152 floats and contingents. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered people are joined by family, friends and supporters to celebrate gay life and have some fun. It started at University Avenue at Normal Street and worked its way through Hillcrest, down 6th Avenue to the northwest corner of Balboa Park.When I arrived shortly before 11:00, the sidewalks along 6th Avenue were packed with anxious spectators. The weather was the usual perfect day in San Diego. The crowd included infants in strollers, seniors on scooters, and everything in between. There were a lot of families with children. The majority of people were young to middle-aged men and women, and many same-sex couples. 8 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
