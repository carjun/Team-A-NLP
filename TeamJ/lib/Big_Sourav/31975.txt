The preliminary complaint will include the murder of Judge John Roll, and the shootings of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and several of her staffers.Formal charges are expected this afternoon, Mueller told reporters, though he said its still unclear when Loughner will first appear in court.Mueller said he was not going to preclude charges under domestic terrorism statutes as the investigation continues, and that investigation will focus in part on Loughners possible connections to white supremacist groups..Note..This Dog hopes that the case goes to the State courts alsoAnd that State prosecutors get the first try at the case.We must not let the death of the one Federal Judge however tragic overshadow the fact that 6 others died in the shooting,including a childShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesArizona State Prosecutors, FBI Director Mueller, Federal domestic terrorism charges, Federal Homicide/Assault Charges, Going Federal, Pima County Prosecutors, Pima County Sheriff, Satate Assault Charges, State Homicide Charges, The FBI, The US attorney for Arizona, Tucson District AttorneyRead moreThe Dogs seems to have got most of it right on the background of the illegals US government powerplay.July 17, 2010jamesb10110 commentsPreet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said his office should never be a rubber stamp for the White House.Back on July 9th The Dog did a post on what he thought went down in the background of the illegals spy case.My main point was not the case itself.That was straight forward.The FBI caught a batch of people that were moles for the RussiansThey were living the good life..Enjoying their American perks and sending very little back to their Russian spy masters.At the time I thought the case wasnt really a big dealIt was actually something that could have been handled by US Customs and Immigration Enforcement since none of the people involved were charged with SPYING..The thing that the Dog found interesting was that while the media was getting hype up on the case..The rug was being pulled out from under the Justice Departement, US Attorneys Offices and the FBI..In my scnerio post I thought outloud that the politcial arm of the United Staes Governmnet was caught by surprise and embarsassed by the moves by FBI, Justice and the US Attorneys offices.Turns out I was rightIn a piece in the New York Times today it is revealed that the US Attorneys Office was shut of the process once the trade talks began it began.as the White House had been when the FBI began rolling up the network.The US Attorney in Mahattan sits down and discusses if the its the right thing to have the swap?Is he kidding me?Later in the piece its revealed that the some of Russians defense attorney s learn of the swap from the Russians!Obviously the US Prosecutor is not happy with being locked out of his case and does this New York Times piece to get HIS story out.But one must remember the US Attorney Preet Bharara has been at his job for less than a year and owes he job to those same political winds that took his case awayHell not be happy but he serves at the pleasure of the Presidentjust like the Attorney General does..In the end a lesson was served up hereI pointed it out from the jumpLike in the Bush years.Even the Justice Departement has to learn to not spring surprises on its bossesThey can bite back.Quietly and quicklyServing up emabrrassment in publicIt really is who has the juiceIt always is..Mr. Bhararas office was assigned last year to prosecute another high-profile case, the trial ofKhalid Shaikh Mohammed and four others accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks, but before the defendants ever arrived in New York,the plans were derailed by strong opposition from local politicians.In the Russia case, though, the circumstances were different. A deal was being struck by political leaders of two nations that would close a decade-long investigation even before an indictment was brought.In the end, Mr. Bharara said he concluded the deal being brokered by the politicians was acceptable and just, and was being pursued for the right reason, and his prosecutors scrambled to secure guilty pleas from the 10 jailed suspects in different cities as the case sped to a conclusion.Now, with the deal done and the Russian agents back in Moscow, it turns out that prosecutors were not the only ones questioning their role in one of the odder, more fascinating spy cases in years.Donna R. Newman, the lawyer for one man accused of being a member of what was known as Russias illegals program, said a prosecutor had made clear to her that the terms of the eventual plea deal were being handed down from the highest levels of government. She said it was usually the United States attorneys office that dictated the terms of plea bargains, and she joked with the prosecutor, Im used to being window dressing, but in this case youre window dressing, too.Robert M. Baum, the lawyer who represented another of the agents,Anna Chapman, said, People congratulated me on the result of the case, but I had nothing to do with the result.The case moved so swiftly that Peter B. Krupp, the lawyer for one of the Russian agents detained in Massachusetts, said he first learned the outlines of what later became the plea deal not from prosecutors but from a Russian official in a jailhouse meeting in Plymouth, Mass.Mr. Krupp said he called a prosecutor, asking for confirmation of the terms of the deal, and was left with the impression that the prosecutor himself was unaware of the details.It is my feeling, Mr. Krupp said, that the defense teams, the prosecutors and the court were all pawns in this negotiation.To Mr. Bharara, the 41-year-old United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, who has served 11 months in the post, the prosecutors were not pawns, and he said they worked hard to guard against that.We took seriously our responsibility to be independent thinkers and responsible enforcers of justice, he said. Its very easy for me to say that, because we agreed with what was going on, but its important for people to know that we thought about that.If something would have violated our principles, he added, we would have objected.Mr. Bharara agreed to discuss limited aspects of the case at the request of The New York Times. Further details were obtained from others who were briefed on the process.More.NoteNowhere in this piece does the Government lawyers indicate that they were asked anythingit appears they werentthey just did the deal..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post UncategorizedThe FBI, The Illegal's/Spy case, The Justice Department, The Russian's, The US Attorney's Office's, The White HouseRead moreThe FBI releases more info on the illegals round upJuly 12, 2010jamesb1012 commentsNow that the illegal spys are gone..The FBI seems intent on giving their side of the story..Which seemed to get them short changed by the politiciansAn anxious June 26 phone call from Russian spy Anna Chapman to her father, a KGB veteran working in Moscows Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led the Obama administration to hasten thearrests the next day of Chapman and nine other illegals in the United States, according to U.S. law enforcement and intelligence sources.THIS STORYRussian spy felt cover was blownU.S. seized opportunity in arrests of RussiansU.S. and Russia complete spy exchangeIn the call to Moscow, apparently monitored by the United States, Chapman voiced suspicions that she might have been discovered.(Photos: Anna Chapman, Russian spy)Planning had begun in mid-June to arrest four couples, who had been under FBI surveillance for years, plus Chapman, 28, and another new Russian illegal Mikhail Semenov, who had been in the United States for only months. Part of the plan involved getting Chapman and Semenov to undertake acts, at the suggestion of FBI informants, that would enable them to be indicted for more than just carrying on secret communications with Russian officials.Chapmans call to Moscow, after a troubling meeting with an FBI informant, came on the eve of a scheduled trip by one of the other Russians, Richard Murphy. He was to leave for Moscow the next day to consult with his superiors at Moscow Center, headquarters of the SVR, Russias foreign intelligence agency.The FBI knew Murphys plans would take him first to France and then to Russia, and the agency had followed him on a similar trip to Moscow in March. But his FBI monitors feared that the SVR, alerted by Chapmans call, might not allow him to return. They also worried that the SVR could alert the other illegals  the term used for deep-cover agents who do not have diplomatic cover  in the United States to flee the country or seek shelter in Russian diplomatic missions.(Photos: Infamous spies through history)On Sunday, Attorney GeneralEric H. Holder Jr. described the situation this way on CBSs Face the Nation: The husband of one of the couples was in the process of going to France and then on his way to Russia, and the concern was that, if we let him go, we would not be able to get him back. He did not mention the Chapman call. Instead, he said, there were operational concerns that if we did not act at that point, the possibility existed that we would not be able to break up the ring in the totality in the way that we have now.At a White House briefing Friday, a senior administration official who was asked about the Chapman and the FBI informant indeclined to comment on operational activities.More..Note.Anna Chapman The Red heads father is a senior SVR (KGB ) guyShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, Updates, WomenAG Holder, Anna Chapman, The FBI, The Russian Illegal's spy caseRead moreCould the Washington Post be doing a cover story?.The Dog offers a thought of how things could have went down.July 9, 2010jamesb1011 commentLet me start this off by saying this is MY guess on thisOk..I read a piece in the Washington Post tonight that made me shake my head..The piece starts out declaring that the White House knew about the illegals a few weeks before the FBI rolled up the network.The Dog doesnt quite buy thatIf you look back over the past week and half you have to know that this WashPost piece has been leaked to change some history..No one can tell me that while President Obama was squirting Russian President Medvedev around before the Canadian G8/20 summit that he was aware that the FBI was gonna rain on his parade by PUBLICLY announcing they had made the arrests..Now this WashPost piece says the WH was briefed in weeks ago.Im sure the president gets to see tons of stuff.But Im also sure NO ONE told him they might be arresting these people on the day he is trying get along with the Russian PresidentI posted at the time of the arrests that I thought the arrests kinda splattering egg on the PresidentWhy?Anybody notice what the White House did for the first 48 hours or so after the arrests?Nothing.They couldnt close their mouths I think.The FBI is all over this..Well there are few problems when the case gets to Justice a short while laterFirst of all..No hard information for the first 24 hours..The media is going crazy.Then the first charges come downNO ONE IS CHARGED WITH SPYING!???Nope.Being in the country under assumed namesManIllegal immigrants do that all the time????Then we find out about the kids.Where are they?And FBI agent took a baby home was one storyBut the real story happens about 4 or 5 days laterIm on the record as sau=ying Obama and apolitical heads at the White House have to furious at AG Holder, and FBI Director Mulller.These are coming out as low level criminal collars.So low level that a judge in New York has set bail for one the 10Then of course there is the paymaster who skipped bail in CyprusWhat happened there?And NO ONE I mean NO ONE is excited except the FBI and Justice who now sense that they are losing it in public and are forced to release more and more Information to the media as more comments begin to float that the case is not really a strong one and the political side of the government isnt really happy about the raining on attempts to improve relations with the Russians.Im guessing that thru back channels the Russians are asking their US contactsWhos in charge in your country?The cops or the politicians?Next thing we know it begins to leak like sieveThere are working on a swap..Who is they..Heres another myth I dont really believe..They  went to President and told himThe Commandeer-in -Chief that the Russians would go along.Whos kidding who?You dont just go to the Russians and do the outline of the dealTHEN come back to the President.You pitch the idea FIRSTThen do the talkingWellby this time the FBI has to shut out.Do your interviews they had to be told..But thats itYou guys are outNext as the State Department lines up a ex-Government official to be the contact point manThe CIA Director himself is said to joined the negotiations.This now a CIA, State caperThe FBIs collars are no longer collars..they are swap meat.The Russians offer up one used scientist that they didnt actually get rid off for spying and they look around afind three more..
