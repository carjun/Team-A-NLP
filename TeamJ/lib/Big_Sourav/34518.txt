I'd make 3 or 4 crazy ass text only videos. Then I'd make my profile on myspace and youtube complete gibberish.Then, when I'm tried in the court of public opinion in the immediate aftermath of the crime, instead of being a racist jerk-off on a mission, I'm just a crazy guy, doing crazy guy things. Put me in a hospital instead of a jail.Jared Loughner might have been crazy like a fox. Refresh|+10 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadI doubt it.

I don't think that we can look at this guy's MySpace page and be certain that it is a true reflection on who he really was, he is a criminal and quite often criminals intentionally try to deceive people.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toplonestarnot      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 11:46 AMResponse to Original message3.Zactly.

His episodes were pretty much that - episodes that were not really connected enough that he could carry out any long-term activity for more than a day or two.  He would become paranoid with an idea-fixee, but his paranoia changed flavor every few months as some other concept became lodged in his thinking.This Jared reminds me of many of the "borderline personality disorder" young men and women I've grown up with or seen over the years, growing up cocooned with unrealistic expectations, unsure or fearful that "they're not good enough", of real responsibilities and consequences, angry because they feel "dis-respected", and/or searching for something to make them seem more special than everyone else around them. I've observed these types will try harder to make themselves the heroes of their own reality than they will to actually live and work in a reality where others may have an equal claim on respect.  From my experience, these types of immature young adults understand what they are doing when they act to hurt someone; but unlike a true psychopath or schizophrenic, they will try to find a socially legitimate justification as to why they need to hurt someone.  (I dated one of these once, and managed to recognize what was going on before I got hurt)I think he's probably emotionally and mentally no different than any other bully or wanna-be tool of a bully.  The only difference here is that he apparently practiced a form of isolationist pseudo-intellectual bullying to the normal active pack bullying that people associate with the type of bullies the media has been covering lately. He'll either try to cop a mental instability plea or retreat into his self-validating martyrdom for the grand cause.  The sooner he gets his death penalty sentence, he won't have to worry about any doubts as to the personal reality he's scripted for himself - with the help of those predators who found him in his isolation and figured out how to profit by directing his actions within that reality.  Whereas my uncle, truly mentally incompetent, would not actually work to make his own reality, he'd just work on a narrow task or philosophy for as long as that episode lasted in whatever reality his brain had provided him with. He did not have a concept of rightness or wrongness when he was where he was, he would not have enough appreciation of his surroundings to understand whether or not he was hurting someone - and he couldn't be used by anyone other than on a rather short-term basis. Certainly not for more than a couple months or so.My two cents based on my experience; for the actual situation, we will have to wait for professionals on the scene.HaelePrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJoe the Revelator      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 02:36 PMResponse to Reply #2632.Interesting insightPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topsendero      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 12:52 PMResponse to Original message28.Insane or not...... this guy will never set foot in the free world again.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJoe the Revelator      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:14 PMResponse to Reply #2830.Thats what they said about Hinkleyhttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/08/national/main...

No matter how legally insane you are, you don't walk in Arizona.  Also, say you were to prevail at trial in proving that you were guilty except insane during the commission of a dangerous offense....you would be sentenced to the State Hospital for the same length of time that a non-insane defendant would be with the added caveat that if you were to be restored to sanity during your stay at the State Hospital you would then be taken to prison to serve out the rest of your term.Here's a decent law review article about Arizona's statute:http://www.georgetownlawjournal.org/issues/pdf/97-6/Sto... The return to prison for a dangerous offense is a relatively new amendment and I can't remember if the law journal talks about it.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 10:11 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss General DiscussionPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
