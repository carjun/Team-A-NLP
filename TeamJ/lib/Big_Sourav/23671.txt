An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society. Our prayers are with Congresswoman Giffords, her staff, all who were injured, and their families. This is a sad day for our country.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnadinbrzezinski      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 11:31 PMResponse to Reply #2526.Not in person,  not in front of a camerawhich is what you should expect.

It'll be one or several of the following:1.  Democrats are just as bad (at inciting violence against political opponents).  2.  Well, you knowGiffords brought it upon herself, because __(fill in the blank)__.3.  The gunman was actually a loony libr'ul ("Really!  We have proof!") or that because he's mentally ill, he was virtually apolitical.4.  This is the result of our having too permissive a society.  5.  So, the woman got just a flesh wound.  What's the big fuss about?6.  (Akin to #5): We're spending too much time dwelling on this; there are way to many more important things to worry about.  Shootings happen all the time.7.  This is the price we sometimes have to pay for freedom.8.  We're real Christians, and we're praying for her recovery!  Really, we are!  (That is, right before we pray for God to smite her.)9.  Oh, but Sarah never had any such thing up on her web site.  That's a big hoax ginned up by socialists and other people who hate America.10. Okay, so Sarah did have it up on her site.  Looking at it, I don't see any call for violence.11. (Some sort of obfuscating speech, peppered with buzzwords like freedoms and democracyin order to totally blur the conversation.)12. Giffords is a conservative Democrat, so this was an attack against conservatives, not lib'ruls.  Besides, there were other people in the crowd that weren't Democrats, ergo this was not a political attack. We should play "Drinking Bingo" with this.  I doubt I'd last long, though...I'd probably be under the table within 15 minutes.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopAsahinaKimi      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:34 AMResponse to Reply #3840.Teabaggers ....Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 12:35 AM by AsahinaKimiThey don't believe in violence?
