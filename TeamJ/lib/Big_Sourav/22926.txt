Trial of Geert Wilders - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaTrial of Geert WildersFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation,searchA trial of Dutch politician Geert Wilders is ongoing in The Netherlands in 2010. Wilders is facing five counts of inciting hatred and discrimination for describing Islam as a fascist religion and Moroccan youths as violent and for calling for the banning of the Koran. On October 22, 2010 a Dutch appeals panel granted a petition by Wilders' attorney to remove the judges presiding over his trial, which means that there will have to be a retrial.[1]Wilders is the leader of the Party for Freedom and is known for his criticisms of Islam and what he describes as the Islamization of the Netherlands. In The Netherlands he is being prosecuted on charges that on several occasions in 2007 and 2008 he insulted Muslims and fomented hate and discrimination against them because of their religion. He is also accused of fomenting hate and discrimination against non-Western foreigners, including Moroccans. Wilders portrays himself "as a champion of free speech" and the trial as a test of freedom of speech and hate speech issues.In 2008, Wilders was also charged by a prosecutor in Jordan with blasphemy and contempt for Muslims for making his anti-Koran film "Fitna".[2]In an August 8, 2007, open letter[3] to the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant Wilders wrote that the Koran, which he called a "fascist book", should be outlawed in the Netherlands, as is Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.[4] He has stated that "[t]he book incites hatred and killing and therefore has no place in our legal order."[5] He has also referred to Mohammed as "the devil".In 2008, Wilders published the film Fitna that accuses the Qur'an of inspiring terrorism, Islamic universalism, and attempts to draw connections to Islam in the Netherlands.[6]Contents1 Antecedents1.1 Prosecution1.2 Responses2 See also3 Notes4 External links[edit] AntecedentsAccording to Article 71 of the Dutch Constitution, as an MP, Wilders has immunity for anything he says in the Dutch parliament; all persons partaking in the deliberations of the Dutch parliament or in parliamentary commission meetings enjoy legal immunity regarding any communication, either in speech or in writing.[7] However, this protection does not extend to anti-Islam comments he has made in the media. This became clear in 20072010, when protests against alleged insults and incitement to hatred resulted in the (now pending) criminal prosecution of Wilders by the district attorney in Amsterdam. On February 3, 2010, the Amsterdam court ruled itself to be competent on the charges against Wilders.His comments and some of the content of Wilders' film Fitna have been protested by agencies such as the Dutch anti-discrimination group Nederland Bekent Kleur ("The Netherlands Shows Its Colors").[8] On August 15, 2007, a representative of the Prosecutors' Office in Amsterdam declared that dozens of reports against Wilders had been filed and that they were being considered.[9]Attempts to prosecute Wilders under Dutch anti-hate speech laws in June 2008 were dropped, with the public prosecutor's office stating that Wilders' comments contributed to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and had been made outside parliament.[10] The office released a statement reading: "That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims does not mean that they are punishable. Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate in a democratic society. That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate."[8][11][12][edit] ProsecutionOn 21 January 2009, a three-judge court ordered the public prosecutor to try Wilders.[12][13] Their statement said that "[i]n a democratic system, hate speech is considered so serious that it is in the general interest to ... draw a clear line" and that "the court also considers appropriate criminal prosecution for insulting Muslim worshippers because of comparisons between Islam and Nazism made by Wilders".[10][11] If convicted he may be sentenced for up to 16 months of jail time or a fine of 9866.67.[14] His lawyer Bram Moszkowicz took the case to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.[15] On December 4, 2009, Wilders was ordered to appear before the court on January 20, 2010, to defend himself to the charges of group insult of Muslims, fomenting hate and discrimination against Muslims because of their religion, and fomenting hate and discrimination against non-western foreigners and/or Moroccans because of their race.[16]On January 11, 2010, the Dutch public prosecutor's office brought additional charges against him. He was charged with hatred against Moroccans and non-Western immigrants.[17][18][19]On January 13, 2010, the Amsterdam court rejected, after a closed pretrial hearing, submissions by Wilders that one of the charges against him should be dropped or reduced. He argued that he had only criticized Islam and not its adherents, and that the charge of insulting Muslims as a group should not stand. His lawyer Moszkowicz petitioned judges to drop the charge of insulting Muslims as a group, which he said would have little chance of winning a conviction. He cited a 2009 Dutch Supreme Court ruling that found insulting a religion is not the same as insulting followers of that religion, and not punishable under the current hate-speech laws. The judge said that the indictment only put into practice an earlier court ruling that he should stand trial and that the defense had not put forward any new evidence to overturn that ruling.[20][21][22]The court sessions started on January 20, 2010. Wilders was accused of discrimination on the basis of religion and spreading hate. On the eve of his trial Wilders told journalists he expected to be acquitted and said "I have done nothing wrong". He said he should be able "to speak the truth about Islam", even if that is painful for some people. After receiving the summons he commented that he considered the prosecution as "a political trial".[23][24] He announced that during the hearing he wanted to ask various experts to act as witnesses.[25][12][26][27][28][29][30] At the first day of the trials, Wilders held a speech recalling Jefferson among others.[31]When the trial resumed on February 3, the judges decided who would be called as witnesses. Wilders' witness list had consisted of a number of various experts on both the law and Islam and included university professors, radical imams and also Mohammed Bouyeri, the man who murdered film maker Theo van Gogh.[32][33][34]The witnesses that Wilders wanted called include: Henny Sackers, Dutch professor of criminal law from the Radboud University Nijmegen and scholar on blasphemy, religious discrimination and hate crime; Tom Zwart, Dutch professor of human rights law, Utrecht University; Theo de Roos, Dutch professor of criminal law, Tilburg University; Afshin Ellian, Dutch-Iranian professor, Leiden University; Andras Sajo, Hungarian judge, European Court for Human Rights; Hans Jansen, Dutch arabist; Simon Admiraal, Dutch author of a book titled "Islam for Pigs, Donkeys, Monkeys and Other Beasts"; Wafa Sultan, author of A god who hates;[35] Raphael Israeli, Israeli professor, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Sam Solomon, author of The mosque exposed; B. French, director of the Centre for the Study of Political Islam; Andrew Bostom, author of The Legacy of Jihad; R.B. Spencer, director of Jihad Watch; F. Jneid, imam from The Hague; Y. Al-Qaradawi, University of Qatar; Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati from Iran; Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi from Iran; and Mohammed Bouyeri, convicted for murder.[36]Of these 18 witnesses, 15 were rejected by the court. It ruled that Bouyeri and other Muslim extremists would not be allowed to testify in the case.[37] The court accepted only the three Islam experts whom Wilders had called,[38] rejecting all the lawyers and Islamic extremists. Wilders wanted to put Islamic extremists in the witness box, to illustrate what he sees as the danger of Islam, and to justify his criticism of the religion. The court also rejected the plea by Wilders' lawyer that the case should be transferred to the Supreme Court, because Wilders is an MP. The court overruled this objection against its jurisdiction: "Parliamentary immunity does not extend to what a public representative says or writes outside of parliamentary gatherings", said Jan Moors, one of the judges at the Amsterdam court.[39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47] Wilders' comment was that he was being denied a fair trial.[48]Pending the hearing of the mentioned witnesses, in May 2010 two lawyers raised doubts in the Dutch press about the impartiality one of them.[49]On 22 October a retrial was ordered when it emerged that one of the judges had tried to convince a potential witness that Wilders' the trial was justified.(Geert Wilders hate speech trial collapses in Netherlands, by Ian Traynor, Europe editor, guardian.co.uk, 22 October 2010)[edit] ResponsesThe prosecution created, in the words of Haaretz, "a high-profile affair".[50] Wilders labeled the judgement an "attack on the freedom of expression".[10] The prosecution was condemned by editorials in the Wall Street Journal,[51] Investors Business Daily,[52] The Washington Times,[53] The American Spectator,[54] Forbes,[14] Dallas Morning News[55] City Journal,[56] Montreal Gazette,[57] The Jerusalem Post,[58] Canada.com,[59] and The Australian.[60] New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg criticized it in front of the Mayor of Amsterdam and the Dutch Ambassador to the United States.[59] Wilders' rival People's Party for Freedom and Democracy called the case "alarming".The Dutch center-left Labour party welcomed the court's ruling.[61] The Socialist Party did as well.[62] The Muslims and Government Consultative Body, said that "We are positive that this will contribute to a more respectful tone to the public debate."[61] Abdelmajid Khairoun, Dutch Muslim Council chairman, expressed support, stating that "Muslim youngsters who make anti-Semitic remarks are prosecuted but Wilders' anti-Islamic remarks go unpunished".[62]The American Middle East Forum has established a Legal Defence Fund for Wilders's defence.[63][64] The New York Times ran a supportive op-ed arguing that "for a man who calls for a ban on the Koran to act as the champion of free speech is a bit rich".[65]A survey by Angus Reid Global Monitor has found that public opinion is deeply split on the prosecution, with 50% supporting Wilders and 43% opposed.[11] However, public support for the Party for Freedom vastly increased since Wilders' legal troubles began, with the Party for Freedom virtually tied with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to be the third most popular party.[66] According to Radio Netherlands, "Dutch politicians themselves seem to be keeping quiet on the issue; they are probably worried that media attention will only serve to make the controversial politician more popular."[51]According to Robert Spencer, creator of Jihad Watch, and author of articles and books relating to Islam and Islamic terrorism, in National Review Online "The Geert Wilders trial ought to be an international media event; seldom has any court case anywhere had such enormous implications for the future of the free world "[67].According to Wilders himself, it is not he who is on trial, but his "freedom of speech" and that at stake are traditional European freedoms: in February 2010, in an interview with Israel National Radio, Wilders said to be "fighting for one thing: the preservation of our culture, which is based on Christianity, Judaism and humanism - and not on Islam While Islamization of our society grows, the political elite looks in the other direction and ignores the real problem, namely, the impending loss of our freedom. I am fighting not against Moslems, but against the influx of a totalitarian ideology called Islam."
