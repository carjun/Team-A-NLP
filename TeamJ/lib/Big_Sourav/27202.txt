Who should buy long-term care insurance?  A. Buying long-term care insurance will assure that you have   access to quality care within the competitive private marketplace. Anyone who:     realizes the objective risk of needing long-term care       understands the value of avoiding Medicaid dependency     and paying privately to obtain quality care at the necessary level       has the income or resources to fund the premiums (after giving this     coverage priority among competing spending alternatives) should buy long-term care insurance.  COST  Q. Who pays for long-term care?  A. You do. Medicare only pays for short-term stays. Medicaid   may pay if you are qualified for government assistance after spending down most   of your assets.  Q. How much does a long-term care insurance policy cost?  A. Age is usually the determining factor when it comes to   pricing a long-term care insurance policy.  The older you are when you purchase a policy, the higher your premium. Take   for example the same low-option policy bought by a 50, 65, and 79-year-old   individual. The annual premium for the person at age 50 is about $400. For a   65-year-old person, the premium is about $1,100 per year, and for a person age   79, the policy would cost more than $4,300. Of course, the younger person pays   the premium for a longer period of time. Yet, if long-term care were needed at   age 85 in each of these cases, the 50-year-old person would have paid a total of   $14,175 for long term care insurance, as opposed to $26,232 paid by the   79-year-old. The 50-year-old will also receive a higher benefit amount due to   the inflation adjustment. The bottom line: the earlier you buy the policy, the   less expensive it will ultimately be.  Even though you cannot control your age at the time of purchasing a policy,   the options that you chose to accompany your policy are up to you. Higher daily   benefits and other special features including inflation protection and   nonforfeiture benefits will increase the cost of your premium. In fact, it has   been observed that there is a three-fold disparity in pricing between a low and   high-option long-term care insurance policy.  Overall, long-term care insurance is going to be expensive. When you purchase   and what your policy includes will cause a difference in price. Remember that   the cost of a policy does not even compare to the out-of-pocket spending level   resulting from no insurance coverage.  Q. What is the difference in cost between a group long-term   disability insurance policy and an individual long-term disability insurance   policy?  A. Usually, a long-term disability insurance policy will be   cheaper in a group setting rather than individually for the following reasons:     Benefits are usually coordinated with Worker's     Compensation and Social Security benefits.       Employer's benefits pay some of the premium,     ultimately reducing the amount employees pay in premium costs.       Plans typically include longer maximum benefit     periods, a ``noncancelable`` feature, an ``out-of-pocket`` rider, and the     option to add more coverage. These features are not automatic when purchased     individually, causing higher payments.       Lower marketing, administrative, and underwriting costs.  Q. What about inflation?  A. When purchasing long-term care insurance, you need to   consider inflation results on the proposed benefit amount. Costs of home and   nursing home care have gone through the roof in the past decade. Just imagine   what it is going to be when you reach the age of 85.  There are a couple of ways to go about this inflation issue. One way is to   purchase 5 percent compounded inflation protection, if you are under the age of   75. Through this method, the benefit amount increases 5 percent annually from   the policy's amount the previous year. Or you could buy a simple rate inflation   adjustment, which increases the benefit amount by 5 percent of the original   benefit instead of the previous year's benefit amount.  Make sure you determine whether your inflation protection plan has a limit on   its operating length. Some policies limit the increase of the benefit amount to   a specific number of years. Generally this is about 20 years or until the policy   doubles, which is about 16 years for a compounded rate of inflation and 20 years   for a simple rate. Other policies will increase the benefit amount until the   policyholder reaches a certain age. Remember to take into account how reasonable   this time period is in relation to your current age. A 60-year-old individual   with an inflation plan increasing benefit amounts for 20 years might be left   with ten years to live and a nonexistent inflation adjustment plan.  Some policies allow you to purchase additional benefit amounts in future   years. However, these additional amounts will have to be bought at the higher   premium based on your present age. You may want to consider this option if you   are under age 50. For older age groups, this option is substantially more   expensive than the automatic annual inflation adjustment option.  Ask your financial advisor to compare various inflation options and the   resulting premiums. You should select the inflation option that is best for your   situation.  COVERAGE  Q. How much long-term care insurance should I buy?  A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Like most insurance policies, long-term care insurance policies   have a fixed dollar amount that you cannot exceed while receiving   covered services. Limits are a typical component of insurance policies.    It is your job to assess what those limits should be within your insurance   policy. The following are four subjects you should consider before purchasing a   policy.   Benefit amount       Inflation adjustment (See "What about inflation?")       Benefit period       Deductible period  Benefit amount-The benefit amount is generally 80 to 100   percent of today's long-term care cost. It is the fixed dollar amount awarded to   you each day and ranges from around $40/day to $200 /day. In determining how   much benefit amount you will need to buy to accommodate your needs, price the   cost of a nursing facility of your choice and figure how much of your income you   could spend per day. The difference between the nursing home price and your   daily income allotment is the benefit amount that you will need to purchase.   Couples need to assume that their income is going solely to cover the other   spouse; therefore, their personal benefit amount would receive no help from   income.  Benefit period- The benefit amount refers to the length of   time you will receive coverage from your policy. First assess the benefit amount   and then consider how long you might need long-term care. Benefit periods range   from two years to an unlimited amount of time. However, the average length of   stay in a nursing home is 2.5 years. Realistically, there is a very small chance   that you will stay in a care facility for more than five years. This is why   amount should be first and foremost in your assessment. Then you can determine   the length of coverage.  Deductible period- The deductible period, or elimination   period, is a length of time in which you have to pay for the covered services   before the policy takes over. This amount of time ranges between 20 and 100 days   usually. The longer the deductible period, the lower the premiums. Yet, this   also means you have to spend more money out of your own pocket during that time   frame. Ultimately, the length of your deductible period should take into account   the available assets you have that can be used for uncovered services during   that time and how much is affordable in terms of premiums.  Q. When should I consider purchase of a long-term care plan? Should I   purchase long-term care insurance now while I'm young and healthy, or wait until   I am older?  A. Because your lifetime annual payment amount is frozen at   the age that you apply for a policy, the best time to purchase is NOW! Each year   that you do not buy a long-term care insurance policy the price rating   increases. Whatever rate you end up getting remains constant until you enter a   care center- then there is no premium rate to pay. Therefore, you could save   tremendously by buying young.  Not only do the premium rates increase for each year that you do not purchase   a policy, but also you increase the probability that you will experience a   medical problem while uninsured. This could deem you uninsurable, further   restricting you from receiving long-term care coverage.  So, remember these quick pointers:   Buy a policy before a major medical illness, accident,     or disability occurs.       Buy when younger to save on premium costs.       Consult the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) in your area     before making a decision.  Q. When purchasing any policy, what criteria should I look for to   ensure an educated buy? A.Your long-term care   insurance policy should:   Provide a premium waiver when you are receiving     benefits       Have ONE deductible for the life of the policy       Cover pre-existing conditions without a waiting period     (if these are disclosed in application)       Provide the option to upgrade or downgrade coverage if policyholders     cannot afford premiums  Q. What is generally not covered in a long-term care insurance   policy?  A. It is important to realize that no insurance can cover   everything without making the premiums highly unaffordable. In the case of   long-term care, certain conditions are not covered. They include:   Health problems detected prior to purchasing the     policy (some insurance companies exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions     for six months)       Mental and nervous disorders or diseases, other than     Alzheimer`s disease and related dementia       Alcohol and drug addiction       Illnesses caused by an act of war       Illnesses resulting from intentionally self-inflicted     injury       Attempted suicide       Treatment already paid for by the government  DEFINITIONS  Q. What is long-term care insurance?  A. These are individual insurance policies that may help you   when you are unable to take care of yourself due to prolonged illness or   disability. However, policies may or may not cover home health care, adult care,   or other alternative services.  Q. What is the difference between a qualified and a nonqualified   plan?  A. Benefits paid by a qualified long-term care plan   generally are not taxable as income. Benefits from a nonqualified long-term care   plan may be taxable as income. Check with your tax advisor about the possibility   of deducting a portion of the premiums paid in addition to the individual tax   consequences involved.  MISC.  Q. What if I die without ever using my long-term care   insurance?  A. There are a few things that could happen to your coverage   if you should die.   You don't get any money back. This is the same for     both home and auto insurance: no use, no recovery. Protection was granted     while you were alive, but you never had to take advantage of it.       Your heirs could receive any premiums that were not     paid out for your care. This is through the Return of Premium Upon Death     Option, located as a rider on your policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Your spouse can be freed of further payments on his/her long-term     care payments. This is under a survivorship rider     within your policy. With this option, the survivor receives automatic full payment     on his/her existing coverage upon the first death.  Q. When considering purchasing either long-term disability or   short-term disability coverage, which one is better?  A. If you need to decide between either long-term disability   insurance or short-term disability insurance, consider the risks covered by   each. Long-term disability will protect you for many years, or a whole lifetime,   and therefore will ease major losses acquired from the disability. Short-term   disability covers only a limited and short time of loss of income, which can be   more easily handled by your family than the long-term magnitude of losses.   Consequently, it may be more beneficial for you to purchase the long-term   disability insurance policy rather than short-term, when having to decide   between the two. However, individual circumstances must be assessed as well in   order to find the best policy to suit your needs.  Q. What "definitions of disability" might be present within my   short-term or long-term disability insurance policy?  A. Policies differ in what exactly they label a   "disability". It is important for you to look closely at your policy's   definition of disability before purchasing. A policy could use the words "total"   and "permanent" when describing disabilities that are granted coverage. Other   policies use words such as "partial" or "temporary". This information is   essential to know. Without it, you as the policyholder could potentially be   denied coverage in the event of a disability.  Also the "occupation" language varies in policies. The "occupation" segment   of the policy states the skills the disabled must not be able to perform in   order to acquire benefits from the policy. Some policies use the wording, "own   occupation," when referring to the activity the disabled is unable to perform.   This is the job the disabled had at the time of the injury or onset of sickness.   The other term, "any occupation," refers to the job or skills that the disabled   has had the necessary training to perform, but is not necessarily the job the   disabled had at the onset of the disability. Most people prefer to have the "own   occupation" clause because it is more liberal than the "any occupation"   stipulation. Take for example a neurosurgeon who becomes disabled and can no   longer work as a neurosurgeon. The policy that defines a disability as not being   able to perform her current job as a neurosurgeon, or the "own occupation"   clause, would pay her benefits. The "any occupation" clause in another policy   might respond to the disability differently. The neurosurgeon has the training   and skills to be a family practitioner and may not receive coverage if these   functions can be performed yet neurosurgery cannot. This type of policy could   fall back on prior jobs and skills to dodge coverage of your inability to work   at the job you had at the time of the disability`s onset.  Thirdly, look at the loss requirements needed for coverage. Policies can   differ in their coverage for disabilities arising for sickness or accidental   injury. Some provide sole coverage for disabilities rising from accidental   illness while excluding sickness-caused disabilities.  Because the language of disability definitions varies so much, it is crucial   that you examine your policy closely before purchasing.
