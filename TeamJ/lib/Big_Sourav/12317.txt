Wikipedia:User access levels - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWikipedia:User access levelsFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia(Redirected from Wikipedia:UAL)Jump to: navigation,searchWP:RIGHTS redirects here. To request user rights, see Wikipedia:Requests for permissions or Wikipedia:Requests for adminship.Shortcuts:WP:UALWP:RIGHTSWP:UserrightsA contributor's access to perform certain actions in Wikipedia is determined by various flags on their account, some of which are automatic and others of which must be given to them manually. A user with a flag is said to be a member of that flag's 'user group', giving them certain 'permissions' and the use of certain features of the MediaWiki software.Users are assigned the highest possible permissions based on the groups they are members of. A user who is an administrator, bureaucrat and rollbacker, for instance, would be able to use Special:Unwatchedpages (granted with the 'sysop' group), Special:RenameUser (granted with the 'bureaucrat' group) and to also use rollback (granted with the 'sysop' and 'rollbacker' groups). If the user was removed from the 'sysop' group, they would still be able to use rollback, because they are still a member of the 'rollbacker' group.Membership in a user group is sometimes referred to as a 'flag' or 'bit'; being made a member of the 'sysop' group is synonymous with being 'given the admin bit' or 'receiving the admin flag'.Contents1 Overview2 User groups2.1 Anonymous users2.2 New users2.3 Autoconfirmed users2.4 Administrators, bureaucrats and stewards2.4.1 Administrators2.4.2 Bureaucrats2.4.3 Stewards2.5 Other flags giving access to specialized functions2.5.1 Reviewer2.5.2 Rollback2.5.3 Autopatrolled2.5.4 Confirmed users2.5.5 Accountcreator2.5.6 Ipblock-exempt2.5.7 Edit Filter managers2.5.8 Oversight2.5.9 CheckUser2.5.10 Importers and Transwiki2.6 Other flagged accounts2.6.1 Bots2.6.2 Founder2.6.3 Researcher2.6.4 Editor3 Table3.1 User access level changes4 See alsoOverviewAll visitors to the site, including anonymous users, are part of the '*' group, while all logged-in users are also part of the 'user' group. Users are automatically promoted into the Autoconfirmed/Established users group when their account is four days old and has ten edits. Other flags are only given upon request; some, such as 'rollbacker' or 'bot', are granted unilaterally if the user demonstrates a need for them (see Wikipedia:Requests for permissions and Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval). Others, such as 'sysop' and 'bureaucrat', are given only after community discussion and consensus at Wikipedia:Requests for adminship. Users are only made members of groups such as 'oversight' and 'checkuser' with the approval of the Arbitration Committee and after confirming their identity with the Wikimedia Foundation.User groupsAnonymous usersShortcut:WP:IPContributors who have not created an account or logged in are identified by their IP address rather than a user name, and may read all Wikipedia pages (except restricted special pages), and edit pages that are not protected or semi-protected. They may create talk pages in any talk namespace but may need to ask for help to create pages in some parts of the wiki. They cannot upload files or images. They must answer a CAPTCHA if they wish to make an edit which involves the addition of one or more external links, and click a confirm link to purge pages. All users may also query the site API in 500-record batches.New usersA user who edits through an account they have registered, may immediately create pages in any namespace (except the MediaWiki namespace, and limited to 8 per minute) and may also e-mail other users if they activate an email address in their user preferences. All logged-in users may mark edits as minor. They may purge pages without a confirmation step, but are still required to answer a CAPTCHA when adding external links. They may also customize their Wikimedia interface and its options as they wish, via Special:Preferences or by adding personal CSS or JavaScript rules to their vector.css or vector.js files.Autoconfirmed usersShortcut:WP:AUTOCONFIRMA number of actions on the English Wikipedia are restricted to user accounts that pass certain thresholds of age (time passed since the first edit) and edit count: users who meet these requirements are considered part of the pseudo-group 'autoconfirmed'. Autoconfirmed status is checked every time a user performs a restricted action: it is then granted automatically by the software. The precise requirements for autoconfirmed status vary according to circumstances: for most users on en.wiki, accounts that are more than four days old and have made at least 10 edits are considered autoconfirmed. However, users editing through the Tor network are subjected to stricter autoconfirmed thresholds: 90 days and 100 edits.Autoconfirmed status is required to move pages, edit semi-protected pages, and upload files or upload a new version of an existing file. Autoconfirmed users are no longer required to enter a CAPTCHA for most events. Autoconfirmed users may mark pages created by others as patrolled in Special:NewPages and save books to the wiki. In addition, the Edit filter has a number of warning settings that only affect editors who are not autoconfirmed.Administrators, bureaucrats and stewardsAdministratorsSee also: Wikipedia:AdministratorsAdministrator rights are granted by the community to users requesting them. The process involves considerable discussion and examination of their activities as an editor. Users who are members of the 'administrator' user group have access to a number of tools to allow them to carry out certain functions on the wiki. The tools cover processes such as page deletion, page protection, blocking and unblocking, access to modify fully protected pages and the Mediawiki interface, and the ability to grant and remove account creator, rollback, ipblock-exempt rights, confirmed user, auto-reviewer, and edit filter manager rights to other users. Administrators are otherwise no different from any other editor.Administrators are also known historically as "sysops" (system operators). The two terms are used interchangeably.See Special:Listusers/sysop for a list of users in this group.BureaucratsSee also: Wikipedia:BureaucratsBureaucrat rights are granted by the community to exceptionally trusted users who are allowed to perform certain actions on other users' accounts.Bureaucrats have extended access to Special:UserRights, enabling them to add users to the 'sysop' and 'bureaucrat' groups (but not remove them), and both add users to and remove users from the 'bot' user group. Bureaucrats can use Special:RenameUser to rename users (including themselves).See Special:Listusers/bureaucrat for a list of users in this group.StewardsSee also: meta:StewardStewardship is an elected role, and stewards are appointed globally across all Wikimedia Foundation wikis.Users who are members of the 'steward' user group may grant and revoke any permission to or from any user on any wiki operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This group is set on MetaWiki, and may use meta:Special:Userrights to set permissions on any Wikimedia wiki; they may add or remove any user from any group. Stewards generally act only when there is no user on a particular wiki that can make the necessary change. This includes granting of the 'administrator' or 'bureaucrat' access levels on wikis which do not have any local bureaucrats, and removing such flags if the user resigns or the account is acting maliciously. Stewards are also responsible for granting and revoking access levels such as 'oversight' and 'checkuser', as no other group is capable of making such changes.Stewards can also act as checkusers, oversighters or bureaucrats on wikis which do not have local members of those groups. If a wiki has a passing need for an edit to be oversighted, for instance, a steward can add themselves to the 'oversight' user group on that wiki, perform the necessary oversight activity using Special:HideRevision, and then remove themselves from the 'oversight' group using their steward rights.All steward actions are logged at meta:Special:Log/rights. See Special:Globalusers/steward for a list of users in this group.Other flags giving access to specialized functionsReviewerSee also: Wikipedia:ReviewingThis usergroup is used in the pending changes trial. Members of this group can review other user's edits to articles placed under pending changes.See Special:Listusers/reviewer for a list of users in this group.RollbackSee also: Wikipedia:Rollback featureUsers who are given the rollback flag ('rollbacker' user group) may revert revisions using the rollback feature. This right is automatically assigned to administrators.See Special:Listusers/rollbacker for a list of users in this group.AutopatrolledSee also: Wikipedia:AutopatrolledMembers of this group have 'autopatrol', which allows them to have their pages automatically patrolled on the New Pages list. This right is automatically assigned to administrators. Prior to June 2010, this right was known as "autoreviewer".See Special:Listusers/autoreviewer for a list of users in this group. Confirmed usersShortcut:WP:CONFIRMIn some situations, it is necessary for accounts to be exempted from this customary confirmation period. The 'confirmed' group contains the same rights as the 'autoconfirmed' group, but can be granted by administrators as necessary. See Special:Listusers/confirmed for a list of users in this group. AccountcreatorSee also: Wikipedia:Account creatorUsers who are given the accountcreator flag ('accountcreator' user group) are not affected by the 6 account creation limit per day per IP, and can create accounts for other users without restriction. Users in this group can also override the anti-spoof checks on account creation. They can also create and modify editnotices. This right is automatically assigned to administrators.See Special:Listusers/accountcreator for a list of users in this group.Ipblock-exemptSee also: Wikipedia:IP block exemptionUsers who are given the ipblock-exempt flag ('ipblock-exempt' user group) are not affected by autoblocks and blocks of IP addresses and ranges that aren't made with the "anonymous users only" setting. This right is automatically assigned to administrators, however the flag must be added separately to enable editing from IP addresses affected by Tor blocks.See Special:Listusers/ipblock-exempt for a list of users in this group.Edit Filter managersSee also: Wikipedia:Edit filterMembers of this group can create, modify and delete edit filters. This flag is given and removed by administrators. It is not assigned to administrators by default.See Special:Listusers/abusefilter for a list of users in this group.OversightSee also: Wikipedia:OversightUsers who are given the oversight flag ('oversight' user group) have access to Special:HideRevision, through which they can permanently hide revisions of pages from all users, and Special:Oversight, where they can view a log of such actions and the content of the hidden revisions. This right is only granted to exceedingly few users who are at least 18 years of age and have identified themselves to the Wikimedia Foundation.See Special:Listusers/oversight for a list of users in this group.CheckUserSee also: Wikipedia:Checkuserand meta:CheckUser policyUsers who are given the checkuser flag ('checkuser' user group) have access to Special:CheckUser. They are able to view a list of all IP addresses used by a user account to edit the English Wikipedia, a list of all edits made by an IP, or all user accounts that have used an IP address. They may also view a log of such requests. This right is only granted to exceedingly few users who are aged 18+ and have identified themselves to the Wikimedia Foundation.See Special:Listusers/checkuser for a list of users in this group.Importers and TranswikiTranswiki and Importers are flags which give permissions on Special:Import. This interface allows users to move pages between Wikimedia wikis (for instance, to copy an article written in English on a foreign-language wiki, while preserving full edit history). Although Mediawiki software provides the ability to import articles directly from XML (which may come from any wiki site), this is disabled on en.wikipedia as well as most other Wikimedia projects.See also the Transwiki log, and Help:Import on Meta.Other flagged accountsBotsSee also: Wikipedia:Bot policyAccounts used by approved bots to make pre-approved edits can be flagged as such. Bot accounts are automated or semi-automated, the nature of their edits is well defined, and they will be quickly blocked if their actions vary from their given tasks, so they need less scrutiny than human edits.For this reason, contributions from accounts with the bot flag ('bot' user group) are not displayed in recent changes or watchlists to users who have opted to hide bot edits. Minor edits made by bot accounts to user talk pages do not trigger the "you have new messages" banner. Bot accounts can query the API in batches of 5,000 rather than 500.See Special:Listusers/bot for a list of users in this group.FounderThe 'founder' group was created on the English Wikipedia by developer Tim Starling, without community support, as a unique group for Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. The group gives Wales full access to Special:UserRights. As 'local founder actions' are usually of great interest to the local community, and are only relevant to the English Wikipedia, the local 'founder' right also has the benefit of allowing Wales' actions to be visible in the English Wikipedia rights log; actions performed with the global founder bit are not visible in that record, but only on the log at Metawiki.ResearcherThe 'researcher' group was created in April 2010 to allow individuals explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation to search deleted pages and view deleted history entries without their associated text.EditorA rare usergroup named 'editor' appeared on June 16, 2010 due to an early implementation of Pending changes applying it automatically to certain editors making a large number of edits in a short amount of time. However, this userright has no function and has been disabled by the software.TableAs a function of the Requests for adminship and Requests for Bureaucratship processes, all bureaucrats on the English Wikipedia are also administrators, and so have all the permissions of the 'sysop' user group in addition to those rights from the 'bureaucrat' group. However this is not a requirement of the MediaWiki software; it is technically possible for a user to be a bureaucrat without also being an admin.Deprecated permissions are either no longer assigned to any group, or the group to which they are assigned is no longer populated.GrantedInheritedDeniedRevokedDependsLimitedvdePermissionAllows user(s) toBlocked usersAnonymoususersRegistered
