Now, thanks to their new political action committee, the voices of the poor will be heard. Gingrich was speaking in his new capacity as executive director of Poor People of America, a recently formed PAC that visited [...]16 commentsRead the full article Mayor Sanders says San Diego should subsidize stadium by selling sunJanuary 1, 2011When people think of San Diego, they think of sunshine, said San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders. Im here to tell you we can make money off that.At a press conference held in his City Hall office, Sanders said the city could raise a substantial amount of cash through a sale-leaseback arrangement focused on the sun.Under Sanders proposal, San Diego would receive a large, lump-sum payment for its sunshine rights. A year later, the city would begin paying a daily sunshine royalty  but only on days when the sun comes out.21 commentsRead the full article OB Rag Exclusive: New Wikileaks release details CIA surveillance of Ocean BeachDecember 23, 2010The ongoing drama surrounding leaked diplomatic cables came to Ocean Beach today when the Wikileaks organization released a report from an American intelligence agent sent to OB to investigate possible revolutionary sentiment. The report, which the unidentified agent submitted to CIA higher-ups in mid-2010, seemed to downplay reports of a secessionist movement in the area.

As the intimidating leader of a premier ballet company strolls through an assembly of his ballerinas, tapping those who will be considered for a lead role, the anxiety builds for Nina, a perfection-obsessed prodigy played masterfully by Natalie Portman. Will she be tapped? Ninas [...]2 commentsRead the full article Our country cant afford to tax the richDecember 17, 2010Originally appeared in the Dec. 14 issue of City Times, the campus newspaper of San Diego City College. Admittedly, the USA needs money to help pay for vital American programs such as Medicare and foreign occupations. But the push by some Democrats to let tax cuts expire for Americas highest earners is too much audacity, [...]6 commentsRead the full article Ocean Beach vs North Park: A migrants observationsDecember 15, 2010In early 2010, my wife and I packed up our Brighton Street apartment  all 450 square feet  and moved from Ocean Beach to North Park. We were drawn by the lures of a bigger place and a new neighborhood experience, and after about a year on the other side (of Interstate 5), North [...]20 commentsRead the full article Hey, Obama, heres some stuff we can cut in San DiegoDecember 7, 2010As everyone knows, President Obama is a gifted orator who has voiced several rousing, meaningless, and unmemorable riffs on abstract concepts like hope and change. But hes never been as inspiring as he was yesterday, when he told the nation how we wont be raising taxes on our super-rich. To hear the president, in a [...]36 commentsRead the full article Book Review: The Continual Condition by Charles BukowskiOctober 15, 2010At age 33, Im a relative newcomer to reading poetry. In high school, the standard stuff they foisted on us  Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Keats, Byron, Shelley, and so on  struck me as dull, dated, and often incomprehensible. In fact, like so much of the literature I remember reading in English classes, many of the poems we were assigned felt like they were written solely to make teenagers hate reading.8 commentsRead the full article Still Pointers after all these years: PLHS class of 1950 reunitesSeptember 27, 2010What makes someone in San Diego a local is sometimes debatable, but its hard to dispute the status of the folks who got together at the Bay View Restaurant at the Marine Corp Recruit Depot on Friday, Sept. 24. This was the 60th reunion of Point Loma High Schools class of 1950, a festive and feel-good gathering of folks who can out-local just about anybody on the Peninsula.6 commentsRead the full article Ocean Beachs Miscellaneous Heathens, at it againJuly 25, 2010My wife and I arrived at Dusty Rhodes Park at about 6pm, to a friendly dance party that had apparently been underway for at least a couple hours. Close to 200 revelers  most in joyfully psychedelic costumes, were mingling and dancing enthusiastically under the overcast skies. A DJ spun energetic house music along with an occasional light-hearted, humorous track, like a remix of Surfin Bird (The bird is the word) featuring Peter from Family Guy.Ocean Beachs Miscellaneous Heathens were at it again.13 commentsRead the full article Prop 19: Imperfect, but worthy of your voteJune 28, 2010At first glance, the November ballot initiative to legalize marijuana in California seems like a no-brainer. It will boost tax revenues. It will lighten the burden on our prison system and allow law enforcement to focus on more serious issues. It will move billions of dollars out of the hands of drug traffickers and into the legitimate economy, creating thousands of jobs. Overall, it will end the prohibition of a relatively harmless drug that has demonstrated medical benefits and is enjoyed by millions of recreational users.46 commentsRead the full article OB Exposed spotlights local photog talentMay 24, 2010The Ocean Beach Historical Society hosted the 16th annual OB Exposed! photo contest at the Masonic Center on Friday, May 21. As usual, the event was an enjoyable celebration of local photographs and the shutterbugs who snap them.Over the course of a couple hours, more than 100 people perused the entries, voted for the peoples choice winner, and enjoyed free food and drink. Ocean Beach native Noah Tafolla, creator of the KPBS TV series Wonderland, announced the contest winners, which were selected by a panel of judges8 commentsRead the full article OB Heathens escape from exile to raise funds for summer partyMay 24, 2010When Ocean Beachs Heathens raise funds, they do it with style.On a recent Saturday night, the OB-based group of artists, street performers and other free spirits welcomed 150 people to a warehouse in Barrio Logan. The nights activities alternated back and forth between DJ-driven dance sessions and performance pieces featuring select members of the group.Escape from Heathens Island was the name given the nights festivities. Most guests wore costumes, the theme seeming to be a psychedelic blend of pirate and clown, with some tribal flavor tossed in.7 commentsRead the full article Movie Review: Exit Through the Gift Shop is deceptively deliciousMay 10, 2010Documentary? Comedy? Satire? Hoax?Its tough to pigeonhole Exit Through The Gift Shop, currently playing at Landmark Theaters in Hillcrest. The film is directed by UK street art superstar Bansky and tells the story of his rise to fame  though it does so indirectly.Exits purported focus is amateur filmmaker Thierry Guetta, an absent-minded Frenchman and associate of Banksys who speaks in comically accented English and decides to become a superstar street artist himself.2 commentsRead the full article Beach marchers call for marijuana legalizationMay 3, 2010by Shane Finneran / Exclusive to OB Rag /About 75 demonstrators calling for the legalization of marijuana marched on the Pacific Beach boardwalk between Crystal Pier and Belmont Park on May 1. Participants spoke on a megaphone and carried signs with messages such as Respect State Law, Prohibition Empowers Drug Lords, and Marijuana Is Better Than Alcohol.The two-hour march, which began at 11am, was organized by the Southern California chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and a San Diego marijuana dispensary. SoCal NORML director Craig Beresh led the group in chants encouraging the legalization and taxation of marijuana.18 commentsRead the full article Jeoff Gordon, MD: Busy OB doc has time for social justiceApril 8, 2010By Shane FinneranThough he doesnt seem like hes in a hurry, Ocean Beachs Dr. Jeoffry Gordon gets a heck of a lot done.In addition to treating patients and managing his practice, Dr. Gordon speaks to local political clubs. He writes articles for medical journals. He works with the national movement for a single-payer health care solution. And along the way, the doctor stays powerfully well-informed in areas like politics, history, and finance. He recommends works by authors such as Kevin Phillips, Niall Ferguson, and Thomas Frank.You might think a person with all that to keep him busy wouldnt have a moment to spare, but Dr. Gordons demeanor isnt rushed. He speaks deliberately, choosing his words carefully. And on a recent Monday afternoon, as we walked to lunch at Ranchos Cocina from his office at the corner of Cable Street and Santa Monica Avenue, he strolled at a relaxed pace, prompting me to slow my normally anxious stride.9 commentsRead the full article Contemplating the Obama BluesFebruary 2, 2010by Shane FinneranLike many folks on the left, Ive recently been suffering from PODS, President Obama Disappointment Syndrome. On mild days, my PODS symptoms would include eye-rolling during Obama clips on the news, lack of interest in presidential moments like the state of the union speeches, and on-sight deletion of emails I get from barackobama.com . And when my Obama blues would really act up, Id find myself dwelling on how the president has let the nation down and turned hope into just another four-letter word.But when I take an objective look at PODS, I realize that the malady actually is not caused by any chicanery on the part of Obama, who has governed just about how he said he would govern. My PODS is a result of the dreamy expectations that I, like many liberals, had for the guy.19 commentsRead the full article The Osprey Family of Ocean BeachMay 7, 2009Local birders have been flocking to Ocean Beachs Robb Field in recent weeks. One big draw has been the osprey family that has nested atop one of the parks light poles. This family of four includes a proud pair of parents and two chicks, who appear to be about 3/4 of the way to full size.While I was filming the ospreys at Robb Field, Dad flew off toward the San Diego River at one point. A few minutes later, he came back with a large fish in his talons. 9 commentsRead the full article Follow Us!
