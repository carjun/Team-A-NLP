Such an environment gave me a hint that life has to be grabbed by the tail as tight as a pimple on a mosquito's butt. With no BS and a whole lot of love. So, from those days to now I get up every morning set on making the world a better place. On my good foot*, and I hope my writing reflects that.       *an old black expressionErnie has written 47 articles for the OB Rag!A Librarian With a Sunny Smile I Once Knew and LovedJanuary 4, 2011San Diego has company coming to town this weekend, about 10,000 librarians.

I remember it especially because it demanded that I play a sinister little game wherein I was supposed to check on the status of the Latino students at my [...]13 commentsRead the full article Knowledge Is Power  The Frightening of the Ethnic ChauvinistsNovember 16, 2010When I was coming up in Tucson, the Old Pueblo, I would go this way and that way, to and fro, trying to keep a step ahead of Old Jim Crow. Somehow I survived that dudes hateful antics and grew up with a lot of love in my heart and soul. But he doesnt give up easily and seems to have a toe hold in Arizona and just wont let go.A few years ago the idea of a holiday for Martin Luther King came up and Arizonans freaked out 22 commentsRead the full article Soaking Up Love at HomeNovember 1, 2010I wrote recently about how addressing the Class of 60 at the University of Arizona, as we celebrated our 50 Year Reunion, was an honor of a lifetime. Well, on that same trip home I received another honor of a lifetime: the UA Black Alumnis Outstanding Alumni Achiever Award.To be honored by my people, people who have come down the same road as I, a road upon which we had to struggle to hold our heads up high with Jim Crow 3 commentsRead the full article Aging with the University of ArizonaOctober 29, 2010I recently enjoyed the honor of a lifetime: addressing the University of Arizonas Class of 60 with my take on our times at our alma mater. My classmates and I showed up brimming with youth and Rhythm and Blues and Rock and Roll, more than ready to Go! Go! Wildcats! Go! and the school welcomed us with open arms.In the background, besides the up tempo music, the likes of I Love Lucy had us laughing crazily and we relied on Ed Sullivan giving us a Really good show every Sunday but the world, at large, was in no way like a picnic on a carefree sunny day.5 commentsRead the full article Back to school benefit for gay and lesbian students at the Big KitchenOctober 15, 2010No discrimination is reasonable but there, to me, is nothing more screwed up than the discrimination inherent in our Dont ask, dont tell world.Now, thanks to old Jim Crow back in the 40s and 50s and 60s, Ive faced more than my share of discrimination but I overcame all that, beginning in my childhood 1 commentRead the full article Does Americas Finest City Care About People like Tyler Clementi?October 7, 2010I cant shake the sadness I feel for Tyler Clementi, the 18 year old Rutgers University student who recently took his life by jumping off the George Washington Bridge after a classmate broadcast his intimate encounter with another man online.My goodness, how many more gay people must die due to societys hateful attitudes towards them?

Jim Hopkin.Our visit was like a fantasy, as there was a time in our lives when neither he or I could have imagined a scenario wherein someday I would cruise up to a sidewalk in a nice chine, as we used to say, in front of Southwest Airlines and he jumps in and I whisk him to a Comfort Inn and we end the day in one of the hippest Mexican Cafes in town  with nary a soul in any of these places wearing a P.U. frown.Back then we knew no one who had flown any where  the concept of a colored person staying in a hotel had not yet been implanted in our young minds  and we couldnt eat in a cafe unless the sign above it read Jacks Barbeque or Dukes Drive-In.8 commentsRead the full article Moving OnAugust 10, 2010by Ernie McCrayIts been a little over a year since my Nancy passed away yet moving on is still the order of the day for our children, Carlos, Tawny, Nyla and me.The kind of grieving weve experienced, in our various stages of moving on, has revealed just how fragile we are and how dependent we are on each other, how glad we are to just have each other around.And just when it seemed that the pain in our lives was toning down, one of the twins, Nyla, announced, since her boyfriend who had been unemployed for about a year found a job in Vegas, that she was packing up and leaving town. Oh, the feeling of loss raises its ugly head again. Not with fangs this time but its come with a bite.15 commentsRead the full article Remembering Betty Brown:(Sharing an Activist Extraordinaire with OBs Abundance of Community Activists)July 22, 2010For some time Ive been wanting to say something about Betty Brown, an old friend who passed away a few weeks ago. Its taken me a while because the pressing question for me has been how does one summarize such a noteworthy womans life accomplishments? Listing them would fill an extremely tall and wide notebook, not to mention exhaust the reader.But Ive decided to go with simplicity beginning with the reality that there are many advocates for children on the planet but not many of them, including myself, could keep up with Bettys pace as a community activist without gasping for air.3 commentsRead the full article Thoughts Rising from Tucsons Flowers of SpringJuly 19, 2010As a child growing up in Tucson I would sometimes, on a comfortable April day, ride my beat up blue Schwinn out to the foothills  and just soak in the beauty of the Sonoran Deserts flowers of spring as they danced in the warm breezes, showing off their brilliant yellow and purple and orange and red and blue petals that cling to their striking green stems like lovers on a honeymoon.Such moments soothed my young soul, making all the world feel like a lilting melody sung in perfect harmony. And to stay with this idea of music as a metaphor for good feelings, the worlds music, at the time, did make everything seem copacetic as the devotees of jazz and swing used to say in their cool ness.4 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
