Now, centuries later, the song as is commonly sung in the United States and other former  English colonies, such as Australia, Canada, etc., the four birds are frequently written and sung as calling birds.While calling birds roll off the tongue easily and sound good to the ear, there is no such creature as a calling bird.  Do a search on the web using the phrase calling bird or calling birds and most results will explain that this is simply a modern corruption of the old English phrase collie bird.Four Calling Birds - 12 Days of ChristmasAmazon Price: $11.87Rosanna Four Calling Birds Footed Dishes, Set of 4Amazon Price: $32.49List Price: $40.00925 Sterling Silver Four Calling Birds Photo Storybook Heart Frame CharmAmazon Price: The Carol is Really About Food and PartiesCollie is a term derived from the word colliery which is an old English word for a coal mine.  Collie or colly meant black like coal.  So the collie birds in the song referred to blackbirds which are common in England.  Not only common but, in the Middle Ages the terms collie and blackbird were frequently applied to any type of bird that was black including, as one commenter on my On the Fourth Day of Christmas Hub stated, starlings.During the Middle Ages and Tudor times, starlings were among various types of wild local birds that were kept in cages as pets.  Various types of blackbirds were also eaten as food along with other game birds.  So  the lovers gift in this case was one of food or a pet.  While men today will take their true love out to dinner at a fine restaurant they generally dont give the woman they are courting a frozen chicken or turkey (or, worse yet, live ones) as gifts, we must remember that in the days when this song originated restaurants were rough taverns frequented mostly by men and food had to be either hunted, obtained from farms or farmers on market days.The Five Golden Rings on The Fifth Day Also Refer to BirdsOver the centuries customs and words change.  The word collie did not follow English settlers to the colonies and in our era of science and more precise classification different species of birds have unique names.  And, not only didnt the word collie follow the English to the colonies, it has also fallen into disuse in England and is no longer a common word there let along a generic name for blackbirds.Given the changing customs and changing word meanings over the centuries it is not surprising that our interpretation of the song has also changed.  Just as the four collie birds in the fourth stanza of the song have morphed into the more understandable, but non-existent, four calling birds, in newer English speaking nations, the five golden rings in the fifth stanza have also changed.While the fifth days gift remains five golden rings, the image in modern peoples minds and in most illustrations accompanying the lyrics is of five gold rings for ones fingers.  However, the five rings referred to five ring necked pheasants.  Again, food was not as plentiful and as easily available  as it is today so gifts of food were more common.The Important Thing is that We Can Still Enjoy the CarolIn the end, it can be interesting to know the history and meanings of words of old Christmas carols but the important thing is the joy and pleasure we get from signing or listening to the carols.  And if the words and images in the song change with time that simply means that there is a timeless quality to the carol and that is good.Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas (Stories Behind Books)Amazon Price: $6.38List Price: $15.99Christmas Traditions: True Stories that Celebrate the Spirit of the SeasonAmazon Price: $1.00List Price: $10.95Christmas Around the WorldAmazon Price: $3.85List Price: $6.99Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and PaganAmazon Price: $1.99The Traditions of ChristmasAmazon Price: $4.47List Price: $15.95The History of ChristmasAmazon Price: $4.52List Price: $12.95One (1) Hand Blown Green Glass Legend of the Pickle Tradition Ornament for Good Luck Christmas Tree Party Favor or Gift GivingAmazon Price: $2.99Christmas Traditions Around The World (Holiday Readers)Amazon Price: $2.55List Price: $2.95The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition with Blue Eyed North Pole Pixie-ElfAmazon Price: $22.75List Price: $29.95Singing Carolers "Twelve Days of Christmas" 6 pc asst Current Bid: $122.99 LENOX  Twelve Days of Christmas Snowflake 12 Ornaments Current Bid: $64.99 New Pottery Barn Twelve 12 Days of Christmas Ornaments Current Bid: $64.99 Twelve 12 Days of Christmas Stamped Table Cloth 60x90" Current Bid: $37.95 J C PENNEY TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS BELL ORNAMENTS Current Bid: $14.99 HALLMARK TWELVE DAYS of CHRISTMAS #10,12-1993,1995-NIB Current Bid: $4.24 The HolidayAmazon Price: $5.63List Price: $14.94Home for the HolidaysAmazon Price: $6.96List Price: $14.98Holiday Inn (Special Edition)Amazon Price: $7.26List Price: $14.98Holiday Inn (3 Disc Collector's Set)Amazon Price: $17.43List Price: $26.98Peanuts Holiday Collection (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown / A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving / A Charlie Brown Christmas) (Deluxe Edition)Amazon Price: $27.93List Price: $39.98The Holiday [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $14.66List Price: $24.95Roman Holiday (Special Collector's Edition)Amazon Price: $4.22List Price: $9.98Links to My Other Hubs on the Twelve Days of ChristmasThe Twelve Days of ChristmasThe Twelve Days of Christmas is a popular carol that dates back to the Middle Ages.
