This immediately caused a reaction from people who were hanging out on the boardwalk as well as those standing in the tide pools. Some were cheering. One man shouted, Put your clothes back on!When the skinny dipper returned to the beach, moments later, lifeguards and police were waiting to detain him. One eyewitness saw the naked man struggle with authorities and was forcibly brought to the ground. Onlookers on the boardwalk reacted with obscenities, shouting, F- the police! and Pigs!72 commentsRead the full article California Senate Passes Single-Payer Health CareJanuary 28, 2010The California Senate approved creating a government-run health care system for the nations most populous state on Thursday, ignoring a veto threat from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.Supporters said it is time for state legislatures to take up the debate as the Obama Administrations national health care proposal falters in Congress.  If its not to be done at the national level, let us take the lead, said state Sen. Christine Kehoe, D-San Diego.  The move in California comes after Massachusetts voters changed the calculus in Congress by electing a Republican to the Senate who opposes the pending plan.Democrats are the majority in both houses of the California Legislature. The 40-member state Senate passed the single-payer plan on a 22-14 vote, sending it to the Assembly. One Democrat voted against the measure.7 commentsRead the full article Turf Wars in the Surf at Sunset CliffsJanuary 28, 2010In San Diegos surfing turf wars, tempers heat up as the waves become more crowded. Are the skirmishes a solution or a symptom?By Adam Elder / San Diego Magazine / January 2010Im not violent, but I have had some times where weve had to do some breath-holding exercises, me and another guy, deadpans Nate Cintas. Thats just part of it.  Part of waterboarding? No. Part of surfing? Yesif you surf at Cintas spot at Sunset Cliffs and dont obey the locals rules.Cintas, known to many as Irate Nate, has for years been one of the heaviest enforcers at his home breaka wave surf magazines wont run photos of, much less mentionsolid, powerful, with close-cropped hair and in great shape for a man in his 40s. Born and raised less than a mile from the Cliffs, hes a local in every sense of the word. 12 commentsRead the full article Has Obama Lost the Left? Why Is He Still Pushing Bi-Partisanship?January 28, 2010Editor:  I received this email from a good friend this morning after he had watched President Obamas State of the Union speech:. For me, an Obama supporter who contributed hundreds to his campaign  well, tonight I removed my Obama bumper sticker. Based on his speech, hes a 20th century president in the 21st century, looking backwards into the future. Nuclear power, capital gains cuts, and a health care bill designed by the greedy for the greedy  insurance companies, hes as much a republican as he needs to be. Just better looking with a better presentation. His approval rating is sinking not because hes losing the right  he never had them. Hes losing everything left of center.Heres an analysis of the Speech:by John Nichols Say what you will about Barack Obama.  But dont accuse the president of veering from the course he charted at a point when his term was new, his popularity ratings were high and Americans took seriously all that talk of hope and change.9 commentsRead the full article Howard Zinn, Peoples Historian, Dies at 87January 28, 2010by Dave Zirin / Huffington Post / January 28, 2010Howard Zinn, my hero, teacher, and friend died of a heart attack on Wednesday at the age of 87. With his death, we lose a man who did nothing less than rewrite the narrative of the United States. We lose a historian who also made history.Anyone who believes that the United States is immune to radical politics never attended a lecture by Howard Zinn. The rooms would be packed to the rafters, as entire families, black, white and brown, would arrive to hear their own history made humorous as well as heroic. What matters is not whos sitting in the White House. What matters is whos sitting in! he would say with a mischievous grin. After this casual suggestion of civil disobedience, the crowd would burst into laughter and applause.7 commentsRead the full article Dog Beach contaminated by Linda Vista sewage spill : The signs are upJanuary 27, 2010Contamination signs have been posted at Dog Beach due to a sewage spill up in Linda Vista.  The warning signs were posted today  Wednesday  at Dog Beach  where the San Diego River enters the ocean.  Its estimated that around 4,150 gallons of sewage spilled, contaminating Dog Beach  all from grease blocking a main sewer line.The citys Public Utilities Department said it occurred about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at 7011 Linda Vista Road, near Ulric Street.5 commentsRead the full article Point Loma Woman Shows How to Catch RainwaterJanuary 27, 2010We here at the OB Rag have been complaining for awhile now that even though we live in a coastal desert, there is no wide-spread effort to collect the rainwater that falls on our parched paradise.  There is no government encouragement for it, our culture doesnt support it  and we waste the opportunity every time it rains  and floods like it did last week.Well, theres a woman in Point Loma who is showing us how to do it. Cielo Foth has installed huge storage tanks and 44-gallon trash cans in her backyard to collect rainwater  which she uses for her garden.3 commentsRead the full article OB FLASHES  News, Calendar and Discussion: January 26  February 1, 2010January 26, 2010SEE INSIDE FOR ARTICLES* Pier Re-opens and Is Mobbed* OB Historical Society Featured Steve Rowells Birds* Old Rexalt Drug Sign Bites the Dust* Ciao Bella to Open by Valentines Day* Surf Shop Opens at Old Rock Paper Scissors Building*  Meanwhile, New Smoke Shop and Others to Open at the Old Surf Shop* Richs VW Closes* Skate Shop Closed* OB Planning Board to Hold Election March 9th* Point Loma Planning Committee Seeks Candidates for March 18th Election* Channel 10 News Finds Sprinkler Going Outside OB Library During the Rains* Noon Designs Is Celebrating Its First Birthday February 4th* South Beach Bar & Grille Fish Tacos Discovered by Chicago Tribune17 commentsRead the full article Sign the Motion to Amend  Overrule the Supreme Court: over 40,000 Americans have signed in just a few daysJanuary 26, 2010Since Thursday, January 21, 2010, the internet, newspapers and people around kitchen tables across the country have been ablaze with outrage over the Supreme Courts action to open the floodgates to corporate money in our elections.Over 40,000 of you have joined with us in launching a long-term campaign to amend the Constitution, and others have begun to follow your lead.6 commentsRead the full article Upcoming March 4th Protests To Challenge State Budget ProcessJanuary 26, 2010Everybody knows that the State of California is broke, right?Its the recession, they say. Tax revenues are down and the State has no choice but to trim its budget. San Diegos schools are just going to have to suck it up, tighten their belts and find ways to live with the $90 million in cuts that the Governors budget calls for in the coming year. On top of the $200 million that has already been cut over the past two years.What the hell, they say, the States proposed budget actually protects education. The Guvenator said so in his state of the State speech just a couple of weeks ago. They say theres nothing that can be done.1 commentRead the full article The OB Planning Board Needs Candidates as the Next Election Is Coming Up March 9thJanuary 25, 2010The annual election of candidates for the Ocean Beach Planning Board is coming up.  The election will be held March 9th at the OB Rec Center.  There are vacancies in each of the 7 Districts.The OB Planning Board  the grandparent of all planning boards and committees  is the official advisory body to the City of San Diego and the San Diego Planning Commission.  It has jurisdiction over construction projects and planning issues within Ocean Beach, and is mandated to require such projects to conform to the OB Precise Plan  the planning outline for the community.The establishment of OBs Board was the result of years of trials and tribulations of community residents back in the early and mid-1970s.  2 commentsRead the full article Center for Policy Initiatives Researcher Interviewed by Voice of San DiegoJanuary 25, 2010Scott Lewis of voiceofsandiego.org recently interviewed the director of research at the Center for Policy Initiatives Murtaza Baxamusa about San Diego and its economy.  The Center is a labor-friendly think tank, a rare entity in this town, at least. Here is part of the interview:If there was one, simple misconception among San Diegans that you could clear up in 2010, what would it be?The last decade saw a well-orchestrated campaign by the blame-the-government privatizers at federal, state and local levels. San Diego was one such target, in which public employees were repeatedly demonized as over-paid and over-benefited, even when independent studies show that the city of San Diego compensates its workers much less than others for comparable work. But the work needs to be done, be it cleaning our streets and picking up our trash, to policing our neighborhoods and fighting fires.3 commentsRead the full article Something terrible happened to American democracy at the Supreme Court yesterday .January 22, 2010Yesterday, January 21, 2010, the US Supreme Court dealt potentially a lethal blow to whats left of American democracy.  The slim majority of  right-wing radical activists on the highest court in the land decided that corporations are people and that there should be no limitations on the amount of money they can spend on elections and candidates.This means that corporations can now spend unlimited monies on any candidate and on any election they want.  The 5 to 4 decision overturned decades of corporate restrictions and overturned a centurys-old  limit on the role of corporate money in federal elections, on the books since Teddy Roosevelt was president.34 commentsRead the full article Reader Rant: Another View of San Diego Countys Food Stamp ScandalJanuary 22, 2010As a former government worker myself, I can understand the food stamp workers lament to not be blamed for the program regulations she/he has to deal and the stress she/he deals with having heavy caseloads and not enough workers, BUT it sure sounds like there is an attitude problem also, as many have already mentioned.The worker blames federal regulations but doesnt seem to be aware that California, and San Diego County in particular, goes far beyond what the federal regulations require to PROCESS the applications, and someone has already mentioned that maybe the fact that our County Board of Supervisors is made up of all Republicans has something to do with that.17 commentsRead the full article Moonbeam reflects on origins of Peoples Food StoreJanuary 22, 2010by SunshineWomen.  Questing, contrary, willful, inventive, questioning women. We are women who name ourselves and announce ourselves as the oracles we are. Breaking the mirror of deceit that kept us tamed, framed, within the mirror, the cage. Unbound in this world, free to achieve our hearts desires.I am reminded of such women by Laughing Womyns (Whispers of Our Knowings by Laughing Womyn Ashonosheni) words on First Woman.Return, return, sisters, with me to the time of our origins. Remember First Womanshe whose body was made from this Earth, molded and shaped to carry and birth the coming generations of children, of ideas, of human ways of being. Remember, sisters, when we gave birth to words, and writing, and counting. Remember our healing ways, our artwork, our ways of expressing ourselves, our strong muscles and bones, our minds that fly with our souls.Women like this have lived in OB for generations.9 commentsRead the full article Is the deluge over?January 22, 2010Is this the end of the storms?

The court, in a ruling issued in San Francisco, said the measure approved by the Legislature in 2003 was an illegal amendment of the medical marijuana law enacted by state voters in 1996.The initiative, known as the Compassionate Use Act, doesnt set a limit and allows patients to possess the amount needed for personal medical purposes. The court ruled in the case of a Los Angeles County patient, Patrick Kelly, who was prosecuted and sentenced to probation for possessing 12 ounces.8 commentsRead the full article Initial Thoughts on Being in the Kingdom of Saudi ArabiaJanuary 21, 2010by John WilliamsHaving now been in Saudi Arabia for only thirty-eight days, I have had time to develop no more than a newcomers perspective on this significant Gulf Region country. This is my first experience in a kingdom other than Disneys magic one. While I can hardly help but consider the political basis of this state to be archaic, I am able to recognize that it is but one of the many systems extant on the planet today, and I can also recognize that whether it is the best or worst system currently in existence or is the best system that possibly could be developed are issues I am neither prepared nor qualified to determine, though I could, if pressed, express an opinion thereon. If pressed, I would have to say it is unlikely that this system is the best possible system which could be created, but then to the limit of my understanding, no system is, and, further this one seems to work for its citizens. Saudis I meet spend no time complaining about their government, culture, or society.12 commentsRead the full article Safety Concerns About San Onofre Nuclear Power StationJanuary 21, 2010Editor: This was sent to us by an OBcean who wanted us to know about Gary Headricks address to the San Clemente City Council about his safety concerns at the San Onofre Nuclear power station.  Headrick made the following remarks before the San Clemente City Council on January 20th:City Council Members of San Clemente:I need to take a few minutes of your time to bring something urgent to your attention. I recently wrote an article about the whistle blowers at San Onofre. Since then, another person with many years in management at the power plant has come forward with more serious allegations, but wishes to remain anonymous. This and other revelations are compelling reasons to temporarily halt progress at San Onofre before they fire up the new generators. The normal channels of communication through the NRC and FEMA have failed, and now we can only seek immediate action from Governor Schwarzenegger.1 commentRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
