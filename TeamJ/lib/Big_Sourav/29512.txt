2010 Haiti cholera outbreak - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia2010 Haiti cholera outbreakFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation,search2010 Haiti cholera outbreakDateOctober 2010LocationArtibonite Valley, HaitiCasualties3,333 dead33,500+ hospitalised[1]The 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak is an ongoing cholera outbreak that began in late October 2010 in the rural Artibonite Department of Haiti,[2] about 100kilometres (62 mi) north of the capital, Port-au-Prince, killing 3,333 people[3] and hospitalising thousands more.[4] By the first 10 weeks of the epidemic, cholera spread to all of Haiti's 10 departments or provinces.[5] In November, the first cases of cholera were reported in the Dominican Republic and the United States.Contents1 Background2 Source2.1 Domestic reactions3 Spread3.1 Controversy4 Casualties5 Political reactions6 See also7 References8 External links[edit] BackgroundDuring the 1900s, six major cholera pandemics had spread around the world. At the time of this outbreak, the world was experiencing the seventh, caused by a new strain of the Vibrio cholerae bacterium, El Tor. Epidemics involving this strain started in 1961 in Indonesia, and spread rapidly elsewhere in eastern Asia and then to India and Bangladesh, the USSR, Iran and Iraq.[6] This was the first outbreak in Haiti in over 50 years.[7]On October 21, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that cases of diarrheal illness that hospitals in the Artibonite region had been receiving had been identified as cholera.[8] The outbreak represented the first significant occurrence of cholera in Haiti for half a century, and as a result, it triggered panic and confusion in the populace, complicating relief efforts.[9]According to the US CDC, in most instances cholera does not spread widely within countries where drinking water and sewage treatment are adequate. When water and sewage treatment is inadequate, as in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, cholera can spread rapidly.[10][edit] SourceThe suspected source for the epidemic was the Artibonite River, from which some of the affected people had drunk water.[4] A UN team investigated samples of a suspected sewage spill from a Nepali peacekeeping base that may have infected the river system. Vincenzo Pugliese of MINUSTAH confirmed that the tests were positive for cholera.[11] The US CDC said its tests of "DNA fingerprinting" showed various samples of cholera from Haitian patients were identified as Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa, a strain found in South Asia.[10][12][13]Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said finding the cause of the outbreak was "not important". "Right now, there is no active investigation. I cannot say one way or another [if there will be]. It is not something we are thinking about at the moment. What we are thinking about is the public health response in Haiti."[14] Jordan Tappero, the lead epidemiologist at the CDC, said the main task was to control the outbreak, not to look for the source of the bacteria and that "we may never know the actual origin of this cholera strain."[15] A CDC spokesperson, Kathryn Harben, added that "at some point in the future, when many different analyses of the strain are complete, it may be possible to identify the origin of the strain causing the outbreak in Haiti." Paul Farmer, a co-founder of the medical organisation Partners in Health, however, said there was no reason to wait. "The idea that we'd never know is not very likely. There's got to be a way to know the truth without pointing fingers." A cholera expert, John Mekalanos, supported the assertion that it was important to know where and how the disease emerged because the strain is a "novel, virulent strain previously unknown in the Western Hemisphere and health officials need to know how it spreads."[10] The Swedish ambassador to Haiti said the epidemic had strains originating in Nepal.[16] However, Nepals representative to the United Nations "categorically refuted" the hypothesis that Nepali peacekeepers were the source of the outbreak.[17]Three US professors or other employees at major US universities disagreed with the contention that the Nepali soldiers were the source of the outbreak, saying that they believed it was more likely dormant cholera bacteria had been aroused by various environmental incidents in Haiti.[18] They said a sequence of events, including changes in climate triggered by the La Nia climate pattern and unsanitary living conditions for those affected by the earthquake, triggered bacteria already present to multiply and infect humans.[18] However, a later study conducted by French epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux contended that UN troops from Nepal had started the epidemic as waste from outhouses at their base flowed into and contaminated the Artibonite River.[19]Following the claims the UN said it would investigate the source of the cholera strain.[20][edit] Domestic reactionsProtesters have demanded that the Nepali brigade of the UN leave the country.[21] There were fears that following the discovery of 15 cases in the capital, the epidemic could spread further.[22] The Pan-American Health Organisation predicted that 270,000 people would be infected within a year of the outbreak.[23]On 15 November, a riot broke out in Cap-Haitien following rumours that the outbreak was caused by U.N. soldiers from Nepal.[24] At least 5 people were killed in the riots, including 1 UN personnel.[25] Riots then continued for a second day.[26] Following the riots the UN said the outbreak was being staged for "political reasons because of forthcoming elections," as the Haitian government sent its own forces to "protest" the UN peacekeepers.[27] During a third day of riots UN personnel were blamed for shooting at least 5 protestors but denied responsibility.[28] On the fourth day of demonstrations against the UN presence, police fired tear gas into an IDP camp in the capital.[29]Riots following the election were a cause for concern in the ability to contain the epidemic.[30][edit] SpreadBy the end of October cholera had been confirmed in four of Haiti's ten departments: Mirebalais, Saint Mark,[citation needed] Arcahaie, Limbe, and the capital Port-au-Prince,[4][31] including the capital's Cit Soleil slum district,[32] By 16 November it had spread throughout the country.[25] In addition to those hospitalised, other people have been unable to receive treatment due to overcrowded hospitals.[33] Health workers also feared the disease would spread after Hurricane Tomas hit the island causing more flooding.[34]There are fears that the disease could further spread, since many people still live in unsanitary camps as a result of the earthquake earlier in the year,[35] after outbreak was reported in the camps.[36] These concerns came despite claims that the outbreak had been contained in the north and central parts of the country.[7] The first outbreak of cholera was reported in the Dominican Republic in mid-November 2010,[37] following the Pan-America Health Organisation's prediction.[23] In the United States, a woman returning from Haiti to Florida was hospitalised for five days as a result of contracting cholera. She is expected to recover fully. The Florida Department of Health also investigated several other suspected cases of the disease.[38]On 15 November, Laura Dills, director of programming for Catholic Relief Services in Haiti, said, "Some people have been reporting that we've gotten in front of it and are in control of the spread of cholera. Actually WHO does not believe that. There's such a severe underreporting of cases that they're not sure of all of the hot spots."[39]The Haitian government estimated that there would be at least 400,000 cholera cases in the first 12 months of the epidemic -- with half of those cases occurring by mid-January 2011.[5][edit] ControversyA clinic located next to a school ignited protests as locals felt the schoolchildren could be vulnerable to the spread of the disease.[40]The spread was blamed on the poor distribution of health supplies due to logistical problems. A global medical aid agency[which?] said there was also a lack of access to untainted drinking water.[5][edit] CasualtiesSome aid agencies have reported that the toll may be higher because the government does not track deaths in rural areas where people never reached a hospital or emergency treatment center.[39][edit] Political reactionsOn 28 October, the head of Haiti's health department, Gabriel Thimot, said 4,147 people were being treated. WHO's cholera chief, Claire-Lise Chaignat, said the epidemic was not contained and that she thought it had not yet "reached the peak", so Haitian authorities should be prepared for a "worst case scenario" of cholera spreading in the capital, Port-au-Prince.[41]On 10 November, Gabriel Thimote, Haiti's senior health official, said that the outbreak was "no longer a simple emergency, it's now a matter of national security."[23]The outbreak of cholera became an issue for candidates to answer in the 2010 general election.[42] There were fears that the election could be postponed. The head of MINUSTAH Edmond Mulet said that it should not be delayed as that could lead to a political vacuum with untold potential problems.[43]On 12 November, the United Nations issued an appeal for around $160 million to fight the spread of the disease, saying that "all our efforts can be outrun by the epidemic" and warned of a lack of space for patients in hospitals.[44] It also denied that the Nepali contingent were responsible for the outbreak.[25][edit] See alsoDisasters portalCaribbean portalHaiti portalHealth and fitness portalMedicine portalUnited Nations portalList of epidemics[edit] References^ "Haiti - Epidemic: Last assessment, 23.377 cases, 1.344 deaths, the cholera gains the South".
