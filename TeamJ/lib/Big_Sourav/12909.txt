In fact, it can even be  fatal.  Severeemotional, mental and/or psychological abuse has been compared to the psychological torture tactics usedby various military interrogators on enemy prisoners of war.   Theeffects of prolonged emotional abuse can have devastating physiologicaleffects on a victim, and will almost always have lasting ill effects onthe victim's mind,  due to the infliction of multiple psychiatric injuries.  In extreme and/or prolonged cases of emotional, mental and psychological abuse, it can even induce suicide.   Crazy Making Stuff.... Literally!

Complex PTSD - It is an injury, not an illness! Long term exposure to repeated emotional and mental abuse can result in Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Sometimes,the term "psychosis" is applied to mental illness, and the term"neurosis" to psychiatric injury. The main difference is that apsychotic person is unaware they have a mental problem, whereas theneurotic person is aware - often acutely.   Image Thanks To: http://s40.photobucket.com/home/ilovetakingphotosWhy Domestic Violence is Often Overlooked In relationships where physical abuse is absent or minimal, manyvictims may think that they are not experiencing domestic violence.Unfortunately this is often not true.A lot of victims of domestic violence might never experience physicalabuse, but they are not necessarily the lucky ones.  Emotionalabuse canbe just as harmful and even fatal. Severe emotional, mental and/orpsychological abuse has been compared to the psychological torturetactics used in the interrogation of prisoners of war. In some cases,itcan induce suicide.  I thinkthat emotional abuse is the core issue in any form of abuse. Mostvictims would never tolerate from a stranger the abuse that they endurefrom a family member or significant other. That is the power of theperpetrator.  Personally, I have experienced emotional, physical,mental, sexual, financial and verbal abuse as well as social isolation,and I think that the emotional abuse is much worse than the physicalviolence. Blood and bruises are tangible things. They are there, youcan see them. No-one can deny it. Other people can see them too, peoplewho will support you and give you hope if you let them.  The emotional hold that the perpetrator has over their victim isinvisible, both to them and everyone else, and it can be hard to wakeup to it because it never happens straight away, they suck you in firstand then slowly the mental manipulation creeps in and they change you. Mental/emotional abuse is never obvious, and the injuries it inflictscan be invisible, both to the victims and to others, and can take muchlonger to heal than a few fractured bones. Indeed some bury so deepthat they never do. Because it is so hard to recognize, emotional abuseis also very easy to deny. Words can be twisted and distorted tojustify and excuse, and of course the things that are said to hurt andmanipulate you are only said behind closed doors. It can be hard toremember exactly what was said when your world feels like it is cavingin, and the abuser will jump on this uncertainty to highlight yourinsanity and to once again shift the focus away from his own appallingbehavior, which makes one feel unsure about what really happened,compounding ones confusion and distress, and deterring one fromobjecting or trying to reason the next time it happens.  I'm sure youcan see why many people who have experienced emotional abuse describeit as "crazy making stuff". It most certainly is! Made Crazy or Suffering Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? Inreality, the common description of emotional abuse as "crazy making" isactually quite appropriate. Long term exposure to repeated emotionaland mental abuse can result in Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,      which is, as the name suggests, a more complex form of PTSD.  Bothdisorders are experienced as a result of a psychiatric injury (inlayman's terms a type of brain damage), but where PTSD is usually theresult of one major psychiatric injury, and can usually be recoveredfrom in a relatively short period of time with the right support,Complex PTSD, is the result of many psychiatric injuries, both minorand major, that are inflicted over a long period of time. The symptomsare also more complex, and so is the treatment, so the name is reallyquite suitable.  The sad thing about Complex PTSD is thatrecovery can take on average, 5 years, and can only begin once thevictim is removed from the situation that caused it, and given theright support and treatment.  On the bright side, PTSD and Complex PTSD are psychiatricinjuries and they can be recovered from. The symptoms, such as anxietyand depression, are not internal chemical imbalances, but reactive       or situational      disorders, and so people suffering from either disorder can make a FULLrecovery intime. This is in contrast to other mental illnesses such as PersonalityDisorders and Bi-Polar Disorder, which are the result of internalchemical imbalances, andalthough treatable, will never actually go away. Food For Thought Domesticviolence is reaching plague proportions in our community. Itdoes not just involve physical violence, and people need to recognizethis, especially the victims. In the end all we can really do is makepeople aware of it and try to educate them. Patience and persistence,as well as discretion pay off, but it still has to be their ownrealization that makes them decide to go (or stay). As a community, wecan support, educate, and inspire, and most importantly, wecan model the right way to behave.

I've been there and it was terrible.  It hurts to see people that you love lose control like that but we are never in control in those situations.  I have PTSD too from a few years of really bad child abuse.  The hardest part was finally accepting my mother's part in it.  I just didn't want to imagine her using me in that way.Than, because of religious brainwashing and an abnormal tolerance for abuse, I found it difficult to see just where the line really was?  How much are we suppose to take from one person?  I believe no God that is good would really condemn anyone to an abusive relationship.  Neither, unfortunately, will any of them cure someone  for you who cannot control their anger when suffering from addiction.  It took me more than a few years to stop turning the other cheek and facing reality.  Did I fail or did God fail?  It just wasn't meant to be.Behavioral Therapy helped me a lot.  So did our Domestic Violence Center.  I recommend it for anyone who finds their flashbacks are interfering in their everyday life.It takes time for people with PTSD to train our minds to respond better to these abnormal responses to situations.  It takes retraining your mind and body in a safe environment in a more efficient way.  I still get upset when I see abusive scenes or some of the other things that trigger my memories but now I have learned behaviors to help stay in the moment instead of getting caught up reliving the night/daymares as intensely.I hope you too are doing all right.  Luckily, the whole world isn't completely screwed up and I hope you meet enough of the sane ones to keep your spirits positive as much as you can.Take care.  I get more hope whenever I find someone who survived a nightmare with their sanity. Even if it is only by a thread.  We get through.Momgramwriter3 months ago Wow what an amazing article and domestic abuse sure is wide spread.How heartbreaking this has become.Leah Davis, Founder.Director Domestic Abuse Awareness Network / Child Abuse Awareness Network2 months ago Love it!!!...Reposting on DAAN this morning!!!...Thank you!!!...peacekeeper3 weeks ago Thnx for the articles I can relate to them all so very helpful to me.michelle ashby3 weeks ago wow what an awsome Hub ,ive been domestic violence free a year now and when the Trials over will feel even more free,Im medicine free now,depression has gone and panick attacks,I have a clear mind and my daughters safe .There are to many laws to protect the Perpetrator and waiting 2 years for a rape trial is disgusting..Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites85safe-at-lastFrom Western Australia62 Followers46 HubsJoined 9 months agoRead more hubs by safe-at-lastContact safe-at-lastFollow safe-at-lastSubscribe to safe-at-last's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk safe-at-last a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsDo you believe in love?
