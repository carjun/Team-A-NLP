The bill could even limit frequent school bake sales and fundraisers that give kids extra chances to eat brownies and pizza.The first lady said in a statement after the vote that she was thrilled aboutHousepassage. She called the bill a groundbreaking piece of bipartisan legislation that will significantly improve the quality of meals that children receive at school.Republicans said the bill is too expensive and an example ofgovernmentoverreach. Even former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has weighed in, bringing cookies to a speech at a Pennsylvania school last month and calling efforts to limit junk food in schools a nanny state run amok.Democrats said the legislation is needed to stemrisinghealthcarecosts due to expanding American waistlines and to feed hungry children in tough economic times.The new nutrition standards would be written by the Agriculture Department, which would decide which kinds of foods may be sold and what ingredients can be used on school lunch lines and in vending machines.The new standards would likely keep popular foods like hamburgers and pizza in school cafeterias but make them healthier, using leaner meat or whole wheat crust, for example. Vending machines could be stocked with less candy and fewer high-calorie drinks..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Health, Law, Other Things, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesChild Nutrition Bill sent to Obama, Michele Obama sponsoredRead moreOn World AIDS Day, Larry Kramer, who first warned of epidemic, rips Do-nothing ObamaDecember 1, 2010jamesb101No comments[AIDS activist Larry Kramer, who first alerted people to HIV/AIDS 30 years ago, says President Obama has been "really useless in terms of both HIV and gay issues.](Handschuh/News)***OnWorld AIDS Day, the man who first sounded the alarm about the AIDS epidemic and shamed the government into action for a decade, had some choice words forPresident Obama.In an interview with theNew York Daily News about growing older with HIV,Kramer, now 75 and writing a novel aboutAmerica and AIDS, offered up his views on the current president.Mr. Do-Nothing Obama will say today Lets think of all the poor dead people- or lets honor all the dead instead of fighting for the living.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Health, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesLarry Kramer/AIDS activist, President Obama, World Aids DayRead moreVictorias Secret Models Discuss Their Love Of Fatty Foods.November 29, 2010jamesb1011 commentFrom Gawker..According to bombshells Erin Heatherton and Chanel Iman, being too skinny  isnt sexy and runway preparation entails eating a lot, a lot.

They were done in the doctors office located on the ground floor of the White House.According to a pool report, Obama received a special type of fiber that should leave a smaller scar:The medical unit that treated Obama used a smaller filament than typically used, which increases the number of stitches but makes a tighter stitch and results in a smaller scar. Obama was given a local anesthetic while receiving the stitches.More.Did they call a fowl on the play?Update.THE WHITEBOARDTHE CULPRIT:The player who elbowed President Obama in the lip during a basketball game on Friday is Rey Decerega, the director of programs for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, the White House said.I learned today the president is both a tough competitor and a good sport,Decerega said in a statement.

There are fewerred-white-&-blue draped coffins coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, but one is too many. There are fewerterrorist attacks in this land of ours, but one is too many. China and Walmart are vacuuming up dollars, but some Mom & Pop stores on Main Street are not whitewashing their windows or boarding-up their doors. There are a few more jobs than a while ago, but far fewer than we need tomorrow.

We should be thankful for the quiet acts of conscientious citizenship that bring life to the American dream.Our American dream is really millions of dreams from millions of us.Dreams of walking with Aung, Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, King.

I cant tell you how many questions I get every year from people who are completely intimidated by the idea of roasting this mighty* bird. Most of these people are great cooks, and in fact, have no problem roasting a chicken, but give them the bird over three pounds and something starts breaking down.Perhaps the problem is that they arepresenting their roast turkey to anywhere from five to 20 picky people, or maybe its the fact that your dinner investment suddenly went from $9 to $45. Regardless, roasting a turkey is actually just as easy as roasting a chicken. It might take a little longer, but in the end, theres no reason why you cant have a tender, delicious, drama-free dinner.A few months ago I wrote a post onhow to roast the perfect chicken. Misplaced modifiers aside, you dont need to start with the perfect bird to end up with a finished product you can be proud of. That said, I will always endorse a free range, organic option, which I think in the end will not only tastes better, but will also support the kind of world we want to live in the future  but if you cant afford a $50 locally farmed, pasture raised turkey, you can still pull off the perfect Thanksgiving bird pretty easily.Here are some tips to help you roast your Thanksgiving turkey to perfection. This is all common sense advice if you really think about it, but for whatever reason people seem to lose their minds when it comes to making Thanksgiving dinner.Do you have any tips of your own? Please leave a comment and let me know what your secret is.How to Roast a Turkey to PerfectionFirst things first:thaw your bird completely before putting it in the oven. Thaw it in the fridge for a few days  up to four, depending on the size of your turkey.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Entertainment, Health, Media, Men, Other Things, Updates, WomenCooking a Turkey, thanksgivingRead moreL.A. and Orange counties ban medical marijuana shops..November 24, 2010jamesb101No commentsWasnt California the place where they had Prop 19 to increase the selling of marijuana?Well apparently things are going the other way these days.Both Orange and LA county are cracking down on the stores that sell medical grass..Seems that the stores attach crime..[ The bans on medical marijuana dispensaries in unincorporated areas will affect an area with 1.5 million people in L.A. County and 120,000 in Orange County. ]Im going to say theres two bad actors, SupervisorGloria Molina told county staff. Theres the lousy marijuana suppliers who are illegally setting up and making all the medical marijuana look bad and  [there's] you all. If you would enforce the rules, these folks wouldnt be out there operating illegally.Molina said her office has been flooded with calls from residents saying that the illegal dispensaries have brought crime and blight.Why dont you use everything you have to get them the hell out of unincorporated areas? Molina asked county staff. Im going to support the ban right now because you guys arent assisting us in getting rid of the illegal operators. All of the residents are complaining, and in my area, its really bad.County officials said a tally of illegal dispensaries was unavailable.Another factor in the ordinances passage was the city of Los Angeles recent aggressive push to shut down dispensaries that dont comply with a city ordinance that took effect four weeks ago. Some supervisors expressed concern that dispensary owners would be searching for a new home.In Orange County, the Sheriffs Department submitted a report that found dispensaries responsible for an uptick in robberies, burglaries, weapons violations and money laundering.Orange County supervisors had never regulated medical marijuana.

An estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil escaped from BPs blown-out well.The new report revises some of those initial findings, but reaches broadly similar conclusions over all,said Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Todays report, now that weve had time to reflect, is a validation of the original numbers, Ms. Lubchenco said at a news briefing.But she also cautioned that the new figures were simply a refined estimate of where the oil went in the early months of the spill and did not reflect where the residual oil was now, or the ultimate environmental impact of the spill.It does not tell us where the oil is today or its final fate, she said. This report does not address impact at all.Unlike the initial report from August, the latest assessment was peer-reviewed by independent scientists and accompanied by extensive technical documentation. Most notably, it concludes that chemical dispersants were about twice as effective as had been initially thought and were responsible for breaking down about 16 percent of the oil from the spill, rather than 8 percent.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Health, Politics, UpdatesThe Gulf Oil SpillRead moreAfter Condom Remarks, Vatican Confirms ShiftNovember 23, 2010jamesb101No commentsWell.Well.I commend this action which has prevention overruling dogma.Catholic conservatives arent gonna be happy..(Most conservatives on anything seem to NOT be happy, eh? )Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters[A bishop read a book of interviews with Benedict published on Tuesday called Light of the World: The Pope, the Church, and the Sign of the Times.]***Pope Benedict XVI clearly acknowledged on Tuesday that the need to prevent diseases like AIDS could outweigh the churchs long opposition to the use of condoms.It was a significant and stunning personal pronouncement from the conservative pope after more than two decades of heated debate inside theRoman Catholic Church and condemnation by health workers who said the churchs ban on prophylactics was morally indefensible during the AIDS crisis.The Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vaticans spokesman, said that for Benedict, the use of condoms by people infected with H.I.V. could be the first step of responsibility, of taking into consideration the risk to the life of the person with whom there are relations.Whether its a man or woman or a transsexual, he added.Though Benedict did not endorse the general use of condoms or change official church teaching  which still strongly opposes contraceptives  his words ricocheted around the globe, greeted with anger from some conservative Catholics and enthusiasm from clerics and health workers in Africa, where the AIDS problem is worst. The pope also considers the continent to be a major area of growth for the church.Were in a new world, said the Rev. Jon Fuller, a Jesuit priest and a physician at the Center for H.I.V./AIDS Care and Research at Boston Medical Center. The pope is implicitly saying, he said, that you cannot anymore raise the objection that any use of the condom is an intrinsic evil.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Health, Media, Men, Other Things, UpdatesApproval, Condoms, The PopeRead moreReal Housewife from Atlanta Kim Zolciak Is PregnantNovember 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsSo much for shes gay.So much for Mr. Big.Oh, yeaBaby Daddy is 25..Shes 32..She looks happy!Good luck Kim!Unsolicited Uterus Update:Real Housewives Of Atlanta starKim Zolciak is carrying a fetus.MoreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Entertainment, Health, Media, Men, Other Things, Updates, WomenKim Zolclak, sexy woman, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, With childRead morePage 3 of 32Previous Page12345...32Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
