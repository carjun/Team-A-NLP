Boy's Will be Boy'sAn error occurred while setting up video display.congoboy added thisThe Navy video scandal brought about by Captain Owen Honors has garnered quite a buzz of controversy, but the Navy hasn't revealed the fate of the carrier officer yet. At this point it is unclear whether Honors, captain of the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, will keep his position.According to the Virginian-Pilot, Honors produced and broadcasted a series of short videos during an "XO Movie Night" meant to entertain the crew that featured "anti-gay remarks, sexual jokes, subordinates parading in drag, and sailors pretending to masturbate and shower together" for the crew.Since an edited version of the video was released by the newspaper over the weekend, U.S. Fleet Forces Command has launched an investigation into Honor's lewd videos.Read more: http://www.thirdage.com/news/navy-video-scandal-will-capt-owen-honors-lose-his-j... groups:News tags:Scandal,Navy,USS Enterprise,Honors |50 comments// Navy Video Scandal!

The only bad thing i can see here is that he used some offensive language, but everyone in the video had fun!  WTF is wrong with that???  As a leader, you are there to set an example but at the same time to help and keep the job interesting.  These kids needed some type of fun and he gave it to them... fuck the government and their bullshit  complaints!  They rather mess with this guy but not go after killers (corporations), child molesters (politicians) and the real terrorists (bush and cheney) that have ruined this country.  Way to go Captain! 5 days agoflag  reply0robin49  KSirys:I agree!! I don't think there is a single person out there who is politically correct all the time.  This guy was trying to give his men a laugh that's all.  People need to learn how to laugh at themselves and not get up their own asses every time someone makes a not so PC joke. 5 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  robin49:This happens every single day in the Navy. The difference is this one leaked to the public and emberassed the Navy, so they are going to punish this Captain. Not for what he did, but for the emberassment he caused the Navy. This is a political move, though honestly once you become a Captain you have to become a Politician. The politics begins once you get a star. Once you are an Admiral you are retired from the military and begin a career in politics. 5 days agoflag  reply+1congoboy  KSirys:after months at sea almost anything might be funny. but wtf these guys need to let off some steam. 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  robin49:political correctness is over rated in any circle 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  hammywill:hopefully all this guy will get is a slap on the hand. 5 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  congoboy:I am afraid that is not likely. The best he can hope for is a forced early retirement. It is POSSIBLE they will retain him..but not likely..he will never again serve as a Line Officer or have a command of his own. He COULD face a Courts Martial.I think we will see an early retirement out of this case. 5 days agoflag  reply0KSirys  congoboy:very true!! 5 days agoflag  reply0pjacobs51What would Captain James T. Kirk do??? 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  pjacobs51:fuck uhura 5 days agoflag  reply0pjacobs51  congoboy:This is how it's done . . . 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  pjacobs51:i think i got wood 4 days agoflag  reply+1mitekillemMUAHAHHA!!!Give him a pass. Give me a break...all of this for some entertaining videos he made, with gay jokes. I would say that it's covered under "Satire", and is freedom of speech. Laughter is a release. A way to cut loose, and is a necessary coping mechanism to secure sanity. People are too serious about this stuff. I'm not referring to gay jokes...just inappropriate jokes in general. Sometimes they're just an exaggeration, or a direct reflection of the absolute truth. Sometimes they're just plain fucking silly. I think we should have a holiday dedicated to comedy. I nominate April 1st. ---seems like a good day for that kind of thing. 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  mitekillem:maybe a holiday dedicated to navy humor 5 days agoflag  reply0Sparky2U  congoboy:The New Cornhole-eo Uniform! 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  Sparky2U:are these available to civilians? 4 days agoflag  reply0tverdellJean Luc would never.That being said, I think boys should be allowed to be boys otherwise how would they let out the frustrations on living in tight quarters 24/7. On the other hand, shouldn't an officer be held to a higher standard? That would be nice, but is it reality?I can't judge because I wasn't in the Navy, just using my common sense.BTW, read The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. In this book, he comes up with a code that military men particulary during wartime should follow. It's a beautiful code, but can men really be this way?? 5 days agoflag  reply+1PrivateBurkeThe worst part about this entire ordeal is that nothing in the video was funny. He lost his career in vain. 5 days agoflag  reply0tylervictoria1  PrivateBurke:Ha ha, my thoughts exactly. 5 days agoflag  reply0littlwarriorhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12114023 it looks like he will be loosing his post. 5 days agoflag  reply+1musicjohnnyWell, now he's been "relieved him from duty" so I guess that's how this one's played out. In my opinion the video wasn't all that horrible, but at the same time, the military is held to a higher standard in terms of discipline and representing the best (even though that's debatable) of American values. Clearly this doesn't represent the best in American values, and given that it came from a higher ranking officer, it's even more damning. If that was put on youtube by some random people, no one would have thought twice about it, but given who it was from and what a high standard the military is held to, it's not unreasonable to find it inappropriate and worthy of a harsh reprimand. 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  musicjohnny:but american values by whose standards? 5 days agoflag  reply0carslutIt's a man's world when it comes to battle. All those women in the armed forces are just window dressing for the liberals. I wasn't offended in the least. I'm pleased to see that that the guys in charge ARE manly men. Those political pundits that you see criticizing this action are a bunch of camera whoring bitches themselves. THEY are the threat to our security. Since when has a lawyer/reporter done anything to defend our national security? 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  carslut:if someone ever released a video of what goes on behind closed doors when congress has had a few drinks we might all be shocked 5 days agoflag  reply0littlwarriorOn the one hand there is a certain degree of boys will be boys, and honestly the little video did not offend me, I thought it was funny, however must we not expect more from the person in charge of an air craft carrier? 6 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  littlwarrior:While I agree with the theory, behavior like this is for all intents and purposes intrinsic to the military. This type of behavior is exhibited more prominently in the Enlisted ranks, but is still instilled in the Officer corps as well. There is no way to wean this out of the Military, this type of behavior allows for an Officer to bond more readily with the crew.While I loved, and still feel a bond that can never be broken with my Shipmates that I served with. I will say this, the Military is NOT full of the best and brightest. It is full of the most desperate. While they are amazing men and women, and there is no lacking for intelligence, the Military does not WANT people to be intelligent and to think for themselves. They want servants. That is the nature of the military, so they discourage independent thought. 6 days agoflag  reply0littlwarrior  hammywill:It is true that the military needs people to follow orders quickly and without question so I cannot imagine them wanting much free thinking. But the guy who runs the ship, he has to give those orders and act quickly in times of dire need, shouldn't he be a mildly shiner peanut in the turd? 6 days agoflag  reply0cantucwearebrothers  littlwarrior:Aren't you going to more readily get a group of men and women to follow your orders when they feel a connection to you?  When they feel that you aren't three tiers ahead of them, but rather one of them? 6 days agoflag  reply0littlwarrior  cantucwearebrothers:Yes but there are other ways. Im not saying that I hold it against the guy personally but I most defiantly would not be looking at him for a leadership position of any kind. These little videos do not imbue respect or honor of any kind, its just some guy being an ass and it is funny, but this man is in a leadership position, he needs to act like it. 6 days agoflag  reply0cantucwearebrothers  littlwarrior:So him being a leader somehow circumvents that fact that he is 'just some guy'.  We're all 'just some guy'.  The fact that he hasn't allowed his position to affect his ego (or so it would seem as I don't actually know him) speaks positively of his character. 5 days agoflag  reply0littlwarrior  cantucwearebrothers:To a certain extent yes it is admirable that he can maintain humor while in a position of authority, however if he cannot provide his position with the respect it deserves he does not deserve the position. 5 days agoflag  reply+1cantucwearebrothers  littlwarrior:Then you would have to disqualify 100% of the military.  All are in a position of authority to some extent and all are still men and women equal to civilians with senses of humor, bouts of bad attitudes, trash talkers....etc. 5 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  littlwarrior:Have you ever served in the Military? 5 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  littlwarrior:Have you ever served in the Military? 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  hammywill:sounds typical of what our elected leaders of either party expect of the american people 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  littlwarrior:maybe a better example of leadership would be barney frank? 5 days agoflag  reply0artemis6Idiots will be idiots , more like . 6 days agoflag  reply0cantucwearebrothers  artemis6:What does that even mean?You've never enjoyed a comedy show or an off colored joke?  C'mon.Humor is half of what gets me through the day. 6 days agoflag  reply0artemis6  cantucwearebrothers:When in a leadership position , humor like this , establishes a pecking order . It tells people who it is OK to be cruel to . Making fun of homophobes might have balanced it out somewhat . I did no see that here . 5 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  artemis6:arti, you have no sense of humor 4 days agoflag  reply+1hammywillNot sure why everyone is upset. This happens every single day in the Navy. 6 days agoflag  reply0Itsbatman_Durrsheesh ffs it was funny and intended to be funny.. politically correct people should be post-partum aborted 6 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  Itsbatman_Durr:yup! 4 days agoflag  reply+1congoboyfor christs sake, leave these guys alone 6 days agoflag  reply0cantucwearebrothers  congoboy:Agreed. 6 days agoflag  replymore fromNews:Suspected CIA Banker Allen Stanfords Trial Indefinitely Delayed Online USA News: Fernanda Vasconcellos with her shoes Michael Vick More Important to Obama Than Family of Soldier Killed In Combat The #1 Work From Home Business Of 2011 . . . most populartop rankednew & rising1Remember When Beck Ridiculed Pelosi For Speaking Out Agains... 2Obama lays blow to closing Guantanamo 3Obama Created More Jobs in One Year Than Bush Created in Eight 4Corporations or politicians hurting America? 5Congress to Reduce Free Speech? -- In Response to shooting 6The system suited everybody until the crisis hit  Ron Paul 7LIFE'S GOOD, SHUT UP ! 8A Real Hero....
