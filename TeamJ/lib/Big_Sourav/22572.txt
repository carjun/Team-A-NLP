Breaking News Facebook Says: "We're Not Shutting Down" Ends Dubious Rumor              Israel says the Palestinian alternatives "mirage "    Jerusalem :  Israel|Jan 05, 2011By Mohamed Abd el Fattah        1 0     Views: 54      Israel urged the Palestinian leadership on Wednesday to abandon a diplomatic campaign to expand the scope of the stalled peace process and return instead to the direct talks.  He said Israeli government spokesman Mark RegevMark Regev told BBC radio broadcast from London, "There is no doubt that the process (of peace) is currently going through an impasse.  "Obviously, unfortunately, that the Palestinian leadership adopts a policy of refusing direct talks with Israel. I asked," How do you expect to make peace with Israel if you are not willing to talk with them?. "  Regev said the belief that there is no alternative to the peace agreement being reached through negotiations, "a mirage."  But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the talks with Israel, which stopped three months ago with the end of Israel to cease building settlements in the occupied West Bank and reached a dead end and he will be pursuing other options.  Among these options are an effort to gain diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state from the largest number of United Nations Member States. And gave Brazil, Argentina and a number of other Latin American countries recognize Palestine in recent times.  Erekat said that the parties involved have repeatedly mentioned that the ongoing peace process 17 years ago when it signed the 1993 Oslo accords "are no longer needed for the negotiations ... now the time making decisions and the responsibility of commanders."  He added that the terms of reference for any peace agreement being reached at the end of the matter must be established by the Quartet of mediators in the Middle East, which includes the United States and the European Union, Russia and the United Nations.  He said: "Secondly, we want to seek UN Security Council to pass a second resolution regarding the continuation of Israeli settlement activity and calls for a freeze and therefore we can continue negotiations."        1 of 20         U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat wave in Ramallah      Mohamed Abd el Fattah is based in Cairo, Kairo, Egypt,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (43.8%) Czech Republic (15.6%) Australia (9.4%) Egypt (6.2%) 7 other countries (18.8%)           READ MORE: Western Asia, Palestinian, Asia, political-news, political-news, Israel, Saeb Erekat, Jerusalem, Mark Regev, Middle East, Taba Summit, Oslo Accords, Madrid Conference, Palestinian National Authority, War Conflict, israeli, israeli-palestinian conflict   More News From: Jerusalem :  Israel     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         U.S., Israel: Talks with Palestinians  By: LouiseRoys      Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat issued a denial after media reports suggested the Palestinian Authority would ask the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state as early as January.Reports this week quoted Erekat as saying the request would be made once Bosnia takes over chairing the U.N.
