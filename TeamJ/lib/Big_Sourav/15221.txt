Gabrielle Giffords, said there was a mysterious, significant change in him a year before the shooting. "He was a good person that just somehow changed so much," former classmate and friend Tong Shan told ABC News in an exclusive interview. "I don't know what the hell happened to him." -----"I don't know might have caused him to change, but from the way he was talking to me on Myspace... you can see. It was just questions and questions and random, weird questions that didn't go together," she said. "He wanted to know everything... He would just trip out. "I don't know why it didn't jump out at me, like, 'Hey, something's wrong." Shan last spoke to Loughner in October, after he was suspended and dropped out of school and before he purchased a semi-automatic handgun from a gunshop in Tucson. But she said while Loughner was "anti-government," he was never violent and never mentioned plans to buy a gunRead more: http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/jared-lee-loughner-suspec...

It's been tough to do because there are laws that make it impossible to do much of anything unless the person threatens himself or others.  Over the years we have called county mental health agencies and were told there was nothing we could do. Her parents have been essentially supporting her financially but have been able to do little else.There may be people out there who see this woman pushing around a shopping cart and collecting bottles wondering where her family is. They might be surprised to learn how involved we have all tried to be. And yes, it is exhausting.  And frustrating.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmaxsolomon      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 04:14 PMResponse to Reply #1519.and many families just don't have the resources - mental, financial - to helpEdited on Sun Jan-09-11 04:15 PM by maxsolomoni don't get to see the families trying to help. i get to see the ranting and threats. and then we get to see the results.in Seattle, we just had a schizophrenic, who had moved from Florida to be with a woman he'd met on the internet, kill a random stranger with a hatchet, in broad daylight, in front of schoolkids. his brother in Florida, and his GF who'd taken out a restraining order both wanted him committed. he had to kill 1st for that to happen.as usual, the stories are coming out that everyone who had contact with the AZ shooter - friends, teachers - had alarm bells going off, but no one could do anything about it until it was too late. when we hear about the parents and family it will be similar.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPJPhreak      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:00 PMResponse to Reply #724."they are in denial or in self-preservation mode"I too have a close family who is severely mentally ill,self-preservation mode is sometimes the only way a person can themselves handle that persons illness,a lot of us are not able or equipped to deal with the situation.A lot of people don't undestand this.You are right.It is exhausting.

We've tried withmy nephew, but there's little we can do.Until he's determined to be a threat to himself or others, law enforcement can't take him in.Without insurance and his willingness to sign himself in, no mental health facility will take him in.The family tries what they can, prays a lot, watches, waits, and hope that no one gets killed.It's awful.

Has anyone heard a thing from them?You know, I'm pretty sick of all the false equivalency going on.  Yeah, I've had enough when we know that a liberal didn't shoot President Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., Bobby Kennedy, Gov. George Wallace, John Lennon, or President Reagan.(And please don't try to tell me that Oswald was a Communist -- because Oswald wasn't in that window, and he wasn't on the knoll.) I think it IS about the guns. Liberals can say some extreme things, but they aren't influencing any "gun-nut base" - is there a group of liberal minded people who hoard firearms and threaten to use them against political opponents? Our commentators can be very passionate, but don't say "lock and load" or "reload." I'm telling you, it's the GUNS in the hands of NUTS who are whipped into a frenzy by people in the media speaking their coded language!Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopFailureToCommunicate      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 04:00 PMResponse to Reply #1116.+1Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmarions ghost      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 04:02 PMResponse to Reply #1118.+100n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topshireen      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 03:32 PMResponse to Original message13.deleted, posted to wront thread. sorryEdited on Sun Jan-09-11 03:33 PM by shireenPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topredraider1974      (4 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 04:32 PMResponse to Reply #1321.My brother has schizophrenia andthe last time that he had a break from reality and was hospitalized into a mental institution I vowed that I would watch him take every friggen risperidone every day from now on because he will simply NOT take his anti-psychotic medication on his own.

Only those who've been committed to state care can be forced to take medication, and any such over ride must be within the facilities guidelines and have a doctor's order.  If the over ride is needed on a routine or somewhat regular basis then, a court order is needed in most states to continue with treatment that denies a person's constitutional rights.  Effective mental health treatment of the mentally ill is often times legally refused by the ill individual:  Family, friends and teachers are often ineffective in getting the person to accept treatment or convincing the legal community that forced treatment is necessary.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 09:54 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss Latest Breaking NewsPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
