The clashes erupted along the border with Thailand shortly after the general election on 7 November 2010.[8] An estimated 10,000 refugees have fled into nearby neighbouring Thailand to escape the violent conflict.[9] There is concern that due to discontent with the elections, and speculations of electoral fraud, that the conflict could escalate into a civil war.[10]Contents1 Clashes1.1 June1.2 October 20101.3 November 891.4 November 10 onwards2 Economic Impact3 International Reactions4 References5 See also[edit] Clashes[edit] June12.

The government deployed heavy artillery in the town in response to the presence of forces from the renegade DKBA brigade. The military had allegedly threatened to shoot people who refused to vote.[14] There were also clashes near Three Pagodas Pass.[15] It is believed at least three people were killed and twenty wounded when a Burmese Army artillery shell landed in a market in the centre of Myawaddy.[16] At least five Thai civilians were injured when a rocket propelled grenade exploded in the town of Mae Sot, on the border between Thailand and Burma.[17]It is estimated that at least 10,000 refugees have fled into Thailand to escape the violence.[18] DKBA rebels took the town of Myawaddy on 9 November, and were holding it against government forces. The town was closed off, and information on further casualties remains unavailable.[19][20]According to Thai sources, the Myanmar military recaptured the majority of the town later in the evening, after an earlier battle between troops and DKBA forces. By the following morning only a few areas remained under rebel control. The Thai military, who are supervising the thousands of refugees, announced that it would send the refugees back over the border once the situation in the town had calmed down.[21][22]By the middle of 9 November, reports emerged that government troops had fully retaken the town, and pushed rebel troops back into the forests.[23] Thai Officials were preparing to start moving the estimated 15,000 refugees back over the border.[24]Late on Tuesday 9 November, refugees started moving back over the river from Thailand, with the government claiming that its forces had quelled the violence, and that DKBA fighters were no longer present in the town.[25] It is believed between five and ten civilians were killed during the fighting. However, neither the government nor DKBA fighters have released any information on the numbers of casualties from the fighting.[26][edit] November 10 onwardsBy November 10, skirmishes between rebel forces and government troops were continuing around the Three Pagodas Pass area.[27] The next day, both sides continued small skirmishes with both sides exchanging rocket fire. DKBA forces allegedly briefly took control of the town of Phayathonzu, however government forces drove the rebels out. According to a Thai official, at least 30 rockets were fired by both sides between 4 and 6am. Both belligerents are believed to have reinforced their numbers over the last few days.[28] The DKBA rebel, Waw Lay base was also destroyed by Government forces after a heavy artillery bombardment.[29]On November 12, Al-Jazeera English reported that the DKBA had joined forces with the Karen National Liberation Army in order to counter an expected crackdown by the government.[30] Fighting then erupted again as both sides exchanged rocket fire. During the fighting a RPG exploded near Tinetayar Monastery, wounding 3 civilians who were taken to a nearby hospital.[31]Fighting flared up once more on the evening of November 14 with DKBA forces once more exchanging Mortar and small arms fire with Government troops. The fresh outburst of violence sent at least 200 civilians fleeing across the border into Thailand[32][33]Thai officials were keen to start sending the refugees back over the border as soon as the violence died down.[34]On the 27th DKBA forces ambushed government troops reportedly killed One soldier and wounding 8.

Trade between the two countries brings in approximately 30 to 36 billion baht annually.[39][edit] International ReactionsUnited Nations - Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern about reported clashes between government troops and ethnic rebels "and urged all sides to refrain from any action that could raise tensions further or create instability at this sensitive time."[40]Australia - The Australian Greens party has called for a full trade embargo against Myanmar in the wake of the election and resulting violence.[41]Canada - The Department of Foreign affairs announced that they would work with Canadian Friends of Burma to help send aid to refugees affected and displaced by the fighting.[42]Thailand - The Thai government called for both sides to show restraint and be careful when firing weapons, as it was revealed several M79 Grenades landed on the Thai side of the border.[43][edit] References^ http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/4558-knu-promises-to-support-dkba.html^ http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/4554-clashes-continue-between-dkba-faction-junta-troops-.html^ "Tribal guerrillas attack Burmese troops".
