She could as easily have been a liberal Democrat or a moderate repubican, or even a hard right repubican.What she is, first and foremost, is a US Representative who was out in her district openly meeting with her constituents. This is exactly what US Representatives do. It is how they stay in touch with their district; with reality. It is how they get reelected.Maybe now they'll be willing to consider some limits on hate speech. Maybe now they'll lean on the purveyors of such speech. Maybe now they'll dial it back.It would be in their own best interest to do so.Refresh|+11 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadThey would need a brain first in order to see the connection.

Since Brandenburg the standard for proscribing free speech is "likely to incite imminent lawless action," such as a riot or perhaps an assassination.  But it does appear that if you think it's a cool practical joke to shout "Fire!" you might have a protected right to do that even if it provokes a stampede.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topstill_one      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:27 PMResponse to Reply #1819.and the Supreme Court used to also accept slavery as Constitutional, doesn't make them right  /ntPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toplocalroger      (512 posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:42 PMResponse to Reply #1921.It's not about what is rightI was just trying to gently correct the widespread misperception that the Schenck standard prevails; it's the kind of pithy one-liner people like and easily remember, and no matter what our personal preference would be it has not been the law of the land in the US since 1969.And this is not entirely a bad thing; the specific "theatre" in which Schenck was accused of shouting "fire" was World War I, and what he was actually doing was distributing pamphlets that argued against the draft.  When you look at the case itself Holmes' metaphor is a lot less compelling, and Brandenburg (which was about the KKK) was about specifically allowing this kind of political speech.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topstill_one      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:48 PMResponse to Reply #2122.You are correct   /ntPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topdave29      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 11:10 AMResponse to Original message3.She is also Jewish.And it's starting to look like this guy was associated with pro-white anti-semitic groups.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopStinky The Clown      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 11:14 AMResponse to Reply #37.I know ..... but that may well be simply tangentialThere are many flavors of tools, kooks, and useful idiots out there.

The 'real' terrorists in this country, some of the MSM, get a free pass and lots of $$$ in the process. I certainly believe in free speech, but with that IMO goes responsibility for the consequences of inciting violence across the country. And a number of politicians fall into this same category IMO.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmmonk      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 11:14 AMResponse to Original message8.For people in their world, all Democrats are progressives, liberals,and socialists.  In their black and white world, there are no shades of gray.  That is why they have hit on a propaganda that produces delusion in their way of thinking.  I think there is also a lesson for blue dogs in this when they add to it in the rhetoric against the "left".  It has taken on a life of its own at this point.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopRegieRocker      (471 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 11:16 AMResponse to Reply #89.Small groups of Democrats telling other Democrats what aDemocrat is and should be and their views are wrong is also a big problem.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmmonk      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 11:20 AMResponse to Reply #912.Progressives and liberals are the ones being targeted for hatredand violence.

All too often I see communication here that is appalling. No adult conversation without a correlated response to the facts posted. A ignoring of the facts, a complete disregard for the type in front of them and insulting the person. A run around so to speak. They are so convinced that their opinion is right so that nothing could convince them otherwise. Sound familiar? Even hard facts. I know, I myself didn't stay completely in line with the op's post but I felt it was important to bring this up. I am not talking about myself only. I have come to the defense of others even though I might have disagreed with them in the past. I do not hunt down people and give them a hard time because they offended me in a past post. I take everything at face value. I do not keep a list of names so to speak. I am here to be enlightened, to enlighten and have meaningful conversation. All posts do not require many words nor do they require perfect grammar.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWiffenPoof      (292 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 11:18 AMResponse to Original message11.I Agree...I wonder if this will have any effect on the Fair Use Act.-PLAPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopGregorian      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 11:34 AMResponse to Original message15.You can't say "shit" on the radio. But you can aim metaphorical guns at one's head.I was just replying to another thread about this. How America has it's priorities messed up. What damage did Janet Jackson do? Yet Fox un-news serves as the amplifier for those who wish to do harm to individuals and to the country at large. Giving a pinhead who thinks Alaska should succeed from the country a platform to act like a little dictator. So while we're bleeping out expletives on air, and spending enormous sums trying to keep people from smoking joints, the remainder of the country is dying from lack of health care, dental care (ask me, I just spent $80k on my mouth because I didn't have dental insurance), paying for depleted uranium to be dropped on countries (causing massive health problems to their young), and allowing much worse things than expletives to go over the air. I just have to rant at how messed up Americans must be to not revolt against this stupidity. And now we begin to see the fruits of their labors. I don't know. I feel like I need to reply. We've reached the lowest denominator, and where do we go from here? Do we just keep doing the same thing? This is going to take more than just muting the bad voices. Or changing the First Amendment. There is a common sense that is missing in America. We've managed to survive using brute force the entire way. Now we have to sober up from our stupor and learn.

Boner, et al, keep referring to their recent gains as a "mandate" and the teahadists take them at their word. They're expecting a seismic shift in policies, politics and the direction of "their" country. When that doesn't happen (and it won't), there will be consequences. Probably for everyone.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptblue37      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:31 PMResponse to Original message20.After McVeigh they were shaken enough to  dialed the rhetoric back a bit.But after Dr. Tiller was murdered, they ramped it up.  I don't think they will dial it back this time, either--I think they will go on the attack, figuring the best defense is a good offense.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toplocalroger      (512 posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:06 PMResponse to Reply #2023.It's about their own vulnerabilityI think McVeigh shook them up because, let's face it, most of these clowns work in a building McVeigh might very well have targeted too.  Since bullies tend to be cowards the idea that he might have bombed the Capitol or the skyscraper their network broadcasts from got their attention.I think this will get their attention in more of a McVeigh than Tiller way, because the loose cannon they set off actually knocked off one of the most conservative Democrats in the House -- someone whose voting record could easily be confused with any of the more sane Republicans.  The Republicans have made many promises, and when those promises aren't met it won't just be Dems with crosshairs on their faces, mark my words.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTheKentuckian      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:18 PMResponse to Reply #2324.Nope, these same nuts think of McCain and Graham as "liberals"These fuckers are over the rainbow, look at how they went after Bennett and took him out with extreme prejudice and he's a far right winger by about any definition other than Teabagger and I say he'd at least be a "moderate" in their ranks.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toplocalroger      (512 posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:49 PMResponse to Reply #2425.Well, that's my pointThe Tea Party didn't really exist in its current form when McVeigh struck, and the voices that dialed back were what we today consider the mainstream (Hannity, O'Reilly, and co.)  There really weren't any Palins back then to not dial back.What I think will probably happen here is that you won't see the Tea Party put on the brakes, for your reason, but you will see the media echo chamber which the Tea Party depends on to remain visible and relevant put on the brakes for mine.
