Who was a core member and who was peripheral was determined by each of us in our own minds.  We were all strong-willed anarchists.  Yet people gravitated to various little circles of love that intersected each other at different points.  Though there were widely divergent life styles, what we held in common could be found in the areas where the circles intersected.  A certain unspoken consciousness.      One time I made the mistake of guessing out loud that this consciousness existed among us in varying degrees.      Consciousness exists in varying degrees?  Who are you to guess?  Baird attacked.  I surrendered immediately.  One: because theres no way to argue with a koan and Bairds mind worked like one.  Two: Baird was right.  And so was Richard.  Everything was needless to say.  All you had to do was watch Hunga Dunga in action.  Everyone loved each other enough to do whatever was necessary to continue living together.  We did naturally and through expedience, what others called communal.      One of the natural and expedient things to do was to pool all our money.  All our money!  It was easy to do for the people who werent bringing in a dime.  It was easy to do for the people who were getting their money from the government, which was most of us.  It was less easy for the one or two people who, at any one time, were working for a living.  Nevertheless, whether it was food stamps, rent vouchers, or cash, everyone was expected to put it all in the communal pot.  To hold back a percentage was anathema.  It showed a lack of faith, though to use the word faith was itself anathema.  Baird wouldnt stand for it.  Faith.  Grace.  Take no thought for food or shelter.  Desirelessness is moksha.  Any and all spiritually encapsulating terms were needless to say.  So we didnt say them.  Because it was understood we should be living them.      Oh, sure, there were times when we knew life would be easier if everyone were contributing.  There were times when Ellen was the only person working.  Other times when it was Psylvia, or Duck, or even me, moonlighting to augment my General Assistance.  There were times when some of us silently prayed the deer would get off his duff and do something.  Anything except sit there, putting out positive vibes into the universe, and staring innocently wide-eyed at the cavorting of the seemingly crazed.      Yet we reminded ourselves that putting out positive vibes into the universe was a noble profession and who were we to judge anyway?  So we did what was necessary because we all wanted to live together, because we were the universe and we had to learn how to live in the universe, not run away from it.  We had to learn how to live together in harmony and that was quite a feat for a bunch of eccentrics.      Being anarchists, we detested rules.  Hunga Dungan self-government was based on traditions and at Hunga Dunga, traditions were often established overnight.  Like the Family Meeting which anyone could call at any time.  Like the one Ellen called the afternoon of Christmas Eve.       I called this meeting because Im tired of doing all the cooking, Ellen opened.      Everyone sighed as if they had been through this a hundred times before.  And regardless of who called a meeting or why, it would seldom address just one issue.  It always mushroomed into a venting session.       Look, you guys, Lizzie said, completely ignoring Ellens concern.  Ive been putting in every residual check I get from the Almond Joy commercial, but Im never going to get my dream vacation in Hawaii if I have to cough up everything.      Well thats a hell of a non-sequitur, Ellen remanded.      Well, you are all aware of how much I want a loom, Trudy stated matter-of-factly, ignoring Ellens remark.  Ellen let out a sigh of despair.      I need a piano, Bobby insisted.      And I need a winter coat, Duck sheepishly added.      Why should Tom and Brandon get to sleep in the cabin? Baird wanted to know, competing for the right to set the agenda.      Tom and Brandon looked at each other, knowing their love would see them through all tribulations, even that of having the privacy of their hide-a-way threatened.      First things first.  Zwagen needs a tune-up, Richard prioritized.  You can only expect so much from a Beetle before it has a seizure!      And I want everybody to be at the rally against the eviction of El Centro de la Raza and to save the International Hotel, Ellen exhorted.      Alvoye, always silent unless pressured to give his opinion, scratched the southwest quadrant of his Afro with a chopstick.      Well, you know at least three of us eventually want to have a place in the country, I reminded.      And Im one of them! Chuck piped up.  And I think at some future date we should discuss what happens to lump sums of money that might come our way!      Richard turned to Chuck.  Now theres an interesting scenario!  And you could almost hear a number of cranial grist mills grinding that one up.        Nicky wants land too! Psylvia said for Nicky.  Nickys eyes got slightly larger, if that were at all possible, when he heard his name.  The most important thing to remember is that everybodys equal and everyone should get whatever they want, insisted Psylvia, simplifying the whole mess.  And if you cant get what you want when you want it, at least were all getting what we need when we need it.  Psylvia turned to Nicky and batted her eyelids at him.  At least I am, Im happy to say!       Richard yodeled, a signal at a family meeting that something heavy and philosophical had been said.  That was treading on dangerous territory.  That was elevating the discussion to another level.  That was Bairds cue to elucidate, a service he himself always volunteered.       May I elucidate?  Baird asked, though really it was not a question, but rather a Hunga Dungan parliamentary procedure by which Baird brought the meeting back to his order.  Under his breath Richard said, Oh no!  Another Lucy date!      I heard that, Richard!  And Baird frowned.       Baird, please!  Continue!  You know, I love Lucy!      Duck and Psylvia giggled.      Baird threatened Richard with his eyes.  As I was saying Baird looked around to ward off any other snide remarks.  As much as I myself reject the structure of some of the other communes with which we interact not to suggest that we are one a commune I mean like The Friends of Perfection, the Angels of Light, the Golden Aura Commune I cant refrain from noting some trends that are developing and some lessons to be learned.  Baird always made you feel like you were in a college lecture hall.      Thank god for Flo Airwaves, Larry interjected.  Flo Airwaves were the coolest neighbors any commune could have and consisted of Rolli, Travis, Althea, Danny, Joan, and Glenn.  At least I always called him Glenn, much to his chagrin.  He insisted on being called Divine.  His friend from Baltimore, John Waters, also liked it when we call him Divine.  Flo Airwaves was one of the few communes whose name really didnt mean anything other than as a reference to the Grateful Dead lyric, let the airwaves flow.  For Flo Airwaves, Larry thanked god.       You may thank whomever you wish, Larry, but please keep god out of it! Baird requested.  Now then, may I continue?      Yes, please do, Ellen said impatiently.  And then lets get back to the cooking problem.  OK?      I am addressing the cooking problem, Ellen.  If youll just bear with me!      We all adjusted ourselves where we sat on the floor in the living room and settled in for a Baird discourse.       Anarchy, for lack of a better word to describe us if I were compelled to describe us at all, and you know how repulsed I am by anything that might be construed as a label, if it is to work requires a certain level of consciousness.      Consciousness?  Levels? I threw at Baird.  Why just last week you were putting me down for even bringing it up!      My, my, my.  Hung up on time, are we? Baird socratized.  I just rolled my eyes.       As I was saying, he continued, anarchy, if it is to work, requires a certain level of consciousness.  Otherwise it degenerates into selfishness and greed, and therefore violence.      We all waited for Baird to say more, but he didnt.  There was a half minute of rare silence.  We all looked at each other.      Ellen had had enough.  So does that mean youre going to start cooking?  Or doing the dishes?      Regard this Big Blue house, Baird started up again, ignoring Ellens question, as a laboratory.  Experiment with yourselves.  Trip out on what works and what doesnt.  Without any rules.  Just because its happening and we do what we do because we want to do it.      Baird, that really excites me, Richard said.  Id like to go upstairs right now and experiment with myself.      Pleez, pleez, pleez sil vous plait!  Luc interloped in his Flemish/French accent.  Reeshard.  It eez not necessaire to rideecool Baird!  Allow me to tranzlate:  To be or not to be.  Zat ees ze questione.  Be nice.  Be helpful.  Someone help weeth ze cookeeng!  I, myself, would love to help, but Im piercing Deevines nose tonight as a Chreesmas present.      Thank you, thank you, thank you, Hamlet the Leatherette!  At last, the mighty Greg had spoken.  He was standing up, leaning against the wall, the only one who chose not to sit in the circle, though I intend no sociologic implication.  Probably a leftover habit from his one and only job all through and after college.  A newspaper reporter for The Lodi Chronicler.  Keeping his emotional distance.  Just the facts, maam!      Greg, ever the pragmatist, forced truth into action with a curtness unusual for one so sedate.  The fact is, people, that its six oclock PM.  The fact is that its Chanuka, Christmas Eve, Winter Solstice Paganland, or just another Day in the Life of Hunga Dunga, whichever term youre most comfortable with.  The fact is that Im hungry and I know Ellen planned a special dinner.  What I suspect is that shes tired and bit off more than she could chew and shes asking for help.  So, Ellen, I will help you and anyone else is invited to participate.  But in the future, Ellen, if you dont want to cook, dont cook!  Can everyone live with that?      Everyone looked at each other and then up at Greg.  Can everyone live with that?  What?  Ellen not cooking if she doesnt want to?  That was an easy one!  One by one, each person nodded, mumbled or voiced some kind of yes.      Is there anyone who cant live with that?  Greg asked with finality.      No one said anything.      Well, if anyone does, either come up with another solution, or live with it!      And that became a tradition.  Of how we made decisions.  Can everyone live with that? became a call for a Hunga Dungan vote.  Either everyone could or would live with it, or someone couldnt or wouldnt live with it.  Either unanimity or nothing.  Well, not quite nothing.  And not quite unanimity.  A lone veto didnt count unless it was accompanied by an alternative suggestion.  Then that was bounced around, fondled, embraced, or vivisected.  If more than one person objected to whatever was being proposed, the issue was tabled until further notice.  Until further notice, things would remain the same.           Greg polled the circle with his eyes.  I hereby call this meeting adjourned!  Lets eat!  And with the feeling that, inexplicably, everyones problems were solved, the circle began to yawn and stretch.  Fifteen people stood up and followed Greg into the kitchen.  Everyone was so eager to help they were officious.  Ellen wound up kicking everyone out yelling shed rather do it herself.       I held Baird back until everyone else was in the kitchen.  I asked him, Baird, way down deep do you think there really is a most important Hunga Dunga?      Giacco, he answered, We are all of us combined, the most important Hunga Dunga.  As individuals we are merely important and all equals.  Equally weak!      He must have seen my brain at work.  Lifting his muumuu so as not to trip, he said, This is just one big fucking experiment Giacco!  With that he rushed into the kitchen.       In the years to come we experimented with ourselves in our laboratory called Big Blue.  We experimented with ways to rid the Self of jealousy, material attachments, greed, selfishness, prejudice, hubris.  It was rarely verbalized.  It was just done.  And done with great humor and a sense of the absurd.  Through traditions, which became more refined over time.  Through communication, which became more finely tuned.  Hints.  Innuendos.  Caucusing and cajoling.  Through every means except rules.  Anything even resembling a rule was forbidden and even to speak about such matters was an admission of not being here and now.      Thats why almost no one had their own room.  There werent enough rooms to go around.  Some people, through tradition, managed to garner the same room for a period of time.  But if we ever suspected them of thinking of it as their room, we knew it was time, and sometimes, they knew it was time, to move them around.  At least until the time when everyone could have their own room.      Thats why no one had their own clothes.  It wasnt fair that Trudys mom was always buying her new clothes from fine stores, and Ellen had to patronize Saint Vinnies.  It wasnt right that Lizzie had come with a veritable wardrobe and Nicky had come with the shirt on his back.  So we simply had closets labeled Coats, Dresses, Pants.  And drawers labeled Underwear, Socks, Sweaters.  Mismatched socks became our trademark.  Whenever there was a gathering of the local tribes, people would come up to us, look down at our feet, and say, Oh, you must be from Hunga Dunga!      And though I never could get beyond my self-consciousness to do so, it wasnt unusual to see Baird, Bobby, or Lizzie, coming down the stairs in the morning in a house dress.  Or Psylvia, Trudy, or Ellen, wearing baggy pants with suspenders, for that matter.  There was only one negative consequence of our taste in fashion that I can think of.  It did take away the surprise and fun of cross-dressing on special occasions like Halloween.      Privacy was the rarest of commodities.  Most mornings, you could find Ellen sitting on the toilet, while Bobby shaved, Duck brushed his teeth, and Nicky took a shower.  Sharing the same time in the same space was a given.  Anyone who may have been shy or squeamish about other peoples biological functions soon got over it or left.  We were really into biological functions, especially making sure they functioned happily.       We regarded lust as just another biological function.  And making it function happily within the walls of Big Blue was something we struggled with, but succeeded.      By tradition, we never competed for the affection of someone a family member may have brought home.  Well, at least we were never aggressive about it.  We would never horn in on anyones current affair.  In fact, we encouraged and respected it.  But if the fires of a romance dwindled, if and when love transmuted to kinship, the guest was fair game.       I guess thats one of the reasons why some of us were hesitant to bring guests home for the night.  We knew that unless we made it very clear beforehand the person was hands off! he or she could be subjected to torture by fawning.  Hunga Dungans excelled at fawning especially if the guest were nice and/or sexy.  If both, watch out!      Chores were never assigned, but self-inspired.  Or guilt-inspired.  We had expectations of each other, but we knew the only way to realize the expectations was to model them ourselves.  And if there was any competitiveness at Hunga Dunga, it was to be a good example.      We also knew that to insist on having something of your own more than likely meant someone else would have to go without.  So we tried to give everybody what they wanted knowing thats the only way we could get what we wanted.       We only had one bank account.  And no matter how much or how little each person contributed, all were entitled to share in the familys resources.  Each of us got a small weekly allowance.  Through tradition and his knack for working with numbers, Richard became the accountant.  We gave him power of attorney for each of us, so he could cash all our checks.  He made all the deposits.  He paid all the bills and kept all the books.  When the bills were paid, anything left over was divided into funds.  The loom fund, the piano fund, the trip to Hawaii fund, the land fund.  It would take time, but everyone would get what they wanted.  Even though we knew that wanting nothing was the key to success.      And we knew that if we could solve our problems, then the rest of the world could solve theirs.  It was a self-imposed experiment in non-attachment.  It was an experiment in which being a willing participant was a self-test of how evolved you were.  We were willing participants because we were part of circles of crazy love.  Where the circles didnt intersect, conflict sprouted as often as the alfalfa and mung beans in the middle cupboard.  Where they did intersect, there was beauty and laughter.  And where they were congruent, magic abounded.  And that was enough to keep us together.  That was enough to make us all willing to give it a try.
