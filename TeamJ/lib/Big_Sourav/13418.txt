Simon Barney gets arrested for domestic violence on wife Tamra Barney    Orange :  CA :  USA|Sep 21, 2010By jaded87        1 0     Views: 224      Simon Barney has been arrested on the charges of domestic battery, and Tamra Barney from "The Real Housewives of Orange County" is in the process of getting a divorce from husband, Simon Barney. The couple was fighting over the dog when Simon Barney hit her on the wrist with a leash. Tamra, upon this, called the police and Simon was arrested and taken into custody on $10,000 bail. Simon Barney is known to have quite a temper, but this straw in the already difficult divorce has pushed Tamra over the edge. Simon Barney and Tamra have been married for 11 years and they have three children together. Simon Barney filed for divorce from Tamra last January on the grounds that she had cheated on him and is verbally abusive. As the divorce proceeds, the tension between Simon Barney and Tamra continues to rise.         1 of 1         Simon und Simon     jaded87 is based in Lancaster, California, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (74.1%) Canada (10.6%) Pakistan (9.4%) Belgium (2.4%) 2 other countries (1.2%)           READ MORE: Simon Barney, Tamra Barney, Simon Barney arrested, The, tamra, arrest, orange, entertainment-news, The Real Housewives of..., television, human interest, The Real Housewives of Orange County, social issues, Barney, law crime, Simon   More News From: Orange :  CA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              More From Orange          Legendary Jewish Singer Debbie Friedman reported to be in coma        Jewish folk singer Debbie Friedman dies        Octuplets mom wins in court against hounding by strangers wanting to oversee her children's finances        Passenger strips rather than be molested          10 people injured in Knotts Berry Farm accident        Pastor gets 6 years for molesting 4 girls        ORANGE COUNTY COUNCIL CANDIDATE DIES JUST BEFORE ELECTION        LAWYER ARRESTED FOR MAKING FAKE "SWINGERS" WEB PAGES IN HIS NEIGHBORS NAMES          Chiropractic Physiotherapy Orange CA New Twists!
