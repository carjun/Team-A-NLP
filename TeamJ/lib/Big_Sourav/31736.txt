Not in Pennsylvania, one of the states at the center of the gas rush.There, the liquid that gushes from gas wells is only partially treated for substances that could be environmentally harmful, then dumped into rivers and streams from which communities get their drinking water.In the two years since the frenzy of activity began in the vast underground rock formation known as the Marcellus Shale, Pennsylvania has been the only state allowing waterways to serve as the primary disposal place for the huge amounts of wastewater produced by a drilling technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.State regulators, initially caught flat-footed, tightened the rules this year for any new water treatment plants but allowed any existing operations to continue discharging water into rivers.More:http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/01/pennsylvania-gas-dri...

Last week, Mr. Hanger said the economic benefits of drilling for gas in the Marcellus Shale were worth the 'inevitable' environmental damage, including poisoning of some residents' water sources. According to Reuters, "He acknowledged that some of the chemicals could be dangerous to human health but said that risk has to be weighed against the benefits that will come from the exploitation of what he called the 'enormous' gas reserves contained in the Marcellus Shale." (http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE5... ). The same article mentioned that there are reports that the northeast PA town of Dimock has contaminated well water resulting from the 'fracking' process used in gas drilling."John Hanger should hand in his resignation. He is not protecting our water," said Jay Sweeney, Green Party Wyoming County. "I attended a meeting a few weeks ago about this. Dimock residents were very upset that they are not getting results from DEP or their State Representative," Sweeney concluded. "He is overemphasizing the benefits of drilling for gas and is willing to trade long term water contamination for a short term increase in the supply of natural gas in a time of diminishing water supplies worldwide."This is from Alleghenydefense.orgThere are two major problems with the DEPs actions with regard to approvals of water withdrawals by Marcellus shale drillers.  First, any notion that the DEP has a comprehensive regulatory scheme in place to keep a check on water withdrawals for Marcellus Shale gas drilling is simply erroneous.  In fact, water resources law in Pennsylvania is not guided by any comprehensive statutory or regulatory program.1 Second, and most importantly, the DEP actually has no authority whatsoever to authorize or permit water withdrawals in Pennsylvania. In other words, if the DEP authorizes or permits water withdrawals for Marcellus Shale gas drilling, it is acting without authority and encouraging unlawful conductRead Morehttp://alleghenydefenseproject.wordpress.com/2010/07/27... /PA and the other shale production states are being systematically contaminated and poisoned with virtually no regulations to stop these ***holes!Coming soon to a river near you! http://www.marcellus-shale.us/Dunkard_Creek.htm Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topfemrap      (1000+ posts)      Tue Jan-04-11 11:42 AMResponse to Reply #1516.It's simply heart breaking tosee people's water supplies poisoned.
