However, this man-child, Griffin, is a one-man highlight reel and a thrill to watch. He is not just a 'dunker' but, has a decent mid-court game as well. Too bad, Don Sterling will never be the owner that Jerry Buss of the Lakers is.With Dunleavy gone, del Neikro seems to be having the same success he enjoyed with the Bulls. I hope the Clippers make it to the play-offs. Blake is in the All-Star dunk contest this year. It's Blake against the rest on this one.
