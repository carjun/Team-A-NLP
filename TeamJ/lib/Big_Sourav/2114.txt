Bacevichs WASHINGTON RULES.  His last chapter, it seems to me, offers the U.S. only Hope for Reclaiming our Best Heritage, which we maintained up until WW I, where we started losing our way.  We have been stumbling blindly down the same path 4ever since, learning NOTHING from our Humiliation in Vietnam but making the same mistakes in Iraq and Afghanistan, trying to Ram the American Credo and Trinity down 6their throats, as if we know what is best for their respective countries.If we do not pull back from trying to Advance the American Imperial Empire by Policing the entire globe and Intervening in the name of making the World Safe for Peace and Free for Democracy, we will eventually BANKRUPT ourselves.  Though that is not likely to happen, because Democracy has been Replaced in America by an OLIGARCHY.Prickly City puts it succinctly:  Carmen is expressing a grave concern to Winslow:          People are Scared, Winslow!  Employers can get           away with making them do the work of three           others and cutting their paywhile making           Bigger Profits than ever.           Sounds like the Free Market to me, Carmen.           To which Carmen replies loudly;  WORKERS OF THE           WORLD UNITE!           Youre creeping me out, Carmen!Bacevich writes that what differentiated the U.S. before the Twentieth Centurywas our PRAGMATISM.  However, the U.S. that emerged after WW I, WW II and the Cold World have become just like the Totalitarian Governments which they have resisted:  IDEOLOGUES!We have replaced WHATEVER WORKS with RIGID AND BOMBASTIC POSTURING more than Results.  The Totalitarian Leaders Barked Ridiculous Demands, as their DocileMasses Chanted Prescribed Slogans.Forget e pluribus unum, WHATEVER I WANT has become the National Motto.  In themeantime, twe the people put up with NONSENSE from our Political Leaders.U.S. Foreign Policy DISREGARD for what actually works leads it to CLING to Familiar Repeated Failures that do NOT deliver the desired Safety and SecurityPromised.  In fact, our repeated failed behavior produces just the opposite of what was intended.  Hatred and mistrust springs up instead of faith in our behavior or GOOD WILL FOR OUR INTENTIONS!Along the way, we have betrayed the Very Values which made us the envy of the world, at an earlier time.  As our Government has FUNNELED more and more moneyinto the Pentagon to make us SAFE, we are more at risk than at any previous time in our history.Bacevich offers that the American Peoples failure to challenge Washington Rules that take place within a Climate of Secrecy, dissembling and OUTRIGHT DECEIT has led to a Distortion of National Priorities, as the Military Industrial Complex siphons off scarce resources with our CONSTANT PREPARATION for War and have ignored paying attention to our Civic Needs.The Totalitarian Ideologies have ALL Failed, as will the boogie men we haveblown out of proportion in Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea.  As the Soviet Unit collapsed by exhausting of its resources, China has simply become China, who is focusing on their own economy, WHILE THEY HOLD ONTO OUR HUGE DEBT!India and Japan are doing the same, as is the rest of the Civilized world, except for the Middle East.  Even our other boogie men in Syria, Cuba and Venezuela are little more than flies on a bulls nose!Maybe our greatest threat is the PROLIFERATION of Genocidal Weapons into the hands of Terrorists, WEAPONS INVENTED AND FIRST EMPLOYED BY THE WEST!  Thoughthe scene of the world has DRASTICALLY Changed, how the U.S. confronts thisVastly Changed World HAS NOT CHANGED.We continue to maintain a GLOBAL  MILITARY PRESENCE and Configure Military Forces to Project our Power NOT out of necessity BUT MERELY OUT OF self interest and inertia!He quotes Dwight Eisenhower, who says would turn over in his grave if he knew what gave a state our Government has alowe3d the Military Industrial Complex to bring us to.          a Life of Perpetual Fear and Tension; a burden          of arms draining the Wealth and Labor of all peoples;          a wasting of strength that defies the American System          to achieve true Abundance and Happiness for the peoples          of this earth.          Every Gun made, every warship launched, every rocket          fired, SIGNIFIES A THEFT from those who HUNGER and          Are Not Fed, those who are Cold and are not Clothed.President Eisenhower goes on to list the vast array of human needs could be metby listing ONE BOMBER:          A modern brick school in more than 30 cities          two electric power plants, each serving a town of          60,000 peopletwo fine, fully equipped hospitals          50 miles of concrete pavement..          single fighter plane with a half million bushels of          wheat.pay for a single destroyernew homes that          could house more than 8,000 people          This is the BEST ROAD OF LIFE WE SHOULD BE TAKING          the way we are going IS NOT A WAY OF LIFE AT ALL!          Living under a cloud of  threatening war, is          HUMANITY HANGING FROM A CROSS OF IRON!President Eisenhower was the first to urge Soviet Leaders to join him in LIFTING HUMANKIND FROM ITS IRON GIBBET.  Of course, his speech was ignored and the INEVITABLE COLLLAPSE of the Soviet Union ended The Cold War.What Bacevich suggests is three examples of how we could get us back to theRoad of Life that we were on before WW I:          Contemplate these three examples:  SIZE OF THE          PENTAGON BUDGET; the DIMENSIONS of the NUCLEAR          ARSENAL; and the EXTENT of the OVERSEAS MILITARY          PRESENCE.His argument would still allow for our National Security to  remain a priority,just more RATIONAL rather than remaining IRRATIONAL as it now stands, on the edge of PARANOIA.         If, rather than EXCEEDING the Military Spending of         the rest of the ENTIRE PLANET, Pentagon Outlays MERELY         EQUAL that of the COMBINED BUDGETS OF Russia, China, Iran,         North Korea, Syria, Venezuela and Cuba.         If U.S. Nuclear Stockpiles  consisted of several hundred         weapons rather than several thousandsany less         Vulnerable to Nuclear Blackmail?        Were the U.S. to finally withdraw its forces fromthe        rest of EuropeAmericans sleep any less easily in their        beds at night?The reason this will  never happen unless Carmens call to arms is answered by WE THE PEOPLE;  WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!  Dont hold your breath!  The Reason this will never happen under Washington Rules is as follows:          The Washington Rules deliver POWER, PROFIT AND PRIVILEGE          to a long list of BENEFICIARIES: Elected and Appointed          Officials, Corporate Executives, Corporate Lobbyists,          Admirals and Generals, Functionaries Staffing the National          Security Apparatus, Media Personalities, Policy Intellectuals          from Universities and research Organizations.          This Money Lubricates American PoliticsJobs and          Contracts for Distribution to Constituents..U.S.          Military Officers hired by Weapons Manufacturers or          Consulting Firms known as BELTWAY BANDITS.          MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX no longer SUFFICES TO          DESCRIBE the CONGERIES of Interests Profiting from          and Committed to Preserving the National Security          STATUS QUO!Bacevich falls back on the usual intractability of the Human Condition thatmakes what is happening to American Culture is no different than what happened to ALL CIVILIZATIONS before and after us yet to come.However, he goes on to quote from Americans before the 20th Century and even some during the 20th Century that called us back to a Path of Righteousness, where we Humans have the Power to Choose our Righteous Side and not our Base or Dark Side.  The so-called Human Condition is NOT INTRACTABLE but rather a MATTER OF CHOICE!Bacevich proceeds  to quote John Winthrop who offered a Different American Credo, until it was swept aside by the CONCEITS and ARROGANCE OF POWER during the 20th Century.         Proponents of this Earlier American credo did not         question Americas Mission.  Embracing John Winthrops         charge issued to his followers on the Eve of Founding         Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630, they sought toCREATE         A CITY UPON A HILL.         This defined Americas Obligation to the world.         Self Mastery takes Precedence over Mastery of Others.         transcending Partisanship, blending BOTH Idealism         and Realism, Patience rather than  Immediacy, Preferring         INFLUENCE OVER COERCION.In George Washingtons Farewell Address to the nation enjoyed a standing next to Scripture:          Washington urged his countrymen to chart an          INDEPENDENT COURSE, enabling the U.S. to give to          Mankind the MAGNANIMOUS and too Novel Example of a          People Always Guided by an EXALTED Justice and          Benevolence.One of his most quoted of his speeches was his warning against both a Standing Army and Entangled Forces Abroad.          Why quit our own, to Stand on FOREIGN Ground?  Why          by interweaving our destiny with that of ANY Part of          Europe, ENTANGLE OUR PEACE AND PROSPERITY in the Toils          of European AMBITION, Rival-ship, Interest, Humor or          CAPRICE?In 1821, Secretary of State Adams echoed Washington theme:          The United States goes NOT abroad in Search of          MONSTERS TO DESTROY.         well wisher to the Freedom and Independence for         all.  She is a champion and Vindicator ONLY of her own!         She will Commend the General cause by the Countenance of         HER VOICE and the BENIGNANT SYMPATHY OF HER EXAMPLE!         The Fundamental Maxims of Her Policy would INSENSIBLY         Change from LIBERTY TO FORCEShe might become DICTATORS         of the World.  She would NO LONGER BE THE RULER OF HER OWN         SPIRIT!The above very Sensible and Rational view of the U.S. Rules guided us through the 19th Century, even as we worked on maturing our own Democracy, Freedom and Independence via the Emancipation Proclamation and the Civil War.Even as President Wilson dragged us into WW I and Americans had to start viewing ourselves in the words of William James of Harvard University:          Americas impulsive if abbreviated FLING WITH EUROPEAN          IMPERIALISM in 1898 signaled an IMPENDING DEMISE to this          Tradition.          We used to believethat we were of different CLAY from          other Nationsbut this turned out to be Pure July 4 FANCY,          scattered in five minutes by the First Temptation..we were          NO Different from the WARRING PEOPLES OF EUROPE!However, there were critics of Wilson in 1917, like Radical Journalist, Randolph Bourne who offered an IMPASSIONED Defense pf Americas True Missionin a World CONSUMED BY VIOLENCE:          If America has lost its Political Isolation, it is all          the MORE OBLIGATED to RETAIN ITS SPIRITUAL INTEGRITY.It          means that THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN LIFE IS NOT YET ACHIEVED           and that, until it is, There is NOTHING FOR US BUT           STERN AND INTENSIVE CULTIVATION OF OUR GARDEN.There CONTINUE to be Voices that call us to our Main Mission of CULTIVATING OUR OWN GARDEN, even as Washing Rules keep Getting it Wrong and lead us down the Path whereby our SPIRITUAL INYTEGRITY AND THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN LIFE KEEPS BEING DELAYED.Bacevich mentions the likes of George Kennan, Senator J> William Fulbright, to whom we have already referred, influential Social Critic Christopher Lasch and Martin Luther King, Jr, arguably the Dominant Moral Figure of the American Century.Kennan wrote:          Americans, it seems to me, have TOO LONG SUBJECTED          THEIR GARDEN TO ABUSE.  Our Country BRISTLES with          Imperfections.  Some of them are Very Serious.  Of          Which MOST OF THEM we are almost UNIVERSALLY AWARE,          but lack the civic vigor to correct.          Here lays the Real Danger.  What is at Stake here is          OUR DUTY TO OURSELVES AND OUR OWN NATIONAL IDEALS.It was in a lecture where Kennan returned to the theme that Bacevich says laythe ONLY HOPE FOR OVERTURNING WASHINGTON RULES:          The sight of an America in which there is VISIBLE no          Higher Social Goal than the SELF ENRICHMENT OF THE          INDIVIDUAL, and where Self-Enrichment takes Place          PRIMARILY IN MATERIAL GOODS AND GADGETS          OMITS ACHIEVEMENT OF DEEPER SATISFACTIONS IN LIFE          This Sight Fails to INSPIRE either CONFIDENCE OR ENTHUSIASM.Kennan here echoes both Carmens call WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE and Bacevichs challenge to WE  THE PEOPLE as being the ONLY ones who can Change Washington Rules.  How do we do it? Kennan, like Eisenhower challenged us:          Rather than Obsessing about the threat of the Soviet          Union, the nation NEEDED TO GET ITS OWN HOUSE IN ORDER!          bY DEMONSTRATING A capacity to Nurture a Genuinely Healthy          Relationship both to Man and to  Nature, then, AND ONLY THEN,          might Americans have Something to say to People Elsewhere.It was Martin Luther King, Jr., who in 1967 raged against our involvement inVietnam.  He said:          All People of Conscience needs to call upon America to          COME BACK HOME!  Before Attempting to save others, the          Nation needed to Acknowledge and Correct ITS OWN SINS.          Before America could address its need for arduous          work of Creating a Free Society, which remained FAR FROM          FINISHEDthe U.S. must first Tackle the GIANT TRIPLETS          OF RACISM, MATERIALISM AND MILITARISM.MLK, Jr. challenged us the same as had WinthroWashington,Adams,Fulbright,and Kennan:          a turning from within is essential, in order          that we may have something to give without, to use         Randolph Bournes words         In short, IF the U.S. has a Saving Mission, it is FIRST AND         FOREMOST TO SAVE ITSELF.As Winslow replies to Carmen:  YOU ARE CREEPING ME OUT!  Yes, Winslow, it is a daunting enterprise but this coming home to ourselves has been a Possibility since our Beginning.  It remains our ONLY TRUE OR REAL OPTION.  Forto Cling to the American Credo and the Triniyty of Washington Rules is the sure Path to our own Self-Destruction!  Now, thats really Creepy!
