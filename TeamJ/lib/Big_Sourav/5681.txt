Loyalist mural celebrating Cromwell's massacre of catholicsThe Writing is on the Wall......Ireland's political wall murals are fast becoming world famous and they receive thousands of visitors every year. In more recent years some of the most memorable murals have been replaced by less 'militarist' imagery due at least in part to British governent grant funding to 'tone' down the murals in keeping with their 'normalisation' policy. In the pro-British Loyalist areas murals were a feature for many years even previous to what is commonly known as 'the Troubles' but they were not on the same scale as they would have been in later years and generally took the form of a simple representation of King William of Orange or similar imagery. In Republican areas political wall mural painting mushroomed over this past 35 years and some such as the renowned gable end in Derry's Bogside proclaiming "You Are Now Entering Free Derry" have become local landmarks and world famous. Several books and academic studies of political wall murals in the North of Ireland have been published perhaps the best known being by local academic Bill Rolston.Up until more recent times there was a strong paramilitary theme to most Irish Republican political murals with paintings of armed Republicans being common. Memorial type political murals were/are also popular with many remembering the sacrifice of the ten Hungerstrikers who gave their lives in the struggle for political status in 1981. Other memorial type political murals commemorate Irish Republicans who lost their lives in the recent conflict. The Provisonal IRA's murals are by far the most numerous in republican areas due to their fairly successfull attempts at achieving near hegemony within the Republican community especially in West Belfast. Murals in support of other groups do exist however and there are several striking murals sponsored by the Irish Republican Socialist Movement (IRSM), arevolutionary Republicanmovement that includes the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) & the Republican Socialist Youth Movement (RSYM.) Three IRSM prisoners gave their lives in the 1981 Hunger Strike and many IRSM murals commemorate their sacrifice. Other IRSM murals commemorate the Great Belfast Dockers strike that saw age old sectarian differences being forgotten in an all too brief display of workers unity against a common class enemy. The IRSM mural in question is placed strategically on an old factory wall on Northumberland Street, a road that runs between the Protestant Shankill and the Catholic Falls Road and it's poignant message appeals for class solidarity once again. A new mural on the same 'peaceline' which divides the Falls & Shankill Roads painted by the IRSP on the 'Republican' side of the interface & working class Loyalists on the Shankill 'side' is currently being planned.Other anti-Stormont Republican groupings have started painting murals in Republican areas most recently being the Republican Network for Unity's (RNU) new mural. To the best of my knowledge the Official Republican Movement (ORM - formed following a split from the OIRA's political wing the Workers Party) have only one mural in Belfast. Painted on the gable wall of their Falls Rd office, it commemorates Liam McMillan a former Official IRA leader. McMillan was allegedly shot dead by a youthful Gerald Steenson who later became a leader of the now defunct infamous IPLO (Steenson was ironically shot dead himself by the INLA.)Many Republican murals are non-party based eg, commemorating the Hunger Strikes of 1981 or the 1916 Easter Rising. Some murals are based in Celtic Mythology and are widely acclaimed because of their intricate celtic designs. The world famous 'International Wall' on the Lower Falls Road/Divis Streetcelebrates international solidarity with Liberation Struggles eg, in Palestine, Latin America and the Basque Country. Tours of the murals and areas of historical significance in the Irish conflict are conducted by ex-political prisoners and are extremely good value for money for students of the Irish conflict & conflict resolution in general. Backpack bearing visitors from all corners of the world are a common sight in West Belfast being guided round the various murals. Community groups in west Belfast also paint murals as an alternative for teenagers instead of graffitti and their work can be seen in many districts often warning of the dangers of street drugs and alcohol abuse.In pro-British Loyalist areas many of the 'political' wall murals are militarist orientated though there has been a recent trend in displaying less threatening images. During George Best's funeral from his parents home in the staunchly loyalist Cregagh estate, overtly militarist & right-wing murals were covered up following a quick cash injection from the loyalist controlled Castlereagh council to 'clean' up the area for Manchester United soccer fans who had come over from Britain for the funeral of their soccer hero. Murals of masked paramilitaries from the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) & Ulster Defence Association (UDA) are still prevalent in loyalist areas, some disturbingly depicting scenes of sectarian murders. Loyalist murals are widely seen to be reactionary & of less internationalist appeal due to their ideological links to fascist & racist groups in Britain & Europe. Some Loyalist murals include scenes from Iron Maiden album covers which is a fairly good barometer of their political maturity! Loyalist ex-prisoners conduct tours of their murals and there are 'joint tours' where tourists can visit murals in both Republican & Loyalist areas.The North's political murals are a 'must-see' for tourists to Belfast and Derry. There are various ways to see them and I will include links to the various groups and agencies offering 'political tours' and generalised tours of places of historical significance within Belfast and Derry's vast working class 'ghettoes' which have seen much of the conflict over the years. There are 'walking tours' conducted by ex-political prisoners which I highly reccomend, they are relatively cheap and great value for money as your guide will be intimately familiar with both the area and the nature of the conflict. There are black taxi tours and mini-bus tours available from the same source. Open top tour buses leave the city centre regularly and these are popular too. It is also entirely possible to conduct your own unassisted tour of Belfast's political murals and you will be completely safe despite the troubled history. Local people will be only too happy to provide local knowledge and you will find that local people are walking encyclopedias on the Irish conflict. Call into some of the local parties or groups offices if you need directions. Like any city Belfast has it's criminal element so avoid areas where you may see large groups of youths drinking & hanging about, commonsense tourist precautions will keep you safe just like in any country in the world.

It actually features in a video for the Cranberries, either Zombie or Ode to my Family- both of which were filed in and around the Falls.I remeber visiting my granny over New year in Belfast and the women in the street would all come out at midnight and bang the bin lids.Thanks for sharing Iskra xxxiskra191610 months ago Many thanks for your kind comments a chara.There are many fine political & cultural murals in Belfast. I think I remember the mural that you describe it had a woman holding a rifle & the symbol for Feminism (a circle with a cross below ) surrounding it?A lot of the more military orientated murals are being painted over & less bellicose imagery replacing them.There are a variety of tours of the murals, the so-called 'peace walls' & places of significance in the conflicts history on offer, some are conducted by ex-prisoners who were combatants in the conflict.Well worth a visit a charaDavid7 months ago Tiocfaidh ar la!Teresa McGurk5 months ago Another great hub.

McG.iskra19165 months ago Indeed..chspublish3 weeks ago As an Irish person living in the south I never realised how many murals there are in the North - a kind of livng visual artistry of life in the forefront of things. I used to live on the border at one stage and was aware of some of the murals. I'm glad to read there are tours of these murals. It's something I will definitely get around to see more of next summer.
