Dupnik(Credit:AP Photo/Chris Morrison)The mans plain sense of out range and the political brinkmanship in his state is wonderful for its directness and frankness..Political manuerib=ng since President Obama has come into office HAS gotten worst..Im with my friend Jack in saying that political gamesmanship isnt the whole reason for the senseless shooting down in TucsonBut it sure doesnt help things.There have ALWAYS been crazies out thereWe can go back and see people throwing things at Presidents.Shooting at them.Seriously or not..People threaten politicians daily..While some call it excessiveElected politicians around the country have police officers accompanying them in protective details everyday.But the Sheriffis rightThings need to calm down out thereWere ALL Americans Trying to get thru this journey.In a more perfect union.That is ever changing..AndChanging is life..It never stops..***Pima County Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik, who is overseeing the investigation of Saturdays mass shooting that critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D), became an overnight sensation with his remarks that the vitriol in todays political discourse contributed to the incident and that Arizona has become a mecca for prejudice and bigotry.Dupniks name wasa top search term on Twitter Saturday night, with many of the tweets thanking him for his candor, and overnight,a Facebook page titled Clarence Dupnik is my Hero sprung up.In a news conference Saturday evening, Dupnik condemned the atmosphere of hatred and bigotry that he said has gripped the nation and suggested that the 22-year-old suspect being held in the shooting was mentally ill and therefore more susceptible to overheated messages in the media.Theres reason to believe that this individual may have a mental issue. And I think people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible to vitriol, he said during his televised remarks. People tend to pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that. That may be free speech, but its not without consequences.His remarks especially resonated with liberals, who even before the name of the suspect was released suggested that the shooter may have had been incited by the tea party. There is no indication that the suspect, Jared Lee Lougner, identified with the tea party or was politically conservative. During the campaign, liberal pundits and politicians asserted that the sometimes militant language some conservative politicians used could incite violence..MoreOf course the knuckle head GOP Senator Kyl really doesnt get it..Kyl: Arizona Sheriffs Remarks InappropriateBrian Beutler | January 9, 2011, 11:50AMSen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ)In a Sunday morning appearance on Face the Nation, Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl (R-AZ) took issue with Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, who criticized Arizona hours after the Giffords shooting.I didnt really think that that had any part in a law enforcement briefing, Kyl said.In a candid moment at a press conference on Saturday, Dupnik said his state had become ground zero for the sort of political rhetoric that foments violence.Read more And we would hope that Sarah Palin will come to her senses and move way from stunts like putting crosshairs on pictures of Democrats..Palin Aide: Crosshairs On Target List Not Actually Gun SightsBrian Beutler | January 9, 2011, 10:52AMFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah PalinAn aide to Sarah Palin claims the crosshairs depicted in her now-infamous target list of Democrats were not actually gun-sights, and that its obscene and appalling to blame Palin for the shooting.We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights. It was simply cross-hairs like youd see on maps,saidRebecca Mansour on the Tammy Bruce radio show. Moreover, there was nothing irresponsible about the image, and to draw a line connecting Palin and Saturdays shooting is obscene and appalling.You can see the original image below. Mansour called the crosshairs surveyor marks. Palin has removed the list from her PAC website, but not from her Facebook page.Read more And comments on the Discussion of the Day?..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, Updates'political 'vitriol', crosshairs on Dem's, Democrats vs Republicans, immigration, opposition politics, Pima County Sheriff Dupnik, politcal violnce, Sarah Palin, Sen Kyl, The Discussion of the Day, the left vs the rightRead moreGov Christie of NJ refused to come home early from Disneyland for last weeks 3 of snowWas he right?Discussion of the DayJanuary 7, 2011jamesb10117 commentsTalkandpolitics points out our topic of Discussion for today.(While the snow falls for the second time in two weeks around here)Did Governor Chris Cristie do the right thing by going complete off the clock while his state was buried in 3 feet of snow?Is the Governors family and need for a vacation more important than him making his way back home to help the state dig out of the snow messA few things to think over..Could the Governor have returned to New Jersey any earlier than WednesdayTwo days after it snowed?Newark Airport was closed..Could the Governor have set up a command post in Florida and worked the situation from there?Was the Governor under the protection of the New Jersey State Police.Therefore technically assumed to be working leader of the state?That is even though he may have designated someone to be anunofficialcaretaker, like the head of the states legislatureWhile no one would dispute that family comes first.The Governors in your face attitude is nothing new.New Jerseyans should know thatBut politicians campaign to get the job.Families know that and expect itI dont know if Christie being back in the state would have made much difference in snow removal..But as with Mayor Bloomberg .People are not just going to forget this..Did the Governor do the right thing?Whats your call people?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updates'in your face' guy, 9 million New Jersey citizens, Family first, Governor Christie of New Jersey refused to come home early from Disneyland during last weeks 3' of snow, Snowed in, State's Governor in-charge, The Discussion of the Day, vacationRead moreMoney and Politics..Have things gone too far?OrShould Everyone be able to spend what they have?January 3, 2011jamesb101No commentsDiscussion for today.Money and Politics.I know when the changed things up a few months ago and basically gutted McCain-Feingold I made this point.While we all complain.Rich people should be able to spend their money also.As should corporations.I said that which most people would probably not agree with because of the fact ..NO MATTER what you doOrLegislateRich people and corporations are gonna spend their money on candidates and causes they feel are important to them..NO Matter What.It take a ton of money to run for Everything these days.My feeling is. EVERYBODY giving to a candidate should have to be listed regardless if the give more that $150 ..EVERYBODY..And since we now have computers for everything.In Federal elections for Congress and Presidents those numbers should be released every MONTH.Not ever quarter.With this in place the media nd Blogs (Yes Blogs) will be a far more effective method of getting this information out to the

Bosses dont want to believe it.But most places run fine without them micro managing things.Discussion of the DayJanuary 1, 2011jamesb10114 commentsAlong the way this Dog and his wife ran a private school.I got up early everyday and made sure I was in and watching how things ran.Talking to people and checking on things..When things got busy.My wife and I graduated to two locations.Where we were ran good.But the other place had a few problemsSo we went back to one location bigger to hold everybody.After a while when things got in shape .I STILL made sure I was always around with my wife.But you know something.Things ran fine if we didnt micro manage them.In almost all situations.When you have a decent, or good staff.Things run fine with or with out the boss.Good managers let their workers do their jobs.Poor managers stick their noses into everything..Way back when I went to Grad school and studied Management and Human ResourcesThe mantra during my time studying was empowerment and bottom up decision makingWe ALL know that is straight-up bullshit.No place lets its staff decide how to run things.Managers are just too damn sacred and egotistical.But if you take a look at where you workOr just about anywhere anybody works..Cop, Nurse, Retail, Military, Ramp of an airport..The grunts do make things work for the most their style.Good crews get a set of rules and policies and hone them down to what THEY need to do the job.Good managers after a while learn to set boundariesThen let their staff go to work..Always being available But stepping back and doing their paperworkAnd being available to handle problems..For that they will aways get respect .And happy productive staff.WellMost of the time..What does everyone think about this out there?Share on Facebook  Tweet This

soon..Discussion for the day..December 31, 2010jamesb10118 commentsWhile driving around in my SUV with my wife yesterdayI heard a session on POTUS XM radio between Joe Mathieu and some guy who had made a good amount of trips to the Afghan war zones..The guy was very informed on what was going on in the war zone.You could tell he wasnt a media person for the cable channels.I loved the session because the guy was giving it straightHe was telling Mathieu what he saw..The truth he went on to say was that the United States was fighting the war the way we do things.BIG.He related how the command center in the war was controlled by a control center in Kabul the size of all most a football fieldWith a grand room straight out NASA or NORAD..With the giant screens and tons of operators and smaller screensHe went on to say even smaller control stations where replicas of the big one..He went on to give an example of how the locals are described as Taliban but really are ANYBODY that might join the fight against the US/NATO forcesThat anybody could be a radical muslim tru believer.A pissed off local who had a family member hurt by collateral damage from a drone strike.Or.Just a kid with nothing to do that picks up a AK-47 and lets off a clipThe reaction would be the same.The whole incident goes from the first report all the way to Kabul and as far as the Special Ops Command in Tampa.The US does things with technology and BIG.And the guy reported that the BIG includes building thingsHe explained that Americans have no concept of how much building is being done in that country for the military.The idea IS.All these things are stakes that cannot and will not be removed anytime soon.If ever.The conversation went on about the speakers visit to some of the outposts.Where he lived and spoke to the front line troops..Here he pointed out the disconnect between being home in the US and being in the fight.Out in the fight there is no concept of quittingThis whole campaign is looked at a slow, long drive to displace the Talibanor whoeverThere is no mention of winning thisAnd I agree.From the grunt in the combat post, to the generals running the war.to the PresidentThe concept of winning the war is simply not there.The goal the guy talking to Mathieus explained is to grab enough ground and disrupt the Taliban and whoever.By doing so.The US?NATO hope to give Karzai or better yet.The afghans a chance to form a strong enough governmentTo try and stand on its own.I have posted here that the general have report back to the Joint Chiefs and therefore the Commander the President that 2011 and 2014 are GOALS for the President to assuage the American people and the media..That the Afghans will ready to walk on their own by then is anyones guess..I have said here for the last few months that I do not believe the US can win.I guess I join the US government in acknowledging this as a fact.I can always get people to jump on my case by saying what this guy has said.The US/NATO arent going anyplace anytime soon.Just as in Iraq where the war HAS stopped.Normalcy is a thing that is far from coming home thereAnd US troops will be there permanentlyAnd so I poise this as the Discussion Question of the Day..Whats your feelings on this people?(Sidebar..When you sign up for the military as thousands of men and woman do EVERY month.You volunteer.You are signing withthefull knowledge that you could be going to a war zone.I do notentertainthe notion that soliders are innocent tothisfact)Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Men,

2010jamesb1019 commentsIn response to the good natured carping DSD did yesterday.Im starting a new featureThe Discussion of the Day..A Woman President is todays topic.Send me your suggestions for the list of topics if can.Ok.The regulars here know that I was rooting for Hillary Clinton at the beginning of 2008..She was the shoo-in everybody thought at first.The problem wasShe believed that also and ran a lousy first half of a campaignBurning thru her campaign funds.Relying on keeping her staff happy instead of getting it to do the best job FOR HER.And dealing with a husband who could conceive that his wife had to actually have to go out and work for the nomination..Oh..And running against a real GOOD opponent.So in my mind ..The lady who could have been the first real serious female President .Ran a bad first half.Better second halfAnd lost.Right now Sarah Palin is the highest profile female politicians on the radarShe certainly has the name appeal to make a serious run..Butas with Hillary Clinton.She has also earned high negativesMy first general question is.Can Sarah Palin REALLY make a serious run?Now I want to address a second thought..Please think about this.I know most of the people who read this blog are mans with a bit of education.That what the analysis of the site visitors tells me.For our guysCan you REALLY swallow a woman Commander-in Chief?If I can get some of the female out there to chime inCan YOU deal with a woman President?We have a lot female Mayors, County Executives and Governors..But taking the step to President seems to be a very BIG one..Can the voters of this country take that step anytime soon?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Media, Military, Politics, Polls, WomenFemale commentors, Hillary Clinton,
