City manager at workPayton didn't commit a crime during the Salesman saga, or at least it doesn't appear that way. But the manager of the 112,000-strong Miramar facilitated Salesman's alleged crime in a frontroom deal for a $35,000 gazebo contract that stank from the beginning. AndPayton knew it; he testified yesterday that it was"unusual" and all but admitted that he played ball with Salesmanbecause he was keenly aware ofthe politician'spotential influenceand didn't want to offend someone who might be able to vote him out of his job.During a meeting in his office at City Hall in April 2006 with Salesman and undercover FBI agents, Paytontold undercover agentsthey wouldn't be getting a "freaking second look" if they "didn't know somebody." Salesman, meanwhile, had already told them that Payton would do what he wanted because the city manager "owed" him. When federal prosecutor Jeffrey Kaplan askedPayton on the stand who that "somebody" was, the city manager didn't hesitate. "Commissioner Salesman," he said. Earlier, when asked why he'd given the FBI front company the work, Payton testified that he'd done it for Salesman.

Lippman, who is being sued by the bankruptcy court for $3.8 millionin alleged Ponzi funds he received from Rothstein, filed for an emergency hearing to bar the media from his deposition, which is set for Friday. Remember thatvital informationhas come from the depos, especiallythe oneinvolving Rothstein accountant Gary Berkowitz. During a court hearing Monday, Judge Ray ruled in Lippman's favor, shutting out the public and media from sitting in on the depo, in which Lippman has said he will answer questions and not invoke the Fifth Amendment. And thank you, Judge Ray, for once again showing us alljust how flawed and idiotic the American court system can be. The sad truth is that if you get more than five lawyers in anyroom together, something badwill oftencome out of it. And that's what you had here. The South Florida Business Journal's Paul Brinkman covered the hearing and reported that Lippman's lawyer, Patrick Scott, told the judge, "This is a case where there's a very low public interest."Now the judge should have thrownboth Scott and his  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendA Morality Quiz By Bob Norman,                                                            Tue., Mar. 30 2010 @ 4:15PMBelow areseveralclassic quotes on the nature of right and wrong. One of them was uttered by Fitzroy Salesmanon undercover tapes made by the FBI.Match the quote with the right speaker (answers come after the jump). Mencken at work1. "Nobody thinks in terms of human beings. Governments don't. Why should we? They talk about the people... I talk about the suckers... it's the same thing. They have their five-year plans; so have I. What do you believe in?"2. "The ideals which have lighted me on my way and time after time given me new courage to face life cheerfully have been Truth, Goodness, and Beauty... The ordinary objects of human endeavor -- property, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible."3. "Cowardice asks the question, 'Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question, 'Is it politic?' Vanity asks the question, 'Is it popular?' But conscience asks the question, 'Is it right?' And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular but one must take it because one's conscience tells one that it is right."4. "In the United States, doing good has come to be, like patriotism, a favorite device of persons with something to sell."Welles as Harry Lime5. "I'm not interested in what is wrong or right because wrong or right can be perceived, depending on who you ask. It's a perception. My greatest concern is what works... There's no right or wrong in the world."6. "When I do good, I feel good; when I do bad, I feel bad. That's my religion."SpeakersA. Abraham Lincoln B. Fitzroy SalesmanC. Martin Luther King Jr. D. H.L.

"He would joke about his sex life," Wren told Aaronson about Salesman. "You would joke about your own sex lives?" Aaronson asked Wren. "There was a lot of banter," Wren said.

The Miami Herald, with the help of Harris, published an in-depth piece on the case Sunday that puts together some of the more compelling evidence that one of the nation's most notorious serial killersis responsible for one ofAmerica's most notorious unsolved crimes. The caseinvolving themainsuspect,serial killerOttis Toole, doesn't hold any water, yet the Hollywood Police Department and Walsh's father, John Walsh of America's Most Wantedfame,continue to cling to the idea that it wasToole.

The pleas was not guilty, of course. Miami HeraldSettineri"We invoke discovery, demand a trial by jury -- we're ready," his lawyer, Jeffrey Weiner, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Rosenbaum. A handcuffed Settineri was in his olive prison garb and will remain in custody for the foreseeable future. His detention hearingwasregrettablycanceled (that's where we would likely have gotten some new details about the case), though Weiner said he intends to try in the future to get bond for his Italian client. Settineri, who has a classic Roman profile,was silent during the hearing and spent a good deal of time scanning the audience. I made eye contact with him a handful of times. In his prison jumpsuit, helooked like hewas walking outof central castingfor a badMafia movie. Or maybe he just looks like the toughest George Costanza who has ever lived (there's another new photo after the jump).

It's just a little Plantation thing, but it illustrates the central problem of governmentprivatizing services it should be providing. Today's Plantation Forum newspaper's lead headline is "City outsources summer camps." The City Council, it seems,voted earlier year to hand the camps held throughout the city over to a private company called Sunshine Child Programs. The company, which is apparently based in Davie and owned by a woman named Loren Merino, put in the only bid for the contract. Why? Well,the camps cost the city $82,700 and the wise politicians on the commissionwere looking to cut costs.The new company would also share 25 percent of the revenuesof the camp,which the city hopes will amount to $70,000 in revenues. Wow, Mayor Rae Carol Armstrong and rabid Republican Party parrotJerryFadgen must beproud of themselves,eh?They're feeding business and saving the city money at the same time. Bravo. Buthere's the kicker that wasn't even mentioned in the newspaper article -- and it's a kicker that accompanies just about all ofthese privatization moves.The company, Sunshine, jacked up the rates by almost a third, from $695 to $880foran eight-week camp.So the Plantation Council basicallyjustbrought in a private entity to jack up rates and add a layer of profit to whatwas a perfectly fine service doing exactly what government is supposed to do. That's too often what privatization amounts to, folks, a farce and asham.-- Well, it looks like they got Fitzroy Salesman dead to rights. Yesterday, the prosecution played an undercover videotapetaken in 2006 at the clubhouse restaurant at the Inverrary Country Club showing Salesman taking $1,000 in bribe money.From yesterday's trial from the Miami Herald: The international financier slid the white, cash-stuffed envelope across the table, and former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman picked up the payoff, folded it and put it in the pocket of his striped, burgundy shirt.Then Salesman poured a Heineken beer into  More >> Write Comment Email to FriendEx-Rothstein Law Clerk's Death Officially Ruled a SuicideBy Bob Norman,                                                            Wed., Mar. 24 2010 @ 4:25PMScott Rothstein, wherever he is now, did a lot of damage to a lot of people in this town. I can't help but believe that his toxic lifemay have contributed to theuntimely death of a promising young woman. Timmerman with Gov. Crist in photo taken at Scott Rothstein's homeJulie Timmerman, as reported here, committed suicide on January 16.Police and medical examiner's investigators have made the official ruling and their reports indicate there is no foul play suspected. The 26-year-old law studentwas discovered in her apartment at Camden Las Olas by a friend's husbandwho had gone to check on her after concerns were voiced about her well-being by her mother, who lives in New York, according to Medical Examiner's Office investigative report. She had sent friends "strange" text messages earlier that morning. NearTimmerman's body were severalpill bottles and a note that reports indicatedsaid, "I am so sorry, I can't live in this misery anymore." Timmermanhad beenlisted in bankruptcy records as having received $60,000 from Rothstein in four $15,000 payments beginning August 2008 through last September 29, just a month before thePonzi scheme collapsed. She had worked as a law clerk for Rothstein and also at times asa hostess at Rothstein's restaurant, Bova Prime, and, before that, Riley McDermott's in the same building, sources say. Rothstein put Timmerman through law school at Nova, where she served as a class officer.A source close to the firm at that time told me that Rothstein had an intimate relationship with Timmerman and had put her upin a downtownapartment. This type of behavior follows a pattern that involved not only Rothstein but other members of the law firm.

Kim, Rothstein, and Rabbi Kaplan. Kim converted to Judaism after marrying Rothstein.The chabad has been in the news becausePonzi schemer Scott Rothstein was not only a dedicated member but he helped build it with his ill-begotten money. Rothstein's name, which used to be on the building, has been removed, but the stain he has left on the congregation is far from removed, said the man. He wouldn't give his name for fear of retaliation and losing, as he put it, "everything." He said he has become disillusioned with the DJCC, Rabbi Schneur Kaplan,and the entire chabad movement since Rothstein's billion-dollarPonzi scheme implodedin late October. But a slight smile crosses his face when he remembers firstmeeting Rothstein five or six years ago.
