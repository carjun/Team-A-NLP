Their forecasts have been quite reliable in the past as well, which is why we incorporate them  along with forecasts from Cook Political, CQ Politics and Mr. Sabato  into our own House race projections.Much earlier in the political cycle, however, Mr. Rothenberg had made a very silly forecast.Read moreNote .Stu Rothenberg is already out with a caution that Democrats have a better chance of retaking the House back than keep the Senate come the 2012 Elections.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Polls, UpdatesApril 23rd /2009 Rothenberg call, Macro vs Micro forcasts, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polling giants, Predictions vs Forcasts, Stu Rothenberg political reportRead moreHow about a woman replacement for Robert Gibbs as White House Press Secretary?January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsIf Im correct the last woman to hold the office was Dee Dee Myers in the Clinton Administration.Are there any good ones from Chicage available?Politics Daily has a list of a few good women to choose fromThe White House is looking for a successor to departing press secretary Robert Gibbs, and the top prospects  as usual  are men. But PoliticosMike Allen says new chief of staff Bill Daley would like a woman in the job.A woman as the face of this administration  why, that would be something new and different.The most important qualities in a press secretary include access to the president, clarity of expression, ease on camera, and good relations with reporters. The names in the mix so far are deputy press secretaries Bill Burton (whod be the first black press secretary) and Josh Earnest, and vice presidential communications director Jay Carney.Its unclear how much influence Daley will have over the choice. MSNBC says hell have input, but incoming senior adviserDavid Plouffe will lead the search and have the biggest say. Its also unclear who if any of Washingtons major female players would take the job. Some of them have spouses and-or children; at least one already knows exactly how consuming the job would be because shes already done it.Still, Plouffe et al should take this seriously. There would be no better way to dilute the Club Men impression the Obama White House gives off. Here are some possibilities, some more famous than others and some more feasible (those who are declared Democrats, for a start):Gwen Ifill. Former New York Times reporter, current moderator and managing editor of PBS Washington Week in Review and senior correspondent on The PBS NewsHour, and author of The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama. Shes poised, well informed, funny and friendly on the air.

Thats a lot of MONEY!I see they are mentioning a first thought figure of $159 Billion that they say is now the $120 BillionI wouldnt count on the savings of $39 Billion.Somehow I think that money will end up back in the budget some way..For the current fiscal year, the Obama administration has assumed about $159 billion in costs for military operations, chiefly in Afghanistan and Iraq. The new estimates now appear to reflect the double impact of pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq and also getting a better handle on stepped-up operations in Afghanistan.Nonetheless it is a very different picture than President Barack Obama had once hoped for as a candidate backed by anti-war forces in his party. In contrast with the Bush-era budgets, Obama has made a point of including some place-holder for war costs in his spending plans, but these have proven more of a gesture than any accurate forecast of the dollars needed.For example, Obamas 2011 budgetjust a year ago at this time assumed $50 billion as a placeholder for contingency war funds in 2012, less than half of what now is expected to be needed.Given the nature of war and the changing tempo of operations, even detailed, timely estimates are vulnerable to the same short-comings. In some respects, the $159 billion request for 2011 may have proven too high and the extra contingency funds became an escape valve of sorts for House and Senate Appropriations looking for ways to buy new military equipment and still cope with proposed cuts from the core defense budget.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Military, Politics, The Economy, Updates$120 Billion vs $159 Billion final number, The War budget request to CongressRead moreObamas import of more Chicago Staff as seen from Chicago.January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsThis..In response to a question I put out about Obama and his preference for more Chicago based new staff members coming to the White House.James,The Chicago crew (save Obama) is alright.Bill Daley seems to have his head screwed on and actually seems like he could be a member of my mothers large Chicago Irish family.I think if Obama is smart enough to listen to him he will be a good moderating influence (keep in mind this is coming from a Right of Center perspective) on a President who shunned Rahm for the expert opinions of Valarie Jarret (exactly what the f#*k does she know about anything again?) and political guru Axlrod, who had no more business making policy than Karl Rove.If he just sits back and listens to Daley I think his Presidency has a chance to reboundIllinois Jim.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesBill Daley, Illinois Jim @Politicaldog101, Obama 's Chicage staff choices, Valarie JarrettRead moreToday in Congress1/7/11.January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsBy David Waldman @Dailykos..I have something special for you to see today.
