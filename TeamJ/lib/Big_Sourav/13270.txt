Judge plays 911 tapes in the brutal murder trial of Casey Anthonys 2 year old    Orange :  CA :  USA|Jul 15, 2010By munchkin87        2 0     Views: 51        Casey Anthony is a woman on trial accused of killing her two year old daughter, Caylee. The body of the baby was found in 2008 and the case on Casey Anthony has been going on since then. The case has been prolonged by the efforts of the defense attorneys who have tried to keep some 911 call tapes out of court which show the frantic calls of Casey Anthonys mother, Cindy Anthony. Casey Anthonys mother started calling 911 when she began suspecting that her granddaughter was missing and her daughter wont admit it. When Casey Anthony finally admitted to having not seen her daughter for the previous one month, Cindy Anthony called 911 and told them her daughters car smelled like a dead body had been in it. The tapes of 911 have finally been allowed to play in the court so that justice for the 2 years old Caylee can be served.        munchkin87 is based in Arizona City, Arizona, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (50.0%) Pakistan (26.7%) Canada (16.7%) Mexico (3.3%) Norway (3.3%)           READ MORE: casey anthony.
