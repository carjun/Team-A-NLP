Chelsea Isaacs recently wrote about Roves comments in the Miami Hurricane:One year from now, Gitmo wont be closed, Rove said. If it is, there will be an uproar in the U.S. about where to put these people. Interrogation tactics used by the CIA during Bushs term in office were not torturous, Rove said, but he did not deny that the CIA strongly pressed terrorists for vital information.

Sanders said residential and business customers alike would face fairly significant penalties for using too much water in the face of a drought and spring cutbacks expected from the wholesaler that provides water to the city. Sanders didnt elaborate on what the penalties might be.Water administrator Alex Ruiz said the rationing plan would try to take into account customers past conservation efforts and seek to distinguish between discretionary outdoor water uses and indoor uses, such as cooking and cleaning.   3 commentsRead the full article Deserter at Miramar Brig Supported by Antiwar ActivistsJanuary 26, 2009Antiwar activists have taken up the cause of an Army deserter who was deported from Canada and is now being held at the brig at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.
