FahrentholdIn early June, Lynda Sorenson, 52, had gone back to community college in Tucson in hopes of getting back on the job market. One of her classes was a basic algebra class--and one of her classmates was Jared Loughner, now identified by authorities as the man who killed six people and critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) in a shooting rampage Saturday. Sorenson's emails to friends from last summer, provided to the Washington Post, reveal her growing alarm at Loughner's strange and disruptivebehavior in class.From June 1, the first day of class:"One day down and nineteen to go. We do have one student in the class who was disruptive today, I'm not certain yet if he was on drugs (as one person surmised) or disturbed. He scares me a bit. The teacher tried to throw him out and he refused to go, so I talked to the teacher afterward. Hopefully he will be out of class very soon, and not come back with an automatic weapon."From June 10:"As for me, Thursday means the end to week two of algebra class. It seems to be going by quickly, but then I do have three weeks to go so we'll see how I feel by then. Class isn't dull as we have a seriously disturbed student in the class, and they are trying to figure out how to get rid of him before he does something bad, but on the other hand, until he does something bad, you can't do anything about him. Needless to say, I sit bythe door."From June 14:"We have a mentally unstable person in the class that scares the living crap out of me. He is one of those whose picture you see on the news, after he has come into class with an automatic weapon. Everyone interviewed would say, Yeah, he was in my math class and he was really weird. I sit by the door with my purse handy. If you see it on the news one night, know that I got out fast..."<snip>http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/jared-lough...

I don't propose an answer to that.  Right now, HIPAA and other privacy protections would come into play.  But, I am not sure where the line of responsibility should end. Similar to the VA Tech shooter, whose mental health issues were documented, yet allowed to fall through the cracks. An area for discussion and perhaps consensus consideration for the university community in the future.....Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmike_c      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:04 PMResponse to Reply #16.interestingly, we've been told that the main topic of an upcoming faculty mtg......later this week is instruction on dealing with "disruptive" students.  I've had a few over the years, but none that I couldn't handle, at least so far.  One of the scariest I've ever dealt with with a guy who wasn't actually disruptive, per se-- in fact, he was pleasant and cooperative, mostly.  He was a former LA police officer, retired on disability, then working as an investigator for a local sheriff's dept.  He made a point of telling me after class, more than once, that he was always "carrying" despite university regulations against firearms on campus and that if I ever needed anyone "taken down" during class, he was the guy to call on.  The fact that he considered this a likelihood was what I found so scary.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Tophlthe2b      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:23 PMResponse to Reply #615.I'd be interested to hear what comes from that...Check back in afterwards, will you?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmike_c      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:26 PMResponse to Reply #1518.will do-- the meeting's on Wednesday....I've bookmarked this thread-- I'll try to PM you at least.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPufPuf23      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:45 PMResponse to Reply #1826.I'd be interested too mike_c krPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopStatistical      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 04:58 PMResponse to Original message2.Failure of our (under funded and under promoted) mental health system.It should be far easier to mandate a counseling session.  There should also be stiff requirements for people in position of authority to report such incidents.Of course fixing our mental health system would take a lot of money and would require a lot of work, and would take a long time.  Instead we piss it away on a "war on drugs" and worthless gun control laws like the assault weapons ban or DC gun ban.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDappleganger      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:39 PMResponse to Reply #224.+10000Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopFLPanhandle      (649 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 04:58 PMResponse to Original message3.Sounds schizophrenicMore mental illness than political terrorist.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTalkingDog      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:38 PMResponse to Reply #328.I've known 5 schizophrenics over the years.

He didn't attack his school mates. He made a conscious choice about who to attack. How about we agree he was a mentally ill political terrorist.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopRamboLiberal      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:02 PMResponse to Original message5.Jared Loughner's college instructor: I was worried he might have a gun in classA community college instructor who taught Tucson shooting suspect Jared Loughner was so disturbed by the student's outbursts in class that he requested Loughner's removal from the course, he told the Washington Post in an interview Sunday. Ben McGahee, a third-year instructor at Pima Community College, taught Loughner in an elementary algebra class last summer. McGahee said that while Loughner never threatened him directly, he was concerned by his behavior."I always felt, you know, somewhat paranoid," McGahee said. "When I turned my back to write on the board, I would always turn back quickly--to see if he had a gun."McGahee said he had to make several complaints before administrators finally removed Loughner. "They just said, 'Well, he hasn't taken any action to hurt anyone. He hasn't provoked anybody. He hasn't brought any weapons to class,'" McGahee recalled. "'We'll just wait until he takes that next step.'"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/loughners-c...

Someone did not communicate for a involuntary 5150 or like hold seems appropriate to me at the expulsion. The reality is that there is more mental illness because of the times and crime and less resources to deal with public safety.  The public safety trend in the USA is to degrade and mis-allocate by "intelligent design". recPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 10:03 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss General DiscussionPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
