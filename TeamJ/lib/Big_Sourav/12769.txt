I'm sorry if the readers think I'm unkind for believing doctors should go into medicine because they want to help people not because they want to live in a McMansion with 18 widescreen plasma TV's, drive 5 BMW's, and pontificate their net value to everyone at the country clubs, golf courses, or on their luxurious yachts. How about this one? If socialism and communism are so horrible, why do we continue bartering with China and outsourcing jobs over there when there's still an embargo on Cuba? I can promise everyone China has a longer track record of human rights violations than Cuba or even the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, all we know about socialism is what we've been told growing up during the Cold War or what those idiots on Fox News say. They don't know the difference between democratic socialism, Marxism, or communism which is an extreme form of socialism. Alas, if you tell someone something enough times they'll believe it no matter how true or false it is. Let's hear your thoughts on this.

Just because certain government services are the 'least bad' solution to societal problems doesn't mean that we need to rubber stamp all government programs that are designed to help. To paraphrase Thomas Sowell, the last 100 years of our history have largely been comprised of replacing what works with what sounded good. I'm sure you know the famous cliche about good intentions and the road to hell. Whenever we come to a junction where one possible outcome is the increase in the size of government, we must ask ourselves "Is this absolutely necessary?" If the answer is anything but a resounding "yes," we must reconsider. AND, when government programs have outlived their usefulness, we must discontinue them, without regard to any minority group who might have a vested interest in their continuation.  To put it another way,  whenever we have a problem, the historical answer has been to throw government at it until it goes away. Instead, we should decide if there is any way we can solve the problem, or let the problem solve itself, without government, and only apply the broad, fumbling brush stroke of government after we have decided it is the only possible way to solve the problem.                   11-25-2010, 01:21 AM          Crossfire600  Senior Member            Join Date: Apr 2008 Location: Alaska 720 posts, read 504,922 times Reputation: 295           Quote:    Originally Posted by daugenstine   ...does that mean we should get rid of social security and all the public libraries, post offices, police forces, fire departments, public schools, parks, roads, sewers, bridges, water supplies, and utilities?

That was such a train wreck I don't even know how to respond to your post.  It reminds me of a Led Zepplin song I used to listen to.. I was a 60's child, if  you know what I mean, and the song made more sense back then than your post does now and I'm well.. in a better state of mind today than I was in the 60's  I miss those days, everyone was against communism, socialism, free willy..

I guess when you get old, don't count on social security or Medicaid when you have arthritis. You could just work until you drop like they do in Third World countries.                   11-25-2010, 01:35 AM          daugenstine  Senior Member         Status: "Reality has a liberal bias"        (set 9 days ago)       Join Date: Jul 2010 Location: Austin 300 posts, read 86,000 times Reputation: 176           Quote:    Originally Posted by thecoalman   Yes, now you tell me how me get rid of the monstrosity it has grown into. Your answer of course is you can't which is part of the problem with these types of programs to begin with.    You're absolutely right that you can't because there'd be a revolution on our hands if there was. I suspect sooner or later there will be because we're not really a democracy anymore. We've slowly but surely turned into a plutocracy which is a nation where the rich have all the power. That's one step shy of totalitarianism which is exactly why you never see any of them sending their kids to war.                   11-25-2010, 01:37 AM          Tnt-User  Senior Member         Status: "Questions"        (set 10 days ago)       Join Date: Nov 2009 Location: california 155 posts, read 58,325 times Reputation: 102           Quote:    Originally Posted by daugenstine   Sure!
