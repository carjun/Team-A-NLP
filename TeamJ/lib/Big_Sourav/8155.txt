Congresswoman Giffords was the first person shot. She was hit in the head one time. Congresswoman Giffords is alive and the surgeon in charge is "cautiously optimistic" that she will survive. Sheriff Dupnik said a semi-automatic pistol was used and a total of 19 people were shot. Six people were killed. Sheriff Dupnik said two of the victims were personal friends. All six victims have been identified. Pima County officials are working to notify the next of kin.Sheriff Dupnik also confirmed that two individuals at this crime scene tackled the suspect. He said there is reason to believe that the gunman came to the location with another individual. Dupnik told reporters his office has pictures of a "person of interest" in this case. He also said the 22-year old in custody had a criminal background, but did not offer much other information based on the advise of legal counsel. The suspect is in the custody of the Pima County Sheriff's department."All I can tell you is that this individual may have a mental issue, and that people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible to vitriol," said Dupnik.Read more: http://www.kgun9.com/Global/story.asp?S=13809243 One person can be a nutcase.

Sheriff Clarence Dupnik declined to name the suspect, but said he "has kind of a troubled past  I can tell you that  and we are not convinced he acted alone."Officials have a photograph of a second "person of interest," a 50-year-old white male, Dupnik said."We have an individual we are actively in pursuit of, but I cannot tell you who he is at this point," the sheriff said.The suspect still had ammunition in his weapon when he was tackled, Dupnik said. Law enforcement officials had previous contact with the suspect and he had made threats, the sheriff said.http://www.npr.org/2011/01/08/132764367/congresswoman-s...

Gabrielle Giffords and others today. "Were not convinced that he acted alone," he said at a news conference at Westward Look resort.He confirmed that there were 19 people injured and that six people are dead. He also refused to identify any suspects, although the name of shooter Jared Lee Loughner has been widely reported.He said that two "brave individuals" tackled the shooter, and that Roll was in the wrong place at the wrong time, as he'd simply shown up to say hello to his friend Giffords.Update: He said a semi-automatic weapon was used and that all 19 victims were shot. He also angrily denounced the vitriolic political climate of todayespecially in Arizona. "We have become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry," he said.Read more: http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2011/01/0...

Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOneAngryDemocrat      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 10:05 AMResponse to Reply #622.DO NOT BE SILENTDo not remain silent.Conservatives certainly will not speak out.They will blame the lone, solitary, shooter...They will blame liberal society...They will blame anything and everything but modern-day conservatism, which preaches that liberals and democrats are the bona fide enemies of America and threats to the nation's very existence.And as long as that is the case, the bodies will continue to pile up.And that leaves it to us to speak out.We need not mince words - it is vital that we speak clearly and succinctly and firmly.Conservatism must evolve.It must change.To believe otherwise is to help pass around the nails for the next coffin in which the next liberal democrat will be buried in.No one was out there speaking about the radical right-wing elements that threaten our civil society until Janet Napolitano issued a DHS report warning about extremists that might resort to violence - a report which conservatives across the country demanded to be immediately rescinded. Now that we have seen a series of right-wing assassinations take place, the original DHS report looks, in hindsight, to have been very timely and prescient. We have seen Jim David Adkisson open fire upon the congregation of the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church with a sawed-off shotgun, killing two, simply because he opposed the all-inclusive nature of the church, and of the church's liberal teachings. Adkisson wrote in a letter which he assumed would be his last, "I thought Id do something good for this country  kill Democrats til (sic) the cops kill me. His hatred for his fellow Americans could not be contained: Liberals are a pest like termites, millions of them  the only way we can rid ourselves of this evil is kill them in the streets, kill them where they gather.James von Brunn, a radical right-winger from Maryland sought to turn the nation's Holocaust Museum into a symbol for his particular brand of racism, when he went there with the intent to kill blacks and Jews, as an example to the rest of white America to emulate. Luckily for those visitors inside of the museum, the first man von Brunn decided to open fire upon was a black man who had the ability to return the favor, and so no one besides than the very heroic Stephen T. Johns died that day.Shawna Forde, and two other members of the anti-immigrant Minutman group which she founded, the ''Minutemen American Defense,'' decided that one way to finance her burgeoning organization was to dress up as law enforcement agents, and to rob Mexican immigrants. When Shawna and her compatriots illegally entered the home of Raul Flores, and demanded money, the head of the family ordered the trio to leave, prompting the radical right-wingers to put a bullet into the head of little 9 year old Brisenia Flores, and into the head of her father. Unluckily for the conservative killers, Brisenia's mother was able to barricade herself in her bedroom, where she kept a handgun, and she was able to keep at bay her would be assassins until the real police arrived. Richard Poplawski opened fire on police officers during a domestic disturbance call, in April of 2009, killing three of them. Why? The 23 year-old right-winger feared that the President was poised to take away his hand guns.Just a few days after that shoot-out, two sheriffs deputies in northern Florida were shot and killed by Joshua Cartwright who later was fatally shot by other deputies. The reason, according to Cartright's wife, was because Joshua "believed that the US Government was conspiring against him," and, according to her, he had been severely disturbed that Barack Obama had been elected President.The list of victims from right-wing terror does not stop there.It goes on, and on.Doctor George tiller.Arkansas Democratic Chairman Bill Gwatney.Congresswoman Giffords and the other victims of the Tucson shooting are but the latest victims of this madness.Hours before the shooting spree in Arizona which the took 6 lives including that of a Federal Judge and a 9 year old little girl, Christina Greene (born on 9-11-2001), Representative Peter King, a conservative Republican and the new chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, made clear his intention to use taxpayers' money - our money - to investigate the radicalization of American Muslims, claiming in his zeal to persecute American Muslims, that "These are very legitimate hearings." But since the day little Christina was brought into this world, on that fateful September morning, the number of victims who have been laid to rest due to domestic jihad pales when compared to those who have been killed by conservative terrorists during little Christina's 9 years on earth.For moderate conservatives to hide these blood-thirsty radicals within their ranks behind the legitimate dissent of the anti-abortion lobby, or of that of any other conservative movement, be it anti-immigration, or advocates for 2d Amendment Rights, and to deny any responsibility for help in fostering these lunatic's bizarre views, doesn't help the conservative lobbies attain their aims and goals... It, instead, helps the radical conservative terrorists attain theirs. We should be there, in Washington DC, on the day Rep. King begins his American Muslim witch hunt.We should be there to tell him with a thunderous voice that we know who the real domestic threats to America are.Del Wasso,Rockford Coffee Party Coordinator,Rockford, Illinois,www.rockfordcoffeeparty.org Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topsavalez      (680 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 11:40 AMResponse to Original message23.Here is a photo of the second suspectPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 09:56 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss Latest Breaking NewsPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
