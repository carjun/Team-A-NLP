No interiorphotographs are allowed to be taken.They are a quick walking distance apart and were both constructedbecause of thegenerosity of Dominique de Menil who has left Houston, Texas with amagnificent legacy consisting of a grand museum filled with a lifetime collection of wonderful art plus these two distinctive chapels.The exteriorsof The Rothko Chapel and the Byzantine Fresco Chapelare modern in design but show little of what is inside to the public.One must venture inside to see the hidden treasures and determine the striking differences for oneself.Both are open and free of charge to the public.

But upon entering, one encounters a distinctly different atmosphere. One goes from a normally bright exterior into a softer lit interior. A quietude and feeling of reverence prevails in the space, even in this first passageway to the real jewel of the chapel which is its central interior. As most all of the links will advise ( and please click on some of them to see some of the professionally photographed interior of this Byzantine Fresco Chapel ) if it had not been for Dominique de Menil paying a ransom for these broken apart 13th century frescoes stolen from a small individually owned chapel in Lysi, Cypress, they might have been swallowed up by collectors of these fragments never again to be seen as a whole. With the consent of the Church of Cypress and after 2 years of restoration, she had her architect son, Francois de Menil erect this structure to house these largest intact Byzantine frescoes in all of the Western Hemisphere. Exact dimensions of the original chapel in Cypress have been replicated inside of the larger building but the materials are completely different and showcase the ancient frescoes in a new light. In a darkened space utilizing black steel, dark woods and opaque glass these frescoes appear in this illuminated modern setting. Benches are provided so that patrons visiting this consecrated space can sit and comfortably look up at the dome representing "Christ, the Almighty" as well as the smaller jewel like frescoes of the Virgin Mary as well as the archangels Gabriel and Michael. The frescoes are now preserved for posterity and must be seen in person to realize their full magnificence.

As a matter of fact, he often requested (demanded) that museums and other venues be readied to his exact specifications prior to allowing his work to be shown.

It is not merely the reflection pool that grabs one's attention but the sculpture titled Broken Obelisk created by artist Barnet Newman that is mounted rising up out of the water.Tall bamboo outlines two sides of this pretty site and benches are provided for people to sit and rest or even meditate.When the Menils acquired this Broken Obelisk sculpture and had it relocated here from Washington, D.C., they dedicated it to the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior.Martin Luther King, Jr.Martin's Big Words: The Life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.Amazon Price: $6.00List Price: $15.99The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.Amazon Price: $6.85List Price: $15.95The Story of Martin Luther King Jr.Amazon Price: $3.60List Price: $6.95Hellhound on His Trail: The Stalking of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the International Hunt for His AssassinAmazon Price: $7.95List Price: $28.95Strength to LoveAmazon Price: $11.91List Price: $20.00Martin Luther King Jr. - I Have a DreamAmazon Price: $9.79List Price: $19.98A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr.Amazon Price: $13.00List Price: $23.99A Picture Book of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Picture Book Biography)Amazon Price: $1.95List Price: $7.95I've Been to the Mountaintop - Memphis 4/3/68Amazon Price: $0.99Martin Luther King, Jr. (My First Biography)Amazon Price: $2.96List Price: $3.99 Broken Obelisk in reflection pool outside of Rothko ChapelSource: Peggy WAnother view of the Broken Obelisk and reflection poolSource: Peggy WRothko ChapelRothko ChapelAmazon Price: $11.25List Price: $12.00Rothko ChapelAmazon Price: $8.99Morton Feldman: The Rotko Chapel, For Stephan Wolpe, Christian Wolff in CambridgeAmazon Price: $12.21List Price: $20.98Zeitfluss 93: Winkler: Emergent - Varese: Intgrales & Octandre - Feldman: The Rothko Chapel (Digitally Remastered)Amazon Price: $8.99The Rothko Chapel Paintings: Origins, Structure, MeaningAmazon Price: $25.53List Price: $34.95Morton Feldman: Piano and String Quartet / Aki Takahashi, Kronos QuartetAmazon Price: $10.71List Price: $16.98Rothko Chapel 5Amazon Price: $0.99The Rothko Chapel: Writings on Art and the Threshold of the DivineAmazon Price: $12.32List Price: $20.00Feldman: Rothko Chapel / For Stephan Wolpe / Christian Wolff In CambridgeAmazon Price: $8.99 This shows more of the bamboo which surrounds two sides of the reflection pool and sculpture outside of the Rothko Chapel.Source: Peggy WMark Rothko - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaMorton Feldman - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaComposer Morton FeldmanRothko ChapelAmazon Price: $11.26List Price: $12.00Give My Regards To Eighth Street (Exact Change)Amazon Price: $9.98List Price: $15.95Feldman: Piano and Orchestra; Flute and Orchestra; Oboe and Orchestra; Cello and OrchestraAmazon Price: $11.30List Price: $17.99Morton Feldman: Triadic MemoriesAmazon Price: $15.48List Price: $26.98Mark Rothko paintingsThe non-denominational Rothko Chapel was completed in 1971 and inside the central area one discovers an octagonal shaped room with 14 primarily black canvasses with slight variations of color on these large pieces of art which dominate the interior walls. Wooden benches are arranged along the walls and are also placed in a somewhat circular pattern in the middle of the room. We have been there when some large smooth black rocks were situated in the center of the room.It almost has a Zen-like feeling to the room.A hushed atmosphere prevails in this modern art space much as it does in the Byzantine Fresco Chapel. The Rothko Chapel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 16, 2000.Mark Rothko never saw this chapel with his name on it completed as his death, due to suicide, preceded it's completion.Morton Feldman wrote a musical piece called The Rothko Chapel in 1971 and there are numerous youtube videos playing portions of it for your enjoyment, one of which is included in this hub.  Students from the nearby St. Thomas University often stretch out on this lawn outside of the Rothko Chapel with their books when studying.Source: Peggy WMorton Feldman : The Rothko Chapel (music and many of Rothko's paintings including ones inside the Rothko Chapel)Rothko (about the artist plus shows many of his paintings)Mark Rothko (1903~1970) Shows more of his paintings...Mark RothkoMark RothkoAmazon Price: $53.55List Price: $85.00The Artist's Reality: Philosophies of ArtAmazon Price: $11.82List Price: $20.00Violet, Green and Red, 1951 Poster Print by Mark Rothko, 24x36Amazon Price: $1.99List Price: $10.00Writings on ArtAmazon Price: $19.03List Price: $29.00Mark Rothko (Taschen 25th Anniversary Special Edition)Amazon Price: $10.57List Price: $14.99The Rothko Book: Tate Essential Artists SeriesAmazon Price: $16.70List Price: $29.95Mark Rothko (Earth & Green: 1955) Art Poster Print - 24x32Amazon Price: $3.80Mark Rothko: The Works on CanvasAmazon Price: $164.32List Price: $250.00Mark Rothko: Works on PaperAmazon Price: $32.25List Price: $50.00Mark Rothko: A BiographyAmazon Price: $27.50Rothko Chapel - 1409 Sul Ross St, Houston, TX 77006, USA [get directions]{"lat":29.737419,"lng":-95.396149,"zoom":15,"mapType":"ROADMAP","markers":[{"id":"11512","lat":29.737419,"lng":-95.396149,"name":"Rothko Chapel","address":"1409 Sul Ross St, Houston, TX 77006, USA","description":""}]}Conditions for Houston, TX at 7:34 pm CSTCurrent Conditions:Cloudy, 43 FForecast:Sun - Cloudy.
