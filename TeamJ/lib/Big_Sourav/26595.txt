You know what that means? It's almost time for your last summer hurrah!This could be the last time to escape your home-base before the cold bites hard (unless you're venturing out of town for the holidays, yep they're on their way as well).So, pack up the car and get on the road. We've found some great eco-destinations that are just right around the corner.New York CityNew York City has embraced the shift toward sustainable tourism, with LEED-certified hotels, organic restaurants and alternative transportation amenities readily available. This is great news for travelers looking for a quick getaway to the Big Apple with the environment in mind.Stay: The 70 Park Avenue Hotel near Grand Central Station supports the Kimpton EarthCare program by offering environmentally friendly products and services to guests.From an extensive recycling program and non-toxic/environmentally safe cleaning products, to a Green Road Warrior package that offers room upgrades and discounts to guests arriving in a hybrid car, the hotel seems to encourage environmental practices wherever possible.Eat: Habana Outpost in Brooklyn claims to be New York City's first "eco-eatery." Using earth-friendly practices in its design, construction and day-to-day operations, Habana Outpost aims to reduce wasteful consumption and promote sustainable solutions.From 100-percent biodegradable or compostable service ware and tables built of recycled plastic bottles and sawdust, to a bicycle-powered blender and grease-powered company car, this eatery is definitely as green as they come.For less than $10, you can enjoy your meal, which was cooked in a restored U.S. Postal truck, under the shade of recycled racing sails and next to the organic garden.Activity: We all know New York City to be synonymous with yellow cabs and subway systems, making it possible for the majority of residents to live and work car-free.Though part of the experience as a tourist to the Green Apple may include that ride in a checkered yellow cab or subway car, a bicycle might be the more enjoyable way to actually get out and see the city. Consider renting a bicycle for the day, or joining a walking or biking tour of the city. You'll find yourself noticing things you've never noticed before!Los AngelesThough synonymous with glitz, glamour and, well, traffic, Los Angeles is also home to more EnergyStar-certified buildings than any other city. A quick getaway to L.A. can be made as green as you choose, with a variety of accommodations and activities available within a short distance.Activity: With so many beaches nearby, beach cleanups are regularly scheduled year-round activities any eager individual can take part in. They're also a fun way to escape the city center for a bit, meet new people, while doing something productive at no cost.Seal Beach Cleanup: Fourth Saturday of each month Santa Monica Beaches Cleanup: Third Saturday of each month Long Beach Beach Cleanup: Third Saturday of each month Eat: Finding a green restaurant in Los Angeles is quite easy as the Green Restaurant Association certifies nearly 20 restaurants in the area. Mendocino Farms, for example, is a neighborhood sandwich eatery and marketplace.Mendocino Farms uses local, organic and seasonal ingredients; recycled, tree-free, biodegradable and organic products for service-ware; and of course, recycle their waste. Average menu item is $7-$10.Other restaurants may not be certified by the Green Restaurant Association, but they are definitely leading the way in sustainability. Street works with sustainable fisheries, local family farms and sustainable ranches to supply the menu.As part of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Program, they serve lesser known sustainable seafood and distribute pocket seafood guides to customers. They never serve bottled water, use recycled and/or biodegradable containers and only produce 3 percent pure waste, as the rest is recycled and composted. The average lunch and dinner prices are $10-$15.ChicagoChicago sets the bar high when it comes to green attractions and amenities offered in a large city. From green roofs to green technology museums, the average visitor can turn a quick getaway into a Green Chicago experience with a little effort.Attractions: Chicago has long been a national leader in the use of green roofs.

Named one of America's Top 50 Roadside Attractions by Time magazine, the home project was a labor of love for owner John Milkovisch, who used more than 50,000 beer cans in what can be considered the ultimate upcycling project.Milkovisch, a retired upholsterer for the Southern Pacific Railroad, set out on what would become an 18-year project in 1968 of emptying cans through consumption and using them in home improvement projects.He used the tops, bottoms, sides and tabs of the cans to make siding, fences, sculptures, windmills, curtains and garlands for the home, actually contributing to a significant lowering of energy consumption.
