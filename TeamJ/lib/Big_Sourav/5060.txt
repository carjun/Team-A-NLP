Beloved Japanese Movie Icon, Hideko Takamine, Dies at 86    Tky :  Japan|Jan 07, 2011By Nathaniel Hines        3 0     Views: 433      Considered by some as the Japanese 'Shirley TempleShirley Temple' of her time, Hideko Takamine, passed away in Tokyo on December 28, 2010, from lung cancer. She was 86. Takamine started out in the mid-1930s as a child star and accumulated movie credits for over 300 films. She last performed in 1979.  "Hideko Takamine was one of the most beloved and accomplished of Japan's film stars," said Kevin ThomasKevin Thomas, a former L.A, Times staff writer who reviewed Japanese films for the West Coast publication from 1962 to 1985. "She was beautiful, and she had tremendous range and versatility. She emerged as one of Japan's greatest star actresses in the postwar period, which was a tremendous period for Japanese cinema." Takamine generated her most memorable work under the guidance of directors Mikio Naruse and Keisuke Kinoshita. She won praise for her portrayal of a stripper in Kinoshita's satirical 1951 film "Carmen Comes Home," Japan's first feature film in color; and a schoolteacher in Kinoshita's 1954 antiwar film "Twenty-four Eyes." She also won critical recognition for her role as "a woman obsessively in love with an unworthy man" in Naruse's acclaimed 1955 film "Floating Clouds" and was a widowed bar hostess in Naruse's "When a Woman Ascends the Stairs" (1960). "Both directors have the reputation for the depiction of women, though their styles are completely different," Takamine told the Straits Times in 1994. "During more than 10 years, I passed from one to another, just like a ping-pong ball. Though different in style, they shared a common aversion to things that were not natural. What I tried to do was to be as natural as women we see in the news, but adding a touch of drama so that I would be even more real." Ultimately, Takamine became Japan's No.1 female box-office starlet in 1955. That same year, she married writer-director Zenzo Matsuyama, who survives her and with whom she added to her movie credits.  Born on the island of Hokkaido in Hakodate, Takamine started her run on March 27, 1924. At the age of 4, her mother passed away and her father sent to be with an aunt in Tokyo, who turned out to be her stage mother.  "There were no child-labor laws, and I was supporting my family," she said of her days as a child star in a 1983 interview with the New York Times. Unlike many child stars of that era or today, Takamine made a successful transition into her teen years. During World War II, she toured Japanese army camps as a singer. And immediately after the war, she sang for American occupation troops at a theater in Tokyo. "I was singing American songs like 'You Are My Sunshine,' " she said in the 1983 interview. "I didn't have time to think about whether I liked it or didn't like it. It was work. And backstage, I was getting flowers and chocolates and K-rations, so thanks to Americans I survived."        1 of 5         In her famous portrayal of 'The Mistress'      Nathaniel Hines is based in Florianpolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (48.4%) Saudi Arabia (6.6%) Senegal (5.3%) Canada (4.8%) 38 other countries (30.2%)           READ MORE: Movie, Japan, Takamine, actress, icon, hollywood, famous, War, film, lightning, Mikio Naruse, Yorokobi mo kanashimi mo ikutoshitsuki, Tokyo, Cinema of Japan, Keisuke Kinoshita, Entertainment Culture, child star, Kevin Thomas, obituaries-news, Zenzo Matsuyama, Shirley Temple, Floating Clouds, Kevin Thomas (footballer), When a Woman Ascends the Stairs, Drama films, Twenty-Four Eyes, Hideko Takamine, Carmen Comes Home   More News From: Tky :  Japan     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 4            Reply  Posted By     Gino C. Matibag|2 daysagoMay she rest in peace. I am sure the Japanese will miss her. I have been to Hakodate. It is such a wonderful place. Good report, Nathaniel. Rated up!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|2 daysagoThanks Gino. I found it interesting that she was able to continue her career throughout the war, her adolescence, her marriage and her fame. It seems we are use to quite a different story nowadays. They don't come the way she did.            Reply  Posted By     SusanGivens|2 daysagoThank you Nat -- your writing deserves a gold star. Nice going on this one.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|2 daysagoThanks Susan. And Feliz ano novo. I love finding those little nuggets and then running down the films to watch. There are some great films that people will never see unless they dig in.
