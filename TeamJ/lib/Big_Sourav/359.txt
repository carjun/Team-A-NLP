The US is not pleased with the actions of the Pakistani military. With the countrys Intelligence service divided and helping both the US effort and seeking to work with and control part of the Taliban effort there is a problemThe US has been steadily pushing the Pakistani government for more action to take away its refuge for Taliban action s in Afghanistan ..The administration has decided to ramp up military aid to Pakistan in order for them to assume a more active role ..Vice President Biden will bring this message and ask for a wish list next week in a trip to the country..Several things come to this Dogs mind upon hearing this.I am not surprised by this action.Which reinforces my preaching that the US isnt leaving the region anytime soon.In fact as I have pointed out things are escalating in the war.While Pakistan has had to divert attention from the war to handle the recent floodsThe US/NATO effort presses on.Remember that $30 Billion Gates said was chopped of the war effort that I posted yesterday?Ill bet it ends up going to the Pakistani military.Either the whole thingOra good part of itNowhere is India mentioned in the linked Washington Post piece..Hummm?I dont suppose India is gonna be very happy with the US rearming Indias nuclear traditional adversary..Oh, yea Budget cuts and debt ceilings?You ARE joking right?Pakistan has complained in the past that promised U.S. aid, currently projected to total more than $3 billion in 2011, has been slow to arrive and that requests for helicopters and other military equipment have remained unfulfilled.Beginning with Bidens visit, the time may be ripe for a frank exchange of views and priorities between the two sides, another administration official said. The Pakistanis understand that Afghanistan-Pakistan has become the single most important foreign policy issue to the United States, and their cachet has gone up. But they also realize that they may have reached the point of maximum leverage, this official said, and things about their region are going to change one way or the other in the near future, as Congress and the American public grow increasingly disillusioned with the war and a timeline for military withdrawal is set.Something is going to give, he said. There is going to be an end-game scenario and theyre trying to guess where were heading.On intelligence, the administration plans to address Pakistans complaints that the Americans have not established enough outposts on the Afghan side of the border to stop insurgent infiltration, while pressing the Pakistanis to allow U.S. and Afghan officials to staff border coordination centers inside Pakistan itself.The intelligence coordination is part of an effort to build political, trade and security links between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a way of assuaging Pakistans fears thatIndia, its traditional adversary, is building its own influence in Afghanistan. We think theres a lot of room for improvement on that front, the senior official said..MoreObama and his senior staff have had to beat down numerous requests by in-theater military staff to take the war on to Pakistan itself in cross border raids.. I would NOT be surprised in the least bit if US Special Ops actions have already been running in and out of Pakistan.The Pakistanis are begiing to understand that although they dont think of the Afghan problem as theirs.The US impatience is..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Military, Politics, UpdatesBoots on the ground, budget cuts, Cross border US Actions, Indian Concerns, Pakistani flood action, President Obama, Taliban, US Military aid to Pakistan, VP Biden trip to PakistanRead moreHigh-Level Talks Aim for an End to the Afghan War..October 19, 2010jamesb101No commentsThis could take some time.But it is a vindication of the surge.There is no way these two side would be talking if the Taliban wasnt getting beat up pretty bad.By the way .The US/NATO troops have gone out of their way to provide safe passage for the people from the Taliban doing the talking..And who is in the middle of all of this.Ole crocked Hamid Karzai..****Talks to end the war in Afghanistan involve extensive, face-to-face discussions withTaliban commanders from the highest levels of the groups leadership, who are secretly leaving their sanctuaries inPakistan with the help ofNATO troops, officials here say.The discussions, some of which have taken place in Kabul, are unfolding between the inner circle of PresidentHamid Karzai and members of the Quetta shura, the leadership group that oversees the Taliban war effort inside Afghanistan. Afghan leaders have also held discussions with leaders of the Haqqani network, considered to be one of the most hard-line guerrilla factions fighting here; and members of the Peshawar shura, whose fighters are based in eastern Afghanistan.The Taliban leaders coming into Afghanistan for talks have left their havens in Pakistan on the explicit assurance that they will not be attacked or arrested by NATO forces, Afghans familiar with the talks say. Many top Taliban leaders reside in Pakistan, where they are believed to enjoy at least some official protection.In at least one case, Taliban leaders crossed the border and boarded a NATO aircraft bound for Kabul, according to an Afghan with knowledge of the talks. In other cases, NATO troops have secured roads to allow Taliban officials to reach Afghan- and NATO-controlled areas so they can take part in discussions. Most of the discussions have taken place outside of Kabul, according to the Afghan official.American officials said last week that talks between Afghan and Taliban leaders were under way. But the ranks of the insurgents, the fact that they represent multiple factions, and the extent of NATO efforts to provide transportation and security to adversaries they otherwise try to kill or capture have not been previously disclosedMore..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Military, Politics, UpdatesAfghan peace talks, Pakistan, TalibanRead moreDutch troops are leaving Afghanistan.August 1, 2010jamesb101No commentsDutch Troops in Uruzgan.The 1,950 Dutch Troops deployed to the war under the NATO banner for 4 years are just about gone..They are proud of the gains during their mission in which they trained 3,000 Afghan troops and helped return about 50,000 children to schoolThe deployment of the troops caused a wide riff in the Dutch GovernemmentWe offer the majority of the population relatively safe living conditions and advancements in health care, education and trade, chief of defense Gen.

As the troops, weighed down with ammunition and supplies, lumbered out and set up defensive positions, AV-8B Harrier fighter jets and AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters circled overhead in the moonless sky.Two more waves of troops touched down over the following 90 minutes near other strategic locations in Marja. Like the earlier contingent, they did not meet with immediate resistance.At sunrise, hundreds more Marines and Afghan soldiers plan to enter the area by land, using mobile bridges to ford irrigation canals built by U.S. engineers more than 50 years ago  that have served as defensive moats for the Taliban. Heavily armored mine-sweeping trucks and specially outfitted tanks will work to carve a path through a belt of makeshift bombs buried around the town.The Marines entering Marja are with some of the first new military units to arrive in Afghanistan as a result of President Obamas decision in December to authorize the deployment of 30,000 additional troops to combat a growing insurgency. The operation is intended to deprive the Taliban of a haven in Helmand province, which military intelligence officials say is home to numerous bombmaking facilities and drug-processing labs.Were going to take Marja away from the Taliban, said Brig. Gen. Lawrence D. Nicholson, commander of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade. Doing so, he said, could result in a fundamental change in Helmand and, by extension, the entire nation of Afghanistan.The question will be .like in Iraqcan they hold the ground after taking it.and can they get the locals to feel secure enough to resist the Taliban..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Military, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesAfghanistan, Aircraft, Automobiles, Marines and Afghan Army Sweep, Marja, TalibanRead morePakistan is solely focused on one issue.UAV attacks.They could care less about the Taliban.December 8, 2009jamesb101No commentsIn a piece in MYDD.com, by Charles Lemos, he highlights the problemsthe administration has in Pakistanwhich the White House is pushing to step up its campaign to go after the TalibanI just did a post on how Aftghanistan has essential told the United States that it cant and wont be able to take care of itself for the next 20 years.Here in Pakistan is a country that is saying were not in any hurry..whats the problem?and by the way stop flying your Predators in our country( and maybe the bad guys will the go away, huh?)..were more worried about getting respect and keeping an eye on India.This from Shayan Khan of the Pakistan Spectator is typical. Back in October he wrote:Pakistans concerns over Kerry-Lugar bill are there for sure, but they are not that important. The chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee has backed a bill that would triple economic assistance for Pakistan, a key US ally in the fight against terrorism, to 7.5 billion dollars over five years. But it perhaps come as a surprise for the Kerry that Pakistanis dont really think much of any aid or such things. They want US to take them as humans like themselves and to understand that the people dying from the drone attacks are 99% Pakistanis, and only perhaps 1% are anything to do with militancy.

Pakistan spends only 2.3 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on education  the lowest level of any country in South Asia  as compared to 3.6 percent on average for other nations in Asia and 3.4 percent in low-income countries overall. This puts Pakistan in the bottom quarter of countries world-wide. Military spending, meanwhile, accounts for 3.5 percent of GDP, an amount that places Pakistan in the top quarter of countries world-wide. The result of inadequate funding for education is that only about half of Pakistani adults can read and write, compared to 92 percent in Sri Lanka and 60 percent in India.This is not going to be easy folks.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Government, Military, PoliticsCharles Lemos, India, Military, mydd.com, Pakistan, Predator, Taliban, UAV'sRead morePakistan is solely focused on one issue.UAV attacks.They could care less about the Taliban.December 8, 2009jamesb101No commentsIn a piece in MYDD.com, by Charles Lemos, he highlights the problemsthe administration has in Pakistanwhich the White House is pushing to step up its campaign to go after the TalibanI just did a post on how Aftghanistan has essential told the United States that it cant and wont be able to take care of itself for the next 20 years.Here in Pakistan is a country that is saying were not in any hurry..whats the problem?and by the way stop flying your Predators in our country( and maybe the bad guys will the go away, huh?)..were more worried about getting respect and keeping an eye on India.This from Shayan Khan of the Pakistan Spectator is typical.

The request he is going to hand up by September 24 is going to include Troops, hardware and money (lots of it).this is because the battle with the Taliban is being carried out in a country with no infrastructurea country (right out of the old testament ).now some in congress are objecting to the obvious fact that the United States in going to have to fight an enemy AND BUILD AFTGANISTAN INTO A 21ST CENTURY COUNTRY.and will probably take a lot of time (a decade? ) and patience.cause AFTPAK is gonna make Iraq look like childs play if the president gets the go ahead..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Military, PoliticsAftghanistan, Congress, General, Iraq, Military, Pakistan, President, Taliban, troopsRead moreFeingold will be against any troop increase in AfghanistanAugust 6, 2009jamesb101No commentsNext week Gen. McChrystal, who is in charge of the Afghanistan war campaign, is most assuredly going to ask for more troops. Mindful of the mistakes Rumsfeld made going into Iraq, and emboldened by the progress with surge, he has to ask for more troopsSen. Feingold is staking out the opposite position upfront. Namely: that more troops will just push the Taliban into Pakistan.. He makes a good point But what do we do?If you dont keep pushing you lose the current gains on the ground, since the Taliban WILL regroup and come back strongermy feeling is that the US wants to push the Taliban back to India, where there is a stronger army, that will present a wall to the fundamentalists.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Military, PoliticsAftghanistan, army, India, McChrsytal, Military, Rumsfeld, Taliban, troops, warRead moreYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
