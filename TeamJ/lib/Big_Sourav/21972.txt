I think it was bound to happen. If violent images go into the eyes and minds of youth frequently enough over long enough periods of time, they will come back out their mouths, their fists, or their other weapons of choice. In addition, the energy of those images may be magnified before coming forth. These images come through the movie screen, the computer screen, and the TV set into the homes of both boys and girls, affecting them equally. Unfortunately, these youth sometimes also see violence live in their own homes, at school, at birthday parties, or at the local convenience store.One good example of this violent aggression is the "choking game" that has reached all the way down to first graders in France, USA, and Canada. Children are hanging themselves to experience a "rush" as seen in certain movies and spread by word of mouth as "fun" or "I dare you." Violence is spreading among youth today like wildfire in dry grass, and it is directed not only toward others but toward themselves. James Garbarino does an excellent job of describing this phenomenon in See Jane Hit.

Some song lyrics they memorize glorify violence. Certain groups of eight-year-old girls are singing about bitch-slapping someone and, while at birthday parties, they are encouraged to do so by their mothers. We see on the news currently that a mother told her pre-teen daughter to go across the room at such a party and beat another girl for talking to the first girl's "man." No wonder girls are hitting. In addition to this, there is the possibility that females of all ages are simply tired of being abused or disrespected. Alternatively, they may be increasing their successes in all areas of life via physical aggression, because they have seen this work for men and boys. On the other hand, physically aggressive girls may have a lack of support at home and act out violently in outrage. They may also simply be more active in sports and thus, more active and aggressive overall, since Title IX took effect in the USA three decades ago. There are many possible causes and a solution to misplaced or unmanaged aggression is needed.Encouraging aggression, even Internet job-search sites advertise that Generations X and Y need to "get in everyone's face" to achieve career success. That puts U.S. society just a few paces short of the Star Trek Klingon tradition of the ship's first officer assassinating the boss for his position. The next question is, "If there are a lot of empty slots left by retiring baby boomers, but Generations X and Y go to jail for committing violence in the workplace, who is going to work in America?" Surely, aggressive impulses can be channeled for good, and the author of See Jane Hit gives some suggestions for steering aggression positively.Good AggressionSome critics of this book feel that the issue of aggression among girls is over-inflated, but I disagree with them. Living in a large metropolitan area with over one million residents, I know that we have over 150 gangs in town, and many of them are girls. Our mayor has made gang violence a priority for remediation equally among boys and girls. Girls have become violent almost as frequently as boys in this place, according to this city's recent arrest records.The author of See Jane Hit discusses aspects of all of the possibilities for the increasing aggression among girls in the US. James Garbarino, Ph.D., holds the Maude C. Clarke Chair in Humanistic Psychology at Loyola University in Chicago and is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. He has advised the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, the FBI, and others. He is one of the most knowledgeable American authorities on the subject, and this book is important reading, because childhood and adolescence seem quite different today when compared with those of just 20 years ago. It is important to be knowledgeable of the trends in our society and help to make them good ones, or at least steer them in a positive direction. This is a book that can help do so.

Useful Funny Awesome Beautiful Woman Submit! Christians & Domestic ViolenceBook Review: Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy and JesusCommentsWehzo2 years ago Great hub Patty.  You are always on the curve of something prominent, at least this is what I have gathered so far from some of your hubs.  Tackling this issue of girl violence, which is one of the reasons I wrote about it in one of my hubs, 'When All Else Fails', is a very important step in the right direction.  I have personally witnessed girl violence escalate at an alarming rate over the pass 30 plus years.  It is a fact that has largely gone unchallenged, at least until recently.  It is only recently that it has become a national issue.  But it still doesn't get the attention it deserves.Patty Inglish, MS2 years ago Thanks very much for your insightful comments. Some days, it seems that everyone is aggressive and every interaction that comes my way is rude, competitve, and provocative.It's becoming a culture. BUt like today, some days are very pleasant and people are relaxed and kind. I just don't engage with the negatives. I'll read your hub - it's an important topic, this violence.Iunn2 years ago Violence from youth across the board has everything to do with two job families and children not being prioritized.  Rage at feeling even their own parents don't value them enough to bother to let one stay home with them.  Not remotely surprising, I'm seen this trend too.There was a way it worked before and it involved one parent working and when children were brought into the equation, one parent staying home (and getting equal respect) for taking care of home and children.Different lifestyles are keen and all that, individual expression.  But when you choose to have a child, you should probably be choosing to raise that child too.  It's not like adopting a puppy and putting it out in the yard 8 hours a day.Stacie Naczelnik2 years ago This looks like an interesting read.  I'll have to add it to my book list.Patty Inglish, MS2 years ago Iouun - Exactly right insights you have! I am tired of hearing of some parents that put kids in daycare from 6am - 6pm and put them straight to bed at 6:30 after a sandwich for dinner, then complain that the kids are too much work. Tahnks for writing what you did here. Kids do need to be the priority and parenting as a profession needs to be respected.Thanks for the comment Stacie - I think many libraries have the book. Iunn2 years ago I wasn't sure what you would think and naturally there will be a variety of opinions (that I won't judge) on this issue, but that opinion is mine. I admit to being relieved it didn't offend you.There is nothing wrong with working women and nothing saying it has to be the girl who stays home, but still... I think this is partially the contribution to what is doing wrong with society. And of course the increase in divorce doesn't help and the current economy forcing both partners to work doesn't help either.Me, I usually think the answer is economic.  Well, you know how I am.  :p  Again, glad you weren't offended.   Patty Inglish, MS2 years ago No, not offended. I think women or men that choose the stay-at-home preofession need adequate respect. Similarly, a person that does not want that role should not be forced into it and should think long and hard about even having children if their spouse does not want to stay at home.I had a student that was 17 that had to drop out of GED classes - he had a single mom that worked as much as she could and there were young brothers and sisters at home. He worked 2 fulltime fast food jobs to help support the family: White Castle and McDonalds, one 8 hours in the day and the other 8 hours at night. So, 80 hours a week and only double minimum wage at the time. So, yes, economics plays a big part I think.Iunn2 years ago I respect you more and more and that's hard to do because I have held you in high esteem since stumbling into your hubs.   Patty Inglish, MS2 years ago Really? That makes me feel good about what I do. I appreciate your comments very much.Kenny Wordsmith2 years ago I agree with most of the points in the hub. Violence is been given too much respectability, and as you say, being glorified. Maybe some girls even think they are being equal to men by being violent. But that's a bad aspect of traditional male behaviour, which was offset by traditional female behaviour. I would be happier if men became less aggressive instead, if somebody has to change for equality's sake.Hub that's a catalyst to many insights, thanks!BartholomewKlick2 years ago A book review along with educated analysis of the content.  Outstanding work.The last few generations of people in the free world have had a unique experience.  Mass communication brings forth the possibility of one person's actions having long term effects on hundreds of thousands of other people.  The responsibility that must go with such power is clearly lacking.One would expect parents to shield their children from such influence.  Instead, we find a great many people all too willing to let their children's beliefs be dictated by a film director.Depressing.  Still, good article. Guru-C2 years ago Dear Patty:  Excellent Hub!!!  Thanks so much for this essential topic!Patty Inglish, MS2 years ago Thank you, Kenny, Bart. and Guru. It is positive that people read these books and reviews and discuss the issues as we are so doing. Without the hard physical labor required before technology advanced (creating some hard brain labor), energy wasapplied more to work. Withe increasing population, it seems people are pressed for enough elbow room, enough attention, and enough important activities to doand too little physical activity perhaps. Violence and bad manners are indeed being galmorized and idolized in the media at times.Thanks for an intelligent discussion from everyone on an important change in society.Patty :)MrMarmalade2 years ago Patty,This one of you best, which is pretty hard to achive,since your standard is already at a high level now.When I was young, many of the girls did not appear to be smokingNow days I belive they are smoking more then the boys.May be in 5 years we will be seeing those young girls getting the same diseasesthat the males get. Lung Cancer.There appears to be a growing concern in Australia about the female violenceExcellent hub thank you. Patty Inglish, MS2 years ago Thank you Mr. Marmalade for your thoughts! I will defintiely look into what's happening in Austalia.There is more smoking among girls now seemingly. I notice it alot.
