Some of the requested data includes details such as tweets, direct messages, IP information, email addresses and more. The government pretty much wants every bit of info associated with the accounts. The targets include Birgitta Jonsdottir, Jacob Appelbaum, Rop Gongrijp, Julian AssangeJulian Assange, Bradley Manning and the main Wikileaks account. Birgitta Jonsdottir, an Icelandic MP, has been fighting back the requests and is trying to get the help of her government to stop the US from obtaining her info, which stretched back to November 2009. Jonsdottir used to work at Wikileaks before she became a Member of Parliament with the Icelandic government. She was partly responsible for producing a video of a US Apache helicopter shooting down innocent cilivians in Iraq back in 2007. The video was then released in April 2010. The various Tweeters have since told the public to stop sending Tweets, and also mention not being afraid of any implications because they have nothing to hide. The subpoena was made available later on by Salon. So will the government stop at Twitter, or will they go further to pull information from Facebook and email accounts? Who knows.        1 of 30         Twitty-leaks      myscottishfitba is based in Prestwick, Scotland, United Kingdom,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:            READ MORE: USA, government, Twitter, tweets, TWiT, wiki, Wikileaks, supporters, orders twitter, wikileaks supporters, technology-news, Las Vegas, Julian Assange, internet censorship, Espionage, World Wide Web, national security, Web 2.0, political-news, Bradley Manning, Birgitta Jonsdottir, Jacob Appelbaum   More News From: Las Vegas :  NV :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Iceland slams US over WikiLeaks issue By: gino510      The Sydney Morning Herald quoted the AFP that Iceland criticized the US following its probe of the Twitter account of parliamentarian andformerWikiLeaks supporter,Birgitta Jnsdttir.Jnsdttir contacted the justice minister in Iceland and wanted to meet with the American envoy to make a complaint....  1 day ago     WikiLeaks Ask Google and Facebook to be Open By: putukarya      Twitter received a court order to open a personal account of WikiLeaks staffs.WikiLeaks has asked Google and Facebook for opening the contents of a warrant if they will accept from the government of the United States.
