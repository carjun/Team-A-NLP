Kidding aside, I came across some quotes from Erma Bombeck who could twist words with the best of them. Give a gander. I know one thing. My mom had a sense of humor and somehow past it on. Love you Mom.  Here are her thoughts about motherhood. All of us have moments in our lives that test our courage. Taking children into a house with white carpet is one of them.  Erma Bombeck Everyone is guilty at one time or another of throwing out questions that beg to be ignored, but mothers seem to have a market on the supply. Do you want a spanking or do you want to go to bed? Dont you want to save some of the pizza for your brother? Wasnt there any change?  Erma Bombeck Have you any idea how many children it takes to turn off one light in the kitchen? Three. It takes one to say, What light? and two more to say, I didnt turn it on.  Erma Bombeck I remember buying a set of black plastic dishes once, after I saw an ad on television where they actually put a blowtorch to them and they emerged unscathed. Exactly one week after I bought them, one of the kids brought a dinner plate to me with a large crack in it. When I asked what happened to it, he said it hit a tree. I dont want to talk about it.  Erma Bombeck Kids have little computer bodies with disks that store information. They remember who had to do the dishes the last time you had spaghetti, who lost the knob off the Tv set six years ago, who got punished for teasing the dog when he wasnt teasing the dog and who had to wear girls boots the last time it snowed.  Erma Bombeck Most women put off entertaining until the kids are grown.  Erma Bombeck Mothers have to remember what food each child likes or dislikes, which one is allergic to penicillin and hamster fur, who gets carsick and who isnt kidding when he stands outside the bathroom door and tells you whats going to happen if he doesnt get in right away. Its tough. If they all have the same hair color they tend to run together.  Erma Bombeck My kids always perceived the bathroom as a place where you wait it out until all the groceries are unloaded from the car.  Erma Bombeck My theory on housework is, if the item doesnt multiply, smell, catch on fire or block the refrigerator door, let it be. No one cares. Why should you?  Erma Bombeck No one ever died from sleeping in an unmade bed. I have known mothers who remake the bed after their children do it because theres a wrinkle in the spread or the blanket is on crooked. This is sick.  Erma Bombeck The age of your children is a key factor in how quickly you a re served in a restaurant. We once had a waiter in who said, Could I get you your check? and we answered, How about the menu first?  Erma Bombeck When mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest, theyre not mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor, or the music that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo dribbling down the shower drain. Theyre upset because theyve gone from supervisor of a childs life to a spectator. Its like being the vice president of the United States.  Erma Bombeck When your mother asks, Do you want a piece of advice? its a mere formality. It doesnt matter if you answer yes or no. Youre going to get it anyway.  Erma Bombeck Who, in their infinite wisdom, decreed that Little League uniforms be white? Certainly not a mother.

Hope you mom has a great day. Thanks for this walk down memory lane!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|8 monthsagoJust talked to her and made sure I was still in the will. Last night she returned from the Bahamas so I'm pretty sure she will have a nice relaxing day.            Reply  Posted By     CaliforniaClass|8 monthsagoThanks for the memories ..... I still laugh ;)            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|8 monthsagoIt made me pull up some of her other quotes. Here's one: "Never loan your car to anyone to whom you've given birth."            Reply  Posted By     paretta|8 monthsagoErma Bombeck was wonderful! She always made me laugh. She found humor in the everyday occurences of life, much like Bill Cosby did back in his prime.Thanks for another great report, Nathaniel!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|8 monthsagoI take your comment with great pride. Thank you.            Reply  Posted By     Punditty|8 monthsagoIf life is a bowl of cherries, what am I doing in the pits? Erma Bombeck had a way with words, for sure.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|8 monthsagoAnother jewel. Good piece on her on Wikipedia. The road she traveled included a few detours and setbacks.
