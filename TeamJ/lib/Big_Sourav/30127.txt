But more immediately we wondered if, now that the political stakes have cooled, she will intervene to keepher undocumented former housekeeper,Nicky Diaz (whom Whitman once described as a friend and a part of our extended family), from beingdeported by Homeland Securitys Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (A clue may lie in the fact that, although Whitmans personal executive assistant was a gay woman who owned a home and had a child with her same-sex partner,Whitman won the Republican primary in part by defending Californias Proposition 8 to outlaw homosexual marriages.)Failed females on the left will also have second acts, encores and next incarnationsMore.

And elections have consequences.NY Times:Legislative leaders in at least half a dozen states say they will propose bills similar to a controversial law to fight illegal immigration that was adopted by Arizona last spring, even though a federal court has suspended central provisions of that statute.The efforts, led by Republicans, are part of a wave of state measures coming this year aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration.NEJM:Can Congress Make You Buy Broccoli? And Why Thats a Hard QuestionThe continuing uncertainty over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), illustrated by conflicting trial court rulings and scholarly commentaries, raises the question of why this constitutional question is so hard to answer. There are at least four reasons.NEJM:Rethinking Safety-Net Access for the UninsuredAccess programs for the uninsured usually serve people with household incomes below about twice the federal poverty level. They may therefore be hard pressed to adapt their missions to the new uninsured population in ways that will maintain their fragile support from funders and volunteers. Since safety-net systems are already on life support,1 any major shock may threaten their very existence. Therefore, access programs must consider carefully how best to refocus and justify their function and mission.In that light, from theWaPo:The new year will bring important changes to U.S. health-insurance rules, as new provisions related to last years massive health-care overhaul take effect.The new rules are designed to help those caught in Medicares doughnut hole, offer seniors more preventative care, and limit how much of their customers money health-insurance companies can keep for overhead and profit.They all go into effect on Saturday.Complainhere.Ezra Klein:Isolate the eight key economic decisions of the Obama presidency: The intervention in the financial sector, the intervention in the auto sector, the intervention in the housing sector, the stimulus package, the health-care bill, financial regulation, and the tax deal. The financial and auto interventions, it should be noted, were begun under George W. Bush but carried out and expanded under Obama.In each case, the Obama administration sought to support or improve private markets. It refused to leave the market to sort itself out, as some on the right would have preferred, and resisted entreaties to take it over, as some on the left advocated.WaPo:Nearly all of them, like Bell, had stumbled into the tea party after Barack Obamas election. Theyd found a calling in the early days of a chaotic, leaderless movement that beckoned to political novices who identified themselves as conservatives but felt little attachment to organized politics. With astonishing speed, the tea party evolved into a powerful force that helped overturn the political order in Washington.But as a new cast of lawmakers takes the reins in the Capitol, Bell and many of her fellow tea partiers across the country are feeling adrift, wondering what they are supposed to do next. The movement is changing, in their view, and not necessarily for the better.Gail Collins has a multiple choice test for you:IV. Multiple choice:The Wall Street Journal reported that at least 15 percent of the incoming House freshman plan to:A) Sleep in their offices.B) Use the word refudiate in their official correspondence.C) Twitter 24/7.D) Try to get invited to Prince Williams wedding.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Entertainment, Government, Healthcare, Law, Other Things, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesAbbreviated Pundit Round-up....1/1/11, ACA, Ariz Immg Bill disease, Doughnut Hole, House Freshmen quiz, Obama Econonmics, Safety Net, Tea PartyRead moreWeight StoriesJanuary 1, 2011jamesb1011 commentWhat Weighty Matters Will The New Year Bring?How will we talk about weight in 2011?First, lets recap what we learned last year: Many people are too thin, while others are simply too fat!

An official celebration event will be hosted in San Francisco on January 5th, event location details to be announced.We sought a venue that fulfills our promise  to showcase the best sailors in the world competing on the fastest boats, said Richard Worth, Chairman, Americas Cup Event Authority. And hosting the Americas Cup in San Francisco will realize that promise.We thank Mayor Newsom, Board President Chiu, Supervisor Mirkarimi and all of the Board of Supervisors, the staff at City Hall and the Port Authority, Mark Buell and San Francisco Americas Cup Organizing Committee, and all who have worked so diligently on securing the bid, Worth continued. We look forward to working closely with City of San Francisco over the coming months to create a world-class Americas Cup event, and a large and lasting beneficial impact on the City.The world-famous San Francisco Bay will be home to the 2013 Americas Cup Finals and the Challenger Selection Series for the Louis Vuitton Cup, as well as an Americas Cup World Series event in 2012. This will be the first time the Americas Cup has been hosted in the United States since 1995.Today is one of great celebration, with San Francisco winning the right to host the Americas Cup, and all of the economic benefit, jobs and excitement that comes with it, said Mayor Gavin Newsom. San Francisco is the best place on Earth to host an event of this stature, and we could not be more proud to be the city that brings the Americas Cup back home to the United States.Independent studies show that the Americas Cup delivers the third largest economic impact in sport to host countries, behind the Olympic Games and soccers World Cup. The 34th Americas Cup is projected to pump an estimated $1.4 billion dollars into the San Francisco region.As a native San Franciscan, I grew up sailing in front of the City. Racing for the Americas Cup in San Francisco is something I have dreamt of my whole life, said Paul Cayard, CEO of Swedens Artemis Racing, a challenger for the 34thAmericas Cup.By hosting sailings most important event in the Bay, the world will see sailing as it never has before. As a team, Artemis Racing is particularly looking forward to competing in San Francisco.Racing will be held on the iconic San Francisco Cityfront and be visible from world-renown tourist destinations such as the Golden Gate Bridge, the Marin Headlands, Crissy Field, the Embarcadero and Fishermans Wharf. An influx of millions of tourists is expected for the Challenger Series for the Louis Vuitton Cup and the Americas Cup Finals in late 2013.My support for San Francisco hosting the Americas Cup goes beyond the opportunity to see our team competing on home waters, said Russell Coutts, CEO, ORACLE Racing, the current Americas Cup defending team. We are excited to sail for our sports greatest trophy, on a stretch of water legendary among sailors worldwide.The Race Village will be constructed on Piers 19 and 29, with the team bases at and around Pier 30/32. As part of the plan, the Americas Cup Event Authority will redevelop these piers as well as the surrounding infrastructure to support the racing, while rehabilitating the piers for the enjoyment of generations of San Franciscans to come.With a goal of creating the most dynamic Americas Cup in history for fans and participants, changes have been introduced to the 34th edition. Enhancements include the introduction of groundbreaking new 72 wing-sailed catamarans capable of speeds in excess of 40 miles per hour, new race formats and rules, and a transformed media and online broadcasting approach to enable an interactive viewer experience.In the summer of 2011, Americas Cup teams will commence racing in the new Americas Cup World Series in the new wing-sailed AC45 catamaran. The Americas Cup World Series calendar of events will be published in early 2011.Daniel G.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Entertainment, Media, Men, Sports, Updates34th America's Cup, SailboatRead moreHappy New Year!2011!December 31, 2010jamesb1011 commentTo all those out there..Happy New Year!May you have the best of the New YearMay you be Healthly, Wealthy and Wise..AndMay you keep coming back here to thePoliticaldog101..And Enjoy!..The DogShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Entertainment, Media, Other Things, Updates2011, Happy New Year!Read moreESPN in 3D.December 31, 2010jamesb101No comments[Lebron James going to the hoop.....]The Wonders And Weirdness Of ESPN In 3DPatrick Sauer recently attended a viewing of the first-ever NBA telecast on ESPNs new 3D channel, and it was a glimpse into our strange future: floating heads, precision celebrity high-fives, and lots and lots of really unreal detail.
