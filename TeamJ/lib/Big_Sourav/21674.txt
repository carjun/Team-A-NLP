As Prince William and Kate Middleton prepare to tie the knot, what are the ingredients of the ideal Royal marriage ceremony?Fairytale pageant, national communion or - for those so politically disposed - a Ruritanian waste of money, the Royal wedding occupies a unique position in the collective British imagination.Prince William and his fiancee, Kate Middleton, may have to contend with all the stresses and strains that confront any young couple preparing to marry - but conforming to the expectations and aspirations of an entire nation is an additional item on their to-do list.The UK may be a less deferential place than when Prince Charles and Princess Diana married in 1981 - a country where people prefer to vote out their public figures on prime-time TV rather than doff their caps to them.

Media requires JavaScript to play.A look back at five royal weddings from the past 60 years Divorce, scandal and the steady murmurings of republican sentiment might also mean that that the monarchy does not quite carry all the fairytale sparkle it did a generation previously.But, nonetheless, the British Royal wedding remains a unique occasion that encapsulates many of the oddities and indosyncracies of the national psyche.And even a cursory study of Royal weddings throughout history reveal that certain expectations are woven into the event like the stitching in a shop-bought Union Jack. So what key components of Willliam and Kate's ceremony can we anticipate in the spring or summer of 2011?ESCAPISMFor all their glamour, British heirs to the throne have a habit of marrying during periods of economic hardship.In 1947, the then-princess Elizabeth's wedding to Lt Philip Mountbatten took place against a backdrop of post-war austerity, rationing and devaluation.The Queen and Prince Philip married  amid the hardships of post-war BritainWhen Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, unemployment stood at 2.5 million and the inner cities were erupting in violence. Yet both occasions proved hugely popular with the beleaguered British public - the glitz, romance and opulence of the ceremonies offering respite from eras of hardship and uncertainty.Will the post-credit crunch UK of mid-2011, in which the coalition government's spending cuts will have begun to bite, take similar refuge from reality in Prince William and Kate Middleton's nuptials?Peter York, social commentator and author of Peter York's Eighties and The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook, believes there is currently a public appetite for escapism mirroring that of the early 1980s. "There's a lot of it around right now - Downton Abbey is about all that," he says of the hit ITV1 drama . "In 1981 you had something similar with Brideshead Revisited."Nonetheless, York suspects the Palace will be keen not to overdo the ostentatious bling lest it prove too much for hard-up subjects."I think they'll be careful about how they do it," he says. "They'll be taking soundings about how far to go."THE DRESSIn the build-up to next year's wedding a great deal of the hype and speculation will surround the design and making of the bride's dress. Princess Diana's wedding dress with its 25ft trail set the standard by which all others will be judgedWith so many people watching, much will be read into Kate Middleton's choice of attire.Indeed, there is a long line of memorable Royal wedding dresses. Perhaps the most influential of them came in 1840 when Queen Victoria married Prince Albert. It was a radical departure from the norm for two reasons. Victoria was not the first Royal bride to wear a white dress, but she cemented what is now an established tradition across the Western world. Before Victoria, brides wore various colours, afterwards, they increasingly veered towards white or cream.Continue reading the main story How to talk proper at the Royal weddingUNon-UDinner JacketDress SuitVegetablesGreensIceIce CreamScentPerfumeLooking-glassMirrorSpectaclesGlassesDiePass onJamPreserveNapkinServietteSofaSettee or CouchLavatory or LooToiletRichWealthyWhat?Pardon?Good healthCheersLunchDinner Drawing-roomLoungeWriting-paperNote-paperHow d'you do?Pleased to meet youPuddingSweetWhat is U and Non-U? Wikipedia Queen Victoria also opted for a shift in style, notes Joanna Marschner, senior curator at Kensington Palace and co-author of Royal Wedding Dresses.Previous Royal wedding dresses had frequently featured gold and silver cloth. They were not replicable by the general public. Now Victoria was wearing one that was. "For the first time a member of the Royal Family was wearing a dress that any girl about town might wear," notes Ms Marschner. As the Times noted: "Her majesty wore no diamonds on her head, nothing but a simple wreath of orange blossoms."The style of dress smacked of a personal choice. Later Royal dresses also established fashion trends. When the Queen Mother married in 1923, she helped set the trend for a nation.  "The Queen Mother's dress worn at her wedding was a flapper-style, lace veil pulled right down over her forehead," says Ms Marschner.And then the Queen's wedding in 1947 saw a dress that reflected the times. Despite being designed by the prominent Norman Hartnell, the then Princess Elizabeth had to use ration coupons to obtain the material. "It became every little girl in the country's dream... the inspiration for wedding fashions for a decade. These dresses do catch the imagination. They all made their bang in their own particular way."Perhaps none since that of Queen Victoria had as great an impact as Princess Diana's in 1981. The 25-ft long train drew the eye. "Romantic fashions were a thing of the moment," notes Ms Marschner. Dresses off the shoulder then became a wedding staple. What unites all of them is that they reflect there is a wider audience in attendance than just the thousands of invited guests."There is a practicality that has to be recognised," says Ms Marschner. "They are going to be photographed, they are going to have to carry the day in these enormous locations." A PUBLIC HOLIDAYEven the most cantankerous republican had cause to cheer on 29 July 1981 - a public holiday was declared and workers were given the day off."Sat and watched the royal wedding on TV," recorded Tony Benn, not normally an enthusiast for the trappings of monarchy, in his diary that day.A holiday means plenty of time for this sort of thingNo announcement has yet been made about whether the official Windsor-Middleton knot-tying ceremony in spring or summer 2011 will be marked with a similar long lie-in for the nation's employees.But an extra bank holiday was declared for the Queen's golden jubilee in 2002 and another is planned to mark the 60th anniversary of her ascending to the throne.No doubt some business groups will protest about lost productivity during a period in which the economy is in recovery.But Prime Minister David Cameron - who has revealed he slept outside the Mall to secure a good spot for the 1981 wedding - might be expected to give advocates of a day off a sympathetic hearing.PATRIOTISMRoyal weddings are supposed to cement affection for the Royal Family. There will also be much talk of the country uniting for the occasion. Even in ambivalent parts of the country enthusiasm will be evidentWhen Victoria married in 1840, it was largely an occasion for people in London and the surrounding area, with so many well-wishers climbing trees in St James's Park that branches snapped off, dumping their occupants into the crowd below.But by the time of the marriage of the future George V in 1893, railway travel was commonplace, allowing people from around the country to be close to the festivities. The Times noted that the Metropolitan Railway alone had carried a record 514,724 people on the wedding day.By 1981, much of the country was watching on television.   For the forthcoming wedding, Union Flags will be abundant. Schools, even in parts of the UK that evince a certain degree of ambivalence towards the Royal Family, will show their enthusiasm on collages and banners. Obviously, there are many republicans in the country for whom the occasion will provoke no such feelings. But the profusion of red, white and blue bunting will be hard to ignore.WEDDING FEVER?Many of those whose business depends on weddings will be rubbing their hands together in the hope that William's nuptials will prompt more lavish spending from those already planning to marry next year.Continue reading the main story Join the conversation Send a comment using the form below We'll also pull in tweets so add @BBC_magazine  Or comment on The Magazine's Facebook pageGet the Magazine's updates on Twitter Or on Facebook But does a much-trumpeted royal wedding have any effect on marriage rates?A quick look at the statistics suggests not. The Office for National Statistics has figures for marriages going back to 1837. Looking at the major royal wedding years of 1840, 1863, 1893, 1923, 1947 and 1981, and it's hard to see any spikes in marriage rates in the years after. Of course, that's not to say that those already planning to get married won't feel a little energised by all the hoopla around William and Kate.For many it will be hard to resist.Here is a selection of your comments For my job it will be great. I work in the NHS, in elderly care rehabilitation, and we will be planning all sorts of activities. Patients will be getting in the kitchen, practicing and cooking up wedding day treats, re-learning some life skills to gain some independence at home, and practising motor skills. We will get some crafts going, with wedding day hats, and bunting and things, so providing activity, social get-togethers and creative outlets. We will be getting a big reminiscence project together, remembering past weddings and other related experiences. If it's a nice day, we might even commandeer the car park for a big street party, just like the old days. And we will be able to get families and friends involved; it will give us a real push. Duncan Blunt, Cardiff, Wales At last! They are a beautiful couple. Although we are so excited and happy about the royal wedding, we can't help wondering about those couples who have already selected (whatever it will be) the same wedding date. Takes the steam out of it for them and for their guests, presumably.Lee, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA Remembering the awful sight of William and Harry walking behind their mother's coffin, it really made me smile to see Kate with Diana's ring on her finger. Good job William, your mother would have been so approving and proud.Veronica McNamara, San Clemente, CA (from Liverpool) The fact that William and I were both born the same year (one month apart), both officers in the RAF, having recently become engaged (although I proposed in Paris in February), and the fact we are getting married next year... all seem to be rather too coincidental. That said, our wedding date has been set for 30 April 2011. So please Your Royal Highness, don't choose the same date, as I would hate to have to be called in to work to provide an honour guard.Matthew Cox, Sutton Coldfield, UK It really does amaze me that people are saying that because we are in hard times that this wedding should be tamed down. If you are worried about the economy or debt of the country, then you should be shouting SPEND, SPEND, SPEND on this wedding. The spectacle of this wedding isn't for the happy couple (who should be congratulated on all fronts), this wedding is for the country. It can only do good for the economy, it can only do good to show people out there that there is still such a thing as love. This is an event. A major event, bigger than the Olympic legacy, bigger than the World Cup - this is what Britain is all about. Give the country a day off, then they can go and celebrate this like it should be, and boost the economy whilst doing so.Kevin B, Ware I remember Charles and Di's big day well - republican parents meant we went to the beach, everybody else was watching TV, great day. Lets hope the weather's fine so we can go to the deserted beach again.Rhys, Trawsfynydd, Wales There should be a net income gain in foreign tourists next year and not just in London. Gloucestershire (where I live) will be a beneficiary with its connections to the Royal Family. There is a also a market for producing memorabilia, maybe products could be manufactured in the UK.Mary, Cheltenham, GloucestershireMore on This StoryRoyal wedding Royal wedding day plans revealedThe Archbishop of Canterbury is to marry Prince William and Kate Middleton at their forthcoming wedding, St James's Palace discloses.Kate to join wax royalty in 2011Prince Harry hails 'sister' KateTestino photos mark royal romanceRoyal wedding china goes on saleKate Middleton fever hits New YorkProfile: Prince WilliamBBC News looks at the life of Prince WilliamThe Kate Middleton storyIn pictures: A royal romanceRoyal wedding: American reactionFrom students to sweetheartsVIDEO & AUDIOMiddleton 'not with the Royal Family' WatchThe Queen and other members of the royal family are spending Christmas Day at Sandringham in Norfolk, but neither Prince William nor his fiancee Kate Middleton will be there.William and Kate: The story so far WatchCharles 'thrilled' at royal wedding  WatchMiddletons: 'Absolutely delighted' WatchIn today's Magazine7 days 7 questionsDo you know what this glass is called and other questions from the week's newsYour Good Samaritan storiesHere are 10 stories of random acts of kindness sent in by Magazine readers.
