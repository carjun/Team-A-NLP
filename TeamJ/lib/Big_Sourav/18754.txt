I like the smell of them, the waythey feel in your hands, the dazzling book jackets and cover illustrations, themagic of what is contained between the covers and in some cases their historyand their collectability. I love the crazy world of book collecting where rarecopies can exchange hands for millions from the very first printed Guttenbergbible to a Stephen King  or a JK Rowling original. As a confirmed bibliophile and also a lover of mysteries,the joy of discovering an author who sets his mysteries in the world of book dealing and collectingis a double whammy.It should come as no surprise, as John Dunning himself is a book scout and dealerfrom Denver. Booked to Die (HB)THE BOOKMAN MYSTERIES I stumbled upon Dunning while holidaying in US and grabbed apaperback copy of Booked to Die from a supermarket shelf. I finished the bookin one sitting (didnt sleep) and desperately wanted more.  I was able to buy the second in the seriesBookmans Wake from Amazon and that didnt disappoint either. The books wereset in the world of book dealing and the mysteries themselves revolved aroundantiquarian book trade, offering remarkable insights around  book collecting and collectors. This didnt compromisethe quality of the mystery within, no sir, it actually enhanced the quality ofthe read for me. The plot was intricate and gripping and a very satisfyingfinale. Its no surprise that the first book of the series won the Nero Awardfor best mystery of the year. Since then he has been nominated for an 'Edgar' a few times. ( Nero and Edgar are mystery writer's Oscars named after Rex Stout's creation Nero Wolfe and legendary scribe of mystery thrillers Edgar Wallace)But brilliant as he is, Dunning is not a prolific writer.Unlike the Michael Connellys, Patricia Cornwells and Jonathan Kellermans ofthis world, who effortlessly churnout a bestseller a year, Dunning takes histime, and boy does he take his time. You can see from the list that his sparseofferings only make you hunger for more.  AUTHOR PROFILEJohn Dunning was born in 1942 in  Brooklyn NY but was raised in Charleston, SC.  John had suffered from ADHD   (which was unheard of in the 50s) and struggled through school and was labeeld apoor student. After being released from the army due to a perforated ear drum,he took up a lowly paid job in a Charleston glass shop. He moved to Denver,Colorado in 1964 to work as a stable hand for a few years. He says in his ownwebsite how much he enjoyed this time of his life, much of this experienceprobably ended up in the 5thJaneway mystery, the Bookwomans last Fling asit is set in the world of racing and horse owners. In 1966 he got a job as a copy boy at the Denver post,slowly working his way up through the ranks and ending up as a journalist andpart of a team of investigative reporters. He wrote a couple of reasonably wellreceived thrillers in the 80s, Looking for Ginger North and The Hollandsuggestions. He also wrote two other novels in this period, Deadline and Denver. Perhaps his ADHD got in the way of publisher pressure in meetingDeadlines or perhaps there were other reasons, but John stopped writing andstarted the old Algonquin book store in Denver in 1984. His intense knowledgeof bookworld and his contacts with fellow writers and their constant pesteringmade him return to writing and in 1992 Cliff Janeway was born to much criticaland commercial acclaim. 2 years after John and His wife closed the store and ithas been an online bookstore ever since. Johns other passion is old radio shows and hisencyclopaedic knowledge into these led him to hosting a weekly radio show inDenver for over 25 years. He has published two reference books on this subject( listed below) and has also acted as a consultant in the Robert Altman filmThieves like us. The film was set in 1937 and Altman in his own inimitable stylewanted it scored with old radio shows and John Dunning was at hand to help.

Inthis ambitious sequel to Booked to Die, Dunning takes his bookman ontreacherous journey worthy of Poe himself. The mysterious pedigree of theGrayson Press edition of Poe, the intricacies of font types and printing presses,the trail of blood that seems to follow the books wake, all conspire to enthralbook lovers and mystery lovers alike.  This book goes one better on the firstand as there is no back story and scene setting,  cracks along at a good pace. Along the way,Dunning continues his scathing attack on the troglodytes who deface booksincluding those publishers themselves who seem to want to deface the very booksthey publish when they are sold as remaindered copies!  Cheer along with Dunningsdelicious put downs on those who feel the need to scribble in a book!  My own personal peeve is those who fold thetop corner  of a page to bookmark it. It  drives me crazy. It does. Other Author Hubs by DocmoArturo Perez- Reverte : His pen and his (s)wordsArturo Perez- Reverte is the bestselling novelist in Spain.

Laura is accused of murdering her husband who also happens to be a bookcollector. Soon the plot boils with Janeway crossing with the local cops,schmoozing with the Judge, investigating an astonishing collection of signedfirst editions that seem out of place in that household. The Trail takes him to the astonishing trade in autographed editions and the conniving underbelly of the book dealers world. There are twists aplenty and the plot takes on a soap opera quality when Laura asks her dead husband's ex-lover to defend her in the trial. Erin never forgave her for stealing her boyfriend and marrying him. Slightlyovercomplicated with the relationship triangle( nay, a tetrahedron!) the book stilldelivers fast paced muscular action and a satisfying finale.

Most of Dunning's  non-series older books are now reissued and back in print. His Encyclopedic knowledge of Old Time Radio has culminated in two generous compendia called  Tune in Yesterday & On the air for lovers of Old time radio shows. John Hasn't produced a Janeway novel since 2006. It is hard to complain now that I know Dunning was sufferingmedical problems  a benign brain tumour that was partially removed in 2006 . He has endured a long recovery and lets hope heis back at his typewriter restoring the old Janeway magic.There is renewed interest in Dunning's other books and there is a re-issue of Denver and paperback version of Two o'clock Eastern Wartime available now, as are all his Cliff Janeway books.
