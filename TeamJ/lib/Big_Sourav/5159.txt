For many others there is an assumption that it is a holiday celebrated in state communist countries like Cuba or the former Soviet Union. Most Americans dont realize that May Day has its origins here in this country and is as American as baseball and apple pie, and stemmed from the pre-Christian holiday of Beltane, a celebration of rebirth and fertility.0 commentsRead the full article May Day in San Diego Call to Action: Rally and MarchApril 30, 2010MAY 1st -May Day in San Diego!Primero de Mayo en San Diego- call to action -Llamada a la accinLEGALIZATION FOR ALL  WITHOUT CONDITIONSLegalizacin para todos, sin condicionesJOBS, HOUSING & LIVABLE WAGES FOR ALLEmpleos y salarios decentes para todosFUND EDUCATION & SOCIAL SERVICES  NOT WARDinero para educacin y servicios sociales, no para guerraIMMIGRATION RIGHTS FOR LGBT PARTNERSNingn ser humano es ilegal, ningn amor es ilegal11:00 Rally at Chicano Park12:00 Human Chain and March to Federal Building1:00 Rally at Federal BuildingDowntown San Diego880 Front ST3 commentsRead the full article OB Town Council Supports Keeping Fire RingsApril 29, 2010Nearly a dozen residents who support keeping OBs fire rings showed up at the Town Councils regular meeting, Wednesday night, April 28th, and about half of them spoke up at the Masonic Temple meet before the very attentive Council on maintaining the communitys icons.And even though the Town Council did not take a vote during the meeting, those members of the Council who spoke on the issue gave strong  indications the Council would vote during their next meeting in support of the fire rings.  About two years, the Council had passed a similar proposal in support of the pits.3 commentsRead the full article BREAKING NEWS: California Begins Construction of Border Fence Along Arizona BorderApril 29, 2010In response to the State of Arizonas new immigration law, California volunteers have begun construction of a new border fence along the Colorado River.30 commentsRead the full article Save OBs Few Remaining Fire Rings  Come to the Town Council Meeting Wed April 28thApril 28, 2010Show the OB Town Council  and everybody else (like the Mayor)  that you want to save the fire rings of Ocean Beach.  Theyre on the agenda tonight, April 28th, of the Town Council.They meet at 7 pm at the Masonic Temple, corner of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and Santa Moncia Ave.Mayor Sanders is threatening to begin removing all 185 of San Diegos fire rings, including the remaining eight here in OB, beginning July 1.

Duncan Hunter Ignorant or Just Racist?April 28, 2010Rep. Duncan Hunter backs deporting U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrantsAt a recent Tea Party meeting in Ramona, Rep Duncan Hunter stated that he supported the deportation of children born in the US to undocumented migrants. Is he racist or maybe he just doesnt know what the Constitution states.Section 1, Clause 1 of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, states:All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.23 commentsRead the full article Stop the Budget Cuts Rally Takes Shape for May 8thApril 28, 2010If you think Californias budget crisis has somehow been resolved for this year just because there havent been many stories about it in the news media lately, think again.And heres the really bad part: those programs that werent axed in this years proposed budget for San Diegos schools, will most likely be eliminated next year as the State careens towards a funding cliff caused by the cessation of stimulus funding. For San Diego Unified, thats another $50 million whack thats just around the corner.2 commentsRead the full article Solidarity Rally for Immigrants and Against Arizona  Photo GalleryApril 27, 2010Dozens of people made it downtown on Monday, April 26th, to rally and parade in front of the Federal Building, to protest Arizonas new immigration laws.  Several OBceans made it to the rally in support.These photos were taken by Michael Gomel for our viewing pleasure.32 commentsRead the full article Remembering a Jr. High Love StoryApril 27, 2010Back in 1951 my classmates and I at John Spring Jr. High, in Tucson, in our pure innocence, made desegregation work in our part of town.It was all about love and without it, in heavy doses, many of us black kids wouldnt have been able to bear the pain and awkwardness that came with the new era. See, there we were on the very first day singing Hail to John Spring Jr. High just a summer away from having, for years, sung our hail tos to Paul Laurence Dunbar. At Dunbar Jr. High. Overnight Dunbars name was exited from our lives like a word being erased at the blackboard  as though there was no realization that this great poet with pen in hand had captured in his imagery the very essence of our struggles as a people, in black dialect, no less. This man was tied to our very psyche, our sense of self. We couldnt understand why his name had to go.2 commentsRead the full article Reader Rave: Thank you OB, California, and AmericaApril 26, 2010by anonymous OBcianOften these days, we hear so many bad things about our country  the political tensions and the economy -, and we hear so many bad things about our state of California  how its going broke and the legislative stalemate  -, and plus we hear so many negative things about our southwestern County  its conservatism and shyness in handing out benefits -, that we sometimes forget where we are.Well, for one, I want to shout out: Lets hear it for the other side  lets hear it for our country, our state, and yes, even for our county: hip, hip, hurray, hip, hip, hurray!What the heck am I shouting about???Im shouting hurray loud and clear for everyone to hear  for the safety and social nets of our county, state and country.10 commentsRead the full article Lets play a game: Imagine if the Tea Parties were BlackApril 26, 2010by Tim WiseLets play a game, shall we? The name of the game is called Imagine. The way its played is simple: well envision recent happenings in the news, but then change them up a bit. Instead of envisioning white people as the main actors in the scenes well conjure  the ones who are driving the action  well envision black folks or other people of color instead. The object of the game is to imagine the public reaction to the events or incidents, if the main actors were of color, rather than white. Whoever gains the most insight into the workings of race in America, at the end of the game, wins.So lets begin.Imagine that hundreds of black protesters were to descend upon Washington DC and Northern Virginia, just a few miles from the Capitol and White House, armed with AK-47s, assorted handguns, and ammunition. 9 commentsRead the full article Countys largest union settles fraud complaints  new elections to be heldApril 24, 2010Editor: Our good friend and OB Rag supporter Monty Kroopkin was the nominee for president of Local 221 of the SEIU put up by a reform slate last summer.  We interviewed him during the campaign, which the reformers lost. Allegations of fraud committed by the winners were raised by the reform activists.  Now, theyve won a round. Check out this update below.by Eleanor Yang Su / San Diego Union-Tribune / April 22, 2010The countys largest union, the Service Employees International Union Local 221, reached a settlement this week over complaints about its election last summer, and will hold a new election under federal supervision before Sept. 30.Members of the SEIU Local 221, which represents about 10,000 county employees and other public-sector workers, filed a complaint to the U.S. Department of Labor contending that the July 21 election illegally denied nearly 1,000 members the right to vote.0 commentsRead the full article Youve got to be kidding Brian Bilbray solves the immigration problem thanks to the shoes of the peopleApril 24, 2010The Republicans have taken the bull by the horns on the immigration issue, proving yet again that they know how to produce b.s. and lots of it.Arizona was not about to wait for President Obama to address this federal issue. Arizona wants to be as bad-ass as secessionist threatening Texas, although the Zonies themselves are smart enough to not want to actually spend time in Texas, preferring to use their get out of hell card to hang out on a California beach during the summer. Arizonas approach to comprehensive immigration reform in all of its reducto ad absurdum is a mere two words- racial profiling. Keep it classy, Arizona!Racial profiling is as American as apple pie and throughout the history of this great country of ours, 12 commentsRead the full article Arizonas Immigration Bill is a Social and Racial Sin  Are We Ready for a Boycott of Arizona?April 23, 2010by Jim Wallis / Christians for  Immigration Reform /04-21-2010I got up at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday to fly to Phoenix, Arizona, to speak at a press conference and rally at the State Capitol at the invitation of the states clergy and other leaders in the immigration reform movement. The harshest enforcement bill in the country against undocumented immigrants just passed the Arizona state House and Senate, and is only awaiting the signature of Governor Janet Brewer to become law.Senate Bill 1070 would require law enforcement officials in the state of Arizona to investigate someones immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person might be undocumented.28 commentsRead the full article Registrar of Voters and Republicans Accused of Mailing GOP Campaign Literature at Taxpayers ExpenseApril 23, 2010The San Diego County Democratic Party (SDCDP) Wednesday named the County Registrar of Voters and the Republican Party as conspirators in a legal violation regarding postage subsidies.The SDCDP plans to report the violation to the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC).The SDCDP alleges that the County Registrar of Voters, at taxpayer expense, will insert partisan campaign literature into the official sample ballots mailed to Republican voters next month.4 commentsRead the full article You have to be kidding Microchips, the DoD and YOUR private partsApril 23, 2010by Anna DanielsObecians- you have participated in a polite conversation on this blog about the intrusion of government in your private lives recently. The Homeland Security cameras, the life guard towers, etc.  Take note that the good citizens of Georgia have recently taken a much more pro-active approach to this issue. The Georgia House Judiciary Committee passed a bill that would prohibit requiring a person to be implanted with a microchip. Violation of this law would be a misdemeanor.2 commentsRead the full article Climate talks in Bolivia: Capitalism vs. justiceApril 22, 2010by Graham Land / Greenfudge.org / April 22, 2010Bolivia has been hosting an international summit, named the World Peoples Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth, in the city of Cochabamba. The talks began on the 19th and finish today.From a report by the Environmental News Service:More than 20,000 indigenous, environmental and civil society delegates from 129 countries were in attendance as President Morales welcomed them to the conference at a soccer stadium in the village of Tiquipaya on the outskirts of the city of Cochabamba.The tone in Bolivia is decidedly political, with an emphasis on nature, poor and indigenous peoples and climate justice.0 commentsRead the full article Anniversary of the take-over of Chicano Park  April 22, 1970April 22, 2010Originally posted April 22, 2009by Frank GormlieThis was the day a new park was born, created out of the dirt of a Highway Patrol station. The people of Barrio Logan on this day seized land that was supposed to hold a CHP station. They made it into a park  Chicano Park  which today stands as an historic center for murals, art, Chicano and Mexican-American culture.8 commentsRead the full article Neo-Confederates, the Militias and the Tea Parties  Are We Heading for a Second Civil War?April 21, 2010I began writing this nearly a week ago, on Tax Day, April 15th, as thousands of Tea Party members were rallying across the nation.  I wanted to write something substantive, authoritative, a summary, a review of the extreme right mobilizations, of the militias, the new secessionists, the  open-carry activists with guns. And what it all meant.For background, I began reading probably more than a dozen reports and posts on and of  the Tea Partiers, the militias, and other extremist nefarious goings-on in our country. Not surprised by all the attention the Tea Parties were getting, I kept reading and searching for more  I put off writing for another day or two.38 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
