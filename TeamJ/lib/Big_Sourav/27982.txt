Many long to play the guitar. With the access we have to videos and cds online it is now easier that ever to become a self taught legend in your own right. Follow along as I share one of my all time favorite heros of the guitar world. Jimi Hendrix, aw now thats a great. There is something about him that is magical and inspiring. Jimi seemed to be a man before his time and I feel it is for this reason so many people relate to him and love him.Many of Jimi Hendrix's famous experiences are forever etched in our minds as we recall; along the watchtower, crosstown traffic, purple haze, voodoo child, the wind crys mary,a castle made of sand, machine gun and on and on the Jimi Hendrix experience's go.  Guitar great Jimi Hendrix electric guitar legend learn to play guitarYou don't honestly know what a guitar riff is until you hear it from the God of riff who truly gave birth to the reality and expression riff! This would hands down be Jimi Hendrix. Jimi was a guitar God who gave birth to chords and took a guitar riff to a entirely whelm. I think of Hendrix as a poet as he so effortlessly expressed his lyrics into a magical ride of poetic beauty. Now that must be where the term psychedelic came from. It's now wonder Jimi Hendrix Records is still a hot and much desired item to own.The WatchtowerFender Starcaster Electric Guitar Pack with Amp and Accessories, Candy Apple RedAmazon Price: $219.99List Price: $199.00Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar, WhiteAmazon Price: $169.00List Price: $282.00Fender Starcaster Strat Pack Electric Guitar with Amp and Accessories - BlackAmazon Price: $168.99Electric Guitar Pack For DummiesAmazon Price: $134.99List Price: $199.99Austin Bazaar Transparent Blue Electric Guitar Package with 10 Watt Amp - Beginner KitAmazon Price: $109.95List Price: $299.95Starcaster by Fender Strat Electric Guitar Starter Pack, BlackAmazon Price: $99.50List Price: $299.99Guitar great Jimi Hendrix electric guitar legend learn to play guitarJIMI HENDRIX Who else could dress like a flag and rock out like he did? Jimi was the perfect image of the times with his courage and colorful promise. The man was so extremely talented all his hippie and druggie culture seemed to fade in the background as you would be magically transcended into time with his insane mastery of the guitar and facial story telling. It was certain that his talent was coming from a place so deep within him, no doubt his soul. Sadly Jimis career lasted but four years in which time he made records now historical monuments of his genius. Jimi Hendrix took hold of the electric guitar and made it an extension of himself. He created a sonic howl that moved everyone within earshot. His voice and guitar married in passion to form a piercing energy that no one wanted to end. It was free and easy to be cast under the Hendrix spell. He is and will forever be a true guitar God. Jimi Hendrix, I just love saying his name, was born in Seattle on November 27, 1942. Just writing this down makes it seem all the more impossible he's gone it seems more fitting for him to have been born much later and alive today.Jimi Hendrix Jimi Hendrix is famous for his Star Spangle Banner Performance at WoodstockGuitar great Jimi Hendrix electric guitar legend learn to play guitarAs a child Jimi had a rather normal life with nothing ever being reported with exception to the love of his six-string. Jimi joined the Army, became a paratrooper and it was reported that he slept with his guitar. I imagine him sleep playing as if he was always at creating a new twist and turn to his diverse stylings. He spent every free moment perfecting his craft. I can imagine he even did so while he slept. If ever there was a man totally into a guitar Im sure it would be Jimi. After the military Jimi Hendrix moved to London. He returned to America having transformed into a more cultured and artful man if that be possible. It was possible as he gave birth to yet one other talent that being a poet. Jimi was a great poet of the guitar. Hendrix seemed to have a connection to all the injustice of the world as he displayed it unleashing in his historical and earth moving performance at wood stock, Star Spangled Banner in form of a protest none other has ever delivered and made with his howling of righteousness for all deserving.West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology (4 CD/ 1 DVD Collectors Box)Amazon Price: $48.31List Price: $69.98Experience Hendrix: The Best Of Jimi HendrixAmazon Price: $8.50List Price: $13.98The Jimi Hendrix ExperienceAmazon Price: $42.59List Price: $59.98Classic Albums - The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Electric LadylandAmazon Price: $6.58List Price: $11.98Guitar great Jimi Hendrix electric guitar legend learn to play guitarThe Great Poet Jimi Hendrix Famous Quotes;1.

I've written about him in numerous hubs, ten best this and that, and most recently I listed the Ten Best Ipod tunes of Hendrix I think everybody should listen to. I also included that "Purple Haze" YouTube video you show above. (Actually you show "Voodoo Chile," well that's an excellent one too.) Good choice! Anyhow, anybody hoping to learn some of Hendrix's licks should check out the lessons on YouTube. Duh, as if they haven't figured that out already. What a resource!

Great hub, loving the magic.katiem28 months ago Hea James, Great to see you!  I do know a thing or two about Jimi Hendrix, he is a guitar great!  Thanks and Peace:)Support Med.8 months ago katiem2:  Yes, Jimi was the great one when it came to guitar. There are times when I think he was ahead of his time as well. However, since I was taught that 'the highest' makes no mistakes, I have concluded that Jimi was a free expression genius guitar player for us to see, hear, enjoy and learn where that passion for guitar and love of music and sending a message of freedom and hope can be demonstrated in a stage performance.  Like most who are ahead of their time, he got caught up in something that's not good for anyone.  Glad his music is still here for us to enjoy.katiem28 months ago Support Med, Thanks for the comment, Jimi Hendrix is a wonderful person to learn about and his music is amazing.  Thanks and Peace :)billyaustindillon6 months ago Jimi Hendrix was here for such a short time yet changed the face of guitar work - he was a great guitar legend. I also wondered what he could have been the way he was playing around with jazz there at the end. Just so many great tunes, all along the watchtower, fire and just goes on. Great tribute Katie.katiem26 months ago billyaustindillon, so glad you stopped in to enjoy Jimi Hendrix, greats like him should not be forgotten.  :)saddlerider16 months ago Fantastic, genius, brilliant hub.
