This concept was shared by an entire generation of grassroots activists here in OB during the first half of the Seventies. In this continuous series about the history of urban planning in Ocean Beach, Im attempting to outline the historical record so newer generations of OBceans can appreciate how OB came to be what it is today.  5 commentsRead the full article Help get CaliforniasWacky USDA food stamps waiver denied and improve access to healthy food for allJuly 27, 2009by Lane TobiasIn previous articles about food stamps, I touched upon some of the barriers to food stamps eligibility that inevitably makes San Diego one of the hardest places in the U.S. to receive food stamps  even if you fall within the income and eligibility guidelines.While most of those barriers continue to present problems to applicants, there are local initiatives that have helped pass important legislation to start eliminating them. 4 commentsRead the full article This is what gentrification looks like in OBJuly 27, 2009Recently, we have raised the issue of gentrification here in Ocean Beach, the controversial process of urban renewal.  Acknowledging that it has been on-going here in OB since at least the early 1970s, it is important to understand it and to appreciate it when it rears its head.Many neighborhoods in major cities across the country have experienced gentrification, where older housing is torn down to make way for newer, spiffier, and more expensive homes, condos, and apartments.  The process often displaces the poorer  and in many cases  ethnic minorities  from neighborhoods that have historically been theirs.26 commentsRead the full article Book Review: Recipe For America  Why Our Food System is Broken and What We Can Do To Fix ItJuly 27, 2009by Doug Porter Once upon a time in America we were all promised a future where there would be better living through chemistry.

Two recent polls  one by this blog  and one that is still on-going by the Peninsula Beacon, show that most  or at least the respondents  want to keep the annual July 4th Marshmallow War around.  The Ocean Beach public event has been the subject of debate recently after the mess that was left behind.  Our blog ran a poll for a week and received 80 respondents.  Clearly most  56 respondents, 71%, wanted the event to continue, although 18 commentsRead the full article Chris Bowd Is Awake!

A group of hoopers had been ticketed on June 4th, with fines totaling $2,500. They got these tickets practicing in a small, controlled group at the beach in OB.The article received a great response, but I started thinking about the voices that hadnt been heard. 22 commentsRead the full article This Old HouseJuly 25, 2009By Ernie McCray(An Old Man Just Sharing Good Memories Sparked by a Picture)The house I live in was built in 1911 of some pretty sturdy wood; it had to be with twin girls traveling up and down its stairs in various teenage moods and posing like Tyra Banks in a photo shoot on its roof; it had to be with a boy, like a descendant of the Eveready Energizer Bunny, bouncing off its walls and floors and ceilings like a racquetball until we shipped him off to Long Beach State with a great big Whew!; it had to be with a mom and dad pacing back and forth on its carpets wondering aloud: Whose Idea was it to have kids?22 commentsRead the full article Che Guevaras Daughter Recalls Her Revolutionary FatherJuly 23, 2009Aleida Guevara was four and a half when her father left Cuba. Ernesto Che Guevara, iconic Argentine guerrilla leader, Marxist theorist and second-in-command of the Cuban revolution, departed the island for Africa in 1965 after falling out of political favor with Fidel Castro.
