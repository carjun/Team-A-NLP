If you drink and drive and kill someone in an accident the driver should be charged with pre-meditated murder.  After all they did choose to drink and then drive.  It should be a capital offense because they killed someone whild breaking another law.   When is the state going to treat them as they should be treated.  I'm sick and tired of them getting a slap on the wrist.  My thoughts are with the officer and his family and hope he fully recovers quickly.57686288Flag this commenta_true_liberal said on December 20, 2010 at 11:18 AMzivkam: What a profound, well-developed response.

That is the safest way to address a tire that goes flat on the highway, and will greatly help in minimizing on-looker slow downs and the wrecks that may result from those.57646573Flag this commenta_true_liberal said on December 20, 2010 at 9:15 AMzivkam, you lost me. Are you saying it's a good law, but some people over-react to it?57645302Flag this commentzivkam said on December 20, 2010 at 9:04 AMTo all the idiots leaving ignorant comments about this story:  Go on a ride along with your local police department.  You will see that the police do NOT have control of the world like you see it.  The Texas "Move Over" Law states when an authorized emergency vehicle has their lights on while on a roadway, passing traffic MUST either move over a lane or slow down 20 mph below the speed limit while passing.  I don't know how many times I've been on the shoulder of a freeway helping someone change a tire, with traffic flying by, when suddenly traffic slows enough to start chain reaction braking.  There is always that fear of someone whipping out onto the shoulder to avoid running into the person they had been following too closely and ending my life.  Whether its the police on a traffic stop, accident, public assistance or the fire department working an emergency, the law is there to punish those idiots who are inconsiderate and unsafe.  Waa if you lose 2 mins on your daily commute.57644638Flag this commentlissajeff2436801 said on December 19, 2010 at 11:33 PM@scottfwtx - you are an idiot.57631017Flag this commenta_true_liberal said on December 19, 2010 at 11:14 PMOkay xpd. Since you know who "bolted straight out of bed", then I suppose that you have inside information about this case. I saw (on another news-source) that the vehicle was a regular sedan (as opposed to a Suburban), so you may be right....57630234Flag this commentxpd8023 said on December 19, 2010 at 10:56 PMcsaw22- THANK YOU. Your comment hit the mail on the head in every way. Scott- you are a complete idiot who simply doesn't kno when to shut up, so I'm going to ignore u now bc ur not worth a second thought.Liberal- that was absolutely uncalled for. BUT I will tell u this: one of the officers who was called in at 2am to assist in the chaos and bolted straight out of bed- HIS last name is PEREZ, and another GPD officer on duty that night was last name GONZALEZ. So put that on ur plate and EAT IT.I think you are all missing the point here so y not take ur heads out of that deep dark smelly hole u keep it in n read the story a lil slower time, think about it,  and have a lil respect for this officer and his family.57629486Flag this commentlp1111 said on December 19, 2010 at 9:42 PMI see plenty of police officers in Arlington stop cars, and they usually have the move out of the way of traffic, and so not all cops stop people in the middle of the street.Also, speeding tickets are not some "little" thing.  If you hit somebody while traveling at a very high rate of speed, you will usually cause more damage or bodily harm than if you hit them traveling at a slow rate.  It's just sad that people don't seem to get this, and think it's okay to break the law.  Also, who decides what is meant by "slightly speeding."  We have speed limits for a reason, and it isn't always safe to even go as fast as the speed limit.  Don't blame the police when people don't obey the law.  Blame the people who don't obey the law.  They are the ones causing the problems.  The police are just doing their job.57625487Flag this commenttxsheri said on December 19, 2010 at 9:13 PMLet me guess.  The drunk wasn't hurt?57623976Flag this commentscottfwtx said on December 19, 2010 at 7:03 PMcsaw22, why do you say "hello?" in the middle of your comment? Were you expecting a response? Your input is idiotic and doesn't make sense. Looks like you were drunk when you typed it.57618572Flag this commentcsaw22 said on December 19, 2010 at 5:04 PMscottfwtx--too bad it wasn't you on the side of the road...you probably would have been in the way too.  The fact of the matter is that most people who do run into police cars are drunk...especially at 1am! Hello?  Everyone else this is coherent enough to recognize it slows down to 10mph and won't pass em let alone become indulged in the beauty of the flashing red and blue lights and drive right in to them.  The only people out on the roads at 1am anyway are usually the cops and the drunks.  Hope the idiot that the officer is eventually charged with intoxication assault instead of a simple dwi.  And ftworthguy..you never hear about the BAC level or outcome of the charges because the media never reports it to you.  Almost all dwi arrests now days are followed up by a blood draw...and those results are not instantaneous.  So, if you really care about what happens to these people enough to follow up on it, contact the media.  But yes, it is usually the idiots fault that hit the police car57614252Flag this commentscottfwtx said on December 19, 2010 at 4:16 PMThe cop must have been in the way. Lots of people have a few pops before driving and nothing bad happens.57612657Flag this commentsteven75150 said on December 19, 2010 at 3:53 PMWhat part of do not drink and drive do you not understand?57611857Flag this commenttim_denton said on December 19, 2010 at 3:53 PMThis is the first I'd heard of the slowing 20mph thing.  Heard something last yr or so about moving over a lane when approaching a stopped police car with the LED lights on.   Those LED lights are much brighter than the old style and can be mesmerizing.  I can imagine that they would draw in a drunk just like a homing beacon.  And so is the case, another typical Saturday Night Special.57611849Flag this commentftworthguy said on December 19, 2010 at 3:00 PMLonestar I could not agree more... Officers stoppping for minor traffic violations like turn signal, slightly speeding, regitration etc... should be made to take the next exit or side street. Lots of traffic backups are caused by officers just pulling people over ina busy roadway which is dangerous for everyone including officers. I have seen Euless stop people countless times blocking a lane just to issue a minor citation. BTW to touch on my last post, i know the circumstances were different here. Officer wasnt even in his car, but when driving its always the others fault.57610007Flag this commentftworthguy said on December 19, 2010 at 2:54 PMEver notice how when an officer gets into an accident it is ALWAYS a suspected drunk driver. Yet you never hear anything about the BAC level or the outcome of the charges on the driver. You never hear "The officer was at fault" I have nearly been plowed into by several cops speeding without lights on and etc. But its never their fault when they get into an accident. I do howver hope the officer makes a good recovery.57609827Flag this commentproudarmywife1 said on December 19, 2010 at 1:27 PMoh and um if the motorist with fender benders would understand the law, it is a law that if you have an accident that does not require emergency medical response, then you are to take it to the shoulder and wait for the PD. So please dont blame the police for stuff that civilians dont want to obide by.57606943Flag this commentproudarmywife1 said on December 19, 2010 at 1:25 PMI saw this last night on my way home and it was horrific. And lonestar, first off you should slow even without the law for any motorist on the side of the road. Its called respect. Perhaps you should try it sometimes. Plus to me it sounds like you would be to busy to pull over for an old lady with a flat tire. Jus saying.I hope he comes through ok because its an image that will never get out of my head.57606859Flag this commentjdmatt said on December 19, 2010 at 1:23 PMLOL.......

(A) Gonzales, (B) Hernndez, (C) Perez, (D) Rodriquez57604682Flag this commentselenaking said on December 19, 2010 at 11:33 AMlonestar24, you have NO idea whether this officer would be in the hospital if the law was different or not. Driving while drunk is against the law too, but obviously people do it. So, what makes you think these idiots are going to abide by any law????? Actually, the current law is a good one....if people would adhere to it.57602786Flag this commentlissajeff2436801 said on December 19, 2010 at 11:16 AMBecause if the driver that hit the officer was drunk like the police suspect, he probably wasn't thinking about laws at that moment.  Also, it sounds to me like this car *was* on the shoulder and out of the way since he had pulled the guy over and was arresting him, it wasn't broken down and blocking traffic (what there was at 1am).  And really, does any of that matter?  Another a-hole driver, probably drunk, hit someone, a police officer at that.  Let's just thank God the officer (or anyone else) wasn't hurt worse or killed.57602159Flag this commentlonestar245 said on December 19, 2010 at 10:09 AMNo disrespect to the officer, but why did the new Texas law requiring motorist to slow 20mph below the posted speed when passing an emergency vehicle not protect the officer? Because it is a stupid law!  What the new law should have required- in addition to what was passed- is that any vehicle that is able to move under its own power exit the freeway and pull over on the service road, a side street or parking lot, far away from the freeway. This officer would not be in the hospital if this was the law.  In addition, freeways would not be tied up during rush hour with officers writing speeding tickets, or investigating fender benders.  All patrol cars have push bars, so they could push the disabled vehicles off the freeway as well, protecting all parties from the random, speeding, drunk drivers on the freeway.57599434Flag this commentPrevious 15 Comments12Sign OutProfileMobileRSS FeedsSpecial OffersNewslettersTwitterFacebookCrime VideoArizona congresswoman still sedated after assassin's attack Lawmakers, aides urged to take safety precautions  Funeral for Arlington shooting victim Kimberly Carter Reaction to Rep.
