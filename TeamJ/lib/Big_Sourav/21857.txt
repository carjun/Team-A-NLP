Protests are rare in Tunisia, which has been run for 23 years by President Ben Ali and works closely with Western governments to combat al Qaeda militants, but have been gathering force in recent weeks. The Tunis protest on Monday followed the deadly shooting by police of a jobless graduate in Bouziane, south of Tunis, last Friday. Around 1,000 people took part in the demonstration, called by independent trade union activists.
