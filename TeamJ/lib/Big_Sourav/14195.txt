The team is led and coached by Shane Warne. The team's mascot is a lion named Moochu Singh [2]. The team anthem, 'Halla Bol' is sung by Ila Arun[2]. The promotional video that aired on national networks before and during the first edition of the IPL was directed by Indrajit Nattoji of Blink Pictures. Leicestershire spinner Jeremy Snape signed on with the Rajasthan Royals as their high-performance coach and team psychologist. They became the champions of the inaugural IPL tournament in 2008. The IPL has terminated the agreement with Rajasthan Royals on 10th October 2010 along with Kings Punjab for violations in agreement and breach of contract on the part of the franchise. BCCI president Shashank Manohar made clear that this expulsion is permanent and owners would not be given second chance. [3] Despite this statement the BCCI lost court cases against the Royals and decided to stop legal action and allowed them to participate in IPL 2011 along with Kings XI Punjab[4]Contents1 Franchise History1.1 2008 IPL Season1.2 2009 IPL Season1.3 2010 IPL Season2 Players3 Expulsion From the IPL & Return (2010)4 Captains of Rajasthan Royals5 Administration6 Fixtures and results6.1 Overall results6.2 2008 season6.3 2009 season7 2010 season8 References9 External links[edit] Franchise HistoryThe Rajasthan Royals franchise is owned and chaired by Manoj Badale. Other investors include Lachlan Murdoch, Aditya S Chellaram and Suresh Chellaram. The Group acquired the franchise for $67 million. Incidentally, this was the least expensive franchise in the Indian Premier League and probably the least fancied team in the league at the beginning of the tournament. Bollywood actress and Celebrity Big Brother winner Shilpa Shetty and her business partner (now husband) Raj Kundra paid approximately US $15.4 million for a 11.7% stake before the start of IPL 2 in early 2009, therefore valuing the team at $130 million.[5]It made a pre-tax profit of $7.5 million in 2009. [1][edit] 2008 IPL SeasonPrior to the start of the inaugural IPL season, many considered the Royals as possibly the weakest team in the IPL, giving them little chance of competing well in the tournament.[6] Evidence of the latter opinion seemed to be confirmed when the team lost its first match against the Delhi Daredevils in a 9 wicket loss.[7] However the Royals won their next game by defeating the Kings XI Punjab and continued to win the next five games in a row. The Royals built up an impressive 11-3 record after their fourteen premilinary round matches; this included a consecutive 5-game and 6-game winning streak with an undefeated record on their home ground and a spot at the top of the points table. They were also the first team to book a place in the semifinals with their 65 run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore. Shane Warne's captaincy and simultaneous coaching was praised and well received by everyone,[8][9] including opposition teams.[10] In addition, many players of the Royals team had consistently played well. The Royals secured a place in the finals with a victory against the Delhi Daredevils.The Rajasthan Royals became the winner of the first IPL tournament, when they defeated the Chennai Super Kings by 3 wickets in the final played on 1 June 2008. With the scores level with one ball remaining, Sohail Tanvir scored the winning run and therefore prevented the match from being decided on a bowl out.[11]Each player and representative on the team was awarded a medal and the team was presented with the DLF Indian Premier League trophy along with a cheque for US$ 1.2 million prize money. Many of the Royals' players also took home individual awards for their performance during the tournament; Yusuf Pathan claimed the Man of the Match award for the final match, Sohail Tanvir finished the tournament in possession of the Purple Cap (the IPL's leading wicket taker) and Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was declared the Man of the Series.[edit] 2009 IPL SeasonThe Royals did not have a good start during the 2009 season. In their opening game against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who were second last in 2008, the Royals obtained the lowest score in the tournaments history. Rajasthan started to gain momentum slowly with Yusuf Pathan's explosive performances in victories against Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils giving hope to the Royals and their fans. However, inconsistency became a major factor; much was expected of South African captain Graeme Smith who was playing in front of his home crowd and who in last season's scored 441 runs, he together with Swapnil Asnodkar were not able to string together strong consistent performances. The absence of previous year's stars Sohail Tanvir and Shane Watson was also a major factor. Tanvir was not eligible in this season due to the political strain between India and Pakistan, and Watson was called up to play for Australia in the series against Pakistan in the UAE. Many also considered the sending of Mohammad Kaif back to India a poor decision as his batting could have contributed to the team's batting performance. The Royals failed to make it to the semifinals after losing their last two matches against Delhi Daredevils and Kolkata Knight Riders.[edit] 2010 IPL SeasonRajasthan started the season looking to emulate their success in 2008 but suffered a three game losing streak at the start of the tournament. They bounced back well with a four game winning streak but they were knocked out after a defeat against the Kolkata Knight Riders in their final game of the third season of the IPL.[edit] PlayersRajasthan Royals were the least active franchise during the players auction. The team didn't have a designated icon player, which saved a lot of cap space for the franchise. However the franchise was surprisingly low key during the auction, and in the end got penalized by the IPL committee for failing to meet the minimum bidding criteria of $3.3 million.[12] The highest bid by Rajasthan Royals was for the Indian middle order batsman Mohammad Kaif, who came off the board at $675,000. Shane Warne was named the coach and the captain of the side. The Royals were unique during the 2008 season as they were the only side to have an English cricketer in their squad, Hampshire's all rounder Dimitri Mascarenhas who only played one match, against the Delhi Daredevils in Jaipur on 11 May, before returning back to England. The Rajasthan Royals also selected Justin Langer and Morne Morkel in the player auction, but both declined to instead play county cricket.[13][14] In 2009 Season the team has cut down six Indian players from the previous years squad. They are batsman Mohammad Kaif and other relatively unknowns Dinesh Salunkhe, Anup Revandkar, Srideep Mangela, Ashraf Makda and Azhar Malik.[15]This article documents a current event.

The expulsion baffled captain Shane Warne who stated that he suspected that their might be some foul play and that the BCCI might possess some ulterior motives. [16] The Rajasthan Royals have however filed an appeal against the decision and the two parties will go to the Mumbai High Court to decide [17] The Mumbai high-court adjourned that case until 29th October 2010. [18] Both parties then agreed to adjourn the case again to November 15th because they didn't want it to coincide with diwali celebrations from November 1 to 14 [19] Later it was announced by the Royals that they told the Bombay High court that they would be negotiating with an arbitrator to see if they could reconcile with the IPL [20] The artibrator announced that while the investigation was ongoing the Royals would remain apart of the IPL for six-weeks and the BCCI would not be allowed to change rules which might go against the Royals. The six-week period included the player auction in which it's expected that the Royals will participate [21] After this the Bombay High Court rejected the appeals of the BCCI against keeping the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL for six-weeks while the case was sorted out. [22] It was estimated because of the losses in court cases and damaging reputation the BCCI decided not to pursue any further legal action against Royals' or Kings XI Punjab and announced they decided to keep them in the IPL [23] The Royals announced that they had retained Shane Watson and Shane Warne before they go into the auction [24][edit] Captains of Rajasthan Royals1)Shane Warne P-43 W-23 L-18 N/R-12)Shane Watson P-1 W-0 L-1[edit] AdministrationOwners  Emerging Media, Shilpa Shetty, Raj KundraCEO  Manoj Badale[edit] Fixtures and results[edit] Overall resultsSummary of resultsWinsLossesNo Result% Win2008113079%200967143%2010*68043%Total2318155%[edit] 2008 seasonRajasthan Royals IPL FixturesNo.DateOpponentVenueResult119 April Delhi DaredevilsDelhiLost by 9 wickets221 April Kings XI PunjabJaipurWon by 6 wickets, MoM  Shane Watson  76* (49)324 April Deccan ChargersHyderabadWon by 3 wickets, MoM  Yusuf Pathan  2/20 (2 overs) and 61 (28)426 April Royal Challengers BangaloreBangaloreWon by 7 wickets, MoM  Shane Watson  2/20 (4 overs) and 61* (41)51 May Kolkata Knight RidersJaipurWon by 45 runs, MoM  Swapnil Asnodkar  60 (34)67 May Mumbai IndiansMumbaiLost by 7 Wickets1326 May Mumbai IndiansJaipurWon by 5 Wickets, MoM  Sohail Tanvir  4/14 (4 overs)1428 May Kings XI PunjabMohaliLost by 41 Runs1530 May Delhi Daredevils (Semi Final #1)MumbaiWon by 105 runs, MoM  Shane Watson  52 (29) and 3/10 (3 overs)161 June Chennai Super Kings (Final)Navi MumbaiWon by 3 wickets,MoM  Yusuf Pathan  56 and 3/22 (4 overs), MoS  Shane Watson  472 runs and 17 wickets, Purple Cap Holder - Sohail TanvirThe Royals won the inaugural DLF IPL T-20 Tournament on 01/06/2008.[edit] 2009 seasonRajasthan Royals IPL FixturesNo.DateOpponentVenueResult118 April Royal Challengers BangaloreCape TownLost by 75 runs221 April Mumbai IndiansDurbanMatch called off after intermittent rain323 April Kolkata Knight RidersCape TownWon (In The Superover), MoM -  Yusuf Pathan 42 (21), 18* (4) In The Superover426 April Kings XI PunjabCape TownLost by 27 runs528 April Delhi DaredevilsPretoriaWon by 5 wickets MoM -  Yusuf Pathan 62* (30)630 April Chennai Super KingsPretoriaLost by 38 runs72 May Deccan ChargersPort ElizabethWon by 3 wickets MoM -  Yusuf Pathan 24(17),1/1985 May Kings XI PunjabDurbanWon by 78 Runs, MoM -  Graeme Smith 77(44)97 May Royal Challengers BangalorePretoriaWon by 7 wickets, MoM -  Amit Singh 4/19109 May Chennai Super KingsKimberleyLost by 7 wickets1111 May Deccan ChargersKimberleyLost by 53 runs1214 May Mumbai IndiansDurbanWon by 2 Runs, MoM -  Shane Warne 3/24(4 overs)1317 May Delhi DaredevilsBloemfonteinLost by 14 runs1420 May Kolkata Knight RidersDurbanLost by 4 wickets[edit] 2010 seasonRajasthan Royals IPL FixturesNo.DateOpponentVenueResult113 March Mumbai IndiansMumbaiLost by 4 runs, MoM -  Yusuf Pathan 100 (37)215 March Delhi DaredevilsAhmedabadLost by 6 wickets318 March Royal Challengers BangaloreBangaloreLost by 10 wickets420 March Kolkata Knight RidersAhmedabadWon by 34 runs, MoM -  Abhishek Jhunjhunwala 45(36)524 March Kings XI PunjabMohaliWon by 31 runs, MoM -  Adam Voges 45 (24)626 March Deccan ChargersAhmedabadWon by 8 wickets, MoM -  Yusuf Pathan 73 (34)728 March Chennai Super KingsAhmedabadWon by 17 runs, MoM -  Naman Ojha 80 (49)831 March Delhi DaredevilsDelhiLost by 67 runs93 April Chennai Super KingsChennaiLost by 23 runs105 April Deccan ChargersNagpurWon by 2 runs, MoM -  Shane Warne 4/21117 April Kings XI PunjabJaipurWon by 9 wickets, MoM -  Michael Lumb 83 (43)1211 April Mumbai IndiansJaipurLost by 37 runs1314 April Royal Challengers BangaloreJaipurLost by 5 wickets1417 April Kolkata Knight RidersKolkataLost by 8 wickets[edit] References^ Cricinfo - Kepler Wessels to coach Chennai Super Kings^ a b Rajasthan Royals launch party^ "No question of revoking expulsion of Rajasthan Royals". cricket.rediff.com. http://cricket.rediff.com/report/2010/oct/18/no-question-of-revoking-expulsion-of-rajasthan-royals-manohar.htm.
