It is the result of a lot of excellent work and resourcefulness on the part of many DUers. It's the most up-to-date and comprehensive collection that I've been able to assemble. This is by no means the last word. This collection is an evolving work, as new resources are needed and discovered. If you find some new, relevant info, by all means add it in! The purpose for this is to have everything we need for emailing, faxing, phoning, and snail mailing purposes - all easily located in ONE master thread. From time to time, I've added a few choice comments and testimonials from other DUers regarding the critical importance of making your opinions known to the media and to policy makers and others in positions of influence or leadership, for motivational purposes. Please note, this thread is NEW AND IMPROVED, and is meant to REPLACE earlier similar threads.After all...IF THEY THINK WE DON'T CARE, THEY WON'T, EITHER!!Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDUERS: THE FIVE-STAR ACTIVISTS' RESOURCE THREAD, UPDATED 7/9/04calimaryJul-09-04 12:36 PM#0Part One: The Original ListcalimaryJul-09-04 12:39 PM#1hi calimary! just a quick repair usa today feedback link:nofurylikeAug-01-04 04:33 PM#37Deleted messageName removedNov-11-04 11:56 AM#96Deleted messageName removedNov-11-04 01:37 PM#97Part One, FIRST ADD: Look what Maraya1969 found (I wanted this up top)calimaryJun-07-05 08:23 AM#127Sent letter to my Rep's/Senators, Face the Nation CNNAuntiBushJul-01-05 04:18 PM#136Smother Big Brother, use this in your signature file!doohickeyAug-25-06 09:35 PM#168find your SENATORS senate.govjarnocanJun-19-06 09:09 AM#164How about a list of ammo providers?alvarezadamsJul-20-06 01:34 PM#167USE THIS: stand up and fight against McCain lies!UnitedWeStand33Nov-02-08 04:09 PM#195Part  Two: The anarchy1999 list - media companies and peoplecalimaryJul-09-04 12:41 PM#2Part  Three: "Editor & Publisher" listcalimaryJul-09-04 12:43 PM#3Part Four: The maggrwaggr collectioncalimaryJul-09-04 12:44 PM#4Part Five: UN Contact InfocalimaryJul-09-04 12:45 PM#5Part Six: House and Senate Contact Info:calimaryJul-09-04 12:46 PM#6some fixesbigtreeJul-11-05 07:12 AM#146Part Seven: The misanthrope collectioncalimaryJul-09-04 12:48 PM#7Parrt Eight: Disney infocalimaryJul-09-04 12:49 PM#8Most management at Disney can be contacted via email using theLorienAug-19-05 10:07 PM#152NOTE: UPDATED 9/7/06, see Part Sixty below.calimarySep-08-06 12:06 AM#170Part Nine: Theater contactscalimaryJul-09-04 12:51 PM#9I'm busy copying/pasting all of this: Then format...AuntiBushJul-01-05 04:30 PM#137Part  Ten: Quick and EasycalimaryJul-09-04 12:52 PM#10Part Ten: First Add (thank you, Pallas180)calimaryJul-11-04 04:25 PM#13Part Eleven: California governmentcalimaryJul-10-04 12:16 AM#11From DUer Bleachers7 - NEW YORK DAILY NEWS INFOcalimaryJul-10-04 12:18 AM#12Part Twelve: Senate Intelligence Committee InfocalimaryJul-15-04 12:37 PM#14Part Thirteen: Slim-fast Contact Info:calimaryJul-15-04 12:39 PM#15And don't forget 1 800 SLIM-FAST.calimaryJul-15-04 11:44 PM#18Part Fourteen: How to send SAFE SNAIL MAILcalimaryJul-15-04 12:42 PM#16Part Fifteen: Why Answer Those Pesky, Biased, Conservative Emails:calimaryJul-15-04 01:08 PM#17make your rebuttal countfrankieAug-06-04 02:24 PM#49This fantastic, Mary , ThanksCapn SunshineJul-18-04 01:37 PM#19yesyesyesssssssss!buycitgoJul-18-04 07:32 PM#20Thanks so much, Calimary.KukesaJul-21-04 09:00 AM#21Part Sixteen: VITAL, EXCELLENT - Military Families Speak Out and more:calimaryJul-21-04 11:41 AM#22Addition:Cookie wookieJul-02-05 01:56 PM#142Part Seventeen: Joseph Wilson Contact Info:calimaryJul-21-04 04:44 PM#23Part Eighteen: Clear Channel Communications Info:calimaryJul-21-04 06:23 PM#24Part Nineteen: Congressional Black Caucus info - July, 2004:calimaryJul-22-04 07:38 PM#25Can we do anything else next month?WinterStormJul-25-04 03:04 AM#26Part Twenty: Cable "News" Channels CONTACT LIST:calimaryJul-26-04 07:36 PM#27FAUX kickKeirseyJul-30-04 07:14 PM#28Thank you thank you thank you, and more, calimary!
