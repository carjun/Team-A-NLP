Thelast thing we want to think about is changing. Yet, New Year is just around thecorner, ready to receive our plans, intentions and ideas for change. There isalways this sinking feeling when we talk about change. We dont like change, welike things as they are.  Not many of us liketo be told to change. This can be intimidating, upsetting and downrightpatronising. We have the right intentions. We should really be making plans butthere is always tomorrow, next week , next month or even next year. Same asthere was last year!Docmo's Health HubsTell me What it isThe process of diagnosis is at the heart of practising medicine. The patient consults the clinician with symptoms that are abnormal or perceived as abnormal. The clinician takes a careful history, evaluates...Message, message everywhere!We are bombarded by messages to change. These come from ourloving family, our well meaning friends, Health professionals, Media and from the Governmentitself. Everywhere we look there are messages telling us not to drink too much,not to eat too much and not to smoke at all. We know these mean well. But why is it so hard to follow them? What are the barriers and hurdles that we have in receiving such messages?Firstly these are external. We have no control or ownership on them. We feel we arebeingnagged incessantly. IT becomes white noise, lost in reception. We may get angry and annoyed. We feellikea little child who wants tobenaughtyjustto be spiteful. We don't wanttobe told what to do. We are our own masters. thank you, very much. Good vs. EvilDocmo's Health HubsCoping with Chronic PainWe have all had pain, admittedly some more than others. (I put that in for the women readers muttering, you men have no idea). Sometimes it is mild, sometimes it is unbearable. Some are short lived and...Denial and Confusion?Yet it is hard. There is that part of the brain that makes itall look so hard. Its the same part of the brain that has all the excuses writtenand ready.  I am too busy. Ive got toomuch on. I have a lot of people to look after. My work is too hard. Im alwaystired. I enjoy this too much. I am too stressed. I dont believe in the thingsthey say. We've all got an aunty who smoked till she was 90 and she was fine. We've all have a distant uncle or a Grandpa who was a big drinker yet never suffered any ailments.We'veheard them all. These are strong narratives that stop s fromdoingthe right thing. Our change resistant brain doesn't want tounderstandthat there areexceptionsto the rule. There'll always be people who look like they can get away withcertainhabits - butcanwe take the chance. Do we like playing Russian roulette?The health messages dont make it easy. The media keeps pickingon conflicting messages to show how science can be misleading and can get thingswrong. The science and research can sound confusing and the media and theinternetpick upthisconfusion and make it look a lot worse. This makes it look like the messages areunreliable. This makes our change- avoiding, addictive brain happy. It says, See, Itold you, they dont know what theyre talking about. Positive visioningPositive VisioningWe do know we have to change because our bodies are constantlychanging and being affected by the things we do. We want to be healthy, to bethere to enjoy the fruits of our working life. We want to do the things wevealways planned to do; spend time with children, travel, indulge in that hobbyweve secretly nurtured, visit family and friends in faraway places. We needthe strength and energy to do all this. We want not to be ill.One strategy that helps is positive visioning. We needtovisualisewhat it would be like to be fitter, healthier. We needtoavoid thinking in double -negatives- ' I don't want to be ill' hasnotgot the same impact as ' I wanttobe healthy'.We need to visualise strongly the benefits of healthylivingin specific,measurableterms- money saved, time saved, looks maintained, energy generated, benefits socially and at work.. etc. personal commandmentsDocmo's Health Hubs'Worried Well' and the 'Deniers'Some of us think that we are sicker than we really are. We may misread natural symptoms in our body as indicative of disease. It can be a frustrating journey to the person and their Doctor, often resulting in...Broad Aims, Specific GoalsTo start with we need to agree on our aims. We need to sign a contract with ourselves that we have collectively agreed with our addictive part of the brain that we own our aims. these aims can be simple yet clear. There should be no confusion or subversion.Never mind the external messages, we need internal messages that inform our vision. We need our own personal commandments.I am going to eat sensibly so that I can maintain/lose weight ( or gain, if you are underweight) I am going to drink in measured fashion so I can enjoy my drink socially and healthilyI am going to ensure my physical fitness is in peak conditionI am going to spend more time with the familyI am going to maintain a healthy work life balance Goal settingWellness Coaching for Lasting Lifestyle ChangeAmazon Price: $17.79List Price: $29.95Take Charge of Parkinson's Disease: Dynamic Lifestyle Changes to Put YOU in the Driver's Seat (A DiaMedica Guide to Optimum Wellness)Amazon Price: $8.03List Price: $14.95The Ultimate Collection Of Tips For  Bringing Down The Deadly Cholesterol: Health Tips For Diet, Lifestyle Changes, Medication And Natural Remedies To ...

First we need to be aware there is a problem. If we live indenial, we cannot change. Then we need to look at the scale of the problem. Isit early or is it approaching a crisis? Is it a preventive strategy or do weneed to act quicker: for example someone diagnosed with heart problem,Diabetes, or arthritis needs a much more immediate plan than someone not yetdiagnosed.We need to accept that change is needed. It should come fromwithin. We should do it for us. This is called ownership- we need to own the problemand the solutions. If we do it for others, however strong willed we are, itwill weaken at moments of despair.However, there always other factors. We need to look at what stage of change we are at ( or the persons we are trying to help change are at). There are different stages of change readiness. stages of changeSMART Goal settingAttitudes, Beliefs & ValuesAttitudes, Beliefs and Values'The power of Knowledge to organise, select, learn and judge comes from values and beliefs as much as, and probably more than, from information and logic' -Thomas Davenport...Word PowerEvery Word Tells a Story #1: Atoms, Assassins and AsteroidsThere are over 1.5 million words in the English language and it grows every day.

We write because we have this mad passion to share our ideas, our stories, and our information with those whom we want to take the time and read our work. We are asking the...SMART OBJECTIVESSMART objectives are more helpful than vague ones. SMART is an acronym that meansSPECIFIC We need to make specific, measurable plans. Not vague ones. I will eat sensibly. Ill drink less. These are vague, unclear targets that have no specificity. We need to say I will cut down portion sizes by this much. I will stop snacking in between meals. I will stop drinking alcohol weekdays and alternate weekends.MEASURABLE We need to measure progress and keep reminding ourselves. We need to find alternate rewards. See, we do the things we do because it gives us pleasure. We need to find new ways of rewarding our brain so it doesnt lose the will. A measure of progress, weight lost, number of cigarettes we have reduced by, money saved, calories burnt they can all be kept in a diary and measured to give us a sense of achievement.ACHIEVABLE Often we fail because we aim too high ( although this is not always a problem) We need to look at what is first achievable and make this our primary target. Going for higher targets is great but if we have failed in our past attempts at changing perhaps its because we didn't address this.REALISTIC Objectives may need to be grounded in reality at least for managing personal change. We can dream high, have high ambitions. But when it comes to shedding a old habit and developing new habits, it may be better to have some realistic objectives. While a 40 a day smoker can dream of stopping cold turkey, it may be more realistic to cut down in incremental steps.TIMED We need to set clear dates to achieve things by. This gives us a schedule and a sense of urgency. If we time our objectives, they can forever get dragged and postponed. supportMost of all, we need support: family, friends and health professionals there are armies of support out there and they can help. They can pat us on the back, give positive feedback and makes us feel good.We can seek support via people who know and have helped manage change. We need to seek support and solace, but we need to be honest with those wh are tryign to help us.More importantly we need to honest with ourselves!As a wise man once said, the only thing constant, is change.It is not easy. But it can be done. When truly want to, wecanmove mountains. We can harness lightning. We can travel to the stars.Have a Wonderful Christmas and a very Happy New Year!Copyright  MohanKumar 2010PoetryChristmas Poem: Of all the GiftsOf all the gifts that Santa can bring Theres only one thatll make my heart sing Of all the stuff that make Sleigh Bells ring Theres only one thing, theres only...Poem: Sands of TimePoem: The SniperPoem: 'Tis the little things...Poem: Someone Kissed ...Poem: The BrookPoem: Someone Kissed ...Poem: My language flees me ( a sonnet)Poem: Lazy WandererPoem : The DeepPoem: My love is in knowingOther HubsHow to Create a Personnel Development Plan for performance reviewsCopyright Mohan Kumar 2011                        Any high performing organisation depends on continually identifying, developing and improving skills, knowledge and behaviours necessary for the  individual... - 2 days agoPoem: Fragments of a DreamFragments of a Dream stutter my sleep  Memories or myths buried so deep  Places Ive never been, Faces Ive never seen  Drift across in a luminous sheen      #     Who are you that haunts my... - 3 days agoJohn Dunning: Literary Mysteries for BookloversJohn Dunning I love books, old and new.
