Avondale :  AZ :  USA|Jan 09, 2011By sanain        1 0     Views: 344      April fool seems to have come earlier this year since there is a virulent rumor that Facebook will be shutting down on 15th March because the social networking site has gone out of control. Facebook shutting down forever is yet another internet hoax that has been haunting Facebook users who find it difficult to survive without updating status, having no memes and no Farmville. The rumor was initiated by Weekly World News that stated the founder Mark ZuckerbergMark Zuckerberg wants his old life back since managing the ever expanding social networking site has become too stressful for the youngest billionaire of the world. Keeping in view the past record of Weekly World News, the credibility of the news seems minimal. Weekly World News also started the rumor that Michelle Obama is pregnant and Michael JacksonMichael Jackson was seen on the moon. There has been no response from Mark Zuckerberg regarding the shutting down of Facebook, and no announcement on the official website of Facebook can be found.        1 of 32         facebook Weekly World News      sanain is based in New York City, New York, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (69.8%) Canada (5.3%) United Kingdom (3.8%) Lithuania (2.3%) 27 other countries (16.6%)           READ MORE: facebook closing down, facebook closing down march 15, is facebook shutting down, is facebook shutting down in march, facebook getting shut down, facebook march 15, facebook shutting down, Technology Internet, technology-news, Avondale, Michael Jackson, Mark Zuckerberg, Michelle Obama, facebook, FarmVille, World Wide Web, Social network service, Online social networking, internet meme, Social information processing, weekly world, human interest, facebook shutting down facebook closing   More News From: Avondale :  AZ :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Is Facebook Shutting Down?
