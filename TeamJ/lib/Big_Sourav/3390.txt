Birgeneau, has come under fire from conservative commentators over remarks he has made linking the shootings in Tucson tothe failure of the Dream Act and the passage of Arizona's immigration law. On Monday, Birgeneau sent acampus-wide emailcalling on the university community to..... stop and ponder the climate in which such an act can be contemplated, even by a mind that is profoundly disturbed.A climate in which demonization of others goes unchallenged and hateful speech is tolerated can lead to such a tragedy. I believe that it is not a coincidence that this calamity has occurred in a state which has legislated discrimination against undocumented persons. This same mean-spirited xenophobia played a major role in thedefeat of the Dream Actby legislators in Washington, leaving many exceptionally talented and deserving young people, including our own undocumented students, painfully in limbo with regard to their futures in this country.An article in the January 12thChronicle of Higher Educationdescribes some of the criticism that Birgeneau has received:Adam Kissel of the Foundation for Individual Rights in EducationcalledMr. Birgeneau's message "very ill-considered." And a frequent conservative critic of higher education, the David Horowitz Freedom Center, posted a blog entry entitled "Genius California Educator Explains the Arizona Shooting." It was a mystery why Mr. Birgeneau would weigh in on the tragedy,wrotethe post's author, Diane Schrader, but "I hope the taxpayers of California kick up a stink over this blowhard's abuse of his authority."TheChronicle of Higher Educationalso notes that the chancellor's comments 'come at a politically sensitive time for the university. California's new governor, Jerry Brown, proposed a$500-million cutin state support for the university on Monday,' with lawmakers planning to hold hearings on the budget in the coming months.Birgeneau's words have resonated deeply in me. I wrote recently about how, had my grandparents sought to emigrate now, they would have been considered 'illegal alien invaders' whohad just come to the US to have a few 'anchor babies' to claim 'birthright citizenship.' I couldn't help but notice the vitriolic tone to some of the responses tomy post, including some that said my relatives and I should all be in jail. 'Mean-spirited xenophobia' indeed exists in our country: So much for being a nation of immigrants who opens its shores to the poor, the tired and the 'huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'I commend Birgeneau for his email and for calling for a climate of 'equity and inclusion' on the UC campuses and beyond---a climate that all colleges and communities across the country should strive to create.After the Tucson shootings, colleges will be scrutinizing their policies and protocols regardingmental healthand disciplinary issues in students. Pima Community College, where Jared Lee Loughner was a student for five years until his suspension last September, has already come under such scrutiny. The college had documented numerous reports (totaling 51 pages of confidential police documents) about Loughner'sbizarre and disturbing behavior, including a 'bizarre posting on YouTube linking the college to genocide and the torture of students' (more detailsin today'sNew York Times). Perhaps, too, colleges and universities need to take a hard look at whether or not their campus fosters an atmosphere of tolerance and equity andthe kind of dialogue Birgeneau talks about.Birgeneau's email ends with a call to work together, to 'work toward a climate of equity and inclusion for all':We must be vigilant to condemn hate speech and acts of vandalism on our campuses by those wanting to promote enmity. We must work to support dialogue about our differences and eschew expressions of demonization of others, including virulent attacks on Israel, anti-Muslim graffiti, racism towards African-Americans, Chicano/Latinos and other underrepresented minority groups, and homophobic acts. Continuing to support our principles of community will ensure a better and safer campus. We must do this now so that our students, as future leaders of this great country, will continue to set the standard for a better and safer nation.I would also like to say that supporting such 'principles of community' will help to create a better and safer world. A community that constantly requires its members to dialogue and communicate with each other about differences, disagreements, and conflict is essential to create a 'climate of equity and inclusion for all.'Previous Care2 postsAfter DREAM Act Defeat, Advocates Fight for Educational EqualityWhat Now For the DREAM Act?My Grandparents Were 'Illegal Alien Invaders'Anti-Immigrants Want Tiered Birth Certificates            Read more:                            college,                            politics,                            education,                            immigration,                            citizenship,                            Birthright,                            illegal immigrants,                            14th amendment,                            anchor babies,                            illegal alien,                            tucson shooting,                            jared loeghner comments20 commentsadd your commentPast Member  saysJan 14, 2011  9:03 AMChancellor Birgeneau, Thank you for a thoughtful, reasoned essay.You gave me hope that reason might once again become the norm not the exception send green starwhy is this inappropriate?submitcancelSubmitting...Your report of abuse has been received and will be reviewed.The response report you have submitted was unable to transmit.

Over the years I have come to regard myself, not as American, but as Californian, precisely because of the Rush Limbaughs and the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and all the other extreme Rightists who base all they do on hate.  Hate immigrants, hate Democrats.

It reasons out that if there were NO ILLEGAL immigration, the shooting would NOT have happened.The solution is OBEY and ENFORCE U.S. LAW, 'especially' U.S. Immigrtion LAW, which just happens to be some of the easiest and fairest immigration laws in the world.send green starwhy is this inappropriate?submitcancelSubmitting...Your report of abuse has been received and will be reviewed.The response report you have submitted was unable to transmit.
