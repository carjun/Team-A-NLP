XVI).The origin of the "$" sign has been variously accounted for. The most commonly held theory is that it derives from the Spanish coat of arms engraved on the Spanish colonial silver coins, the "Real de a ocho" or Spanish dollars that were in circulation in the Spanish colonies in America and Asia. The Spanish dollars were also legal tender in the English colonies in North America, which later became part of the U.S. and Canada.In 1492, King Ferdinand II of Aragon adopted the symbol of the Pillars of Hercules and added the Latin phrase Non Plus Ultra meaning "no further", indicating "this is the end of the (known) world." But when Christopher Columbus discovered America, the legend was changed to "Plus Ultra", "beyond."Spain's coat of armsThe symbol was adopted by Charles V and was part of his coat of arms representing Spain's American possessions. The symbol was later stamped on coins minted in gold and silver. These coins, depicting the Pillars of Hercules over two hemispheres and a small "S"-shaped ribbon around each, were spread throughout America, Europe and Asia. For the sake of simplicity, traders wrote signs that, instead of saying dollar or peso, had this symbol made by hand, and this in turn evolved into a simple S with two vertical bars.[3]There's another, better documented, explanation that states that the sign is the result of the evolution of the Spanish and Mexican scribal abbreviation "ps" for pesos. This theory, derived from a study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century manuscripts, explains that the s gradually came to be written over the p developing a close equivalent to the "$" mark."[4][5][6][7][edit] Alternative hypothesesThere are a number of other theories about the origin of the symbol, some with a measure of academic acceptance, others the symbolic equivalent of folk etymologies.[8][edit] Drawn with one vertical line ($)[edit] Slash 8That the dollar sign is derived from a slash through the numeral eight, denoting pieces of eight. The Oxford English Dictionary before 1963 held that this was the most probable explanation, though later editions have placed it in doubt.[edit] Potosi mint markImage of 1768 Spanish Colonial Real silver coin, showing PTSI mint mark in lower right and left quadrants and the Pillars of Hercules surrounding a picture of the world.That the dollar sign was derived from or inspired by the mint mark on the Spanish pieces of eight that were minted in Potos (in present day Bolivia). The mint mark, composed of the letters "PTSI" superimposed, bears a strong resemblance to the single-stroke dollar sign (see photo). The mark, which appeared on silver coins minted from 1573 to 1825 in Potos, the largest mint during the colonial period, would have been widely recognized throughout the North American colonies.[citation needed][edit] Alchemic sigil for cinnabarAn alchemic sigil for cinnabar dating at least as far back as the early eighteenth century. [9][edit] Greek mythologyThat the dollar sign may have also originated from Hermes, the Greek god of bankers, thieves, messengers, and tricksters: Besides the crane, one of his symbols was the caduceus, a staff from which ribbons or snakes dangled in a sinuous curve.[citation needed][edit] Drawn with two vertical lines[edit] From "US"That $ is a monogram of U. S., used on money bags issued by the United States Mint. The letters U and S superimposed resemble the historical double stroke dollar sign : the bottom of the 'U' disappears into the bottom curve of the 'S', leaving two vertical lines. This theory does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the United States.[10]The book Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand includes a section where the main characters philosophize about the United States being the only nation to ever use its own monogram for its currency symbol. They suggest it means that the country had always been primarily concerned with the creation of wealth.[edit] "Unit of silver"That it derives from "unit of silver", each unit being one "bit" of the "pieces of eight". Before the American Revolution, prices were often quoted in units of the Spanish dollar. According to this theory, when a price was quoted the capital 'S' was used to indicate silver with a capital 'U' written on top to indicate units. Eventually the capital 'U' was replaced by double vertical hash marks.[citation needed][edit] German ThalerThat it derives from the symbol used on a German Thaler. According to Ovason (2004), on one type of thaler one side showed the crucified Christ while the other showed a serpent hanging from a cross, the letters NU near the serpent's head, and on the other side of the cross the number 21. This refers to the Bible, Numbers, Chapter 21 (see Nehushtan).[citation needed][edit] Roman sestertiusThat the dollar sign goes back to the most important Roman coin, the sestertius, which had the letters 'HS' as its currency sign. When superimposed these letters form a dollar sign with two vertical strokes (the horizontal line of the 'H' merging into the 'S').[edit] Later historyAccording to a plaque in St Andrews, Scotland, the dollar sign was first cast into type at a foundry in Philadelphia, United States in 1797 by the Scottish immigrant John Baine.The plaque in St. Andrews.The dollar sign did not appear on U.S. coinage until February 2007,[citation needed] when it was used on the reverse of a $1 coin authorized by the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005.[11]The dollar sign appears on the reverse of the 1934 $100,000 note as well as the reverse of the 1917 $1 note.[citation needed][edit] Use in computer softwareThe symbol "$" has Unicode code point U+0024 (inherited from Latin-1).As the dollar sign is one of the few symbols that is, on one hand, almost universally present in computer character sets, but, on the other hand, rarely needed in their literal meaning within computer software, the $ character has been used on computers for many purposes unrelated to money.[12] Its uses in programming languages have often influenced or provoked its uses in operating systems, and applications.[edit] Programming languages$ was used for defining string variables in older versions of the BASIC language ("$" was often pronounced "string" instead of "dollar" in this use).[12]$ is used for defining hexadecimal constants in Pascal-like languages such as Delphi, and in some variants of assembly language.[12]$ is used at the starts of names to define variables in the PHP language and the AutoIt automation script language, scalar variables in the Perl language (see sigil (computer programming)), and global variables in the Ruby language.[12]In most shell scripting languages, $ is used for interpolating environment variables, special variables, arithmetic computations and special characters, and for performing translation of localised strings.[12]$ is used in the ALGOL 68 language to delimit transput format regions.$ is used in the TeX typesetting language to delimit mathematical regions.[12]Formulas in spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel) use $ to denote an absolute cell reference.[12]In many versions of FORTRAN 66, $ could be used as an alternative to a quotation mark for delimiting strings.[12]In PL/M, $ can be used to put a visible separation between syllables of identifiers. For example, 'Some$Name' refers to the same thing as 'SomeName'.[12]In Haskell, $ is used as a function application operator.[12]In several JavaScript frameworks starting with Prototype.js and also popular in jQuery, $ is a common utility class.[edit] Operating systemsIn CP/M and subsequently in all versions of DOS (86-DOS, MS-DOS, PC-DOS, more) and derivatives, $ is used as a string terminator (Int 21h with AH=09h).[12]$ is used by the prompt command to insert special sequences into the DOS command prompt string.[12]In Microsoft Windows, $ is used at the end of the share name to hide a shared folder. For example, \\server\share is accessible and visible through browsing, while \\server\share$ is accessible only by explicit reference.[12]In Unix-like systems the $ is often part of the command prompt, depending on the user's shell and environment settings. For example, the default environment settings for the bash shell specify $ as part of the command prompt.The using history expansion !$ (same as !!1$ and !-1$) means the last argument of the previous command in bash, !-2$ expands to the last argument of the penultimate command, !5$ expands into the last argument of the fifth command and so on. For example:> touch my_first_file> echo "This is my file." > !$where !$ expands into my_first_file.In the LDAP directory access protocol, $ is used as a line separator in various standard entry attributes such as postalAddress.[12][edit] Applications$ signifies the end of a line or the file in text editors ed, ex, vi, pico and derivatives, and, as a result:[12]$ matches the end of a line or string in sed, grep, and POSIX and Perl regular expressions.[12][edit] Currencies that use the dollar or peso signMain articles: Dollar and PesoIn addition to those countries of the world that use dollars or pesos, a number of other countries use the $ symbol to denote their currencies, including:Nicaraguan crdoba (usually written as C$)Tongan paangaAn exception is the Philippine peso, whose sign is written as .Some currencies use the cifro , similar to the dollar sign, but always with two strokes:Brazilian realCape Verde escudoChilean pesoPortuguese escudo (defunct)The cifro is also used to account for over 130,000,000 domestic standard US Mint (1986+) bullion US silver dollars as one dollar per one troy ounce fine (99.9%), thereby avoiding confusion with debased US trade dollar-denominated tokens and Federal Reserve notes.[citation needed]In Mexico and another peso-using countries, the cifro is used as a dollar sign when a document uses pesos and dollars at the same time, to avoid confusions, but, when it used alone, usually is represented as US $ (United States dollars). Example: US $5 (five US dollars).[citation needed]In the United States, Mexico and English-speaking Canada, the dollar or peso symbol precedes the number, unlike almost all other units. Five dollars or pesos is written and printed as $5, whereas five cents is written as 5.[edit] See alsoEuro signIndian Rupee signPound signYen sign[edit] References^ Lawrence Kinnaird (July 1976).
