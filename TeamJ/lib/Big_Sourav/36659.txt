Jan Brewers office is confirming federal judge John Roll[nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in 1991 by Pres. Geo. H.W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1991] was among the dead.Sheriffs authorities said there were six dead, including a child, as well as 18 wounded.Giffords, who is in critical condition, is out of surgery at University Medical Center, said Dr. Peter Rhee at University Medical Center.The shooting occurred at a Safeway supermarket where Giffords was holding one of her regular Congress on Your Corner events, which allows her to speak directly with constituents in her district.The gunman has been identified as 22-year-old Jared Loughner, according to the Associated Press.Giffords has held several events since first taking office in January 2007. At one such event in 2009, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell on the supermarket floor.This was her first event since her re-election to a third term in November.Giffords, 40, was talking to a couple in the store when a gunman rushed her, shouting as he fired his weapon.The gunman fired at people in line and got within 4 to 5 feet of the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a former Tucson newspaper executive who is now on her staff.The gunman fired at Giffords then ran out, continuing to shoot.Members of Giffords staff were among the wounded. District director Ron Barber remained in surgery, but his life was not expected to be in danger.Individuals at the event tackled the man after the shooting, said Pima County Sheriffs Department Bureau Chief Richard Kastigar.Last March, Giffords Tucson office was vandalized after the House vote overhauling the nations health care system.Giffords had just started the congressional session. She tweeted welcomes to new Republican congressman David Schweikert and had just sponsored legislation, with Republican Congressman Ron Paul, to cut congressional salaries.U.S. Congressman Raul Grijalva, Giffords seatmate from Southern Arizona, said, Its horrific. Its heartbreaking. Its very frightening. I hope she comes out of it. This is not what public service is all about.The heated rhetoric and civil discord creates an environment for something like this to happen.He lamented a series of incidents demonstrating the buildup that leads to something like this, including envelope of white powder sent to his Tucson office as well as a shot fired at his Yuma office.Gabbys contributions were all in the future. Her career was all in the future.Washington D.C. authorities have spoken with his staff to stay put.His family in Tucson now has security, but he doesnt know yet whether he will have a secret service detail in the future.***Backround from DSD.The gunman, who may have come from inside the Safeway, walked up and shot Giffords in the head first.Giffordss Tuscon constituency office was vandalised last March after she voted in favour of Barack Obamas controversial health bill, which has been bitterly opposed by the American right. Giffords had been named as a political campaign target for conservatives in Novembers elections by former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin for her strong support of Obamas reforms. Palin had published a target map on her website using images of gun sights to identify 20 House Democrats, including Giffords, for backing the new health care law. At an event in 2009 which was similar to the one Giffords was holding today, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell to the supermarket floor.Giffords, who was born in Tucson and has two children, took office in January 2007 supporting immigration control, embryonic stem-cell research and the right to abortion. While the motive for todays shooting was not immediately clear, Giffords was one of 10 Democrat members of Congress who were the subject of harassment over their support for the healthcare overhaul. Although a Democrat, Giffords was a strong supporter of the right to bear arms and was re-elected to her third term last November in congressional elections, edging out the Tea Party favourite Jesse Kelly.http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/08/gabrielle-giffords-shot-tucson-arizonaMore Backround for TPL and Daniel G..Quote by Timothy Peter Leal:She married Cmdr.

His hit Baker Street was earning him 80,000 a year more than 30 years after its release. (Photograph: Rex Features)The singer-songwriter Gerry Rafferty, whose songs such as Stuck in the Middle with You, Baker Street and Get it Right Next Time soundtracked the 1970s, has died aged 63 after a long illness.His family said he died at home peacefully with his daughter Martha this morning.The Scot was born in Paisley, near Glasgow, played withBilly Connollysfolk outfit the Humblebums, and co-founded the soft-rock group Stealers Wheel, before enjoying a successful solo career. Baker Street, released in 1978, was still netting him 80,000 a year more than 30 years later.Rafferty endured battles with the music industry  once taking three years to disentangle contracts  and a problem with alcohol.

Limit on Gases to Pose Risk to Obama and Congress..December 31, 2010jamesb101No commentsThis headline from the New York Times makes me smile..People have been complaining about green house gases and global warming.So the government does do something about it.Now that the SOMETHING is going to come into effect.The media changes direction and spotlights the trouble it could cause..Knowing full well that SOMETHING has to be done to slow down the use of fossil fuels in the atmosphere..The political story really doesnt interest me.Its the same thing over and overMoney..vs.Our Health ..This shouldnt be an issue.President Obama vowed as a candidate that he would put the United States on a path to addressingclimate change by reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas pollutants. He offered Congress wide latitude to passclimate change legislation, but held in reserve the threat of E.P.A. regulation if it failed to act. The deeply polarized Senates refusal to enact climate change legislation essentially called his bluff.With Mr. Obamas hand forced by the mandates of the Clean Air Act and a2007 Supreme Court decision, his E.P.A. will impose the first regulation of major stationary sources of greenhouse gasesstarting Jan. 2.For now, administration officials are treading lightly, fearful of inflaming an already charged atmosphere on the issue and mindful that its stated priorities are job creation and economic recovery. Officials are not seeking a major confrontation over carbon regulation, which offers formidable challenges even in a less stressed economic and political climate.If the administration gets it wrong, were looking at years of litigation, legislation and public and business outcry, said a senior administration official who asked not to be identified so as not to provide an easy target for the incoming Republicans. If we get it right, were facing the same thing.Can we get it right? this official continued.

But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Tuesday afternoon the 9/11 bill will likely require members to remain in Washington for an extra day.I know the consternation that exists with respect to our schedule and when were going to leave, Hoyer said on the House floor. [But] Sen. Reid indicates to me that its a high likelihood they will complete 9/11 sometime tomorrow.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told Hoyer the Senate is expected to finish the bill between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Wednesday.Senate proponents of the bill have tweaked a House version  which passed in September  to win the support of some Republicans. The changes mean that the House must pass the bill again before it can go to the presidents desk.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesHouse passage, Senate passage, The 9/11 Health BillRead morePage 1 of 32123...32Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
