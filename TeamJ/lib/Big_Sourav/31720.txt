Do you think any of those will be a good candidate for short positions in 2011?These stocks have dropped a lot don`t know if this downward spiral has lost the steamchan05122 days ago Davidrio,I wouldn't just short stocks because they are the laggards from previous year. Like 2009 laggards, some of these laggards stocks recovered during 2010 such as Zion Bancs, MetroPCS. If you have shorted these stocks, you  will lose your money since some of these stock gain 60-80% during 2010.I actually like some of these laggards stock such as SWN, RRD, AKS and Visa. I'll probably invest accordingly if there is some sort small of correction (3-5%).If I were you, I'll look at the best performer for 2010 and look at the most overrated p/e stocks. Or even be ready to short the index. I think it is due for small correction. But just be ready... Good luck.Simone Smith2 days ago Thank you for this extensive overview!
