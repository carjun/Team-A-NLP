Obviously it's a very extreme procedure, but there's people who have undergone it at an early enough age (while the brain is still more malleable) who have gone on to graduate studies and the like.Of course, anything that dramatic is going to have very different effects on different people for any number of reasons, though.

It doesn't necessarily mean that her brain's respiratory control has been knocked out, though that can happen with swelling inside the skull, certainly.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnorthernlights      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:45 PMResponse to Reply #929.not necessariy. anybody know if she is left or right handed? or ambidextrous?because that would be a good clue. Both hemispheres participate. However, the dominant hemisphere controls use and understanding of language and complex computations and analysis. 90% of the population has a left dominant hemisphere. In the other 10%, the right side is dominant or they are used equally.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHorse with no Name      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 12:56 PMResponse to Reply #2938.I was just repeating what the doc saidparaphrased "It is very good that the bullet didn't penetrate the hemisphere.

It is also a fairly high speed round so it will go through quickly. And don't know if he was using ball or hollowpoints. Hollowpoints may expand which would make a more devastating & larger wound channel.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJoe the Revelator      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:48 PMResponse to Reply #2735.If it was a "through and through" shot, as they are saying it was not a hollow pointIt would have been a full metal jacket.

So if it traveled to one side or the other, that area may not be affected.Now I have my Hole's anatomy in front of me and I see my memory was correct (3 years since I took anatomy) -- general interpretive area of the brain is dead center. Also, the visual area is center/rear and motor speech (Broca's area) center/front.Other than that, front-back or back-front hits part of pretty much something everything: visual recognition, sensory interpretation, visual/auditory memory.The rest depends I think on how high or low it traveled and angle (low to high versus high to low). Above center are voluntary muscle control, frontal eye field, contentration/planning/problem solving, sensory areas, understanding speech. Below center is interpretation of sensory experiences, and visual/auditory memory and patterns.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnolabear      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 12:40 PMResponse to Original message25.This is conjecture but it's likely very good that it passed clear through.The brain is pretty plastic, even in adults, up to a point.  The fact that the bullet didn't lodge or ricochet in the congresswoman's brain might mean the path of damage is far more contained than it would be otherwise.  Other areas can still develop control over some functions. (My god, what a thing to even have to think about).  Best case would be if it missed major connective sites and places that control major functions.  Honestly, though, we just won't know for a while.

It is a tragedy of incredible proportion.Even if she gets off the vent, she will never be the same again.  Her right side will likely be paralyzed.
