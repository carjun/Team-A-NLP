Overall 62% of Americans think Obama legitimately won the election to only 26% who think ACORN stole it for him, as few Democrats or independents buy into that line of thinking."TPM points out that ACORN has gained in popularity as a bogeyman for the right:"This number goes a long way towards explaining the anger of the Tea Party crowd. They not only think Obama's agenda is against America, but they don't think he was actually the choice of the American people at all! Interestingly, NY-23 Conservative candidate Doug Hoffman is now accusing ACORN of stealing his race, and Fox News personalities have often speculated about ACORN stealing the 2008 Minnesota Senate race for Al Franken."For the record, Obama's margin of victory was 9.5 million votes.On the News Blog: http://blogs.current.com/news/2009/11/20/poll-gop-voters-think-acorn-stole-elect...SOURCES:http://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2009/11/acorn.htmlhttp://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/11/poll-gop-base-thinks-obama-didnt-actu... groups:News, News_Featured, Current Republicans tags:Obama,Democrats,Election,2008 Election,GOP,Republicans,President Obama,SuperNews,Poll,ACORN,TPM 7 more|38 comments// Poll: GOP voters think ACORN stole election for Obamahide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

Damn anyone who's actions diminishes my vote and cheapens democracy. 1 year agoflag  reply0Wharf_RatWow these teabaggers really need some help! Maybe they don't want everyone to have health care, because they are afraid they will have to take a psychological exam. 1 year agoflag  reply0inspirationseekerWell it will be easy to prove them wrong during the next presidential election. 1 year agoflag  reply0samthesixthToo funny! And I remember when Democrats thought Bush had stolen the election. 1 year agoflag  reply0MaeveeoIn this case the word SUPPOSE is ah pretty strong word ! 1 year agoflag  reply0czthedayAcorn is guilty of...everything?  If so, they have certainly been busy little suckers.  A corrupt group?  Perhaps.  William Jefferson's corruption does not make the Democratic Party a corrupt group any more than Senator Ensign's corruption makes the Republican Party a corrupt group.  Corruption has been uncovered at Acorn. The investigation continues.  The notion that every member of Acorn is corrupt is pretty far-fetched -- but the corruption may run deep...we shall see.  Corruption should not be tolerated by either party in any organization.  From where sit it looks like both parties jumped all over Acorn when evidence of impropriety surfaced.  That is the way the system is SUPPOSED to work... 1 year agoflag  reply0realitychickAcorn is guilty, guilty, guilty of most everything.  It's a matter of getting the proof. That's starting to surface from Independents!  So, everyone should listen up!  Where are our tax dollars going?  That's what matters.  Look where the money goes and what is happening. 1 year agoflag  reply0laserdog  realitychick:Could you give me a concrete example of what you think they're doing wrong?How exactly do their attempts at signing people up to vote result in voter fraud? 1 year agoflag  reply0gaglbgncanyone and everyone who voted for change needs realize that it was not acorn that stole the election it was people who was ready for change that stole the election from the from republicans. we also need to be more active in politics and continue to make sure that we are registered to vote and by the vote we can continue to steal the vote and make changes that this so country desperatly needs .                              for we have been awakened !!!!! 1 year agoflag  reply0nanac  gaglbgnc:Well said!!!!!!!!!!!! 1 year agoflag  reply0ibrake4rappers13I dont think Acorn got Obama elected, but i do believe SEIU helped Obama get elected. this is the special interest group that is running obamas agenda.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ1NJaCtIkM 1 year agoflag  reply0ibrake4rappers13  ibrake4rappers13:Andy Stern leader of SEIUhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzG0xpkjWrA 1 year agoflag  reply0Saladin  ibrake4rappers13:I didn't have time to watch the clips, but I can think of a worse things to stand for than unions.I don't appreciate the president being in the pocket of anyone, but nothing I've dug up on these guys seems very radical. 1 year agoflag  reply0Ihatethemall  ibrake4rappers13:SALADIN, You need to dig a lot deeper. Andy sterns is as crooked as they come. 1 year agoflag  reply0SaladinAnd that agenda would beeeeeeeee what exactly?And last time I checked, crisis pregnancy centers, anti-abortion fuckheads who scare women into not getting them, are Federally Funded.So once again, right-wingers are hypocritical douche bags who can't even keep their conspiracy theories straight. 1 year agoflag  reply02helenahandbasketBull shit. The GOP doesn't think any such thing. How stupid. The GOP DOES, however, think ACORN is a crooked, left wing organization that would stop at nothing to achieve their goal, whether legal or not. Prove them wrong, I beg of you...... 1 year agoflag  reply0snarly  2helenahandbasket:so, in other words, the GOP think that ACORN is the left-wing version of themselves? Interesting. 1 year agoflag  reply0Ihatethemall  2helenahandbasket:No thats now at all what she said, did you learn reading and comprehension in the public schools?????She said ACORN is a corrupt group. They have no one to answer too, they have no one that needs to get elected yet they recieve millions of dollars of OUR tax money. I for one dont like it. My guess is Helen doesnt like it either. Any other questions? 1 year agoflag  reply0nanac  2helenahandbasket:Who cares? 1 year agoflag  reply0laserdog  2helenahandbasket:"Prove them wrong, I beg of you....."There is this thing called "Burden of Proof" for this sort of situation.It isn't ACORN's job to prove that accusations are false, it is the burden of the people making the accusations. 1 year agoflag  reply0Ihatethemall  2helenahandbasket:Well you could start off by watching the videos. I saw them. They are guilty. They dont deserve to get one fuckin penny of my god dam money. To fuckin bad for acorn. Fuck them 1 year agoflag  reply02helenahandbasket  2helenahandbasket:There is plenty of proof that ACORN is a corrupt organization. And more proof is on the way. Just stay tuned. While you're waiting, watch the videos. 1 year agoflag  reply02helenahandbasket  2helenahandbasket:And you're right, ihatethemall...  It makes me furious that ACORN aquires millions of our tax dollars, answers to no one, and we really don't know WHO the hell they are. Just as I'm angry about the CZARS whom we DID NOT elect, yet they have unquestioned and unlimited power to make changes and run our government any way they see fit. But that's another whole topic......(I just wish I had your handle, which I'm in complete agreement with.....  :)   ) 1 year agoflag  reply0Wharf_Rat  2helenahandbasket:ACORN & the SEIU  maybe a crooked organization. Maybe it is a few "bad apples" or the organizations leaders are crooks. I haven't made up my mind yet, but I do know 1 thing; These groups are not 1/2 as corrupt as Halliburton, Blackwater, etc, etc. 1 year agoflag  reply02helenahandbasket  2helenahandbasket:I don't believe ACORN gets a pass in its corruption just because we might find someone MORE corrupt. Do you? 1 year agoflag  reply0EdJoyProductionsIf this were true, I would be impressed.  Republicans are delusional. I only wish ACORN had that kind of power. 1 year agoflag  reply0CreditFigaroLet's talk issues? Oh wait, republicans can't win on those. 1 year agoflag  reply0bailey78  CreditFigaro:Hey they can lie about the issues. They have been doing it for the past nine years or so. 1 year agoflag  reply0Denica_CassandraAcorn is going to steal your children. (and then pimp them out) ;) lol 1 year agoflag  reply0current89"Denial ain't just a river in Egypt" -Mark Twainhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/ElectoralCollege2008.sv... 1 year agoflag  reply0laserdog"and Fox News personalities have often speculated about ACORN stealing the 2008 Minnesota Senate race for Al Franken.""Ugh, the MN senate recount was one of the most transparent and thorough recounts performed this decade.*Every* ballot was scrutinized.  Had ACORN been running a nefarious plot to stuff ballots, that bi-partisian 6 month process would have surely found a ton of smoking guns.  The fact that the best they can do is "theorize" when there is a staggering amount of ballot information available from that election is mind-boggling.It is again proof that Fox News only pushes their pre-conceived narrative over any sort of good faith attempts at "fact gathering". 1 year agoflag  reply0unimatrix0More evidence that the GOP is home to intellectually challenged Americans.  Maybe we should round those folks up and put them in camps so they don't hurt themselves. 1 year agoflag  reply0nanac  unimatrix0:I agree totally! 1 year agoflag  reply0bailey78So bush stole it whats good for the Goose is good for the Gander 1 year agoflag  reply0estevancarlos  bailey78:So you're saying you believe both elections were stolen?  What kind of tin foil will you be wearing? 1 year agoflag  reply0bailey78  bailey78:Reynolds wrap extra heavy duty. Why do you ask? 1 year agoflag  reply0wrand  bailey78:A bit of a difference between saying a recount in one state was bungled and that a community organization manufactured almost 10 million votes nationwide. 1 year agoflag  replymore fromNews:Michael Vick More Important to Obama Than Family of Soldier Killed In Combat The #1 Work From Home Business Of 2011 . . .
