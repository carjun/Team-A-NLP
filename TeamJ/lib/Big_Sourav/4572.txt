I'm not knocking the point.  I love badminton, took a quarter of PE credit of it in college, play it now at any opportunity.  However, these HP headlines indicate that HP Sports doesn't actually watch an awful lot of sports.  Best this, best that, usually are nothing of the sort.  I guess this is the most mediocre post ever.            tnrc75: How many points has the HP watched?

That is why the competitors, especially in singles, run much more in one match than in tennis.  Badminton is a great sport, it's too bad it is not popular in the US.   During the summer Olympics, I have to watch the badminton matches online because the network will rarely show it on TV.
