My resistance to pharmaceuticals was weakening. I needed something to ease what felt like a yeomans knot under my right shoulder blade. As I continue this adventure in paradise, I remembered that my roommate, a doctor himself, had spoken highly of his friend Bill, an Acupuncturist. When the lug woke up, I begged him to make a call for me. Now, I have never ventured outside of western medicine. I dont know what compelled me to seek this less-than-traditional remedy, but something had to be done. Doc here offered his strongest muscle relaxer as it appeared that I was frozen in a pose  hunched tightly. But I said no, having already decided that Id give this poker guy a chance. Meet William Benning, M.Sci., LA,c. I dont know what the alphabet stuff means, but I have met him and his wife a couple times socially and was convinced that he wouldnt poke me to death. Needless to say, his credentials have some weight. He trained at a respected College of Oriental Medicine in San Diego, California and has matriculated to Brazil in the last six years, qualifying to practice here  no small feat. The session started in his nice, clean vista-catching clinic. It was clean, artsy and made me feel comfortable in a professional environment. He explained as much as he could to a belligerent patient in pain, but I got the gist of sanitized needles, his manipulation designs and there I was on the gurney. First he thoroughly searched for my release points. I vaguely remember him pointing out the knots that had not only concentrated in my upper back and neck, but also the natural knots that had come by way of compensating my movement  of lack thereof  for the last two days. I cant say that as he worked out the bubbles, it was painless. He did give me the option to say if it hurt too much and he went through a series of release the tension points. As I started to drift into a more relaxed state with my head in some sort of harness thingy, I could hear the preparation of the needles. In all, he probably inserted 15 needles. I lost count. My rendition of a porcupine would have been one of those photo moments. In my feet, in my hands, in my back, in my shoulders and at least one in the crown of my head, he painlessly inserted the miniscule silver needles. He just said relax and I was snoring within two minutes. Some time later, I was awoken out of haze to be told that the treatment was complete. And it was. I could move. I could stretch. I didnt feel like the hunchback of Notre Dame anymore. For what amounted to $53 US, I was able to roust a doctor, get treated and get immediate relief on a Sunday morning. This adventure just keeps getting better. If anything, dont discount the possibility of acupuncture. It worked for me.        1 of 1         It worked for me.

Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoAffordable. On demand. On Sunday. Couldn't get better than that.            Reply  Posted By     Kelly Woodcox|7 monthsagoI have never done acupuncture before. My chiropractor hooks me up to machine now that helps. but If I could find an acupuncture therapist, I may be willing to try it too.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoGood for you. If you knew me, you would know how much of a stretch it is. I don't allow anyone approach me with needles. It worked for me for that particular pain. I dare say, if it was an alignment, this boy knew what he was doing.            Reply  Posted By     Caitlin Tadlock|7 monthsagoDid you go to sleep because of something on the needles or was it just that relaxing?            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoGood question. I would hope he didn't put something on the needles. Actually, I could hear him taking each and everyone from a sterile package. It was just relaxing. But when he put that last one in my head, I immediately went to sleep.            Reply  Reply By     onepercussive|7 monthsagono, they don't put anything on the needles. the needles come sterilized and sealed in a plastic packet.             Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoI would have to agree. He told before that each one was sterile.            Reply  Posted By     onepercussive|7 monthsagoNice you could broaden your horizons. I'm a believer in natural healing modalities and have had great success with acupuncture. I lived one year in Korea and with my national insurance my copay was around $4 a visit and it was very effective. The my acupuncturist helped me with constipation, sciatica and a weird rash I acquired while putting my hand where I shouldn't have. All the Bestg            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoOkay. The hand story has got to come out. Just kidding. Thanks for the nod. It is nice always to learn something new.            Reply  Posted By     paretta|7 monthsagoGlad you're feeling better! Thanks for the report.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoRight on man. I still can't believe it. Some things you learn late.            Reply  Posted By     GoldenStateTouch|7 monthsagoGlad to hear you are feeling better after your acupuncture. I have attached a recent story from the Wall Street Journal on a new theory about why acupuncture works.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoMuch appreciated. I will definitely read and continue to recommend all I know. Thanks.            Reply  Posted By     Andy Mathisen|7 monthsagoI wouldn't wish severe back pain on a rabid dog! Glad to hear things worked out. Love the writing style!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoThanks Andy. My hero is Hunter S. Thompson.            Reply  Posted By     MichaelRobertReardon|7 monthsagoYou were treated fabulously by him on the table with his softly spoken words and lightly poked needles of great pleasure. I will pass on the word that acupuncture is something to adventure by in the future. You made it sound so eloquently enlightened. I might have a poke at it!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|7 monthsagoI'm happy to report that two days out from the treatment I have been able to put in a good long bike ride with no ill effects. I do appreciate the compliment and hope I continue to inspire those adventurous enough to indulge.
