While no longer in the classroom, I have taught this subject every Christmas for the past 14 years.  Each year it was fascinating to watch the young children light up as we would learn about a new country and one of it's holiday customs or traditions.   I would pick different countries each year so that I could approach the season with a fresh excitement to learn and share with the children, and my family.  With this article, we will go around the globe and focus on different cultures and their custom of celebrating Christmas.Many people celebrate Christmas on December 25 as the birth of Jesus.  We will not focus on the possibilities of this being accurate as there is controversy surrounding the exact date, but long ago people held festivals at this time of year hoping that winter would end.  It was a festive time and gifts would be exchanged as well as gathering around feasts. Eventually the church officials chose this date.  Not everyone celebrates Christmas as a Christian holiday and celebrate cultural traditions such as Saint Nicholas Day or Saint Lucia Day.  Let's begin our journey around the world.  Having these 'teacher genes' working with me, we're going in alphabetical order, although not representing each letter, but covering a diverse group of traditions and customs starting with the country's greeting.

It is a time of joy, love, forgiveness, remembrance, reflection, fun, feasting, spending time together with family and hopefully also with friends and those that may need a friend.  Ihave always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round, as agood time; a kind, forgiving, charitable time; the only time I know of,in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by oneconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of peoplebelow them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave, andnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys.  ~Charles DickensEnjoy the season.   Merry Christmas means love in every language. Love, Light to all, rebekahELLE A Christmas Wish For Allvote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...? Useful (1)Funny Awesome Beautiful Christmas: A Short Christmas Story;  Magic BellsDo You Have a  Favorite Christmas Tradition?Veronica Allen14 months ago This was very interesting rebekkahELLE. I've always been fascinated by the backgrounds of the holidays - where they orginated and why they are celebrated. This look into how and why various cultures choose to commemorate this day is very eye-opening. Thank you for all the research you put into this hub. It made for a interesting and educational read.rebekahELLE14 months ago Thanks Veroncia, I had wanted to write on this subject anyway and when I saw the HubMob theme yesterday, I was excited to start writing. It kind of brings the world closer together, doesn't it? thanks for stopping by and commenting.  :)Carmen Borthwick14 months ago Great hub rebekahELLE. The tradition in our house is having Christmas dinner on Boxing Day [Canada]. It began when the kids were little, didn't seem fair to make them sit down for dinner when they were too excited with gifts from Santa. My 19 yr old son actually called today to ask if that was the case this year. Thanks for all the wonderful information on different cultures.emievil14 months ago Thanks for featuring my country in your hub. The simbang gabi or dawn mass is really a big tradition for us. In fact, some of us make it a point to complete the nine days of dawn mass (from Dec. 16 to 24), imagine that. Then we also have this tradition of going house to house during Christmas day to visit friends, families, loved ones, godparents (who try to hide from us so they don't give us our gifts LOL). It's truly a fun day for us.rebekahELLE14 months ago thank you Carmen and emievil. it really is fascinating to see that most countries do celebrate at this time of year in some manner. Being together as family and friends is the common thread throughout all cultures and celebrating. thanks you for stopping by. :)HealthTip14 months ago That was a brilliantly thought out idea for a Hub, loved it, well done and Merry Xmas ; )rebekahELLE14 months ago thank you darlin, can you share with us one of your country's customs? would love to have it here since I could not include all countries! :)HealthTip14 months ago Well we usually make it a family affair with parents etc coming over for Xmas Dinner which is of course Turkey, ham, roast potatoes, brussel sprouts. Then a drink of wine and pulling crackers, wearing the silly hats.Best is Xmas Eve leaving the kids pressies round the tree and then watching them open them on Xmas Day. We usually have our Xmas Meal about 3pm for some reason but tis tradition. Plus all the shops close on Xmas Day, Boxing Day here in the UK is mostly sport as all the Premier teams play each other and the big horse racing event takes place, I sometimes would go to an Irish League soccer game just to get out of the house.We usually put our tree up 1st December and don't take it down until 10 days after Xmas as tis meant to be bad luck if you take it down sooner. Hope that helps ; )rebekahELLE14 months ago thank you! that's wonderful to read. I do remember making christmas crackers and crowns with the children at school.The kids loved it! We wrapped small pieces of holiday fabric around a toilet tissue roll and tied ends together with ribbon. of course, there was candy inside. we even laid them next to their christmas meal at school one year and they wore their crowns!  so much fun. thank you for sharing. :)HealthTip14 months ago Moi pleasure, enjoy your weekend !IslandVoice14 months ago Really lovely!
