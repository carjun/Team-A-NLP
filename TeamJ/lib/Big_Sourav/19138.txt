Now even Ashton Kutcher is proclaiming that we could soon witness the end of the world as we know it.  Yes, you read that correctly.

Jesus Christ also said you can tell by looking at the sky that a storm is approaching, why can't you discern the signs of the times? 8 days agoflag  reply+2Vierotchka  victoriousvic7:Ever since the Book of Revelation was introduced in the Canon in the 4th century, not a single year has gone by without Christians seeing the signs everywhere and saying that the End Times were upon them. 8 days agoflag  reply0bailey78  victoriousvic7:But I don't believe in fairy tales. 8 days agoflag  reply-1victoriousvic7  Vierotchka:Yeah well one of these generations is bound to get it right, and now that there are weapons of mass destruction it is even more likely to come to pass. 8 days agoflag  reply+1coolplanet  Vierotchka:I resonate with what Thomas Jefferson said about the Book of Revelation: "the ravings of a mad man."Nonetheless America's Masonic founders openly considered America the New Jerusalem.I think we've missed the whole point of what heaven really is --On Earth! 8 days agoflag  reply-1victoriousvic7  bailey78:let us lay aside such cynical way's of thinking and look to the cross, the empty tomb, and the lives of many around the world who have been changed by the finished work of the cross of calvary! 7 days agoflag  reply0bailey78  victoriousvic7:Like I said above and many times before I don't believe in fairy tales. 7 days agoflag  reply+1bailey78Every day we live we are just one day closer to death. Every day we are at war we are one day closer to all dieing. The Earth will be here long after we are but dust in the win.Oh and if you get turned into a Zombie I will shoot you in the head without thinking twice about it. Happy New Year :) 8 days agoflag  reply+1ProgresshivMy Grandma Gertie told me (in 1958) that the world would end in 1966.

He shares the same belief as the homeless guy screaming in the middle of a Manhattan street pounding on a well worn bible.  I hold them both in the same esteem. 8 days agoflag  reply+2NiceNI think it's GI Jane that's putting him up to it. 9 days agoflag  reply0ozoneoceanYes, he was very good at playing a moron on "That 70's show" and "Dude, where's my car?". I don't care what he has to say about anything else. 9 days agoflag  reply+5VierotchkaWho on earth is Ashton Kutcher? Never heard of him. 9 days agoflag  reply+3EdJoyProductions  Vierotchka:I wish that I was as fortunate. 8 days agoflag  reply0remanns  EdJoyProductions:this must be some sort of "gurl thing",....I don't have much of a reaction one way or the other.   I thought " Butterfly Effect " was good,.......but NOT particularly because OF , or in spite Of, his involvement. Good movie.   He hasn't DONE anything yet that allows his "acting chops" to be weighed.     I think.    Not an RTF PHD or anything- 8 days agoflag  reply+3BludolphdolphWhat does it matter? I am secure in my beliefs. People make a fortune getting others to panic. 9 days agoflag  reply+3thedirtmanJust my opinion, but I think the apocalypse is over.  We're on our own now. 9 days agoflag  reply0coolplanet  thedirtman:I agree. This is basically what America's Deist Founders thought, too.It is up to us to create a better world because G-d moved on long ago to spark new life in the cosmos. 8 days agoflag  reply+6remannsKewl !    I keep trying to find posts appropriate to add to "Apocalypse News" and "End Time Prophecy" !    Rah !   HAPPY NEW YEAR ! 9 days agoflag  reply+7artemis6Life is change . It only becomes a problem when you can no longer adapt . 9 days agoflag  reply+4remanns  artemis6:I ask advice at Radio Shack ALL THE TIME for that sort of thing. ( One way or another, you can ALWAYS find some adapter that will keep your old printer n such working ! ) 9 days agoflag  reply+7MrMxyzptlkWell since Kuchner has been wrong about every decision he has ever made I feel so much better about the future of the planet now. 9 days agoflag  reply0ibrake4rappers13I've been anticipating the end of the world since 05. I started studying biblical prophecy like if my life depended on it. Every night I would look to the clouds anticipating Christ return. I stll do.I also started paying attention to EVERY SINGLE news story looking for signs that the end was near. In 05 I saw 3 stories that confirmed to me that we are the generation that will witness the return of ChristIsrael, according to the bible, is Gods country. Anything that happens with Israel is connected to biblical prophecy. So I started paying attention to what was happening with IsraelOne thing caught my eye was the gaza withdrawal in august of 05. I didn't know what the significance of that was but I think it's playing a big role in biblical prophecyAnother was ahmedinejads speech calling for Israel to be wiped off the mapAnd Katrina hitting new OrleansThey may seem like normal events to most people. But if you take deeper look into these things. You may find the key to our future.Peace, and have a happy new year. 9 days agoflag  reply+4vixxxen618  ibrake4rappers13:There are so many things I want to say in reply to that post... but I'll take the high road.Happy New Year. 9 days agoflag  reply+2Vierotchka  ibrake4rappers13:Ahmadinejad never called for Israel to be wiped off the map. See: http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/2010/12/14/well-wipe-israel-off-the... 9 days agoflag  reply+2ryanryanryanryan  ibrake4rappers13:Paraphrasing, "Why would the ramblings of Bronze Age, nomadic tribe have any insight into the future or into any "deeper" reality?" - Hitchens 8 days agoflag  reply0Aaron_Brutus  ibrake4rappers13:I dont see alot of people on this site that believe in christ. its nice to see im not alone. i approve this message. 8 days agoflag  reply0Davidod  ibrake4rappers13:"They may seem like normal events to most people. But if you take deeper look into these things. You may find the key to our future."And I predict, you may NOT.So what's going to happen even if you DO find "the key to the future"?  Setting aside the impossibility of living 1,000 more years to observe whether or not the prophecy was correct, apart from the arguably-valuable bragging rights ("See, I told you guys this would happen!"), how exactly would your life be any different than it is today?And as 4xryan says, why should a vast array of nomadic tribesmen (who lived anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 years ago) be granted special insider access to the future from God?Sheeze, it seems like everyone's looking to get an edge, a hot tip, a leg up on the next guy.... 8 days agoflag  reply+5thetrimsmithUh oh, didn't the Ancients place great weight on the forecast of idiot savants? 9 days agoflag  reply+8eden49...the poor bastad's probably exhausted, and delusional from being tied to the bed... 9 days agoflag  reply+5PzLuvHappenizHow bout we all just live like the world is gonna end tomorrow 9 days agoflag  reply+5vixxxen618One good thing about the end of the world... no more Ashton Kutcher. God, he's even from my state and I can't fcking stand him. 9 days agoflag  reply+12Itsbatman_Durrwell that settles it then. if ashton says its all over, its a no brainer. i was planning on waiting til johnny knoxville chimed in, but ashton is good enough for me and i want to beat the traffic 9 days agoflag  reply0KSirys  Itsbatman_Durr:pick me up while you're at it! i have Hulk Hogan calling me nonstop because of the devastating news!!! lol.. 8 days agoflag  reply+10ThatCrazyLibertarianBetter have one of these handy.... 9 days agoflag  reply+6ThatCrazyLibertarian  ThatCrazyLibertarian:And this will definitely help... 9 days agoflag  reply+2PzLuvHappeniz  ThatCrazyLibertarian:That case is way too small to contain a shotgun, you got ripped off on your zombie survival purchase 9 days agoflag  reply+5a619ko  ThatCrazyLibertarian:I prefer a chaingun. :) 9 days agoflag  reply+3ThatCrazyLibertarian  PzLuvHappeniz:For a compact 12 gauge....nah.Would I rather have a chain gun?

Just remember if you behead them, destroy the brain 9 days agoflag  reply+2Davidod  ThatCrazyLibertarian:You all know that zombies are people, too, right?  They display a complex social structure and possess a level of intelligence (e.g. as evidenced by their organizational skills to march en masse on their victims, engaging in collective feeding on the brains of their prey) that is at least on par with that of dolphins.Just saying, the panic case above would likely be seen as incriminating evidence of your  pre-existing zombicidal tendencies, and that might be critical in showing your motives should you ever be brought to trial in a post-zombie-world trial (BTW, good luck finding 12 surviving humans to constitute a jury trial by your peers). 8 days agoflag  reply+1KSirys  ThatCrazyLibertarian:Does Walmart have them? 8 days agoflag  reply0bailey78  ThatCrazyLibertarian:If your wanting to survive then you will need these. 8 days agoflag  reply0ThatCrazyLibertarian  KSirys:Don't know....but I'm pretty sure that S Mart carries them.

I know about corporate personhood, but never heard of zombie personhood.  But I'm pretty sure that zombies aren't going to afford me due process.  +^d 8 days agoflag  reply0ThatCrazyLibertarian  bailey78:Street sweepers and a Mac-10 certainly would be a benefit.  +^dBut I'd rather have a Benelli M4.  I've fired one a few times, and it can take care of business. 8 days agoflag  reply0ThatCrazyLibertarian  SamuraiDave:Can't go wrong with a Katana....you'll never run out of ammo either.  +^d 8 days agoflag  reply0KSirys  ThatCrazyLibertarian:lol... thank you! 8 days agoflag  reply+1bailey78  ThatCrazyLibertarian:I'm not a big fan of Benelli I have a couple of old stevens one side by side and a pump. I don't want any auto unless it's full auto but then I would go to prison and I'm just to pretty to go to prison.:) 8 days agoflag  reply+3Davidod  ThatCrazyLibertarian:It's often difficult to see things from the other person's (or zombie's) point of view: after all, WHO'S shooting WHOM with that shotgun?  Along those lines, I'd like to see Zombieland re-filmed, except from the zombie's point of view: alternate ending is Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson's character) is finally apprehended, and faces a trial in a zombie court; Tallahassee runs with a justifiable zombicide defense: Zombie prosecutor:"So aside from your admitted contempt and hatred for all zombies (apparently seeing ALL of us as a threat), did the zombie you killed point a firearm at you?  No?  Did he brandish a knife, or any other type of weapon?  No?  And was he on your private property, or breaking into your home?  No?  Didn't you say you actually broke INTO the home of Bill Murray and trespassed?  Your honor, I rest my case." 8 days agoflag  reply0remanns  Davidod:+^d.   HAH !
