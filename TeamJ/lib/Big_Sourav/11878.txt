Per MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino, he reminded the motorists to avoid drunk driving as most of the people involved in accidents are drivers driving under the influence of alcohol. The MMDA has been starting a campaign against drunk driving in Metro Manila. The agency is looking into a means of an ordinance that would require different entertainment centers to limit the sale of alcoholic drinks to customers especially those who have to drive home at night. On the other hand, former Pampanga Rep. Gloria Arroyo filed a bill seeking to criminalize and impose penalties on drunk driving under the House Bill 382. Referring to the Driving under the Influence of Alcohol Act of 2010, it says a motorist can be charged with drunk driving when his mental and motor skills are impaired by alcohol, or when his blood alcohol concentration level is 0.06 or higher.        1 of 2         image      Firstborne is based in Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (52.6%) Philippines (15.8%) Canada (13.2%) Vietnam (2.6%) 5 other countries (10.5%)           READ MORE: MMDA, travel-news, Philippines, manila, Driving under the influence, Blood alcohol content, Methoxymethylenedioxyamphetamine, law, chemistry, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, driving, Francis Tolentino, Drunk Driving, Gloria Arroyo   More News From: Manila :  Philippines     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         MMDA propose motorcycle riders to wear appropriate safety attire By: jpatrick7308      The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is proposing theenactment of legislative measures requiring motorcycle riders to wearappropriate safety attire to curb the increasing rates of fatal roadaccidents involving motorcycles.Chairman Francis Tolentino presented the idea during the Transportand Traffic Summit held last ...  about 1 month ago     DOTC suggests doable solutions for traffic problem By: jpatrick7308      Department of Transportation and Communications (DoTC) Secretary Jose de Jesus has lauded the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for coming up with "doable" suggestions to solve the perennial problems of traffic congestion in Metro Manila.During last week's transport and traffic summit, De Jesus said he is quite impressed with ...  about 1 month ago     Single Ticketing System Proposed for Traffic Violators By: jpatrick7308      The Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) welcomed Friday suggestions from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to simplify the processing of traffic violation tickets in the metropolis.MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino has been batting for the use of a single ...  about 1 month ago     Malacanang urges Bus Operators to give number coding a chance By: jpatrick7308      Malacanang on Sunday called on bus operators in the metropolis to give a chance for the re-implementation of the number coding scheme of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) before carrying out their planned strike on Monday."Tingnan muna natin ang magiging resulta; hintayin muna natin na ma-implement iyong plano para makita natin ...  about 1 month ago          Loading News Contributions...
