"And we'll be concentrating on a broader area," Deputy Deborah Bell said.Many agencies also will be participating in the state's "no refusal" initiative to take blood samples from suspected drunken drivers who refuse sobriety testsGarland and Plano police departments started stepping up DWI enforcement efforts on Dec. 21 and will continue through Saturday.The Texas Highway Patrol will have extra state troopers in high-risk locations during the hours when alcohol-related crashes are most likely to occur."We recommend that you designate a sober driver if you're planning to consume any alcohol. Even one alcoholic beverage, under the right conditions, can seriously impair your driving  and the safety of those around you," said David Baker, assistant director for the Texas Highway Patrol. "The holidays are no time to spend in jail, but we will arrest any driver who is impaired."Last year on New Year's Eve, state troopers arrested 502 drivers for DWI and issued 12,697 speeding tickets.Drunken driving isn't the only danger posed on New Year's Eve.The Dallas Police Department is urging residents to lock up weapons and call 911 about revelers firing shots into the air to celebrate the holiday.The department receives more random gunfire complaints on New Year's Eve than any other day of the year.In Deep Ellum last year, a 20-year-old woman was struck in the left shoulder by a stray bullet shortly after the new year began.Share this article:28 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Man accidentally shot in face by friend dies from injuriesNext article Hostages safe, suspects in custody at Houston-area bankTo add a comment, please register or login.Add another commentLeave your comment1000 characters remainingSubmitWe welcome your comments on this story's topic.

My son and 2 others, all over 21, were arrested and charged with Public Intoxication a few years ago.  The driver was let go but the coppers arrested all the passengers...they still wanted some money.  My son sat it out rather than pay, and the taxpayers of Euless paid for his room and board for 5 days.  The reason they were stopped?  The cops said the sober driver changed lanes without using a turn signal which is bull.  They were stopped b/c the cops saw 4 people in a car at 11:30 p.m.  Moral to story? Stay away from Euless.58201948Flag this commentdzzzzzzzzzzzzzz said on January 2, 2011 at 3:15 AMgpbob the next time a drunk driver kills one of your family members dont call the police or if someone breaks into your house dont call the police.

City is making at minimum 10000.00 dollars off of each conviction. That adds up to 50,000,000.00 dollars a year in revenue.Does anyone really think they want to stop drunk driving????????Just think if there were no more drunk drivers tomorrow, the cities would have to figure out something else to make up for the money lost in DWI.Insurance companies would have to figure out something too since they could no longer charge outrageous rates for convicted DWI offenders?What would DWI attorneys do?Too much money in drunk driving to really stop it. Really want to stop drunk driving just send the cops to every place that sells alcohol and wait out side. Anyone who comes out and gets in their car just arrest them because they have just drank something and are going to drive.58144492Flag this commentsteven75150 said on December 31, 2010 at 2:42 PMIt's simple,  if drinking is your choice , them stay the night at your party or just stay home.58144351Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:55 PMScrapping the DWI offense in favor of better enforcement of reckless driving laws would also bring some logical consistency to our laws, which treat a driver with a BAC of 0.08 much more harshly than, say, a driver distracted by his kids or a cell phone call, despite similar levels of impairment. The punishable act should be violating road rules or causing an accident, not the factors that led to those offenses. Singling out alcohol impairment for extra punishment isn't about making the roads safer. It's about a lingering hostility toward demon rum.58142901Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:54 PMDoing away with the specific charge of drunk driving sounds radical at first blush, but it would put the focus back on impairment, where it belongs. It might repair some of the civil-liberties damage done by the invasive powers the government says it needs to catch and convict drunk drivers. If the offense were reckless driving rather than drunk driving, for example, repeated swerving over the median line would be enough to justify the charge. There would be no need for a cop to jam a needle in your arm alongside a busy highway.58142878Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:54 PMIf our ultimate goals are to reduce driver impairment and maximize highway safety, we should be punishing reckless driving. It shouldn't matter if it's caused by alcohol, sleep deprivation, prescription medication, text messaging, or road rage. If lawmakers want to stick it to dangerous drivers who threaten everyone else on the road, they can dial up the civil and criminal liability for reckless driving, especially in cases that result in injury or property damage.58142874Flag this commentsonnee said on December 31, 2010 at 1:53 PM@tim - there's only a problem when there is a tool at the end of the tool.58142857Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:53 PMThese ever-expanding enforcement powers miss the point: The threat posed by drunk driving comes not from drinking per se but from the impairment drinking can cause. That fact has been lost in the rush to demonize people who have even a single drink before getting behind the wheel (exemplified by the shift in the government's message from "Don't Drive Drunk" to "Don't Drink and Drive"). Several studies have found that talking on a cell phone, even with a hands-free device, causes more driver impairment than a 0.08 BAC. A 2001 American Automobile Association study found several other in-car distractions that also caused more impairment, including eating, adjusting a radio or CD player, and having kids in the backseat (for more on such studies, see the 2005 paper I wrote on alcohol policy for the Cato Institute).58142811Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:52 PMMany states have tried to solve this problem by claiming another invasive power: They are now allowing police to forcibly take a blood sample on the side of the road.58142796Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:51 PMCheckpoints are only the beginning of what California DWI attorney Lawrence Taylor calls "the drunk driving exception to the Constitution." The Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination has been turned upside down by state laws that instantly suspend the licenses of drivers who refuse to take roadside breath tests. Those breath tests are also fraught with problems. Most manufacturers of breath test machines have refused to turn over their source code, meaning DWI defendants can't assess the machines' margin of error, which can be a significant factor in a case where the difference between 0.80 and 0.79 for a first offense can be $1,000 or more in fines, mandatory alcohol awareness classes, and loss of driving privileges for up to a year.58142754Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:50 PMA typical checkpoint would consist of 20 or more cops, yield a dozen or more vehicle confiscations, but around three drunk driving arrests.58142742Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:49 PMThe roadblocks are also constitutionally problematic. In the 1990 decision Michigan v. Sitz ,the Supreme Court acknowledged that stops at sobriety checkpoints constitute "seizures" under the Fourth Amendment but ruled that the public safety threat posed by drunk driving made them "reasonable." In the years since, the checkpoints have become little more than revenue generators for local governments. When local newspapers inquire about specific roadblocks after the fact, they inevitably find lots of citations for seat belt offenses, broken headlights, driving with an expired license, and other minor infractions. But the checkpoints rarely catch seriously impaired drivers. In 2009, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley, 1,600 sobriety checkpoints in California generated $40 million in fines, $30 million in overtime pay for cops, 24,000 vehicle confiscations, and just 3,200 arrests for drunk driving. A typical checkpoint would consist of 2058142716Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:49 PMOnce the 0.08 standard took effect nationwide in 2000, a curious thing happened: Alcohol-related traffic fatalities increased, following a 20-year decline. Critics of the 0.08 standard predicted this would happen. The problem is that most people with a BAC between 0.08 and 0.10 don't drive erratically enough to be noticed by police officers in patrol cars. So police began setting up roadblocks to catch them. But every cop manning a roadblock aimed at catching motorists violating the new law is a cop not on the highways looking for more seriously impaired motorists. By 2004 alcohol-related fatalities went down again, but only because the decrease in states that don't use roadblocks compensated for a slight but continuing increase in the states that use them.58142689Flag this commentdontbefooled said on December 31, 2010 at 1:48 PMLooks like the revenue generators will be out in force tonight. Most Consider the 2000 federal law that pressured states to lower their BAC standards to 0.08 from 0.10. At the time, the average BAC in alcohol-related fatal accidents was 0.17, and two-thirds of such accidents involved drivers with BACs of 0.14 or higher. In fact, drivers with BACs between 0.01 and 0.03 were involved in more fatal accidents than drivers with BACs between 0.08 and 0.10. (The federal government classifies a fatal accident as "alcohol-related" if it involved a driver, a biker, or a pedestrian with a BAC of 0.01 or more, whether or not drinking actually contributed to the accident.) In 1995 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration studied traffic data in 30 safety categories from the first five states to adopt the new DWI standard. In 21 of the 30 categories, those states were either no different from or less safe than the rest of the country.58142684Flag this commentdallasgrump said on December 31, 2010 at 1:03 PMI don't understand the tradition of getting drunk on New Year's Eve. What's the purpose?58141189Flag this commenttim_denton said on December 31, 2010 at 12:42 PMThough not entirely legal to do, a firearm can be safely discharged regardless of city limits local or not.  Specifically, shooting down, never up, because the projectile(s) WILL come back down and accelerate until they terminate into something or someone.  Sometimes yard snakes, aggressive stray dogs, and other varmit simply require being shot and eliminated.  Firearms serve a purpose just like any yard tool.  But they should not be discharged to enhance celebrations, and should never be operated by a person whom is intoxicated or otherwise mentally impared.58140324Flag this commentsusieeq said on December 31, 2010 at 12:34 PMGo law enforcement, you get'm, they should go to jail and prison.58140032Flag this commentbware said on December 31, 2010 at 11:34 AMIdiots who shoot into the air, or in the city limits at all, should be charged with attempted murder or at the very least, deadly conduct.
