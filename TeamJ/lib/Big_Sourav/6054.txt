But the need to begin planning for a potentially tough Democratic primary on the ground  coupled with President Barack Obamas desire to move beyond the speculation swirling around Emanuel  is moving him closer to the door.If Emanuel leaves, Obamas senior adviser Pete Rouse is expected to temporarily replace him until a permanent replacement can be tapped after the November midterms.Earlier this month Obama said he hoped the 50-year-old former congressman would stay at the helm through the midterms. But the distraction caused by Emanuels very public courting of Chicago Democrats  and the announcement of senior advisor David Axelrods decision to join Obamas re-election campaign in Chicago next spring  increased pressure on Emanuel to decide sooner rather than later.On Monday, Obama told Matt Lauer on NBCs Today that Emanuel needed to move quickly if he plans to jump into the Feb. 22 primary.More..Despite criticism that Obamas too insular and too reluctant to venture beyond his comfort zone  the president feels little pressure to move outside the relatively small group of advisers and ex-campaign staffers who currently surround him in replacing Emanuel, aides say.Nor is Obama expected to pick a permanent chief of staff until after the November midterms, when the full extent of Democratic losses and GOP gains is fully known.The only names being seriously considered to replace Emanuel are three men who are already on Obamas team, according to officials: Deputy National Security Adviser Tom Donilon; Ron Klain, an aide to Vice President Joe Biden; and Obama senior adviser Pete Rouse, who might be called upon to temporarily replace Emanuel until a permanent replacement is found.The outsiders being mentioned include former Senate Majority LeaderTom Daschle, onetime Clinton chief of staff John Podesta who has said repeatedly he doesnt want the job and CIA DirectorLeon Panetta.Panetta, a former congressman who also served as a Clinton chief of staff, is reportedly the favorite pick of some Democrats on Capitol Hill, who say hed be best equipped to deal with a newly empowered Hill GOP.None is considered to be on Obamas shortlist at the momentMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesRahm Emanuel, Rahm running for Mayor of ChicagoRead moreDemocrats are fighting the internal fight also.Not just the GOP and the Tea party.September 24, 2010jamesb101No commentsIm highlighting again the agrumenet with the different factions in the Democrat party which are almost the same as the Tea Party and the Establishment Republicans.The problem in this countries politcal parties is that they are both fighting aginst staying the middle and compromise.Even within their own houses.This is NOT GOODNobody seems to be pushing for thegreater good for whole country.Not Good At all..From tarheel74 over @ MyDD..I had an interesting exchange on my previous post regarding who should take the blame for the abysmal outlook for Democrats. One of the basic problems I have with the party right now is the extremely bad messaging and the poor leadership which basically allows individual conservative Dems to thumb their nose at the Democratic party with impunity.However, much of that blame I would also lay at the feet of the administration that neutered the third party progressive groups during the key healthcare and financial regulation debates by stifling their money. This was well exemplified by theincident from which I get the heading:Sources at the meeting tell me that Emanuel really teed off on the Dem-versus-Dem attacks, calling them fking stupid. This was a direct attack on some of the attendees in the room, who are running ads against Dems right now.Tellingly, Rahm raised the specter of a loss on health care, sources at the meeting say  which suggests that the White House may be less certain about victory than officials allow publicly.But now we hear a very different kind of whining from the bubble Democrats. They are basically seeing Republican outside groups outspending Democratic group by a 5 to 1 margin.Their latest whine:Where are those guys? a top House Democratic aide demanded. There is very real and growing resentment over these groups being AWOL.And this Democratic aide fired a warning shot at liberal groups, suggesting that their absence from the campaign could have long-term ramifications.When these interest groups come to Democrats and say, We need you to do this, a lot of Democrats who survived 2010 will say, You werent there for us then.Liberal-leaning organizations answer that its not a matter of desire but something more simple: They dont have the money.One wonders how come the third party progressive groups do not have any money?Mike Lux at Open Left, who has worked for many years in organizing progressive third party advocacy has a great piece, the gist of it is like this..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesDemocrats, Political compromise, Progressives/Liberals vs The WH, Pull to the left of the Democratic party, Rahm Emanuel, Republicans/Tea PartyRead moreRahm starts dotting his is and crossing his tsmeets with rep.

Jesse Jackson Jr. Wednesday night to discuss the race for mayor of Chicago, a post for which both men are potential candidates.When reached by POLITICO, Jackson said that hes been meeting with a series of officials, including state Sen. James Meeks and fellow Democratic Reps. Danny Davis and Luis Gutierrez, on the matter. Jackson has also been in regular contact with another possible candidate, he said: Alderman Sandi Jackson, who is his wife.Indeed, many candidates are quickly gearing up for a two-tiered race that begins with an all-candidate primary and ends with a runoff between the top two finishers.Rahm and I agreed that the citys financial crisis puts Chicago at a tipping point. The ramifications of this tipping point could tear at the social, political and economic fiber that holds our city together and makes it great, Jackson said. Both of us are very concerned about the upcoming November 2nd election and the subsequent municipal elections, and agreed that every possible contender should conduct their effort on the moral high ground because our city deserves a very serious debate about its economic future.Jackson also noted that everyone is talking about the mayors race.Indeed, many candidates are quickly gearing up for a two-tiered race that begins with an all-candidate primary and ends with a runoff between the top two finishers.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesJesse Jackson Jr., Race for Mayor of Chicago, Rahm EmanuelRead moreValerie Jarrett to follow Rahm as Chief-of- Staff?September 7, 2010jamesb101No commentsValerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President ObamaThe next RahmThe suggestions that Rahm Emanuel will run for Mayor of Chicago assume that hell leave the White House soon after the midterms, which may coincide nicely with the demands for blood after a bad cycle.Which means: The second most important job in Washington, that of the White House chief of staff, may be just about to open.Emanuel has told Chicago associates, a source tells me, who he believes will likely succeed him: senior Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett.Other internal names have risen and fallen.The list is Here.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Updates, WomenRahm Emanuel, Valerie Jarrett, White House Chief of StaffRead moreMayor Daley WILL NOT run for re-election in Chicago!..September 7, 2010jamesb1018 commentsEmanuel and DaleyObama better start looking for a new Chief-of-Staff..Id think Rahm will be gone veryverysoooon!Daley Will Not Seek Re-ElectionChicago Mayor Richard Daley says he will not run for re-election in 2011, theChicago Tribune reports.Said Daley: The truth is I have been thinking about this for the past several months.

Two weeks later, having been named White House chief of staff, Emanuelgave his mantra the presidential imprimatur as he told a conference of business leaders organized by the Wall Street Journal: You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. . . . Things that we had postponed for too long, that were long-term, are now immediate and must be dealt with. This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.Now with the glub-glub economy going down for the third time and almost certainly taking congressional Democrats with it, Emanuels aphorism about the can-do benefits of a crisis seems more likely to make the Hubris Hall of Fame than the next edition of Bartletts Familiar Quotations. At minimum, with the benefit of hindsight, it should be rewritten as No crisis can fester for two years without dire political consequences.It is no secret that early on the Obama economic team misjudged how high the unemployment rate would soar  and how intractable the crisis would become. In contrast, Nobel Prize-winning liberal economist Paul Krugman presciently warned in a New York Times column written just after the 2008 election, Democrats won big last week  but they won even bigger in 1936, only to see their gains evaporate after the recession of 1937-38. Americans dont expect instant economic results from the incoming administration, but they do expect results, and Democrats euphoria will be short-lived if they dont deliver an economic recovery..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesPresident Obama, Rahm Emanuel, Running the government, The Obama AdminRead moreSomeone is spreading Rahm Emanuel wants to quit rumorsJune 21, 2010jamesb1016 commentsYou want to know something?This is like the 3rd time this rumor is out there.After a while things have a funny way of getting to be true.RahmWe know you are going back Chicago to run for Mayor..When?TheDaily Telegraph reports White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel has grown tired of the idealism of President Obamas inner circle and will quit within six to eight months in frustration at their unwillingness to bang heads together to get policy pushed through.Emanuel enjoys a good working relationship with Mr Obama but they are understood to have reached an understanding that differences over style mean he will serve only half the full four-year term.However,Fox News says the White House dismissed the report this morning as ludicrous.From PoliticalwireShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesCounterpoints, PoliticalDog 101, Rahm Emanuel, wants to quit, WH Chief of StaffRead moreRahm Emanuel gets a pat on the back?February 12, 2010jamesb101No commentsThis from a piece in PoliticalWire.In Praise of RahmEzra Klein: Its a bit weird to see so much blame accruing to Rahm Emanuel for the administrations woes. Emanuel wasnt part of the campaign team. He was brought in to help govern. In that capacity, his primary job was shepherding the administrations agenda through the legislative process. Ugly as that process was, Emanuel  and more to the point, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi  did a fairly masterful job at it. In the Senate, Democrats got all 60 of their members to sign onto the same large, controversial bill. Thats a legislative achievement [unprecedented] in modern times. Bill Clinton didnt manage it on any bills of this size and scope, and neither did George W. Bush.Klien goes on to say this in his Washington Post piecewhich the Dog wholeheartedly agreesIn this way, the lure of 60 votes was probably a curse for the Democrats. It meant they had enough support to build their first-year around major legislative accomplishments rather than adroit political positioning. That mightve worked, too, but an unexpected outcome in an unexpected election pulled the rug out from under that strategy.You nailed sir...Note:No matter what he does.Rahm Emanuel will always be the outsider in this administrationShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Healthcare, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesDemocrats, Healthcare, Rahm Emanuel, The AdministrationRead morePage 1 of 212Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
