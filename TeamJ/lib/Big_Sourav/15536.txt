There are certainly a lot of misunderstandings. Another problem is that some people don't know what constitutes abusive behavior - a mother at a local rec center kept hitting her kids in the head - hard - when they didn't obey her quickly enough and she was surprised when the piolice were called. She didn;t see anything wrong with it.Whitney053 years ago Wow! Great info. ThanksPatty Inglish, MS3 years ago You're welcome!

In some towns, the police do not want to be bothered with the paperwork when a report is made. I am a therapist and under the duty to report law, so I have to report all instances of child abuse that I encounter.I reproted a famly several years ago for sex abuse iof children in one suburb and the police called me and threated me with a 4th degree misdemeanor until I told them I am under the duty to report. They quickly got off the phone. Three of the policemen were fired soon after, because they were driving cruisers to the high school, getting behind young girls driving home, pulling them over and forcing them to have sex after threatening the girls with jail. These three officers forced the girls to drive to their own homes, where the police followed them in and raped them. After the firings, rthe story was buried.Abuse does exist.   Patty Inglish, MS3 years ago It's an ongoing battle to overcome obstacles to educate everyone about what exactly is abuse and how to prevent it -- And to help those that have siuffered it as well as those that do it. I think abusers must be miserable - this does not excuse their behaviors, but they cannot be happy, I think.Whitney053 years ago I wish that more could be done. Honestly.
