Useful Funny Awesome (2)Beautiful Leather FashionWearing the American FlagCommentsTriplet Mom22 months ago This is so timely because my daughter is a total pink fan and she just now got into black. There is something about that combination that she totally loves especially with the deeper pinks almost rose color pink.  I guess my baby girl has style (good for her cause I never had any lol).  Great hub!!BkCreative22 months ago This is all grand. I got the black items and just added some pink nailpolish.Thanks Princessa - you keep us up to date!funride22 months ago When I saw this request a few days ago I immediately thought of you Pricessa. And you didnt let me down, great hub. I never saw such a complete black & pink wardrobe. Thumb up.fishskinfreak200822 months ago My former English teacher, Caroline Paskiewiez once claimed that red and black WERE ONLY FOR WHORES, BUT THE FUNNY THING WAS THAT THOSE WERE THE ONLY COLORS SHE WORE (OK she wore white sometimes too). Then, there was the "I'm going to New Zealand with my husband. It's summer down there and it's nice". Hm. I wonder what she could have meant. This was in 1999. OK, now, nearly 10 years later, I understand. Some very interesting ideas. Thumbs upBrianS22 months ago Iv'e always been a fan of the little black dress (for my wife not me, before anyone says anything), but having looked at the photos in theis hub I may have changed my mind.Purple Perl22 months ago Thanks Princessa for a superb hub! I love pink and black too.I have a saree that is black with a border and motifs that are pink.I also have a salwar kameez in this combination.My daughter loves pink too and has many pinks in her wardrobe.Laila Rajaratnam22 months ago Great hub!A real feast for the eyes! The accessories are superb and Elizabeth Hurley's pink saree is awesome!Thanks! :)Princessa22 months ago Triplet Mom : pink and black is a vibrant combination, no wonder your daughter likes it and being young means that she can dare wear all the shades of pink mmm I am jealousBkCreative : you are welcome !Funride :thanks for the thumbs up.fishskinfreak2008 : Only people with character can afford to wear vibrant combinations.  Thanks for the thumbs up.BrianS: Never too late to try something new.Purple Perl: Pink and black sarees are stunning, they look fantastic, no wonder so many celebrities are so keen to wear them.Laila: Thanks for stopping to comment Laila.  Me too I love Elizabeth Hurleys saree it looks so elegant!Whitney0522 months ago So I loved the eye makeup, but I really hope she doesn't go out like that one the regular. I'm pretty sure she'd get made fun of in my town. I've seen some people try to do runway makeup, and end up looking like clowns because they're not on the runway. That's what she would accomplish, even though it looked really good.Princessa22 months ago Whitney05 : I know what you mean.  Me too I spend most of my time in a small town and one needs to dress and make up accordingly, otherwise it looks seriously out of place.  I keep my most daring outfits for the city ;-)Whitney0522 months ago I'm from a larger town, a military town, but boy-o-boy would she still look out of place, even with the crazies I've seen around town. She'd get made fun of severely if you ask me...  There is a time and place to put that much makeup on, and it's not every day. HaJennifersJumpers22 months ago I have to admit that pink is not a color that I didn't own a lot of.  It just came over me all of a sudden that I didn't own pink and I had to go out and get some.   Maybe it's becuase I sew children's clothing and pink and brown and pink and green seem to be all the rage.  I guess I looked at pink so much that I had to have it.  I just finished a black dress with pink polka dots and the ribbon to tie it closed will be pink with black polka dots.  I am sure that dress will make some little girl happy.Princessa22 months ago Whitney05 : It is a shame that someone would be made fun of just because of the make up she is wearing.JennifersJumpers: pink can be very cute -as in a little girl's dress- or it can be sexy or shocking as in some of the dresses above.  I like a colour that can be all that!  Thanks for stopping to comment.AshleyVictoria21 months ago Betsey Johnson - my fave designer, and she's such a lover of great pink designs!Whitney0521 months ago I definitely agree it is sad, but sometimes people need help with their makeup. I've seen females try really hard to do model-like eyeshadow, and it come across looking like a clown. But, it happens... :-/Princessa21 months ago AshleyVictoria: I just had a look at the Betsey Johnson site... nice collection!Whitney05: That's why I don't wear too much make up :)threesweds21 months ago Princessa, pink is definitely a very feminine color, however it too can be part of a man's wardrobe.  Pastel pink is a popular color for men's shirts, slacks, neckties, and sweaters.  When I wear a pink shirt, it brightens my day, especially if I am also wearing some very pink matching lingerie.  A real stress relief!!  Where can I find the pink corset with sassy black accents you show above?  I love your hubs.Princessa21 months ago threesweds: I think that pale pink looks great in dark coloured skin men.The pink corsets you can find them on Amazon.com (there are direct links on the left of the pictures for some of them)Dolores Monet21 months ago never been fond of pink, it reminds me of that pink stuff they make you drink when you're a kid and have a stomach problem...pink is nice on flowers and in sunsets...i've painted rooms pink for the soft glow, but me no wear pink...maybe i ahve some gender issuesPrincessa18 months ago Hi Dolores, no problem with gender issues :) we all have our favourite colours and our own idea of how and where to use them.

They are both blondes and look adorable in that color combo. I on the other hand I am a redhead with very pale skin. I can pull off the black, but pink hates me with a passion.designer apparel7 months ago Pink color is mostly suited on fairy ladies or only kids(girls).Pink and black color is normally all womens favorites.For more clothing online visit on our website designer apparelMonika Rumin6 weeks ago Very nice hub, I love pink and black combinations. :)Dazzling Image6 weeks ago Pink is a very sweet color. It makes one feel bright and happy. I especially like the black and pink shoes which you have shared. They are so beautiful and gives the wearer a "princess" feel.Princessa6 weeks ago advoco: that's the main thing ;-)Disturbia: if you want to try the pink&black look you can still try accesories like the pink and black shoes, or handbags in black with pink accents that won't clash with your hair colour.designer: thanks for the visitMonika: I like it too.  I've recently got the black and pink dress (pencil skirt with high waist) it looks really chic!Dazzling: It does, pink is somehow related to fairy tales and princesses.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sitesBlack And Pink in the NewsWe HAVE To Say Something About How Cute Pregnant Pink Is!MTV43 hours ago(Credit: Splash News) Here we see a pretty, pregnant Pink recently spotted relaxing with her husband Carey Hart on vacation in Hawaii.
