Information may change rapidly as the event progresses.Brett Favre's retirement controversy occurred when allegations came forward of Favre's intent to still play football, months after a tear filled press conference on March 3, 2008 when Brett Favre officially announced his retirement from the National Football League and the Green Bay Packers. Following his official retirement from the NFL, reports on July 2, 2008 emerged of Favre's 'itch' to come back and play football.[1] A week later, Favre sent a letter to the Packers asking for his unconditional release to allow him to play for another NFL team,[2] but manager Ted Thompson refused to release him,[3] and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback. In an interview with Greta Van Susteren Favre spoke publically about the issue for the first time, where he stated his views of the Packer's organization and his commitment to return to football.[4]On July 16, 2008, the Packers filed tampering charges against the Minnesota Vikings with the league office, alleging improper communication between Vikings offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and Favre.[5] Favre officially filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29, 2008.[6]Contents1 History of the controversy1.1 Initial retirement1.2 'Itch' to return to football1.2.1 Interview with Greta Van Susteren1.3 Packers reaction and tampering charges1.4 Reinstatement2 Player and fan reactions3 Notes and references4 External links[edit] History of the controversy[edit] Initial retirementIn his final seasons in Green Bay, Favre often took weeks or months of time in the off-season to contemplate retirement. In Favre's last game of 2006, Favre became choked-up in an interview after the game when asked about a return. In the offseason, however, Favre stated his intent to play the next year.[7] Prior to the Packers' playoff game in the 2007 season, Favre stated his desire to continue playing football for another season.[8]On March 4, 2008, Favre formally announced his retirement.[9][10] Although Favre stated that he had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win are small, and that he wasn't up for the challenge. Favre's agent, Bus Cook, stated "Nobody pushed Brett Favre out the door but then nobody encouraged him not to go out that door either. I don't think he had a lot of encouragement to stay, but nobody told him to leave either."[11] Cook also believed that Favre had not gotten the impression from the Packers that they wanted him back. Two days after his retirement at his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, had nothing to do with what the Packers did or didn't do. He said, seemingly contradictory to Cook's statements, that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he didn't want to play anymore. He said during the conference, "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to."[12]Favre stated that if the Packers asked him to return in an emergency situation, that "it would be hard to pass up." He stressed, however, that he would only return if he was in shape.[13] The Packers anounced they would retire Favre's number (4) at half-time in the first game of the season against division rival, Minnesota Vikings, on national television.[14] On April 25, 2008, the Green Bay Packers placed Favre on the official reserve/retired list.[15][edit] 'Itch' to return to footballOn July 3, 2008, reports came forward that Favre was in communication with head coach Mike McCarthy. The reports explained that Favre's family had been tugging him to return, and Favre had the 'itch' to play. The Mississippi Sun Herald confronted Favre about the recent reports, but Favre stated that "it's all rumor". Favre told the newspaper in a text-message that there's "No reason for [the media storm]."[1] Favre's brother, however, told reporters that Favre has been working out, and a return is "50-50". Allegations also came forward of Bus Cook asking the Packers to release Favre. Packers sources stated that the situation was all speculation, and that Favre would remain retired.[1]Three days after reports his 'itch' to return, Favre asked for his unconditional contractual release in a letter to the Packers. The letter was by Bus Cook, who then then sent it to the Green Bay Packers. Months prior to the reports, Favre began working out with a local high school football team in Mississippi. After his letter to be released, ESPN reported that Favre was in "excellent physical condition" while practising with the high school team.[16][edit] Interview with Greta Van SusterenOn July 14, 2008, Favre spoke publicly for the first time about his return to football. He appeared on Fox News in the program "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren" to speak about his retirement reversal. Favre made reports about coach Mike McCarthy:"And [Mike McCarthy] says, 'Well, playing here is not an option, but we can't envision you playing with another team, you know, either.' And I thought, so basically, I'm not playing for anyone if I choose to come back."Greta Van Susteren asked Favre about his reports that he was "never fully committed" to retirement, and that he felt pressured by the Packers to make a decision by manager Ted Thompson. Favre stated that he knew the Packers wanted to move on, but thought the Packers should release him if that was the case. Favre also stated his displeasures with Ted Thompson's descisions to not sign crucial players, such as Randy Moss, Marco Rivera and Mike Wahle. He also stated his displeasure that the Packers did not interview Steve Mariucci for a head coaching job once coach Mike Sherman was fired. In the interview, Favre stated his displeasure with Thompson:"And none of those had anything to do with me retiring once again but, you know, it's hard for me to trust, you know, this guy when I -- either I'm told one thing and everyone else is told another, or he's telling the public one thing and telling me another," Favre said, according to the newspaper. "And so -- and that's part of the reason for [requesting] the release. Not only was I told that playing here was not an option, we're moving on -- it's kind of in their company line, moving on. That's OK."[17]In the second part of the interview, Favre said he was tempted to show up to the upcoming Packers training camp. He stated that he didn't want to go beck "just to stick it to them" and knew it would be a media circus regardless of his attendance. Favre also stated his sorrow for the Packers current starting quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. He stated that Thompson and McCarthy did not care about Favre's legacy, and that a trade would be the only way to get his way. In his final words, Favre said there was a possibility that he would not come back to play. [18][edit] Packers reaction and tampering chargesThe Packers promptly declined Favre's request to be released to free agency. Despite not releasing Favre to free agency, Ted Thompson and Mike McCarthy remained committed to Aaron Rodgers as the Packers starting quarterback. Thompson reported that the team has "moved forward", but would still let him play a role in the organization. Thompson described the situation as "gut-wrenching" and sensitivity hurts a lot of people. Thompson and McCarthy told reporters that Favre was considering returning in late March. Favre cancelled a scheduled meeting in Mississippi and told Thompson and McCarthy that he had changed his mind and wanted to stay retired. Following the cancelled meeting, the Packers began to move on with Rodgers as their new quarterback. The Packers also drafted two quarterbacks in the 2008 NFL Draft. The Packers stated that Favre continuously said from June 21 to July 8 that he would not play. Thompson said the situation was a distraction, but still cared about the legacy of Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers.[19] The Packers president, Mark Murphy stated his support for McCarthy and Thompson in their dealings with Favre.[20]On July 16, 2008 reports surfaced from FoxSports.com that the Packers filed a tampering charge with the league against division rival Minnesota Vikings for alleged contact with Brett Favre. The Packers stated that they had strong evidence against the Vikings. Despite rumors of the Vikings need for a quarterback, officials stated they were committed to current quarterback Tarvaris Jackson. The report claimed that Favre engaged in an inappropriate dialogue with Vikings offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell.[21] Report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Favre used a Packers-issued cell phone to make calls to Bevell and head coach Brad Childress.[22] Sources close to Favre repelled the reports, stating that Favre did not have a Packers issued cell phone.[21] Favre denied the Vikings "tampering", and called the cell-phone reports "bogus".[23] The Vikings would face possible fines or loss of draft pick if the allegation were found true.[24][21]Following NFL commissioner Rodger Goodell's request to resolve the controversy on July 23, the Packers began telephoning several teams for a possible trade. Goodell encouraged the organization to accelerate the process by surveying teams around the league. Goodell also said he would reinstate Favre as an active player if he were to officially make the request. Favre's preference trended toward the Minnesota Vikings, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were also included in speculation.[25] Favre told the Packers that he was closed to a trade to the New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, both teams which the Packers surveyed.[23][edit] ReinstatementBefore Favre would be eligible to play, he would need to file an official letter to commissioner Rodger Goodell, along with his approval. On July 28, Favre sent the official letter seeking reinstatement to the Green Bay Packers, but did not send it in to the NFL offices.[23]On July 29, Favre officially faxed his reinstatement letter to the NFL. Before the move was approved, the Packers made an offer to Favre to stay retired. The deal would give Favre $25 million over 10 years if Favre were to retire. Favre told ESPN that he was contemplating the offer, but knew it would not accomplish his goal to return to playing football.The move was approved by Goodell nearly a week later on August 3, and became effective the next day on August 4.[edit] Player and fan reactions[edit] Notes and references^ a b c Mortensen, Chris (2008-07-02).
