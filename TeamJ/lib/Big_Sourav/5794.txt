As best I can tell, its beginnings came in fits and starts. I remember participating in a Coop back in 1971, where we went to the North County to buy produce and eggs from small farmers. We drove back to Ocean Beach in a my 1962 Corvair (It was unsafe at every speed!) full of assorted boxes and sorted them out into individual orders at the STP (Serve The People) storefront, located on the 4900 block of Voltaire St. That storefront didnt last very long, due to our landlords distaste for the vandalism incurred on the property by assorted right wingers. After the plate glass window on the front of the building was smashed a second time, we were gone.57 commentsRead the full article The Lie MachineSeptember 29, 2009On the first day of August, a mob of 200 right-wing Texans stormed the parking lot of a Randalls grocery store in southwest Austin. They were united in a single goal: Disrupt the office hours that Rep. Lloyd Doggett, the districts congressman, had scheduled for his constituents. The protesters targeted Doggett for his role in crafting the Houses bill to reform health care, brandishing signs that read No Government Health Care and No Government Counselor in My Home!!! But their anger seemed to encompass a universe of conservative fears: higher taxes, illegal immigration, socialism. 5 commentsRead the full article UC Santa Cruz students occupy campus building in protest of cutsSeptember 27, 2009Editor: We have heard that students at UC Santa Cruz have taken over a campus building in protest of the cuts proposed for the UC system.

Way to go Mary!_________________________Culture Shock and the ABCs of break-dancing.So heres the move, says Joseph Dyno Rock Corrales, before sweeping his right leg under his entire body, hopping on his left foot and switching arms. His legs move with no thought, so intent is he on watching his charges imitate him. A hip-hop track fills the room, and the stars of the class, 14- and 15-year-olds with bodies like Gumby, match their steps to the music.2 commentsRead the full article Local Law Professor Thinks Bush and Cheney Should Be ProsecutedSeptember 26, 2009Editor: Marjorie Cohn teaches law at Thomas Jefferson School of Law  my old alma mater  plus she is the national president of the National Lawyers Guild.

What do you think about art installations on top of Peace Rock? This became an issue lately, when a group of Point Loma High School seniors placed their year 2010 in wood red numbers up on the rock.  The rock is the large, protruding rocky sentinel that juts out of the Pacific Ocean just south of where Froude Street runs into Sunset Cliffs Boulevard.  Everybody who has driven, walked, or  jogged along Sunset Cliffs knows it.14 commentsRead the full article Michael Moore: Capitalism as Comedy and Tragedy Now Playing in NY and L.A. and September 26, 2009by Michael Moore______________Friends,The time has arrived for, as Time magazine called it, my magnum opus.

Many early critics and viewers have called it my best film yet. 3 commentsRead the full article I walked the line at the UCSD strike.September 25, 2009by Anna Daniels_____________I arrived at the UCSD La Jolla campus just as the planned rally began, picked up a sign and joined over a hundred striking employees and supporters.

Now three hundred strong, 4 commentsRead the full article Hmmm ..September 24, 2009by Ernie McCray_____________I feel like Arsenio Hall because everywhere I roam I see things that make me go: Hmmm. Like these crazy people Ive seen on TV. You know the ones, theyre all blue in the face, looking scarily Incredible Hulkish, some of them without a shred of insurance, shrieking at a man who has: put keeping them healthy and well so they dont have to foreclose on their American Dreams high up on his list of things to do.10 commentsRead the full article From OB to Burning Man and back  with picsSeptember 24, 2009by SunshineAs my son, Van, and I planned and prepared for this years trip to Burning Man, I had no expectations and really no idea what would occur. What can I say to sum up such an epic journey that it ultimately transformed my entire existence?For months before the event, we planned ~ I, of course, made my usual notes and massive to-do lists ~ checking off everything as we went: shop for supplies, have the van checked, and eventually pack up for the long journey away from OB. 13 commentsRead the full article 5,000 Rally at UC Berkeley Against Budget Cuts / Increased FeesSeptember 24, 2009BERKELEY  Thousands of UC students marched through downtown Berkeley and the area around campus this afternoon, staging a sit-down protest and blocking traffic as part of a demonstration against cuts to the university budget and proposed fee increases.The unscheduled march started at the end of a two-hour rally on Sproul Plaza attended by an estimated 5,000 students, professors and other university employees.  7 commentsRead the full article The First Circle of the OB Rag  circa 1970September 24, 2009The Etiwanda HouseThe initial circle of the OB Rag newspaper consisted of Frank Gormlie, a local who had grown up in Point Loma, who had surfed in OB in his youth, and a recent graduate of UCSD  the Rag had been Gormlies brainchild as he saw it as a handy way to do community organizing in OB; the circle also included Bo Blakey, fresh from the campus battles at UC Berkeley and another graduate with Gormlie of Pt.

I wouldnt call it a right.  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.)Slavery used to be cool, and that was even before cool was cool. In fact, slavery was beyond cool  it was something people didnt think about one way or the other, because there was no other.Just a few hundred years ago, just about everywhere, slavery was an accepted part of life, like families and work and the sun coming up in the morning and the Padres trading away franchise players. 2 commentsRead the full article 1-Day Strike at UCSD and All UC Campuses TodaySeptember 24, 2009Support the one-day strike up at UCSD today.

They rallied and then marched down Park Blvd to City College.  And they rallied and marched for the rest of us.  They really wanted to march on Sacramento, but had to settle for downtown San Diego.It was high noon in front of the Navy Hospital near Balboa Park.  0 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
