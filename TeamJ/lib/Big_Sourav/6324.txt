Now, Professional golfers, Dustin and Natalie are combining their superhero powers. Gulbis confirmed this weekend what has been rumored: She and Johnson are a couple.

"I'll let Dustin handle our PR," Gulbis said with a laugh after confirming to the website they are dating. Johnson declined comment.Smart man. Natalie already has him trained well, apparently: Keep your mouth shut and look good, DJ.
