It is the here and now while they are young that molds them and determines their level of success in life. While this may seem like a huge weight of responsibility on you the parent, it is the here and now that determines what your child will achieve and enjoy as an adult.One of the most basic laws of life is earning power. Each and every child on the face of this planet will one day grow up and earn a certain amount of money. It is this amount that determines the degree to which they enjoy options. Money is the means by which they get everything they have and nows the time to learn the eb and flow of it in order to develop good habits.   To Give or Not to Give Your Child an Allowance - Teach Kids About MoneyTo give or not to give your child an allowance teach kids about moneyWhat You Do MattersIt takes a child little time to learn the power of I want, or Can I have that and while busy parents rush through a shopping experience how prepared for this are you? Do you opt for the time saving sure honey and toss it in the cart or into their cute and adoring hands? This is a breeding ground for a distorted sense of how things are acquired. At a very young age children can learn the value of a buck and understand its true value. In life we are paid a set amount for the level of skill at which we perform task. Far too little is taught about money in school. It is up to you the parent to give your child the truth and fact regarding money they need to succeed. To give or not to give your child an allowance teach kids about moneyLearn the Cut and PasteChildren soon develop the, I wants and its no wonder with all the advertisements they are hit with on TV, radio, books and stores. In fact, if you just take a moment to notice all the brightly colored ads everywhere you go, it wont take you long to note your babies are being heavily marketed. After all marketers know where the heart strings are the purse strings are not far behind.

The next time your child brings an advertisement to you and shows you a picture of what they want, have them go set with scissors and craft materials. Tell you child to cut out what they want and make a chart including the price of the item. You will need to show them the prices as this is something they may not be aware. Ah ha, we first make them aware of cost. Cut and paste the item and its cost on a board and explain the amount it cost. Go on to explain that anytime something is needed we plan and save for that item and once the money is set aside bit by bit the item can then be purchased. Ah they have just learned the concept of budget!Explain the PowerNow comes the part where you explain how things cost money and how it is earned. Go on to explain that a certain amount of money is earned for a certain task. This is when you add an outline of things your child is expected to do for two dollars a week. Experts say you start out with a dollar around the age of two or when ever they get the I wants but I like two given inflation and all. Besides two bills has much more charm and allure than does one.

You then explain this is how you earn your two dollars a week. Go further to explain you use your money to buy the things you want. This is where the chart comes into play. You will need to guide your child as to how much money they want to put toward each item each week. Once they reach the goal they will have learned the power of earning it. The most powerful lesson earned here is that of impulse. After working to save the money the child often feels the item just isnt worth it or not something they really truly wanted at all. It feels good to lose the impulse spending habit!The Next Shopping TripNaturally your child has formed a habit of asking for things and you tossing them into the cart. Its important that from here out when your child ask for something you reply, How much of your money did you bring to pay for that? The idea is to allow them to spend it freely at first but the key is for you to be firm and reminding them each time they want something to stick to the plan of spending within their budget. You will be amazed at how quickly they shift their thinking about the I wants.

This was good in both regards. I outlined a chart of chores that paid a set amount which allowed the kids to earn more toward the purchases they wanted.No BrainerYoure obviously intelligent enough to understand the power behind this approach and that it does far more than teach your child about money. This in fact empowers your child to feel good about themselves, their abilities and teaches them practical life skills. It also gives them incentive to do well in school to raise their adult earning power and options in life.All in all this is a win win for everyone involved, so put your own personal twist to it and by all means please do give your child an allowance!To give or not to give your child an allowance teach kids about moneyOther Powerful Learning ToolsThis is a wonderful time in both the life of you and your child.

I'm pretty torn on this one. lol  I was a spoiled brat and never had to do anything for my allowance and I will say that I never appreciated anything until I was broke and on my own and had to work for things and then had to grow up fast.  I do think children should get an allowance however I feel that chores and responsibilities should be involved so they appreciate it.

I prepare all foods that she might need to eat while in school so I usually don't give her allowance most of the times.

I mean, I have 9, 6 and 3 yr olds, I recently started to give them weekly pocket money (depending on weekly spelling and times tables scores and behavior) and the most difficult thing for a busy mother is to be consistent with this. I will definitely try my best to continue teaching them about the value of money as it is definitely an important part of parenting.Thanks for the great advice!katiem22 weeks ago living earth, Great to hear about you devotion to teaching your children the value of money.
