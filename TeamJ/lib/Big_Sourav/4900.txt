I could not be a candidate and I could not vote. If my business was not a good enough reason for me to vote as a business owner in OB, then its not good enough for me to vote in the board election.But what happened?9 commentsRead the full article U-T: OB Rag publisher removed from town council ballotAugust 27, 2010By Christopher Cadelago / UNION-TRIBUNE /August 26, 2010OCEAN BEACH  Its official. Frank Gormlie, the activist, lawyer and co-founder of the OB Rag, will not be on the ballot as a candidate for the Ocean Beach Town Councils board of directors.  Gormlie, who hoped to be one of eight candidates  including six incumbents  vying for seven seats on the dais, had been told that because the business was based out of his Lemon Grove home, he was not eligible to run.At town council meeting Wednesday night, Gormlie said he had secured a lease in Ocean Beach to house his business, but was told he was still not eligible to run because he did not submit the business address by the Aug. 16 deadline.5 commentsRead the full article Over a third of all San Diego homeless are vetsAugust 27, 2010by Dylan Mann / Voice of San Diego / Originally posted August 25, 2010You see them in the medians at intersections and at the bottom of freeway off-ramps. Suntanned and weary in camouflage pants, they hold magic-markered signs announcing: HOMELESS VET  ANYTHING HELPS  GOD BLESS. And you feel empathy for them, dont you? No matter what you think of our nations military campaigns, its undeniable that here before you is a person that once served our country, but now he sleeps outside and isnt sure when hell eat next.5 commentsRead the full article Rep.

Jeff Light, newly ensconced as Union-Tribune editor, asked me out to lunch. I wasnt expecting a free lunch and conversation; I was just trying to get a letter to the editor published. After I cleaned the froth off my monitorit was one of those moments when I shouldnt have chugging diet Dr Pepper while reading my email, I typed sure, lets do it and hit the send button.19 commentsRead the full article Democracy, the OB Town Council, and Grassroots ActivismAugust 26, 2010Last night at their packed public meeting, I pleaded with the Ocean Beach Town Council to allow me to remain a candidate on their ballot for the annual Board election which has just begun.They didnt, and without a discussion or even a vote among Board members, Town Council president Jim Musgrove ruled against me.  Jim Musgrove came into the meeting having already made up his mind: Gormlie was off the ballot.In the amidst of their agenda, the Council slid into their advertised Candidate Forum  20 commentsRead the full article OB says no to dense developmentAugust 26, 2010OCEAN BEACH  The main advisory group for land use and development in Ocean Beach has rebuffed a proposal that could weaken building restrictions in the coastal community.  The Ocean Beach Planning Board this month unanimously rejected plans to change what many architects and bureaucrats refer to as the floor area ratio and bring it in line with standards in place across the city. Board members argued that increasing the current ratio or relaxing parking requirements could spur too much development and lead to the eradication of an estimated 300 to 400 historic cottages.3 commentsRead the full article OB Lawyer Rant: Town Council motives to bar Gormlie should be questionedAugust 25, 2010by Anonymous OB LawyerSince this would appear to be an interpretation of an organizations bylawsI would want to know more about what the definition of work in OB means. Is there a further definition of what work means. Does it indicate that a person must work for a business that has a property and license in OB? If the bylaws are silent on this, then it really isnt a stretch to say that Frank might qualify as working in OB.In a civil court of lawmaking an argument that a PO Box doesnt count would be a very very weak argument.13 commentsRead the full article Mother harassed for breastfeeding in Orange County store  organizes a nurse-inAugust 25, 2010A Southern California mother is outraged she was asked to stop breastfeeding her baby in public.Rose Homme, a mother of two from Orange County, said the incident happened Friday at the Cost Plus World Market located at the Village at Orange.

After some brief intros by Jack Hamlin, we were directed to choose one of four areas to meet over  public facilities, community, government, and activities. 9 commentsRead the full article Reaching Across Time in the Sunset of Our YearsAugust 25, 2010Ahhh, what a time we had, my childhood friend from Tucson and I. Jim Hopkin.Our visit was like a fantasy, as there was a time in our lives when neither he or I could have imagined a scenario wherein someday I would cruise up to a sidewalk in a nice chine, as we used to say, in front of Southwest Airlines and he jumps in and I whisk him to a Comfort Inn and we end the day in one of the hippest Mexican Cafes in town  with nary a soul in any of these places wearing a P.U. frown.Back then we knew no one who had flown any where  the concept of a colored person staying in a hotel had not yet been implanted in our young minds  and we couldnt eat in a cafe unless the sign above it read Jacks Barbeque or Dukes Drive-In.8 commentsRead the full article Out of Control Egg Producer Flouts Regulations: Consumers Deal with 500 Million Salmonella-Tainted EggsAugust 25, 2010by Jill Richardson / AlterNet / August 25, 2010 |The recent recall of 500 million eggs due to salmonella should surprise no one.The official term agribusiness will use to refer to Austin Jack DeCoster, the owner of the farm that produced the tainted eggs, is bad apple. Thats what they call anyone who gets caught for outrageous ethical breaches in agriculture. Farmers who are caught abusing their animals and workers, committing flagrant environmental crimes, and selling record amounts of tainted food are all bad apples. The implication is that everyone else, those who havent made front-page headlines for their bad behavior, would never dream of doing such a thing on their farms.2 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
