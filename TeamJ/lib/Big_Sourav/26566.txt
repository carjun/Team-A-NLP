We are that source.  Somerelationships in our lives are simply not meant to be.  But then some of those relationships are justso hot, that we just cant help but be caught in the vortex of an emotionalimbalance between the partners. Inevitably, these types of relationships are spawned from chemistry sointense that the partners generally, in their own ways; become dependent on thedeeply emotional waves that they experience. Both sayings; Opposites attractand being at 6s and 7s with someone, certainly would apply to suchrelationships. Often the six is so addictive, that we are blinded by it andoblivious to the potentially negative effects of the seven.  So often these types of attraction candevelop into an unhealthy co-dependent relationship, for the parties. Below is a poem of hope forSuzy, who had the balance in her relationships undermined by a heavy overexposure to benzodiazepines that had been prescribed to her solely for thepurpose helping her sleep.  When herdoctor was challenged as to why he would keep her on such cruel drugs, renownedfor their emotional and nerve degradation, he refused to speak, clearly knowinghe had abused the patients trust and health; as a result of an 8 year exposureto a drug not recommended to be taken continuously for more than 6 months.  A true story, her pain and her pleasure isnot so unique. In bitter sweet transitions she would change from a tame and loving woman to wild cat.You've switched off.Yep yell at meAnd storm out againIve switched offCant hear what you sayI just watch your lipsAnd wonder howHow thin they becomeHow well you curlYour angerHands on your hipsHow I once loved Someone who was like youSomeone who dreamedSomeone who caredNot this angry bitchShes lost all respectFor herselfFor our heartsFor the dreams that wesharedYouve switched offCant hear what I sayCant take this anymoreCant let you make this playIm not sorry that I caredAnd that I dreamed tooBut I am sorry thatI called you a bitchAt a time I know you hurtOn a sometimes Crazy dayThat can and doesSwing either waySo we need to breatheWe need to smileWe need to not Be angry anymoreTime out to findWhy this stormKeeps rolling throughA precious friendshipThe love we once sawAnd what it made us do.  I knew your back so well... did you ever find those words that I left written across your shoulders?Intense passions rule and come and go in deep wet sensual waves.So in the calm restoredPlease tell me what is trueBecause, I just cant helpClinging to the pain Pain behind the wordsSpoken on such distant days I find it is just so hardNo matter what you doYou make me acheAnd swallow all my prideIn such cruel, cruel waysYou hold my heartAnd squeeze it hardJust to show me that you canThose pouting lipsAre full againYour scent is allThat I can breatheLove, hate, loveDestructivenessObsessive things we doIf I must I will love you like a foolAnd ask myselfMost every day whyThese intense passions ruleAnd come and goIn deep wetSensual wavesWe rise and rise this wayOnly dawn can make us restI hate, that I loved thisCrazy foreplay at its bestThat crazy, crazy, crazyLife that we hadSpent fighting and forgivingCo-dependency, that is trueGod I loved those crazy,crazyCrazy toxic waysOf loving of you oo0oo  Copyright  2010  Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rightsreserved.  What Happens Next?For many who get intorelationships like this, they often find that there is a constant feeling that onemust walk on eggshells just to avoid the awareness that at any time, theother can loose it over the slightest thing. There is often a power play thatis going on in the background, where one of the partners has convinced theother and themselves, that they are a victim. Generally, a dark issue of self esteem feeds that role to the point thatthe other partner unwittingly takes up the role of rescuer.   Within a short span of time the victimtakes full emotional advantage of that power over the rescuer and that ishow the whole relationship is expected to be conducted.  Effectively, this is actually an abusiverelationship, even though there are times when incredible highs occur, whichthen tend to be followed by incredible lows. If this sounds like an emotional roller-coaster, it is because it is andyou cant jump out while your car is swinging off the corners and roaringthrough corkscrews. Best advice: get outbefore you are accused of some imaginary event or carted off to a policestation, accused of domestic violence. They love you. They just dont know what that means, as they have veryself love.   When a relationship isindirectly affected by the side effects of very harsh drugs; then loving thatperson means that you have to try to ignore that bad behavior and concentrateon the positive aspects of the relationship! Get the picture?  There are NO Positives about an abusiverelationship, are there?   Good luck Lovehurts.   Copyright  2010  Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rightsreserved.

I can relate, but am glad it's in the past.Pearldiver2 months ago Hello alekhouse, thank you for reading this work and for commenting on an issue that many of us have experienced and I guess many others will. If the underlying message here is taken, then perhaps others will know how to avoid the destructiveness that has the potential for negatively affecting one's future relationships. It is as you say: an absolutely heart wrenching bad. Thanks again for the weight of your wisdom. Take Care.LindaJM2 months ago I've been in similar relationships but didn't know the reason my friends were acting out. It can be very confusing and the pain is intense. Your poetry encapsulates that experience - one that too many people share.Pearldiver2 months ago Hi LindaJM, thank for reading this and sharing your experience. You have been reading one of my experiences. You are right, we often don't know why our friends are acting that way.... mine banned me from going back... lol.We forget that our real friends tend to know us most don't we? Take care and cheers.always exploring2 months ago I have never experienced this kind of relationship, but reading your touching words is a reminder of the pain that one goes through with addiction and codependency.A great informative hub.CheersNellieanna2 months ago Wow.Whikat2 months ago The tears sting a little as they roll down my cheeks. I can relate all too well. I just got off of that roller coaster ride a couple years back. I guess I am still recovering everyday, and putting the pieces of my heart back together again. After all that has happened, I still miss the person he was before the drugs.I believe drugs can be worse than death, because sometimes they kill the best parts in the most beautiful people. Thank you for sharing this beautiful piece and the words of wisdom to warn others.Pearldiver2 months ago Always Exploring, thank you for taking the time to read this poem of hope on a subject that many may never have the courage of admitting that they knew they were, or are in and how destructive not walking away with some dignity, can be in the long run. I'm pleased that you have avoided such relationships AE. We don't often look for them; they just appear at the point that care most for the other person and you must make the decision to either care for yourself (and Leave) or care for them (and Stay in the hope the madness passes). So many people have had their life light extinguished in these type of affairs. Take Care and be well.Pearldiver2 months ago Nellieanna, Hi.. thanks for reading this and having the ability to say so much with just a single word. Wow indeed.Just another little twist in the human condition, isn't it?Take care and be well.Pearldiver2 months ago Hi Whikat, thank you for taking the time to read this and perhaps see that there are many 'survivors' of this style of relationship. We all have scars.. both partners are scarred.. that is part of the tragic, foreseeable outcome.. some that have taken half a lifetime to heal. For a 'rescuer' I guess it is like stopping to help someone getting beaten up by their partner... stepping in to help and having them both then turn of you, happy that their game has brought the heightened buzz of kicking a caring stranger!So yeah, one step at a time, purposely further away from the emotional blackmail. You be strong for you and take care.SomewayOuttaHere2 months ago ....yea, emotional blackmail....pretty intense relationship ...thankfully I haven't had the experience....felt your words.....it's hard to heal deep, deep scars when both have them.....Pearldiver2 months ago Hi SomewayOuttaHere, these are extremely intense relationships; which is a lot of the original attraction. The scars come from how two people tear each other down from that intensity. It's just Tres BS! Take care, thanks for reading this work.Christopher Price2 months ago It's no wonder that vampire, werewolf and zombie movies are so in vogue; where sensitive caring people are sucked into hopelessly destructive relationships with creatures that once were wonderful, caring, loving partners, but are now hollow shells only slightly resembling what they once were.It is the occasional glimpse of their now lost humanity that never quite lets you cut all ties and save yourself.The analogy is fitting and the primal passion play is all around us.Like the vampire who has no reflection, neither partner seems able to look in the mirror and see who they have become, preferring the illusion they are the people who once deserved one another's love.This was a well done hub and the poem all too familiar.CPPearldiver2 months ago Hello CP, Thanks so much for such an excellent and relevant analogy. You are so right about this. Nicely stated Sir. I am sure that I will enjoy more of your creative mind when I read your works. Cheers, you take care and keep your stake sharp!maven1012 months ago Hi Rob...I enjoyed this sharing of a challenging time in your life...I also appreciate the sage and considered advise you have offered your readers about abusive relationships...Tight lines, my friend...LarryPearldiver2 months ago Hi Larry, thanks for reading yet another chapter in the steps to understanding human nature my friend. Tight lines.. ummm it's spring fishing time here and I've been letting so many great fish go; sadly, merely as I haven't cast a line for awhile! Hope all is well with you sir. You take care..Rebecca Saunders2 weeks ago ahh the power of addiction to another - more intense than any drug induced high - and more destructive...beautifully portrayed.Pearldiver2 weeks ago Hi Rebecca, thanks for reading this poem of hope (I don't do this again!!) Well the problem is; that if you care you ride it out.. and if you don't, or want to save time, you walk away. We often never see how badly drugs have really emotionally damaged others, until we have to deal with the things that require emotional maturity.. and often, there lies the problem.. Take Care and cheers for your kind words.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites94PearldiverFrom Bumble Town - NZ640 Followers52 HubsJoined 20 months agoRead more hubs by PearldiverContact PearldiverFollow PearldiverSubscribe to Pearldiver's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk Pearldiver a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsWhat does "I love you, but I'm not in love with you" mean?asked by Beamboh 6 months ago22 answersAnswer this questionWhat do you look for in a person as a romantic partner?asked by JulietduPreez 16 months ago10 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsThis Sensuous Language of Love: A Life Circle and...by PearldiverLife Circles: Poems of Hope: About Finding Loveby PearldiverYou Dont Know Home: Amazing Poems of Love and...by Pearldiver'If You Ever Left Me': Amazing, Inspirational Poems of...by Pearldiver'My Life Circles': Poems of Hope: Album One: A Collection...by Pearldiver'If One Word Could Change Your Life': Profound Poems of...by Pearldiver Setting the Mood for Romance ForumTopicRepliesWhy is saying "I love you so hard?"posted by Stevennix200189What I Am Planning for My Lover on Valentinesposted by theirishobserver.122Post a new topicTagslove relationships relationship poems crazy partners Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
