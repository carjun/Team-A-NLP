Top sex questions -- answered!10 ways to save on your monthly bills >   wedding hairstyle basicsThere are so many choices when it comes to wedding hairstyles and the process can seem overwhelming -- after all, your wedding hair will be highly photographed! Fortunately, we've got all the tips and tricks to gorgeous bridal hairstyles you need. The first step to choosing the right hairstyle is to gauge your hair type. Obviously, there are plenty of wedding hairstyles for long hair, like natural styles with romantic, loose curls and formal wedding updos. But there are also a lot of fun options for short wedding hairstyles, like sparkly hairpins or even trendy headbands. Next, you'll want to start collecting photos of wedding hair styles that you love (check out our wedding hairstyle photo gallery!). Once you have an idea of what you want, you'll need to find a wedding hair pro in your area, keeping in mind that the same person who cuts your hair isn't necessarily the best person to style your wedding hair. Do your homework -- once you've found someone you like, schedule a hair trial appointment. This is your opportunity to share the photos of bridal hairstyles you like and to determine whether your stylist's vision matches yours. This is especially true for wedding updos! When you go to your hair trial, make sure to bring along your veil or any hair accessories you're planning to wear so that your stylist can recreate the exact look you want. Once you've nailed down the perfect style, book their services, keeping in mind that wedding hairstyles for long hair often take several hours (so be sure to give yourself enough time to get ready before your wedding ceremony). If you plan on changing your hair before the reception, ask your hair stylist to teach one of your bridesmaids how to help you.More About Wedding HairstylesLess About Wedding Hairstyles    Search by Designer   Choose a Designer Any Designer 2 Be Bride-Elizabeth Darcy 2 Be Bride-Gavin Michaels 2 Be Bride-Isabella Chessari Adele Wechsler Classic Adele Wechsler Eco Couture Adele Wechsler Hello Africa Aire Barcelona Alfred Angelo Alfred Angelo Sapphire Alfred Sung Bridals Ali B Maids: Destination Bridal Collection Alice Padrul Alisa Benay Bridal Couture Alita Graham for Kleinfeld Kollection Alix & Kelly Allure Bridals Allure Couture Alma Novia Alvina Valenta Amsale Amsale Presents Little White Dress Amy Michelson Anjolique Bridal Anne Barge Aria Atelier Aime Atelier Aime me di me Atelier Aime Pret A Porter Atelier Diagonal Augusta Jones Avne Perucc by St. Pucchi Badgley Mischka Bride Barefoot Bride-Destinations Bellissima Couture Birnbaum and Bullock Bliss by Bonny Blue by Enzoani Bonny Carolina Herrera Caroline DeVillo Couture Casablanca Bridal Casablanca Bridal Couture Cecilia Perez Christina Wu Christos Claire Pettibone Classics by Eden Cosmobella Couture Bridal by Elma Reis CYMBELINE Paris David's Bridal David's Bridal Woman DaVinci Demetrios Dere Kiang Destinations by Maggie Sottero Divina Sposa by the Group  Eden Bridals Elie Saab for Pronovias Ella Bridals Enmanuel Couture by the Group  ENZOANI Essence Collection by Bonny Essense of Australia Eugenia Exclusive by Allure Gail Garrison Galina Exclusively at David's Bridal Galina Signature Exclusively at David's Bridal Group USA & Camille La Vie Impression Bridal Impression Couture Impression Destiny Ines Di Santo J.
