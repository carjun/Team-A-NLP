"I don't know what it was about."She said her pastor, Sandy McGriff, called her on Christmas Eve, shortly before the break-in. A short time later, police said a neighbor spotted the 52-year-old preacher breaking a window and climbing in.Arriving officers said they caught McGriff loading her car with Agnew's furs and purses  and then resisted arrest."It's not like she needed them; she didn't need them, she has fabulous things," Agnew said.McGriff has been preaching for years; she's part of a well-known spiritual family in South Dallas. She recently began holding services in a small chapel in the back of her husband's furniture store."My biggest mistake was going through... going through the window," McGriff told News 8, explaining that she was checking on Agnew on Christmas Eve and she caught two men breaking in.McGriff said she climbed through the window so she could protect Agnew's property. She said she couldn't find the key to the house.But why not just call the police? "My mistake," she said. "I should have."Record show McGriff has a lengthy criminal past and goes by several aliases.Police booked her under the name "Kathy Robinson," which McGriff concedes is a fake."Everyone has a past," she said. "I am a giver, not a taker. I'm not a burglar."McGriff admits taking pain medication, but insists she's been clean since the late '80s.Serita Agnew has her belongings back, but she worries about what's been lost."She seems to have this connection with God; she seems to be a woman of God," Agnew said. "I made a decision not to let it shake my faith."McGriff said she will plead not guilty to the theft charge. She told News 8 her faith remains strong, and she even held Sunday services just hours after being released from jail.E-mail jbetz@wfaa.comShare this article:43 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Dallas police arrest suspect in baby's shootingNext article Bill proposes deferred adjudication in Texas DWI casesTo add a comment, please register or login.Add another commentLeave your comment1000 characters remainingSubmitWe welcome your comments on this story's topic.

What a perfect cover she thought she had! I am sure the entire churchie thing was started as a cover for her thieving ways. About 10-15 years in the big house might do this thuggie some good.58059888Flag this commentreaganadams said on December 29, 2010 at 5:21 PMJust pathetic any way you look at it.58058576Flag this commenthoneymoon said on December 28, 2010 at 6:41 PMI wonder who is worst: Steven Wood, the man who lied about serving in Iraq and got a lot of money from the community or this "pastor".58007149Flag this commentbayougirl said on December 28, 2010 at 8:14 AMWhat an idiot.   What baffles more than the gall that this woman has by making up these lies that you would expect to hear from a 10 year old when caught stealing is that there were people who went to listen to her preach when she got out of jail..She  should be ashamed of herself.57976809Flag this commentjohnaviator said on December 27, 2010 at 9:14 PM1)  Having a HUMAN shake your faith in God is like...hating Gold because you got hit with a brick.  They're both rocks, right?2)  Nice reporter spin (you guys should be ashamed, but you never are)....the "victim" says her faith was NOT shaken.   The reporter wraps the story with...."she's afraid now of what else might have been taken". (while showing a pix of a Cross in the sunlight)  NICE!Anyone remember when WFAA stood for actual journalist standards and credibility?  Sad.57963257Flag this commentg4investor said on December 27, 2010 at 8:55 PMThis is why I tell people to stop worshiping these pastors.  Pastors are human beings.  Being a pastor is a JOB, just like those of us posting comments have jobs.  They preach the word of God because that is their job.  They are paid to do it.  Most pastors I've met have a love of money, just like any other human being.  They are susceptible to desires of the flesh like the rest of us.  That's why you here stories of their extramarital or homosexual affairs, rapes of young boys and girls, etc.  That's also why I would never, ever go to a pastor to discuss any problem I was having on the job, with my spouse, or anything else.  Because they are human, things you tell them in confidence will travel throughout the congregation and into the streets.  If you're having a problem, seek help from God and pray to Him yourself.  A pastor is a human being, and therefore, cannot save you.  Only YOUR prayers and faith in God will save you.57962641Flag this commentjilldavenport said on December 27, 2010 at 7:58 PMOMG, I just listened to video telling "her side of the story". This woman is a total liar and thief. Who is she trying to fool???? She is a PROVEN CRIMINAL and she got caught stealing again. She's telling her story and smiling and acting like she is a hero. PUT HER IN JAIL NOW....GET HER OFF THE STREETS! She is a lunatic.57960764Flag this commenthoneymoon said on December 27, 2010 at 7:34 PMShe has a lengthy criminal past and goes by several aliases.....Hmmm. I would not attend her services at all.

She probably would too!57957454Flag this commentlucmar said on December 27, 2010 at 5:59 PMThe police caught her with stolen stuff in her car, and she still claims she's innocent of all theft and burgulary charges.  Hope she gets the chance to preach in prison.  Maybe they'll pass the plate, in her honor.57956517Flag this commentg4investor said on December 27, 2010 at 5:47 PM@jilldavenport  - She can have an affair with me.  Like I said, she's a cutie.

It is sure to evoke sympathy from even the biggest doubter. It has been used since the 70's when Ted Kennedy wore one that was 3 sizes too small for his big head and  crooked neck, but it worked. I understand that Edie Bernice Johnson has one she can borrow.57941747Flag this commentkkaggie said on December 27, 2010 at 12:00 PMThis is just so sad and pathetic.

Just because they wear a robe doesn't mean they are not a criminal. In fact she has a long criminal record as a thief.57940132Flag this commentg4investor said on December 27, 2010 at 11:15 AMThis pastor is kind of attractive.  I could see her having an affair next.57939582Flag this commentkeithstone said on December 27, 2010 at 10:46 AMHer mistake was trying to fleece her flock directly, bad idea. What she should do, like all smart crooked Pastors, is to lie and rob old women on television. She should have just used the "Seed Donation Scam". It's a real cash cow. Just ask any of the Televangelist, like Cefallo Dollar, Marcus and Jonie Lamb, Kenneth Copeland and many more who line their pockets with lies and false ministries. Old people should be protected from these creeps.57938296Flag this commentbleeker said on December 27, 2010 at 10:32 AMdanta: I literally laughed out loud at your comment.

She did that too!!!Hmmmm..........maybe she need a couple of more items for her E-Bay status to be Gold. In that case its okay57937071Flag this commentdanta said on December 27, 2010 at 10:16 AMI think it's great that she showed enough initiative to go out and rob her flock at their homes unlike those white preachers in North Dallas that make the victims come to them.  I wonder if she'll duck this charge by having an affair next.  It seems to be part of the standard script.57936984Flag this commentgriffinmike47976 said on December 27, 2010 at 9:39 AMNothing new.

All too common and all too typical. When will people learn that all these crooks are in it for is to steal from you and the rest of the blind followers? I bet if you dug deeply you would find out quite a bit about the background of these supposed teachers of gods word.......57934092Flag this commentsunshine75043 said on December 27, 2010 at 9:00 AMI am trying to figure out why she did not call the police.  She put the stuff in her trunk.  She really needs to hear the interview she gave WFAA.  Did she say she used an alias and that is not her real name?  Did she say she saw the burglar and decided to break thorough the window to protect the lady's stuff.  Who is she Superwoman?  Come On, the chick is lying big time.  BTW @gpbob  it is not a typical black thing.  It is just stupidity.  The only thing is she got caught.57933769Flag this commentarmyairborne said on December 27, 2010 at 8:35 AMMust have gone to the Eddie Bernice Johnson School For Liars.
