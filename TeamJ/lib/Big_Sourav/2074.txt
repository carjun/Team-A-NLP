Obama made the call during his weekly radio and the internet, after Republicans took control of the House of Representatives on Wednesday, leaving the land ready for potential battles with the president and the Democrats on issues like spending, the debt and health care reform.  "Our primary mission must be to accelerate the recruitment and growth," said Obama.  The president used as an example of bipartisan cooperation on a compromise tax-cut plan passed by Congress last month, which he said contributed to "more optimistic economic forecasts for next year."  With some caution, Obama on Friday welcomed the Labor Department report showing that unemployment in December fell to 9.4 percent from 9.8 percent. But the creation of 103,000 jobs fell far short of economists' expectations.  "We know that these figures can bounce from month to month. But the trend is clear," he said. "The pace of recruitment is increasing," he said.  Turning to political issues, Obama kept up the pressure to generate a growing cooperation between the parties since the Democrats were defeated in the November elections.  "What we can not do is re-fight the battles of the past two years which distracted us from the hard work to advance our economy," he said.  "What we can not do is enter the type of symbolic battles which often consume to Washington while the rest of America expect us to solve problems," he added.  Republicans have vowed to reverse the health reform plan to Obama, but his goal was a setback on Thursday when congressional budget analysts said that an appeal would add billions of dollars to the federal budget deficit.  Democrats, who still have a majority in the Senate, pledged to protect the health reform law, most government legislative victory of Obama. The Republican effort to overturn the plan has been seen as largely symbolic.        1 of 1         Obama calls for end to "symbolic battles"in Congress     breeze84 is based in Cairo, Kairo, Egypt,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (80.0%) Egypt (8.9%) Germany (4.4%) United Kingdom (2.2%) 1 other countries (0.0%)           READ MORE: symbolic battles, political-news, Seattle, political-news, Punahou School alumni, Political positions of Barack Obama, United States presidential election, Presidency of Barack Obama, United States, Barack Obama   More News From: Seattle :  WA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 1            Reply  Posted By     Adebanjos|1 dayagothanks for sharing, rated!
