Many of the companies on this list are partially doomed by their industry. Airlines, cable companies, and banks for example, are often maligned by their customers. Retail firms and companies that were sensitive to downturns in the economy had to lay off significant numbers of employees during the recession, which bred resentment.But several companies you might have expected on this list arent. AIG became a pariah after its federal bailout, but it does not show up on the list thanks to high earnings over the past year, as its stock has nearly doubled. Goldman Sachs, that infamous vampire squid of Wall Street, earned a fair share of negative press and popular resentment since the credit crunch. But Goldman also ranked near the top in categories like customer satisfaction, shareholder satisfaction, employee satisfaction and CEO approval. GM has faced similar obstacles, but its also seen a spate of good news in the last few months, with profits, hires, and a successful IPO winning it more positive press coverage.More..Why am I not surprised that Bank of America tops the list?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAT&T, Bank of America, BP, Citibank, Dell, Direct TV, McDonalds, Nokia, The 15 Most Hated Companies in America, ToyotaRead moreToo Big to Fail applies to Government Contractors also.Not Just Financial CompaniesDecember 18, 2010jamesb101No commentsMy friend Jack and I went back and forth during the fist few months after the BP Gulf Oil Spill.Jack.As is common for himCalled for BP to go out of businessI reminded him everyday that that was not gonna happen.That BP was in fact Too Big to FailThey are ..BP kicked in $20 Billion and that will be the cost to them for the spillThe company is STILL in business and the stock is doing fine.While I tend to agree with Jack that BP should feel some pain(The CEO got bumped out of the process after a messed up pressor)The fact remains that my overall premise was and is correct.Big companies tend to have a few aces in the hole that we dont.Stock holders, Employees, the local, state and federal governments themselves..This just ISAnd these companies know it and work it .. ***Weeks into the largestoil spill in American history, government officials met in Washington to discuss ways to compelBP, which leased the drilling rig, to move faster in stopping the spill.One proposal called for suspending the company from getting government work under a federal law aimed at protecting taxpayers against unscrupulous contractors.But there was a snag. BP, the regulators knew from experience, might be too big to ban. They recalled that last year, before the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, officials at theEnvironmental Protection Agency wanted to stop BP from getting government contracts until it addressed various environmental and safety violations. Then, according to a lawyer involved in the debarment process at the agency, the Pentagon objected: BP was its biggest supplier of fuel.As the case of BP illustrates, the largest companies often escape the stiffest penalties because government agencies are too dependent on them. And even when there are suspensions or debarments they usually affect individuals or a business unit within the company, not the whole company.The top 100 government contractors have paid more than $19 billion in cases of fraud, bribery, falsifying records and other violations over the past 15 years, but only four of them have been suspended from government contracting, and none have been debarred, according to a database from theProject on Government Oversight, a group based in Washington. The database is based on the contractor rankings for the 2009 fiscal year..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesBP, BP $20 Billion escrow account, BP oil Spill, Get out jail free card, Government Contractors, Large Companies that mess up, too big to failRead moreThad Allen today..BPThe Oil SpillAnd working togetherAugust 22, 2010jamesb1012 commentsWhile I was outwith my wife spending money .

Why would they do anything else?Walk away from an established oil deposit ?Worth BILLIONS OF DOLLARS???ARE you out of your MIND?The revenue from that oil deposit will repay BP back ALL of the money they are going to shell out for this mishap..Go look at their stockThey aint going out of businessDamn.. They made money on the oil they siphoned off the busted well AFTER the cap was put on.Filled up more than a couple of tankers..People really do say dumb things and dont THINK.Yea, send BP away.Dont let them keep tapping that deposit Ten minutes later some other foreign company ( probably the Chinese will show up and drill the same spot )Bet on it.UpdateFor a great graphic and more on this issue check TalkandpoliticsShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Media, Other Things, UpdatesBP, Dumb comments, Nature's recovery, POTUS Radio, The Oil SpillRead moreStatic kill doneTalkandpolitics..August 5, 2010jamesb101No commentsFrom Talkandpolitics..The gusher is capped, killed  and the final seal with bottom kill is just a couple of weeks away.From the Guardian:BP has said the static kill might be enough by itself to seal the well. But the 18,000ft relief well that BP has been drilling for the past three months will be used later this month to execute the bottom kill, in which mud and cement will be injected into the bedrock two to three miles below the sea floor to finish the job, Allen said.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Other Things, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesBP, Static Kill, The Gulf Oil Spill, US Coast GuardRead moreLockerbie, The Scottish Bar And Libya: A Different Truth Perhaps?.The Oligarch Kings..July 26, 2010jamesb1016 commentsThe Scottish BarHi Guyser guys?..um Guys?.guys? President Obama is now seeking to link BP, his most unfavoured face of Big Oil, with Libya, and the release of a proven imprisoned terrorist. Obama follows the tried and tested rule of media mis-direction  when in doubt blame everyone for being in league with terrorism and cast them out. Put simply, he would like you to believe that BP, wishing to gain access to reap the oil in Libya, put pressure on the British government to release Adelbaset Al-Megrahi who had been tried and found guilty in a Scottish Court.Adelbaset Al-MegrahiExcept that it wasnt really like that. Not even slightly. He is conflating two entirely different stories for his audience and this post will attempt to separate them out. Not that anyones going to come up smelling of roses on this one.The story is that BP have negotiated with General Kaddafi of Libya for concessions to drill oil. Like no one else ever did this sort of thing? And that this involved a complex series of cross negotiations that involved the British Government in releasing Al-Megrahi to allow the deal to go through.Only the British Government didnt release Al-Megrahi.This is worth the time, so grab a coffee and settle back..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesBP, Lockerbie, The Obama Admin, The Olgarch Kings@ Political Dog101, The UK and the ScotlandRead moreUpdate..The BP Gulf well has NO leaksCould be permanently sealed..July 19, 2010jamesb1013 commentsGood stuffFinally!Kent Wells, a senior vice president for BP, said the company was studying the possibility of a static kill, in which heavy mud would be pumped into the recently capped well. Also known as bullheading, the procedure would force theoil and gas back down into the reservoir.The static kill does give us a new option, he said at a briefing in Houston. A decision to proceed could be made in several days, Mr. Wells said.He said that the procedure could speed the process of sealing the well and that the digging of a relief well, which has been seen as the ultimate solution and could be completed by August, might be needed only to confirm that the technique had worked.The flow of oil into the gulf has been shut off since BP installed a cap on the well and closed its valves last Thursday.On Monday morning, BP and the government said scientists had determined that methane gas seeping from the seafloor nearly two miles from the well was a natural occurrence and not related to a pressure test to assess the wells condition. The test was extended to a fifth day on Monday.The seeping was discovered on Sunday and raised concerns that the test had shown that the well was damaged and was allowing gas to escape into surrounding rock and up through the seabed.Thad W. Allen, the retired Coast Guard admiral who commands the spill response, said small numbers of gas bubbles that had appeared much closer to the well were not a problem, either. Its the collective opinion of folks that these small seepages do not indicate there is any threat to the well bore, he said at a briefing in Washington.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesBP, The Gulf Oil Spill, update, Well cappedRead moreBP has turned off the OIl leakWhat now?July 18, 2010jamesb1013 commentsTheyve been testing the cap for more than two days.No blow outs have occurred anywhere else.Now they should start to sipon off the oil from the wellrelieving the pressure and making more money collecting oilThey certainly are going to need that money..As we continue to see success in the temporary halt of oil from the leak, the U.S. government and BP have agreed to allow the well integrity test to continue another 24 hours, Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said on Saturday afternoon. When the testing is completed, Allen said, some of the valves on the cap will be reopened and oil will be collected from the well and sent up through a pipe to containment ships on the surface.Progress continues on the two relief wells according to Allen, the national incident commander. The relief well remains the ultimate step in stopping the BP oil leak for good.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Health, Media, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesBP, Cap working, Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Oil leak capped, resume collecting oil, UpdatesRead moreThe oil leak in the Gulf maybe no moreJuly 12, 2010jamesb101No commentsHURRAY!Maybe the end of the oil spill!Yes!Now the REAL crazy stuff begins!A new containment cap is lowered over the broken wellhead in the  Gulf of Mexico.After a new containment cap was lowered into the Gulf of  Mexico Monday, underwater video of BPs well showeda dramatic  decreaseinoil flow for the first time since the Deepwater  Horizon rig exploded in April.BP officials would  not immediately comment on the newimages streaming online, according  to the AP.A new cap was placed on the well in the latest  attempt by BP in a series of failed efforts to stop the flow of oil  gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.The18-foot-high,  150,000-pound metal cap was lowered onto the well Monday night.The  cap is meant to be a temporary fix until the relief wells are drilled  into the blown out well.Officials said that the cap would slowly  stop the flow of oil, avoiding another explosion.Rather than like a train running into a brick  wall, itll be more like putting the brakes on slowly, said Don Van Nieuwenhuise, at the University  of Houston.President Obamas  Press Secretary  Robert Gibbs was hopeful about the new containment cap during  Mondays press briefing.The sealing cap will assist in the  eventual killing of the oil, Gibbs said.And were certainly  hopeful that over the course of the next several days, theyll get that  on, theyll get that tightened appropriately.And the containment  capacity that I just described will increase in a way like we havent  seen thus far.A previous cap was removed on Saturday and was  not fitted properly, allowing crude to escape into the waters.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, UpdatesBP, Capping the Gulf Oil Spill, The Gulf Oil SpillRead moreObama  no more nice guy.Talkandpolitcs.July 9, 2010jamesb1012 commentsFrom Talkandpolitcs..Shift of tone  straight partisan, individual attacks, bashing GOP.Download Video or MP3 Source.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Entertainment, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesBP, Harry reid, Nevada senate race, Obama campaigning, republicans, Sharron Angle, talkandpolitcs @ PolitcicalDogRead morePage 1 of 212Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (145) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on Will the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..Scott P on Will the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?Scott P on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSD Your Ad Here 2011 Politicaldog101.ComDesign by SRS Solutions
