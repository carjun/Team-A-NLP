A Fox News spokeswoman confirmed reports that the president would sit down with the conservative pundit for a pre-game interview before the Super Bowl on the Fox broadcast network. The sit-down will be a moment of outreach between Obama and the network, which his administration has clashed with during the past two years over the network's coverage of the White House. It's also the second straight year Obama will use one of the most watched television events of the year to advance his message. He sat down last year with Katie Couric on CBS, the network that hosted the NFL championship game, which took place during the height of the healthcare battles in Congress. http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/136479...

Yes.3.  Yes.4.  In my entire life I've never heard any claims of fraud against SS, other than criminals who don't report someone dying so they can cash their checks.  And, please think about it, eliminating such fraud would not be a cut by anybody's reckoning because it doesn't touch anybody's legitimate payments while at the same time preserving the funds for those who deserve them - so, why did you even mention it?

O'Reilly won't be preaching to the choir.  This will be watched and judged by the whole country.  The republicans will be watching just because it's O'Reilly and expecting the usual Fox crap.  What they will see is an intelligent, caring, dignified yet likable man.  They won't see a crazy muslim socialist.  They will hear what he really thinks and feels instead of his words run through the Fox meat grinder.  Anyone who thinks that all we have to do is fight the right to get our way is totally delusional.  We do have to win them over.  Obama knows that and if anyone can do it he can.

If it wasn't a celebration day and he occasionally goes on FOX News for a serious interview to co-opt the transmission that's fine, as he has done before.In this situation if O'Reilly goes confrontational and serious on him he has to come back on him strong, which clashes with the all-American party vibe. On the other hand if O'Reilly goes wink-wink back-slappy with him then O'Reilly makes him look a tool like David Gregory dancing with MC Rove.So unless Obama has something up his sleeve he might regret this one, no matter how 'customary' it is.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopMimosa      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 05:21 AMResponse to Reply #4143.Is it customary for Presidents to do interviews before the Superbowl?Not being a sports fan I don't remember any doing it previously.What date is 'Superbowl Sunday' anyway?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopanAustralianobserver      (315 posts)Sat Jan-08-11 09:24 PMResponse to Reply #4346.Feb 6.
