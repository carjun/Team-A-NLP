Please stop. You are welcome to make useful contributions after the block expires. If you would like to be unblocked, you may appeal this block by adding the text {{unblock|Your reason here}} below, but you should read our guide to appealing blocks first. SarekOfVulcan (talk) 15:45, 7 July 2010 (UTC)While the edit warring was inappropriate, this edit just prior to the block (copy-editing the dispreferred version) seems to indicate they were not going to continue the edit war. Perhaps in light of this, the block could be lifted early? xenotalk 15:52, 7 July 2010 (UTC)If he wants to state that here, I have no problem with unblocking. --SarekOfVulcan (talk) 15:56, 7 July 2010 (UTC)Over to you, Toa Nidhiki05(talk contribs) xenotalk 16:01, 7 July 2010 (UTC)Yes, the edit war was over when Jimbo came in. I had no intention of continuing beyond the three reverts I believe I made. I may have made more, btu I am not sure. Toa Nidhiki05 17:48, 7 July 2010 (UTC)Unblocked.--SarekOfVulcan (talk) 17:50, 7 July 2010 (UTC)Cool. Thank you copyediting my sloppy grammar, by the way. xenotalk 17:51, 7 July 2010 (UTC)No problem. Toa Nidhiki05 17:52, 7 July 2010 (UTC)[edit] AccusationHow am I a liar?--Jerzeykydd (talk) 16:30, 23 July 2010 (UTC)Based on previous consensus in historical presidential, senate, and gubernatorial elections: a candidate needs to poll at least 5% to get into the infobox (before the election). And after the election, a candidate needs to obtain at least 5% of the vote on election day in order to get in the infobox. We came to this consensus because if we allowed every single candidate in the infobox, then it will look horrible if there are more than 5 candidates on the ballot. It's only fair to allow the candidates who poll a significant margin to be allowed. The purpose of the infobox is show a summary of the election results. In the United States, most election feature two major candidates and most of the time the others get less than 3% of the final vote on election day and make very little difference in the election.--Jerzeykydd (talk) 21:38, 23 July 2010 (UTC)[edit] Wikipedia policyWhich specific policy are you referring to here? Thanks. Hysteria18 (Talk Contributions) 16:57, 3 August 2010 (UTC)[edit] YouTube Poop: Spongebob and Patrick don't want to ride the Mitten65.12.153.91 (talk) 17:51, 5 August 2010 (UTC)[edit] Libertarian SocialismWhy do you want it removed from libertarianism article? Your own prejudice? ValenShephard (talk) 02:44, 30 August 2010 (UTC)It's a violation of WP:OR to refer to libertarianism socialism as libertarianism because there are no reliable secondary sources that do that. --Born2cycle (talk) 19:56, 16 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] United States Senate election in South Carolina, 2010Please respond to the arguments made point by point on the Talk page. There is a difference of opinion on whether to include Tom Clements picture in the infobox. There is no 'consensus' for exclusion as you have stated. The 5% rule you cite is only a suggestion. Circumstances peculiar to this race make the candidacy of Tom Clements notable enough to include his picture in the info box. You do not appear to be looking at the edits before you revert them. In reverting edits to eliminate Clements' infobox picture, you are also deleting referenced editorial material. For that reason I flagged your last revert as vandalism. No offense intended. Wikipedia disputes don't have to be confrontational. Other editors will give their opinions and we'll have a broader discussion about this. In the end, there will be some sort of compromise. DJ Silverfish (talk) 18:46, 3 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] NPAJust a friendly note that this is probably a personal attack per WP:NPA. You might want to strike it. --Errant [tmorton166] (chat!) 15:47, 6 September 2010 (UTC)Unfortunately I can't let stuff like that stand so I asked for an admin review on WP:AN/I. It's probably a good idea to give admins a "heads up" on that RFC anyway given the emotion it seems to be evoking. --Errant [tmorton166] (chat!) 16:07, 6 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] logical deductions are WP:OR"Take care not to go beyond what is expressed in the sources or to use them in ways inconsistent with the intent of the source, such as using material out of context. In short, stick to the sources." See [1]."Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources." See [2].Arguing that logical deductions based on what the sources say is not OR is not going to be persuasive. I suggest dropping that line of argument. Thanks. --Born2cycle (talk) 19:54, 16 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] Difficult communicationsYou've been mentioned at the Wikiquette board. Obviously ... we're not having a constructive discussion. You're more than welcome to discuss this issue here: Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#User:Toa_Nidhiki05_..._difficult_communications. BigK HeX (talk) 17:37, 17 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] Warnings...Please don't act non-constructively as you did earlier on BKH's talk page. It is inappropriate to overly warn people and, in this instance, was incorrect. In addition there is a policy of "do not template the regulars". Please lets have constructive discussion on the talk page - as I noted there already I plan to keep an eye on things and ensure that personal attacks stop and reliable sourcing is performed. --Errant [tmorton166] (chat!) 18:55, 17 September 2010 (UTC)Admins are not in a position of authority. Editors are. Admins enforce the will of the editing community, the consensus rules. The bare fact of the matter is; I can tell you if I think you are breaking policies, if you disagree that is up to you, then we need more people to weigh in - and they either tell me I am wrong or agree with me. You can accept my attempt to help in good faith or you can resist. I'm not too bothered, but that entire topic needs a big solid hammer brought down on it to quell the bad behaviour, and I am willing to do it if needed. If it makes you feel angry you are too attached; step away, take a breather and come back and focus on the content --Errant [tmorton166] (chat!) 19:20, 17 September 2010 (UTC)I made a comment on my talk. But it also occurs to me I could have pitched the original message as more of a request; it's just not helping to take the approach you did (i.e. templating him for a minor thing that wasn't even really soapboxing). I will offer you a deal though; give me a shot at dealing with this - BKH included - over the next few days and focus on the content and the sources. If it doesn't work out, well, we'll figure out a different approach. --Errant [tmorton166] (chat!) 19:47, 17 September 2010 (UTC)BlueRobe has raised similar concerns to your own over may actions in relation to this - so the clear the air I have asked for outside input at AN/I. The discussion is here if you wish to comment, I am hopeful that everyone involved will be open to the idea of myself as some sort of informal mediator - but if this is discouraged by consensus then so be it:) --Errant [tmorton166] (chat!) 21:39, 17 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] RE: Please readIt's not soapboxing. It's a pretty decent gesture, though I will have to reserve my opinion on the matter. Thanks for the effort. I'll be interested to see what actions follow. BigK HeX (talk) 03:13, 18 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] Disruptive editsPlease refrain from removing Clements from the infobox. I will restate the reasons: he has been endorsed by a national progressive news source, which is a sign of major importance to an election; he has earned the endorsements of local interest groups and has a presence across the state and in multiple local media sources. There is no widespread consensus on the issue of inclusion. By my count, there were 6 commenters on the issue on the talk page and 4 of them support inclusion. Only you and Jerzeykydd oppose it and without relevant reasoning other than an arbitrary polling number. For these reasons, I have reinstated Clements to the infobox. If you continue to go against the talk page's consensus, I will report you to WP:ANI. You do not own the page and your opinions are as valid as every other editors, but not more so. --TM 18:36, 26 September 2010 (UTC)Well, that is your opinion, but it is not the opinion of the majority of those who commented. Also, there is no rule for inclusion. Simply shouting "there is a rule!" does not make it so. When a relevant guideline is produced by a larger body of editors than on a talk page, then it is a rule.--TM 21:14, 26 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] Libertarianism in the United StatesI'd like to draw your attention to the condition of this article. Compare with Conservatism in the United States, Liberalism in the United States and Republicanism in the United States. Could you please dedicate your talents to improving this article? Yworo (talk) 15:59, 27 September 2010 (UTC)I thought you were probably unaware of it. While I am sympathetic to your frustration with the main Libertarian article, it is supposed to give a worldwide view of the topic and libertarianism worldwide is simply much broader than in the US. Getting the Libertarianism in the United States article improved could easily lead to improvements in Libertarianism as that article should include a summary of the US article, which could be in part extracted from improvements you may make to the US article. Yworo (talk) 18:26, 27 September 2010 (UTC)[edit] Far-left?You added that the Socialist Party USA is a "far-left", which is purely POV and none-neutral.. It is a left-wing party, just as its sister-parties in Europe, an example being the Socialist Left Party in Norway or Die Linke in Germany which are both considered left-wing. The principals of SPUSA is not that different from these two parties, which are both considered left-wing.. Second sources call them a left-wing party, not a far-left-wing party. An example of a far-left political party in the US would be the Communist Party USA. And while I noticed on your userpage that you are a self-proclaimed right-winger (in European terms), just as im a left-winger i suggest that you learn more about the topic, that is socialism and left-wing politics in general. I don't tell you this to be a jurk, i've been told the same thing. I've learnt however that personal feelings and beliefs should not be included in Wikipedia, just as you should learn that socialism is not a far-left ideology. If it was, most of Western Europe would have been ruled by far-left-wing governments, something its not..Again, i'm not trying to sound arrogant, if i did, sorry. --TIAYN (talk) 19:40, 4 October 2010 (UTC)In fairness to Toa Nidhiki05, I don't think it's all that much of a stretch to call the Socialist Party USA far left. Why? (1) On their own website, they describe their goals as " to establish a radical democracy" and "we join with others in making radical demands on the existing system." The term "radical" is practically synonymous with extreme politics. See Radical left and Radical right. (2) Simply because the Socialist Left Party in Norway and the German Die Linke have the same ideology as the SPUSA and the first two are considered "left-wing" does not mean the SPUSA should be considered as such. If you asked the average right-wing Republican in the US his or her political beliefs, it would match up nicely with the average John Birch Society member, yet the John Bircher is considered far-right. If you compared a Green Party of the United States member's beliefs with a SPUSA member, they would be virtually identical, but the former is considered "left wing" while the SPUSA is, in fact "far-left." The difference between a "winger" (right or left) and a radical (right or left) isn't necessarily ideology, it is the way they communicate their ideology and the length they would go to transform the status quo... or as the SPUSA says "(make) radical demands on the existing system."By now, you're probably preparing the typical "European" response which says that American politics isn't like the rest of the world- America is more conservative than Europe... I agree but that misses the point. America's right-wing leanings and aversion to the term "socialism" doesn't make the SPUSA far-left wing, rather it's the other way around- The SPUSA has been forced to become far-left in their posture because they've been marginalized by America's political system. The Socialist Left Party of Norway and Die Linke routinely win seats in their country's legislatures and occasionally form coalitions with parties "less" left. The SPUSA has almost NO chance of being elected to any meaningful office in the United States even in "leftist" hotbeds like San Francisco or New York City. (Hypothetically) if they did, the Democrats would probably refuse to let them caucus with them. And so the SPUSA can be a more "ideologically pure" (radical) party in rhetoric and actions than a European Socialist party could. Just something to think about... VictorianMutant (talk) 07:13, 6 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] Editor review transcludedHello there. Sometime in the past, you requested an editor review, but you forgot to transclude it onto the main page. Thus, you may have been wondering why no one gave you any reviews. I have now transcluded the request, so please check back in a while for reviews. During the meantime, please consider reviewing another editor. Thanks. If you have any questions, feel free to message me. Netalarmtalk 23:17, 4 October 2010 (UTC)I have completed an editor review here.

Best, HJMitchell | Penny for your thoughts? 00:22, 7 October 2010 (UTC)I'm unwatching your talk page but you know there are a few of us who will be watching to see this right is used properly in certain articles of interest:-) I never knew about editor review, but anyone who edits Israel-Palestine issues could spend a year detailing all their editorial disputes! CarolMooreDC (talk) 19:01, 7 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] ClementsCan we end this silly disagreement over Clements now? "Clements has passed Greene. U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint is poised to cruise to re-election, as 58 percent of poll respondents favor DeMint. But Green Party candidate Tom Clements of Columbia is preferred by 12 percent of voters, while Democratic Party nominee Alvin Greene is preferred by 11 percent of voters. Clements leads Greene among Democrats 30 percent o 22 percent. Greene, the surprise winner of the Democratic nomination, has not actively campaigned." [3]--TM 07:15, 13 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] The continuous teen pop debateNo matter how you look at it, per GA and FA music artist articles, we stick to the main genres in the infobox, not subgenres. However, this is different for albums, so that cannot be used as an example. I think the teen idol noting establishes a happy medium now. Candyo32 02:43, 22 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] 1912 infoboxWhoops, my bad. I do remember now that 5% was the agreed upon threshold. My apologies.

Continue the good work!--Jerzeykydd (talk) 23:39, 25 November 2010 (UTC)[edit] Phillips, Craig and DeanNo problem - thanks for joining in to make the article better. I don't think PCD deny being modalists (one of the links in the article, http://vintage.aomin.org/PCD.html, documents their understanding of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as manifestations of a single unipersonal God, rather than 3 distinct persons). Their response affirms their belief in the Father, Son and Spirit but doesn't go on to make any trinitarian assertions (and in fact reiterates the language of "manifestation".) At any rate, it's probably best just to let both sides express themselves in their own words, and so hopefully keep the article from tilting one way or another. (BTW, what part of NC are you in? I'm not too far from the Burlington area.)
