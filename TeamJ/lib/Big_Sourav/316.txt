"It's God's blessing. Terrific, terrific. We just love her."MatthewCasaus, 23, who is alleged to have been one of three men who participated in the kidnapping, has been arrested, police said. The other two suspects, Edward Muckelroy and Nathaniel Williams, turned themselves in to authorities in Albuquerque.The 54-year-old woman went missing after leaving her job at Brodnax Printing early Thursday morning in the 2300 block of Reagan Street in Dallas. Less than an hour after leaving her workplace, Loskot got into a collision with her soon-to-be abductors at about 1:30 a.m. at FM407 and Simmons Road in her hometown of Double Oak. She was just six blocks from her home.After the collision, Loskot got out of her Infiniti G35 coupe, which was when she was rushed by the men who forced her back into her car. Two of the men got into the car with her, demanding she drive to an ATM machine in Cedar Hill, which was where she withdrew $900. The men then drove to New Mexico with Loskot in the trunk of the car. She was released unharmed.Police said Loskot then drove her own car back to Texas. She contacted authorities in the small town of Vega."She had been very traumatized," said Mark Lancaster, a DPS trooper. "She told me she had been in the trunk for 14 hours. She was ready to take a shower and see her husband."Casaus was arrested Thursday in Dallas and was booked into the Denton County Jail overnight. He is a registered sex offender in New Mexico.Casaus was initially pulled over for a traffic violation, but officers later used that information to track him down. Investigators said Casaus has confessed to his role in the kidnapping.The first known sign of trouble came at 1:38 a.m., police said, when Loskot called home - apparently surreptitiously - and left a voice recording. Her husband didnt hear the message until he woke up later Thursday morning, authorities said. He called the Double Oak police shortly before 7 a.m. to report her possible kidnapping."You can overhear two or possibly three people in the conversation talking with her, stating for her to give them her debit cards or credit cards, that they wont hurt her if she gives them money, said Craig Miller, the Dallas Police deputy chief, of the voice recording she left at her home.Her captors apparently noticed that Loskot had placed a call on her cell phone, Miller said.They ask her is she talking with the police, at which point we lose communications and we have not heard from this phone since that time, Miller said.She was laterseen at a Bank of America branch on Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill taking out the money. Police released surveillance video of Loskot making the withdrawals from the bank. A shadowy figure could be seen in the front passenger seat of her car.The suspect arrested in connection with her abduction was found at his Dallas residence after authorities were able to connect him to the kidnapping based on a traffic stop at about 1:40 a.m., police said."Eileen is a very strong person," said Betty Prentice, a friend. "She's a leader. But, something like this, I couldn't imagine what is going through her head."Loskot was working late so she could finish her work before starting Christmas vacation with her family.Share this article:38 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Defense tips: Keeping alert in questionable situationsNext article Double Oak neighbors talk of woman thought to be abductedTo add a comment, please register or login.Add another commentLeave your comment1000 characters remainingSubmitWe welcome your comments on this story's topic.

I'm surprised the news channels have not mentioned that.57557726Flag this commentvidkid said on December 17, 2010 at 8:13 PMGlad she made it through this ordeal! Nothing to do with this story but I noticed gas prices jumped .15 cents at the pump today with no reason given. Price fixing by the energy giants and no story about it. This will bring on the second economic crash... sorry about hijacking this post.57543734Flag this commentmike2009 said on December 17, 2010 at 5:20 PMbboop13Wasp spray for self defense is a bad idea. Stick with the Pepper Spray. Wasp spray is unproven and has never been tested on humans. Wasp Spray will NOT work on those who cannot feel pain i.e. drugs or alcohol. Pepper Spray is an inflammatory which will cause the eyes to slam shut no matter the situation. Thats why over 40,000 law enforcement agencies carry it nationwide and even the smallest canisters will fire 10 ft while the larger will canisters will fire 25 to 30 ft.57538204Flag this commentbrickhouse said on December 17, 2010 at 3:38 PMI hope all three of these men receive life in prison with no possibility of parole.  They committed enough offences (kidnapping, car jacking, robbery, assault) to warrant the DA going for a life sentence.  A word of caution~the ploy they used is well known.  I was taught that if I was ever in an accident like that to either remain in my car and call 9-11 or if things didn't seem right, to drive off and get to the nearest police station, fire station or hospital.57533937Flag this commentjc214 said on December 17, 2010 at 11:44 AMMy heart broke when I first heard this story.

Even MSN maps puts the trip to Vega at 6 hours 12 min. Four hours less than your guess. Not important. News outlets do get some things wrong especially in the early phases of a story.I imagin the one guy they have already, is singing like a canary.57516947Flag this commentbrickhouse said on December 17, 2010 at 10:41 AMI was awake last night (early a.m.) when the news broke that she was safe.  I immediately started praising God and thanking Him for her safe return.  Wishing the Loskot family a joyful Christmas!57516544Flag this commentsonlighter said on December 17, 2010 at 10:38 AM@stilljustme!!! THANK YOU!!

What a blessing.BTW...2:45am-11:30pm is more like 20 hours, not 9.  You might want to recount.57515914Flag this commentsonlighter said on December 17, 2010 at 10:20 AMI am glad she is home safe ... but something about the story's timeline is not adding up. From Double Oak to Cedar Hill is about an hour, from Cedar Hill to New Mexico is about 10 hrs [without stopping]...if they were just inside New Mexico state lines, then for her to drive to Vega is another hour or so. That's 11 hrs or so from Cedar Hill. She was at Cedar Hill bank at 2:45am...then called Police from Vega, TX at 11:45pm on the same day? That's only 9 hrs later? Am I reading that correctly? Don't understand how she can go from Cedar Hill to NM to Vega in 9 hrs  - driving? And then her abductor made it all the way back to Dallas and was arrested too? That surely does not add up. Someone else mentioned ransom in the first article? No mention of that in this article. Anyway, glad she is safe, but something just sounds kinds odd to me.57515121Flag this commentcircusintown said on December 17, 2010 at 9:50 AMI prayed for Eileen and He answered with a Christmas miracle. Thank you,57513134Flag this commentcharacterh said on December 17, 2010 at 9:09 AMI am so glad she is okay. I can't believe this Aaron kid is my age and is already a registered sex offender, and now he is an abductor and a thief. What a POS. The only thing going his way is that he did not hurt this woman and that he confessed.As for the gun issue mentioned previously in the comments - if this woman had been correctly trained with a CHL and carrying a gun, there's a good chance that this would be the last time these thieves pulled this stunt. I agree not everyone should be carrying a gun as not everyone is equipped with the respect and sense of responsibility that comes with carrying a gun. It's illegal for criminals to have a gun, but you better believe they get around "the law". I'm getting a CHL soon, but I hope I never, ever have to use my gun.57509936Flag this commentbezubop said on December 17, 2010 at 9:07 AMThank you God! This is truly a miracle. This is what the holidays are about. Peopel coming together in prayer for someone they don't even know. She was gone so long that it was looking impossible that there would be a good outcome. But with faith in God, this is proof, you can do and overcome anything. ANYTHING is possible. I'm so happy for this family. You go Eileen!!! You were not a victim here. You were a fighter!Now to the media- this is the perfect example that if it isn't bad it doesn't get coverage. This should have been on the front page. If outcomes like these were covered more rather than horrible crimes people commit, than maybe people would start getting hope rather than horrible ideas! This was very similar to the kidnapping that happened last month in ft worth. Where the woman was taken by three men to Hill County and escaped.57509723Flag this commentfeduptxgranny said on December 17, 2010 at 8:34 AMThank heaven for answered prayers!

I have no doubt that people across DFW were praying for Eileen's safe return.  This is a good lesson during the holidays about caring about one another even those you've never met and how diligence and persistence can turn a situation around very quickly.  I carry a can of wasp spray in the console of my vehicle, and keep my doors locked at all times, just for situations like this.  According to athorities, wasp spray ($3 a can) works much better than pepper spray and can disable someone in seconds.57503624Flag this commentcemetrius said on December 17, 2010 at 6:46 AMTHANK YOU JESUS !!!!!! I thought about her all last night. I found myself waking up reading the news on my phone to see if there was an update. Not all criminals are heartless murders. Even though it was still very wrong to kidnap and rob her. I am so glad they did not harm her. Nice to read a happy ending this morning.57502869Flag this commentcheermom96 said on December 17, 2010 at 6:39 AMThank God!  I really didn't think this ordeal would end the way it did.

And it's right here in the middle of the holidays.Are their a lot of cars like hers? I saw one JUST like it today, only about a mile from where she was taken.I tried to call the police, just in case it could be of any help at all. But after calling 911, they gave me the phone number of dispatch for Denton county, they gave me a number for the building inspector in Double Oak, where at least I was able to leave a message. I know time is of the essence in cases like this, I mean, she could be laying in the trunk of the car waiting for someone to find her. I'm just an upset, but hopeful citizen. I'll continue to pray for her and her family.57496426Flag this commentsimplejustice said on December 16, 2010 at 10:48 PMThis is one video we should have been able to view immediately.  It was not a time for a commercial first.  I've read some of the previous comments and there are people that do not seem to think a person should carry a gun and defend themselves.  I would like to know why.  Everyone should be able to defend themselves from this kind of thing.  So ladies go right ahead and get that license.  I have my weapon and will be getting that license as soon as I can afford it.57494154Flag this commentscottfwtx said on December 16, 2010 at 10:04 PMnascar_d, I feel sorry for you.57492849Flag this commentnascar_d said on December 16, 2010 at 9:53 PMHope this lady is ok!!

However, in the story there is no mention of this type of call other than her secretly calling her home on her cellphone at which time the suspects can be heard telling her to give them her credit/debit cards and money. So this is a little misleading, unless there is something you're leaving out. Maybe the line should say, "A a phone call was made in which the suspects were heard talking to the victim, demanding her money."57483951Flag this commentkristmasg8370192 said on December 16, 2010 at 5:52 PMI feel very bad for this woman.
