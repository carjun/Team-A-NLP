Gates has pledged to squeeze from the Pentagons budget.Gates is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders Thursday to outline how he intends to save the $100 billion over the next five years by cutting weapons programs, Pentagon overhead costs and other portions of the Defense Departments massive bureaucracy. Gatesannounced in June that he would press the military services to find the savings with the incentive that they would be able to reinvest the money in programs essential to the current war effort and military modernization.The secretary will not only announce how much money we have saved and where we have saved it, but what new investments this will allow us to make, said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagons spokesman. This will be as much about investments as cuts.The headline of this piece is misleading.Defense Secretary Gates isnt looking to save a nickel.If you read the part from Pentagon spokesmen Morrell he clearly indicates that Gates is gonna take the saved money and use it someplace else..AndHell only be able to do that ifCongress lets him do that..So far just about every time Gates tries to kill a program.It pops back up from CongressOh, yea .Then there is this..U.S., NATO to spend $11.6B in Afghanistan The United States and its NATO allies plan to spend $11.6 billion this year buildingAfghanistans security forces, the largest yearly sum to date, as pressure mounts to shift responsibility for fighting the Taliban from the U.S.-led force toward local troops.The new funding pushes the total for 2010 and 2011 to nearly $20 billion, as much as in the seven previous years combined, said Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell, the commander of NATOs training mission in Afghanistan. Funds already spent have purchased, among other things, 24,000 Ford Rangers, 108,000 9mm pistols, 74,000 handheld radios, 44 helicopters and four bomb-sniffing robots.Its an enormous undertaking that we do, Caldwell said.NATOs decision to offer details Wednesday about the vast quantity of equipment provided and the steep cost to foreign taxpayers follows public criticism by Afghan officials that the West has not given Afghan troops and police officers adequate weaponry.I submit to you that the US and NATO cannot and will not be leaving Afghanistan anytime soonAs part of that.I also submit that the Defense budget has TONS of waste in it..Just waste that can be cut without affecting the countries overall defense.Will those cuts affect jobs?SureWill those cuts have political ramifications?AbsolutelyThe question isCan cuts ever be done?Thats the Discussion of the Day..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Military, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesCan the Defense Budget EVER be cut?, Congress, Defense Sec Gates, Discussion of the Day, The Afgahn WarRead moreWere gonna need more time here.December 11, 2010jamesb1011 commentThat frank assessment from the guys on the ground in Afghanistan. is NOT good news for the politicians in the White House who have been lucky so far that the American people and the media have been focused on the Mid-Term elections and the Economy.But the White House knew it was coming..Which is why the 2014 figure was played upThey where warned by reading their history that this war would take a longlong long timeMajor Gen.

But commanders on the ground here have already reached their own verdict.Were going to need more time, says Maj. Gen. John F. Campbell.[Gates and General Champbell over fly Afgahnistan in a Blackhawk...]Campbell runs Regional Command-East, an area of responsibility that includes several forward operating bases in Kunar Province near thePakistan border. Since summer, he says, coalition forces have captured or killed some 3,500 insurgents in Kunar province. But theyve also dropped 850 bombs in the process  leaving locals as frustrated with the coalition as they are with theTaliban.AsDefense Secretary Robert Gates touredAfghanistans eastern and southern stretches this week, he heard the same story again and again: While the United States is making gains in some areas, the security situation is improving in some areas, there are still big problems in others. The inescapable conclusion: The nine-year-old war isnt going to end anytime soon.At a press conference with AfghanPresident Hamid Karzai Wednesday, Gates said he will return to Washington convinced that our strategy is working.But back home, part of the administrations political strategy turned on the so-called December review  a vow to take a hard look at the success of the presidents plan to build up theU.S. troop presence in Afghanistan, then start pulling out in July 2011..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Military, Politics, Updates2012 Elections, 2014 War goal?, Afghanistan War timetable, Defense Sec GatesRead moreThe Pentagon will release Dont Ask report this afternoonNo surprises are expected.November 30, 2010jamesb101No commentsDefense Secretary Gates and Joint Chief of Staff Mullen have clearly indicated that they want the ban liftedAs a matter of fact the survey the military did was pointed in the direction of WHEN the ban is lifted not SHOULD it be lifted..Well see if the Republicans are gonna go along..Gates and MullenThe Pentagons long-awaited report on gays in the military concludes that repealing the 17-year-old dont ask, dont tell law would present only a low risk to the armed forces ability to carry out their mission, and that 70 percent of service members believe it would have little or no effect on their units, according to sources briefed on the reports findings.According to a survey sent to 400,000 service members, 69 percent of those responding reported that they had served with someone in their unit who they believed to be gay or lesbian. Of those who did, 92 percent stated that their units ability to work together was very good, good, or neither good nor poor, according to the sources.Combat units reported similar responses, with 89 percent of Army combat units and 84 percent of Marine combat units saying they had good or neutral experiences working with gays and lesbians.At the same time, the report found that 30 percent of those surveyed overall  and between 40 and 60 percent of the Marine Corps  either expressed concern or predicted a negative reaction if Congress were to repeal the dont ask, dont tell law, which allows gays and lesbians to serve in the military on the condition that they keep their sexuality a secret.The Washington Postfirst reported this month on details of a draft copy of the report.The Defense Department will formally release the report about 2:30 p.m. ET today, but officials are briefing lawmakers and other stakeholders on the findings in advance.

The participants said, among other things, that keeping America safe shouldnt just be a job for the military: National security is about development and humanitarianism, too. The poll reveals a shifting mentality within the typically gun-ho U.S. military that began with the 2006 surge in Iraq.According to the report, 89 percent of active duty and retired officers believe its crucial to emphasize development and diplomacy initiatives in addition to military strength. Eighty-three percent of those surveyed cited the importance of non-military programs, like food assistance and health, education and economic-based development plans, as fairly important or very important in achieving the countrys national security objectives.Fifty-nine percent said that increasing funding for non-military programs would help national security and military objectives, and another 59 percent say a decrease in funding would hurt our long-run security goals.The message from the survey isnt new: international diplomacy and development are top priorities of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Department of State, and USAID. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen have also argued in favor ofmore support for USAID and the Department of State.We in the Obama Administration view development as a strategic, economic, and moral imperative, said Clinton at the Council on Foreign Relations on September 8. It is central to advancing American interests  as central as diplomacy and defense. Our approach is not, however, development for developments sake; it is an integrated strategy for solving problems.But while the polls message isnt novel, what is new is the group voicing that message. According to Ambassador James Dobbins at the Center for a New American Security, who served as a special diplomatic envoy in the Clinton and Bush administrations, the poll reflects the changing attitudes of a military that has seen near universal overseas experience. The deployment of so many American soldiers since the 2003 invasion of Iraq has exposed almost the entire military to overseas conflict.Now, throughout the armed forces, theres a more widespread understanding of information that once only experts understood, explains Dobbins.That information boils down to this: the military cant secure a society aloneMoreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Government, Health, Healthcare, Media, Men, Military, Politics, Polls, The Economy, UpdatesDefense Sec Gates, Military go it alone policy, Miltrary leader's like Foreign Aid, Poll, Sec of State Hillary ClintonRead moreFla. pastor suspends Koran burningSeptember 10, 2010jamesb101No commentsA meeting between Rev. Terry Jones and Imam Rauf now seems unlikely. | AP PhotoStay tuned folks..Jones is gonna get more out of this..A Florida minister announced Thursday that he would not go forward with a controversial plan to burn copies of the Quran on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks Saturday  shortly after a call from Defense Secretary Robert Gates asking him to cancel the event orrisk the lives of U.S. troops overseas.But if the White House hoped they had put the Quran-burning controversy behind them by days end Thursday, that was not at all clear.The Rev.Terry Jones of Gainesville, Fla., and his associates offered a series of confusing statements about the decision  with Jones saying at one point he decided to cancel the Quran burning after securing a promise that the controversial proposed mosque near Ground Zero would be moved.But the mosques leader,Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, said there was no such deal. And Jones, in turn, said hed been tricked and left open the chance the Quran-burning might still go forward.A supposed meeting between Rauf and Jones set for Saturday  which Jones touted in his remarks to reporters  also seemed unlikely to occur.About the only thing clear by days end was that the White House had once again found itself dragged into a controversy over Islam, just days before the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The lower Manhattan mosque issue has dogged Democrats for weeks, and now Obama seems sure to face questions about both that and the Quran controversy at his news conference Friday  one in which he hoped to keep a sharp focus on his economic recovery plans.Though his church has less than 50 members, Jones drew international attention with his plan to sponsor a Burn the Koran day to protest violent Muslim extremism and honor the victims of the 9/11 terror attacksRead more:http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/41948.html#ixzz0z68p6MeSShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Entertainment, Media, Men, Military, UpdatesDefense Sec Gates, Terry Jones 9/11 Koran burningRead moreDefense Secretary Gates has been asked to stay onJanuary 8, 2010jamesb1012 commentsIn a vote of confidencePresident Obama , as expected, has asked the Republican Defense Secretary Robert Gates, 66, to extend his tour for at least another year as the nation top civilian Defense officialthe Former CIA Director, and President of Texas A & M University and the 22nd Defense Secretary of the United States will continue at his jobWhile I am disappointed at some of his decisions on equipment procurement and responsibilitiesthe Dog is happy to see Gates staying.he has a darn good Defense Secretary who focuses on getting help for the troops and backing his GeneralsHe also gets along with the Secretary of State..something that has been absent for some time in Washington D.CWe wish him well in his continued government serviceShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Military, PoliticsBreaking News, Defense Sec Gates, Men, MilitaryRead moreYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
