This probably helped my over active mind to invent stories and games to keep me and my younger brothers entertained. However, I am indebted to myfather for introducing me to the pleasures of a good narrative combined withsplendid artwork. Yes, he read comics. And when he finished reading them, hepassed them onto me. I was six when I started reading theseworlds of wonder that transported me from the dreary realities of a disenchanted childhood.  I devoured the pleasures of various Golden age comic stripssuch as Steel Claw, Flash Gordon, Phantom, Tarzan, Buzz Sawyer, Modesty Blaise, SecretAgent X-9 as these were sourced from allover the world the reprinted by a South Indian comic strip publisher calledMuthu Comics. There were the best of French, Italian, English& Americancomics that were reprinted locally.Although the strips were translated into Tamil, the strengthof the narrative and the power of the pictures meant that the stories crossedlanguage and country barriers. I could be transported from our dusty and wet tworoomed shanty house to anywhere in the word.  Among all the dazzling adventurers with superhuman skills,there was one that stood out who had no superhuman characteristics. He used hisbrain more than his brawn. He was no James Bond like womaniser but had a steadygirlfriend. His sidekick was no acrobat but a balding butler who is an ex con.Despite these shortcomings the series was drawn with extraordinary artwork,some brilliant stories featuring well developed characters and went onto become one of the most successful dailies of all time.  The strip was called Rip Kirby.

Raymond has a top pedigree when it comes todrawing daily strips- He created Flash Gordon, Jungle Jim and Secret Agent X-9.  That Rip Kirby went on to become one of the most successfulcomic strips of those decades comes as no surprise. The artistry containedwithin those panels will astound anyone who can appreciate storytelling andart.  Raymond had great success with Flash Gordon when he enlistedas a marine in World War II. He was demobbed and returned in 1946 to find FlashGordon in the safe hands of his former assistant. At the suggestion of KingsFeatures he created the character of an ex-marine turned urbane New York baseddetective Remington Rip Kirby. The launch of the strip was extraordinary- Kings Featuresran full page advertisements to promote the strip and it was quickly syndicatedall across America enjoying fantastic reception. Circulation rose, and thestrip was extremely successful. It ran from 1946 for well over 50 years finallyending its run in 1999. Although the quality of storytelling and the artistryremained impeccable, none could match the extraordinary talents of AlexRaymond, who sadly died in a car accident in 1956. He was only 46 when he died.  The Dramatis Personae  People had seen nothing like Rip Kirby before. Most of theirpulp private detectives were thugs and heavies, often using violence and brawnto solve their cases. Remington 'Rip' Kirby  was a breath of fresh air. He was an ex chemistryscholar, living in comfortable existence in New York as a private detective. Hewas suave, looked good in a suit and a tux, had wavy dark hair, rugged goodlooks and smoked a pipe!He also wore glasses and had a studious mentality. He used his brain to solve the crimes butwasn'tafraid to use his fists when called for.  One only has to look at pictures of Alex Raymond himself to see that he had modelledsomeof his characteristics onto his creation. Alex loveddressingup in smart suits and cravats, sported an ErrolFlynnmoustache, smoked a pipe and loved driving fast cars.  His girl-friend, model Honey Dorian was a blonde cutie.Her modelling career also gave Rip excuse to travel round the world solvingcases as far away from his native NY to London, Paris and Rome.  He could afford a live in butler, a Jeeves likeDesmond.  The latter is a ex safecrackerand a con artist, whose skills maybe called into assistance once in a while.  To Honeys Yin there was the dark temptress Pagan Lee whoserved as Yang. Drawn to Rip in a love hate relationship she went from a minorcharacter to a mobster hell-bent on destroying the detective.  The characters were well drawn out and even though there was a whiff of stereotypical in their construction, one can forgive the fact as they inhabited the 50s and sixties.

Although most involved murder in New York there are outrageous plotsand twists involving chemical weapons, kidnapping,  blackmail and mob crimes.  Alex Raymond may have had a hand in suggestion story arcsand filling in the blanks. He was truly gifted. The success of the strip was the refreshing take on crime solving as opposed to the pulp vigilantism of Mickey Spillane and tough talking no-nonsense Raymond Chandleresque private dicks, Rip represented a breath of fresh air. He was debonair, he had charm, he was kind to women, he had a heart, he dressed well, wrote science books, yet when it came to a situation can bring upon his boxing skills and self defence to look after himself and protect his girl. He was a very first metro-sexual!  The stories had their fare share of twists, thrills and spills aided by Alex Raymond's extraordinary visuals. There was such flow in the panels, as one scene merged into another, the characters were in constant motion, never static, always expressive. A true master-class in portraiture and storytelling.

Useful (1)Funny Awesome (2)Beautiful Docmo's Author-Book reviews: John Dunning: Literary Mysteries for BookloversDocmo's Author-Book reviews: You Gotta Read This: Locke & KeyCommentsAmy Becherer10 days ago As I read your well written take on comic creator and artist, Alex Raymond, and his masterpiece "Rip Kirby", I couldn't help but recall an American TV series called "Remington Steele" a 1980's tongue-in-cheek detective series starring the dashing, debonair, Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist as detective Laura Holt.  Brosnam, who was really a con and thief, was cast by female detective Laura Holt as the fictional detective to add credibility to her detective firm.  And, you describe Alex Raymond as the first metrosexual, Remington Steele was the personification of "metro" also before that term became recognized.  I love your descriptive, beautifully written, comprehensive tribute to your childhood imaginings and inspiration.  Awesome, really.Docmo10 days ago I sadly missed Remington Steele in my formative years but do know of it and have see a few clips. Brosnan was the epitome of cool and did you know that he lost out of being cast as Bond because his contract for Remington Steele refused to release him ( understandably) ..He had to wait a few years before taking up the mantle of James Bond and made it cool all over again. I am glad you enjoyed this tribute, Amy. BTW one of my favourite Brosnan films is the remake of Thomas Crown Affair where he sizzles on screen with Rene Russo - As a bored millionaire and art thief. That film has enough chemistry to fill a giant sized lab. I haven't seen the original with Steve McQueen ( another cool cat and a metrosexual inspiration!).cookingdiva9 days ago Mohan,I love comics too but I have to admit I do not know much about Rip Kirby but I am sure to read up these when I get a chance.I love many Japanese Anime like Lupin the 3rd, Xmen and all. Take care.Amy Becherer9 days ago I did know that Pierce Brosnan, uber cool, handsome, metrosexual was very disappointed when he did not ace the Bond movie lead.  He was the perfect choice, but Hollywood waits for no man.  It seems to me that the Bond capers and that type of egocentric male character lost steam in the movies. Sean Connery had a more rugged, male screen presence than some of the subsequent "James Bond" stars, who were just too pretty.Docmo9 days ago I am ashamed to say one of my party pieces is to do a 'But of coursh dear, Mish Moneypenny' routine trying to ape Sean Connery's ack-shent ;-)What's your take on Daniel Craig. I thought he represented the best of both worlds- clever casting by Making 'M' a no- nonsense female chief in the form of Judi Dench - giving perfect foil to Bond's masculinity.saideepa7 days ago great reading this, I am a comics fan too.My father was a great reader too.he introduced us three to reading not only comics but greek mythology and all great classics too.I am glad to have found a person like me.Docmo5 days ago Thanks Saideepa, I am glad this brought back some good memories.
