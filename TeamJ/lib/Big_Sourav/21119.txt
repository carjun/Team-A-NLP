Seems to be a standard comcast account. The address is open on port 80, but returns a 503 error and nothing on the other standard proxy ports. I suspect it's just a dynamic IP rather than an open proxy. Sailsbystars (talk) 20:20, 4 December 2010 (UTC)I'm not up to speed on the technicalities but Wikipedia:Open proxy detection has picked up on it as OP. RashersTierney (talk) 00:02, 5 December 2010 (UTC)The Open Proxy Detection page uses fairly primitive techniques, so it gets some false positives. In this case it may not have been a false positive, as several websites list it as an open proxy. However, this particular ip is on a dynamic range and at the moment the ip isn't up at all. So either a.) it was never a proxy to begin with (somewhat unlikely, since there was a suspicious service running on port 80 when I checked earlier today) b.) it was a proxy but it switched addresses or c.) it was an open proxy that was blocked by the ISP (since I imagine open proxies are quite the bandwidth hogs....). Regardless of which scenario is the case, it does not appear to be at this time.

The IP should get an account, and then ask for IP block exemption. The range block on 1&1 should be kept in place. A Google search for 74.208.128.0/18 brings up some past infelicities from that range. The block log for the range may be viewed at 74.208.128.0/18 (block user  block log  WHOIS).

Daniel Case (talk) 14:43, 23 October 2010 (UTC)There is a /19 rangeblock in place on this range since 2006. The provider seems to be OVH, and a Google search for OVH brings up some bad news, for instance this forum post about spam from the range 91.121.0.0/16. Checking the contributions from from the wider /16 range I see mostly vandalism since July 1. I don't know what port to use to check whether the actual IP cited in this report is an open proxy. I hope somebody will look into whether extending the rangeblock to cover the entire /16 is reasonable. In this thread the OVH company is trying to defend their reputation. A Google search for OVH sas france open proxy gets a number of hits. EdJohnston (talk) 16:27, 23 October 2010 (UTC)A glance through the contributions of the /16 shows a very high proportion of banned users and open proxy-type edits, and whether open or not they are almost all web servers and VPNs. I turned down this IP's request - it resolves to stegosaure.linux-fr.net (stego- as in..). It's running ssh and other server services, and seems therefore to be an anonymising proxy or VPN. Using it as a proxy seems completely avoidable. -- zzuuzz (talk) 16:39, 23 October 2010 (UTC) Open proxy or web server. Keep blocked.
