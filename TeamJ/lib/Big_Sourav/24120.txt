Despite new stimulus programs, recovery seemed far off. Opponents in the GOP (and even some in the presidents own party) called for cutting spending to reduce the budget deficit. Democrats were split: Was the president acting as boldly as possibleor was he not nearly bold enough? Pundits on the left accused him of dithering and caving in to big business. 5 commentsRead the full article Obama: Create Jobs by Executive OrderNovember 10, 2010On May 6, 1935, with the country in the midst of the Great Depression, and with indirect efforts to create jobs having not moved the needle of unemployment rates, President Franklin D.

Branded an illegal alien of the occupied Netherlands because she was Jewish; she and her young friends had to hide in fear of the black-shirted fiends known as the Protective Squad (Schutzstaffel) or SS as it was commonly called.Roaming through neighborhoods they were the enforcers of ethnic purification. Their unspeakable atrocities against human beings in the name of the law still lacerate our sense of humanity. And while the ends of their sickening purposes still surface occasionally in places like the Sudan, Rwanda and Bosnia; their means continue to be used as weapons against targeted peoples like todays Department of Homeland Security thugs.20 commentsRead the full article Artists unite!
