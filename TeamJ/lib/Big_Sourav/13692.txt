Its the most anticipated holiday of the year!Being a predominantly Catholicnation, Christmas is our most celebrated holiday. Traditions abound in variousparts of our country during this time. This is the time when Filipinos workingin various parts of the globe flock the international airports just to get a flight home and be with their familiesduring this time. Even locally, the domestic flights are packed withlocals who want to go home to their provinces or hometowns to celebrateChristmas.Christmas is also a great timefor our retailers, supermarkets, department stores and merchandisers. Salesduring the last quarter of the year leading to Christmas day alone beat thesales of these businessmen for the first three quarters! Even during hardtimes, sales are still better during this time of the year (albeit not as goodduring the pre-crisis years) than any of the other months during the same year.So, in celebration of thiswonderful season, I am writing this hub as an introduction to how we celebrateChristmas in the Philippines. The wonderful parols (http://leegho.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/christmass-in-the-philippines-11.jpg)The Ber MonthsWhat are these months? Let mejust enumerate them  September, October, November and December. The Philippinesactually has one of the longest Christmas seasons (it has been saidthat we have the longest Christmas season) and it starts on September. As earlyas September, you will already hear Christmas carols being sung on the radio andon TV. Decors are already starting to sprout up or sold for the buyers who arestarting to shop around for Christmas. Christmas gifts are already on displayin various stores around the country.The Decors Christmas decors in the Philippines arewidely abundant and colorful. We have the lanters or the Parols, which arebeautiful, hand-made and are so colorful, youll be scratching your headstrying to choose one for your homes. Then we have the Christmas tree which isreally a plastic Christmas tree (we dont have pine trees here, sorry). TheBelen, a tableau showcasing the Nativity Scene (Mary, Joseph and Jesus plus theThree Wise Men, plus the shepherds and the angels), is also another staple inour Christmas decorations. Christmas lights are also ever present during thistime. In fact, some homeowners go all out and decorate their gates, rooftopsand their houses with these lights (some put in like thousands of these lightsoutside their homes!).The Food The food! Christmas gifts can bein the form of food (Food for the Gods or the Rhum Cake) or wines and spirits.Hams (of various types, shapes and sizes) are sold in abundance during thistime. Keso de Bola (cheese shaped like a ball) also goes hand in hand with theham. Lechon (roasted pig) is another staple during this time (oooohhh, my bloodpressure!) especially here in my place where they ran out of pigs during theChristmas season! What else? Filipino desserts such as leche flan, halayang ube, puto, bibingka,  mmmmmmm! And who can forget the fruit salad or the macaronisalad (getting hungry here)!

For adults, it can mean a lot of things: bonuses, Christmas break, Christmas shopping, exchange gifts, etc. For kids or children, it means one thing: Christmas gifts. And...Christmas Traditions We celebrate a lot of traditionsduring this time. Theres the Misa de Gallo (dawn mass) which starts fromDecember 16 and ends nine days later on the eve of Christmas. Usually the Misade Gallo happens at around 4:00 in the morning but lately, the churches arealso conducting Misa de Gallo at around 9 or 10 in the evening. Those whocomplete the nine days (also considered a novena) are said to have their wishesgranted after the nine days.Christmas parties are anothertradition here. These parties will not be complete without the Kris Kringle orthe exchange gifts. Here, the participants draw out the names of their partnersbeforehand (its a secret, of course) then exchange the gifts during the party.There are also contests, parlor games and song and dance numbers to make theparty more fun and exciting.Christmas Day (December 25) is acelebration by itself. Families go to mass on December 24 then gather aroundtheir homes at the stroke of midnight to partake of the Noche Buena food. The New Years Eve is anothertradition within this season. To celebrate the incoming new year, Filipinosstay awake the night of December 31st to prepare food, light upfireworks and firecrackes and eat the Media Noche at the stroke of midnight. Stage plays are also muchanticipated during this time. The reenactment of what happened during Jesusbirth is a common theme for these plays. Sometimes, even, the couples who playMary and Joseph go around the neighborhood and knocked on peoples doors(pre-arranged of course) where they get subsequently turned down before theyfound their place on a manger which happens to be inside the parish church.This is called Panunuluyan.Lastly, Christmas carols andsongs round up our Christmas traditions. Caroling (going around the houses andsinging Christmas songs or carols) is a very common tradition, where thesingers are rewarded with coins, or food or both. In fact, caroling cansometimes become the preferred activity to raise funds for groups. And this rounds up how the Philippinescelebrate Christmas. Hope you enjoy reading this hub.

It's an annual fund-raising activity for some groups and yes, people often invite some carolers to eat something.
