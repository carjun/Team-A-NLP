Hayward :  CA :  USA|Mar 11, 2010By Ryan Finney        6 0     Views: 363      Throughout recent history, the San Jose Sharks have proved they are among the top NHL Hockey units that play the game. But for some reason when the games really count for something, they fall and fumble their way out of the playoffs. In this short time period after the Olympic break, the Sharks have proved to me that maybe my hopes and prayers will be answered this year. Can the Sharks really win the Stanley Cup in 2010? Or can they make it to the Stanley Cup Finals to have a chance at a title? The Sharks Hockey Franchise has never even been to a Stanley Cup series! I say, never say never... San Jose scored 6 goals tonight in the 3rd period against Nashville! The predators played a hard fought game, but they couldn't stop the Sharks feeding frenzy in the end. In this win, the Sharks set an NHL record when they beat down the Nashville Predators 8-5. They are the first team to win 3-consecutive games when starting the 3rd period behind 1 or more goals. In fact, they've almost done it 4 games in a row when they nearly came back from a 4 goal deficit in the 3rd period against New Jersey on March 2nd. The Sharks have played 4 home games since the Olympic break in San Jose. In those games the Sharks have been outscored 10-3 in the first 2 periods! So how have they won 3 games in a row? By out-scoring their opponents 13-2 in the 3rd period of these 4 home games! 6 in one period is their highest scoring period in the season to date. And this wasn't a case of a weak opponent. The Predators are in the heat of the playoff race and treated tonight as if it were a game 1 in the first round. So for future games, how can I, you, or the Sharks give-up and be counted out of any game? This 3rd period magic is a sign of a championship team in the making. It's one thing to have the ability to win games, it's another to will wins and finish games strong. There might be a point in the playoffs when it looks like San Jose is going to get eliminated, like always...but don't let these sharks of hockey fool you this year. Sharks not only frenzy when they smell blood, they also trick and steal games in the end. To see Joe Pavelski's 360 backhand goal go to the 9th min. of the video. It's the best goal I've seen all year!          1 of 2              blank      Ryan Finney is based in Hayward, California, United States of America,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (85.9%) Russia (3.9%) Canada (3.9%) Senegal (1.4%) 9 other countries (3.6%)           READ MORE: Sharks, san jose, NHL, hockey, Playoffs, games, Olympics, stanley cup, 2010, finals, Franchise, nashville, Predators, Frenzy, Trick, Steal, championship, 3rd period, San Jose Sharks, sports-news, Hayward, Patrick Marleau, 200708 San Jose Sharks season, National Hockey League, ice hockey, Pacific Division, Nash   More News From: Hayward :  CA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 4            Reply  Posted By     Karl Gotthardt|10 monthsagoIt sure sounds like the Sharks do have the ability to explode in the 3rd period. I wouldn't make a habit of falling behind in the in the first two periods though. A true champion should carry the game through all three periods.            Reply  Reply By     Ryan Finney|8 monthsagoSo far so good right Karl?            Reply  Posted By     Adrian Holman|10 monthsagoWith Thornton and Heatley on that front line, the Sharks can score plenty every game. Nashville already took the L when they didn't have Vokoun in goal. The only reason the Sharks have not been to a Stanley Cup Final is that Nabokov never gets hot during the playoffs. Hopefully, that will change because he laid an egg along with the other Russian goalies in the Olympics.
