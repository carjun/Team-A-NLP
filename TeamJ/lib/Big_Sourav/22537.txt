You will most likely be challenged, entertained, delighted, and educated yourself all at the same time.  The patients on a psych unit are going through crisis, and they have mental illnesses which make education challenging.  The education, however, is all that much more important to them.  Psychiatric patients are in the hospital because they need stabilization from their crisis, and if you have the opportunity to educate them you at least one key to unlock a higher quality of life.  Some frequent issues challenge the learning environment of the inpatient psychiatric educational group.  These challenges can totally ruin any possibility of patients learning anything from the group you lead. These challenges are sure to present themselves, because the people have problems.  Keep this in mind. And note that some resistance from students is good because is indicates engagement.

More specifically, whether thepatients learned what you designed for them to learn. You can "wing it"and have a great group, but you can also have an awful group. Whenleaders are winging it you get a wide variation across differentleaders. Of course, some topics are going to naturally be better forsome leaders, but structure in the planning process can minimize thefactor of chance. How to Plan an Educational GroupAskyourself what it is that you would like your patients to learn fromyour group. These can be deep understandings to simpler ideas andconcepts. You are the designer of the learning, and the best way todesign anything whether it be a car or a lesson plan is by startingwith the goal in mind. Do you want your students to learn that whenthey go off meds and pass up sleep they end up in crisis and earn atrip to the hospital? Start there for yourself, but work backwards toplan the learning activities of the group. This idea comes from apopular education book Understanding By Design (or UBD). It is abackwards planning concept. This is much better than simply findingresources and making them fit. Backwards planning starts withunderstandings in mind which choose which resources will fit. Tip:Make a concept map with your large understanding in the middle of thepage. Spider web to smaller ideas and concepts. Use this as your crudelesson plan.Depending on where you are working, you willprobably have certain topics you are to teach clients, ranging fromlife skills to medication education. You will be responsible forteaching clients on these topics. Think about what order you shouldpresent each concept. The education field uses something called"scaffolding" in order to allow students to understand concepts bybuilding on what they know. Start with where your patients are. Thengive them the next step of education. If your patients need a group onpersonal hygiene and wellness more than communication skills, thenstart there. Even better yet let your hygiene group lead intocommunication skills noting the fact that hygiene communicatessomething to others as well as other non-verbal communication. Now youare scaffolding and prioritizing for the needs of your students. Tip:Stay Flexible and Scaffold Learning Experiences. Ensure that yourlesson is appropriate to the clients you are serving. Survey yourstudents to learn more about them. Just asking can really help.Nowthat you have an idea of the "what" and "when" you will teach things,lets examine the "how." Keep in mind that you may have some clients whohave more education than you while others in the group aredevelopmentally disabled. "Dumbing Down" is not acceptable as you willquickly notice the higher functioning people losing interest. "Talkingover their heads" is not a good idea either as you will find the samething in the lower functioning patients. The way educators deal withthis dilemma is by using differentiation. Differentiation is a term forstrategies that allow all students on varying levels to learn from asingle lesson. Veteran educators incorporate these strategies withoutthinking about it. Your job is to choose appropriate strategies atappropriate times.  Give your clients choice to keep them engaged and include them in their learningGroup work differentiates for learning levelsDon't forget to incorporate multiple learning styles into your lessonsDifferentiation Strategies to Help All LearnersChoice.This sounds simple, but it is easily overlooked and one of the easiestto incorporate. You can give your students choice about what theylearn, thus making them feel included in their own learning. This islike including them in their treatment plan. Cut down on engagementissues right away with this strategy. I suggest asking for feedbackindividually or in written form to gain good feedback without startinga riot.Group Work. This allows those athigher levels of functioning to help those at lower functioning levels.Be careful when designing your group work. Larger groups are moredifficult to control. Make sure you have a clear explanation ofexpectations of each group member; assign roles. It is a good idea tochoose who you want to work with who. This keeps people from choosingfriends and socializing too much, and making others feel left out.Utilize Multiple Learning Styles.There are different types of intelligence types and different learningstyles. Many people say they are visual learners. Survey your clientsto find out what works best. I have found most learn the best fromvisual media and by doing. Professional educators use graphicorganizers to make difficult information easier to understand. Thiscuts down on engagement problems. Use variety to keep your lessonsinteresting. Ideas include having patients listen to a song, writetheir own reaction, and then watch the video that the artists made.Then have the patients write their own song either collectively, ingroups, or individually. And this could be just the intro to your topic.Suggestions for Dealing with Educational ChallengesWe have investigated tools to ensure learning in our mental health groups.  Depending on what challenges you are currently having or foresee in the future, you can use tactics to address each.  Another unmentioned thing to think about is making your groups relevant to your clients.  Aim material at their demographics.  Keep in mind their age, interests, socioeconomic status, etc.  Let's revisit the common challenges and list possible remedies.Wide variation in developmental levelsDifferentiation (including: group work, using multiple learning styles, student choice)Scaffolding (building on what patients already know/learned)Overactive and under-active participationSet ground rules and expectations (examples: Respect others, No putting down others, Listen to others, No sharing of personal stories for this group)Differentiation (including: group work, using multiple learning styles, student choice)Scaffolding (building on what patients already know/learned)Short attention spanDifferentiation (including: group work, using multiple learning styles, student choice)Scaffolding (building on what patients already know/learned)Ask yourself what would allow you to pay attention through the group.Total disrespect for the leaderDifferentiation (including: group work, using multiple learning styles, student choice)Set ground rules and expectations (examples: Respect others, No puttingdown others, Listen to others, No sharing of personal stories for thisgroup)Examine your own attitudeAvoid offensive statementsUse Love and Logic languageEducation ResourcesGroup Topics for the Mentally IllWhen someone has a mental illness, it is likely there will be multiple topics you can teach him or her to help cope and stay well.

I have the sinking feeling that I gave the psychiatric unit a difficult time my last visit.  I don't remember much, but I've been able to piece together that my roommate was not allowed to shower, so our bathroom was kept locked and I had to use a bathroom down the hall.  I can imagine I was pretty p o'd at that.  Then I do have a difficult time "playing along" -- which is what you ideally want patients to do.  I apologize to any mental health workers who ever had to deal with me. . . . interesting hub.Blake Flannery22 months ago Teresa,Sorry that you had to go to another bathroom.  One thing I have to remind patients is that everyone on the unit is there for different reasons, sometimes apparent other times unapparent.  A frequent problem is people putting things into the toilet, such as entire rolls of toilet paper.  Or priorities of safety may have caused your inconvenience.As for the staff, don't give yourself much grief over anything you did.  I would not feel useful if every patient was perfect and I was not challenged.  That's what we're there for.  I'm glad you are doing better.Freudulant21 months ago Very interesting piece. It obviously helps to have the luxury of organizing groups based on shared core interests or needs. In a psych unit you have indeed a very mixed bag.sasanqua11 months ago Great hub, especially the opening paragraph! There is such a stigma attached to people who have a mental illness, when really we are just as special as everyone else, and are capable of having positive effects on other people's lives. Thanks for making me smile.shoppingcartsplus11 months ago This is very informative and I applaud you for making this. I would like to also add that before a person gets to interact with mentally ill patients, he must not forget to deal with his own issues first. Self-awareness is a crucial factor in maintaining a healthy educator to client relationship.Patsy Cheyney10 months ago I have been invited as a guest speaker a couple of times to appear on panels on community resources at the local state hospital, San Antonio State Hospital.  The groups have been amazingly orderly, generally interested, and reasonably participatory.  The audience rates the speakers on effectiveness just as they would at any seminar.  Acute patient care--not extended commitments or intensive care.  An interesting experience.  The psychologist who heads the program does a great job.  Thought this article was much needed--very few resources on educating persons with a mental illness in any situationopismedia7 months ago A very educational article, i think group work to be the most efficient approach, but ofc that is my opinion and i know it differs from situation to situation.fruitunderatree4 weeks ago Intersting stuff. I do a lot of this kind of work in a medium secure psychiatric mospital where i work as well is stuff based on my reflections as a user of mental health services (or lack of them).
