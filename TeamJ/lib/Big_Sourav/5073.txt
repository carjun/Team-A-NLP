The group is going around town in an effort to get their message out to community groups.  OB was the second stop on Himelsteins rounds. Last week he had been in Tierrasanta.16 commentsRead the full article Mayor Sanders Spins the New Central Library Without City WorkersJuly 29, 2010Editor: The City broke ground yesterday on construction of the new Central Library in downtown San Diego.  On hand for us as witnesses were Anna Daniels- a former City librarian  and her hubby Rich Kacmar toting a camera. Anna filed the following observations:_________To be honest, I never thought Id live long enough to see a much needed new central library in this city. The City Council gave the green light last month to its construction but it wasnt until we were all invited to this mornings groundbreaking that I felt it was truly going to happen.22 commentsRead the full article Shadowy Great Schools Group To Address OB Town Council Meeting  Wed July 28thJuly 28, 2010Scott Himelstein, the spokesman of the newly named San Diegans 4 Great Schools, has been visiting various civic groups around the city spreading the word that his group is disappointed with test scores in San Diego Unified schools and that governance is the problem.

This historic turn-around for the Council reflects a shift in their and the publics thinking about recycled water.  The Council voted 4 to 2 for the project, with Councilwoman Sherri Lightner and Councilman Carl DeMaio voting no.Water treated at the demonstration facility, to be built at North City Water Reclamation Plant, will be added to the citys graywater system and not be added to the drinking water.1 commentRead the full article Separate fenced area for small dogs approved by Dusty Rhodes board.July 28, 2010On July 22nd, a meeting of the Dusty Rhodes park board was held and numerous locals attended with complaints of the recent rash of small dog mauling and deaths from larger dogs (see here for our earlier coverage).  Monica Honor 0f the City of San Diego Park and Recreation Department was in attendance.Finally, the local board voted to approve a separate fenced area for small dogs. The city has obtained bids for the fencing. Enough money is available in the dog park reserve fund plus a recent allocation of $3,000 from Councilmember Faulconers office for fencing, a fountain, labor and the associated requirements of ADA compliance. .5 commentsRead the full article City Schools, Services Face Cuts As City Hall Fiddles.July 27, 2010The slippery slope of San Diego politics got a little slicker this week, and when the dust settled around City Hall, both the proposed sales tax increase and the schools parcel tax were burning hulks, sitting on the side of the Sanders feel-good expressway. The battle arena over increasing revenues for local city services and/or public education has now shifted from the voters in November to the back rooms of Sacramento, where, rumor has it, a pending deal between Republican and Democratic legislators will delay upcoming corporate tax breaks granted in past years budget negotiations and allow the legislature to ease the budget cut backs for next year that are threatening local finances.1 commentRead the full article Californias Cannabis Culture   a Short filmJuly 27, 2010by Amanda Van WestIm a 24 year old filmmaker from Santa Clara, California, currently finishing my MA degree in International Broadcast Journalism at Westminster University in London. Ive worked on short documentaries in California, Mexico, Nicaragua, and London.Californias Cannabis Culture is a short documentary that was created for my final MA project. I filmed everything around Northern California between May and June, and finished the documentary in London. Its an exploration of the marijuana scene in California, in light of the upcoming possibility of Proposition 19 passing in November. California has long had a reputation of being marijuana-friendly, so I wanted to showcase a bit of the culture and investigate what changes might happen, if any, should it become fully legalized in November.4 commentsRead the full article Ocean Beachs Miscellaneous Heathens, at it againJuly 25, 2010My wife and I arrived at Dusty Rhodes Park at about 6pm, to a friendly dance party that had apparently been underway for at least a couple hours. Close to 200 revelers  most in joyfully psychedelic costumes, were mingling and dancing enthusiastically under the overcast skies. A DJ spun energetic house music along with an occasional light-hearted, humorous track, like a remix of Surfin Bird (The bird is the word) featuring Peter from Family Guy.Ocean Beachs Miscellaneous Heathens were at it again.13 commentsRead the full article Antiwar conference: US economy woes linked to foreign warsJuly 25, 2010The Revolution will be televised  or, rather, streaming live online.Antiwar demonstrations in the Vietnam era were a regular feature of the nightly network news on NBC, CBS and ABC.Today, protests against the war in Afghanistan are just as likely to be online as on TV, and in the form of damning documents or videos shown on WikiLeaks.And lacking a Sarah Palin or Glenn Beck  figures that have rallied the nations Tea Party movement  peace activists are taking a different tack. They are connecting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and our sagging economy and poor jobs outlook.1 commentRead the full article Heathens Take Over OB  Photo GalleryJuly 25, 2010For one day, the Heathens took over Ocean Beach. Here is a photo gallery of their day with all photos by Jim Grant. Check back real soon for a more complete accounting of the Heathen party and procession.2 commentsRead the full article Local and Out-of-town Volunteers Help OB WetlandsJuly 25, 2010Melisa Shafers deal with her three children was pretty simple: spend 20 minutes Saturday morning helping restore a fragile coastal dune and marsh area in Ocean Beach and they could go to the beach.  The kids didnt know it, but the point of their work had little to do with the physical labor involved.The natural world is important to us, said Shafer, 36, as she and the children lined rocks along a footpath through sensitive native vegetation. If we dont teach the next generation about it, well lose it.0 commentsRead the full article Im depressed  look at what theyve done to my ocean.July 24, 2010I went to see the doctor the other day because Ive been so tired lately. Are you depressed? he asked me.After weeks of seeing photos of the devastation in the Gulf of Mexico; watching YouTube videos of pelicans suffocating in an oily sarcophagus, marshes saturated in putrid, brown slime and what appears to be oily rain and a surf belching noxious gases; reading reports of outright incompetence in dealing with the situation, the application of millions of gallons of a chemical dispersant that no one seems to understand the environmental ramifications of using, news of a judge with a vested interest in the oil industry rescinding a ban on deepwater drilling Good God, who wouldnt be depressed!On Saturday, June 26th, I took the bus to Ocean Beach with my husband and a friend, to participate in one of the Hands Across the Sand events. There was a hundred or so of us lined up on the beach.4 commentsRead the full article Cheap Thrills Satisfy on NewportJuly 24, 2010Damn!  Another reason never to leave Ocean Beach.  2 Dollar Thrill is a tiny little store making a big bang on Newport.When I first wander in I admit Im a bit confused.  I ask the friendly sales clerk So, not everything is two dollars, is it?Yes it is.  she answers and adds; Everything is 2 dollars, thats all. Ill hear her repeat a version of this litany several times to other people while Im in the store.  Why is this question necessary when the store is called 2 Dollar Thrill and theres signs everywhere saying Everything Two Dollars?  Because 2 Dollar Thrill is too good to be true.7 commentsRead the full article 56 top-secret government agencies and companies in San DiegoJuly 24, 2010Across the country, an unprecedented operation is developing at an accelerating clip, unseen and unknown by most Americans.Until now, that is.On Monday (7/19/10) The Washington Post launched Top Secret America, an ongoing report of the private intelligence operationswhich the report calls our 4th branch of government that have surfaced in America since September 11, 2001. The project has been in the making for two years now.The top-secret world the government created in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has become so large, so unwieldy and so secretive that no one knows how much money it costs, how many people it employs, how many programs exist within it or exactly how many agencies do the same work, reads the reports introduction, spearheaded by long-time reporters Dana Priest and William M. Arkin.3 commentsRead the full article Education reformer scheduled to speak at OB Town Council not received well in TierrasantaJuly 23, 2010The same guy who will be speaking about education reform at the next OB Town Council meeting on July 28th, spoke at a Tierrasanta community meeting Wednesday night (7/21/10).  He wasnt received all that well by local residents there.Scott Himelstein, the leader of the newly named San Diegans 4 Great Schools, told the residents gathered at the Tierrasanta meeting that his group was disappointed with test scores in San Diego Unified schools and that governance was the problem. Governance is a cloaked term for how the school board works. 17 commentsRead the full article Telling it like it is!  a Common Sense CommentaryJuly 23, 2010by Jim BellWe humans are something special and rare.In spite of there being an estimated 5 to 100 million species of life on our planet, our species is the only one sufficiently conscious to become conscious of existence and our place in it on all levels.On the most foundational level, this means that if enough of us become conscious enough, soon enough, we will be able to pass the birthright of a peaceful and life-supporting world to our children and future generations.2 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
