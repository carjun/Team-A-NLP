Back then, the French delegates on the right-side of the chamber  hence the Right  wanted to keep the King and those on the left side  the Left  wanted him removed.Ever since then, to be on the right means standing up for property rights, the status quo, and the powers that be.  To be on the left means standing up for civil and social rights, for change, and for egalitarianism.  Although, the terms are relative and are tied to their historical and societal context.10 commentsRead the full article Sting: Lets End the War On DrugsMarch 31, 2010By Sting / Huffington Post / March 31, 2010Whether its music, activism or daily life, the one ideal to which I have always aspired is constant challenge  taking risks, stepping out of my comfort zone, exploring new ideas.I am writing because I believe the United States must do precisely that  and so, therefore, must all of us  in the case of what has been the most unsuccessful, unjust yet untouchable issue in politics: the War on Drugs.The War on Drugs has failed  but its worse than that. It is actively harming our society. 5 commentsRead the full article Ten Myths of the California BudgetMarch 31, 2010Editor: The following Ten Myths was prepared this month by the California Budget Project.

But a new initiative that will appear on the ballot in November elections is seeking to legalize recreational marijuana use.3 commentsRead the full article Local OB Veterinary Clinic Smack DownMarch 29, 2010It appears that complaints about one of OBs veterinary clinics are rising.  Local musician and producer Chuck Schiele recently posted a long rant about the Point Loma Veterinary Clinic terrorizing his cat.  Apparently, after making them wait for more than two hours, the vet said she did not know how to treat the feline, did not have a diagnosis, and then billed them more than he thought they should.14 commentsRead the full article OB Coffee Party: People Over CorporationsMarch 29, 2010There we were, all 21 of us, crowding around under the shady umbrella at Java Jungle. And we were all talking politics  imagine!It was a meeting of the coastal section of San Diegos Coffee Party movement, a movement that is barely two months old, yet already has nearly 400 chapters across the country.  What started as a facebook rant about the incivility of American politics and the apparent stalemate in Congress, and which has now blossomed into a nation-wide movement, had its first San Diego meeting on March 13th.  The turnout was so huge, that the group broke down into four sections.The west of I-5 folks, naming themselves the coastal chapter, had decided to meet on the 27th in OB.  And at least half the turnout was from Ocean Beach. 1 commentRead the full article Peninsula Singers At Carnegie HallMarch 29, 2010by Denny KnoxI am a founding member of the Peninsula Singers, which is a community chorus that practices in the Community Room at the Hervey Point Loma Library.

Right versus Left. What the hay?  A PrimerMarch 24, 2010Left, right, conservative, liberal. We hear pundits using these terms everyday. TV commentators say the passage of the health care bill was a victory for the left. Now the right wants to appeal it.  The Tea Party on the right, the anti-war movement of the left.Left versus right. Right versus left! What the hay!? Do you know what all this means?Left vs Right-Since these terms are bandied about so much, at the same time its not clear everyone knows what they mean. So, I wanted to lay out a brief primer on what these terms are and where they came from.12 commentsRead the full article OB Flashes  News and Calendar and WhateverMarch 24, 2010SEE INSIDE FOR DETAILS AND LINKS* David Wells Boosts Auction for PL High Baseball  and Displays OB Longhorn Tat* Volunteers Needed for OB Coastal Dunes Restoration  March 27th*Complaints Still Coming In About Homeless Youth and Their Abusers  Still No New Public Restrooms* San Diego Coffee Party Coastal to Meet at Jungle Java  Saturday March 27th* OB Farmers Market Is Favorite of Daily Aztec* OB  Fire Pits On Agenda of OB Town Council April 28th* Diane Bell: Ninjas on Motorcycles on OB Pier* OB Historical Society to Hold Annual Photo Exhibit and Contest6 commentsRead the full article Were Watching You  Surveillance Cameras to Be Installed On OB Pier and Around Mission BayMarch 22, 2010City Government Enters Official Bid Process for Public Surveillance System In Beach Areas  Including OB PierWinston Smith, youd better touch those toes.

[Editor: in case you are not familiar with the novel, Winston Smith is the main character in George Orwell's "1984."]It may be a couple decades late, but 1984 has finally arrived  government surveillance cameras are soon to be installed in a handful of locations along the San Diego coast, kicking off a program that seems destined for expansion into a spectrum that could one day encompass every public space in America (and whatever private spaces arent protected by a heat-shielding drawn curtain). It might soon be time to bust out those tin-foil-lined hats.56 commentsRead the full article The Great Thing About the Health Care Law That Has Passed?

Lifetime coverage limits will be eliminated and annual limits are to be restricted.    * Insurers will be barred from excluding children for coverage because of pre-existing conditions.    * Young adults will be able to stay on their parents health plans until the age of 26.

Rag, with the caption International Womans Day, you see a group of women, and one small kid waving a flag, marching on the O.B. pier in support of International Womens Day. To the far right is Nancy Little, in her often-present overalls. At her side, her seven-year old son Paul is merrily waving his flag, just having fun in the festivities.Joe Cocker sang, And Every Picture Tells A Story Dont It..How telling that Nancy should pass on one week after her picture appears once again on the pages of the OB Rag some 35 years later. I wonder if she saw it. I hope so. She loved Ocean Beach.8 commentsRead the full article Dark Days At City Libraries Go Into EffectMarch 21, 2010by Anna DanielsThe reduced hours schedule for our libraries went into effect Saturday (March 20). The Central library is now closed on Saturdays because of the draconian 10% mid year budget cuts exacted from the library budget by the mayor and approved by the city council this past December.That 10% cut was more than any other General Fund Department had to sustain. Think about that- our largest library which supports your branch, and serves all citizens- is now closed on Saturdays. And the hours have also been cut at our branches, which I will address further on.We should all be asking Why is the mayor balancing the budget on the back of our library system? I suspect the answer is because he can. We didnt stop him.3 commentsRead the full article First Floatopia of 2010March 21, 2010by Nate HippleLet it be known: The first Floatopia of 2010 occurred yesterday on Mission Bay!Apparently, nobody got the memo that Spring has only barely sprung and hence its still a bit nippy to be rafting with an ice chest of beer. But never ever underestimate the indomitable spirit of the peoples will to party, even when all signs tell them to behave.When the city banned alcohol on the beach, Floatopia was the natural reaction. (Its sort of a cross between Jersey Shore and the movie Waterworld).The end result of the ban is pushing public drinking 22 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
