All edits will still be added to the wiki and inappropriate edits must still be reverted or fixed as usual.Logged-out users  Until checked for obvious vandalism or superseded by appropriate editing, edits to "pending changes protected" pages will not be seen by users who are not logged-in. Edits by autoconfirmed users will be approved automatically during the trial, with rare exceptions.Policy  Pending changes may be applied only in the same circumstances as usual protection, see protection policy and pending changes usage policy. It will be progressively phased in using a queuing system, and will be limited to 2000 pages for the trial.Reviewer status  This will be granted liberally (become a reviewer!), and may be granted based on automatically generated lists.Support and testing  Test page: Wikipedia:Pending changes/Testing.

I'm not aware of it ever being answered. What advice has the Foundation received about the effects on editors' liability of Pending Changes? DuncanHill (talk) 12:01, 23 September 2010 (UTC)There was a discussion about it on one of the Flagged Revisions pages where Mike Godwin commented, and I think he said something along the lines of "editors could potentially be held liable but we're not really sure". Hut 8.5 13:38, 23 September 2010 (UTC)Found it: Wikipedia_talk:Flagged_revisions/Archive_8#Legal_liability_under_a_sighter_system. Hut 8.5 13:46, 23 September 2010 (UTC)ec.As I understand liability and I am not a legal expert at all .. there would be strong mitigating factors and accepting or reviewing someone else's contribution that in the small chance that it turned out to be defamation or libel a good faith reviewer would not be fully responsible for that contribution. The chances of a personal legal case arising from such an acceptance of someone else's contribution are in the present environment and as regards previous precedents minuscule to non existent imo. Off2riorob (talk) 13:53, 23 September 2010 (UTC)Thanks Hut 8.5, so the answer is they haven't a clue what effect it could have for editors. DuncanHill (talk) 13:57, 23 September 2010 (UTC)Quotes to keep in mind: "It's primarily that WMF is not insured to give legal advice to community members. We run an encyclopedia, not a free legal clinic" and "We're not your lawyers". -- Seth Finkelstein (talk) 02:19, 24 September 2010 (UTC)We could be potentially held liable for anything we do on line or off. PCs changes nothing.Doc James (talk  contribs  email) 02:41, 24 September 2010 (UTC)It means you're actively accepting an editdeciding it should be visible to a larger readershiprather than passively editing after someone else has made it. It does change the emphasis in terms of responsibility. SlimVirgin talk|contribs 05:38, 24 September 2010 (UTC)Scary.:-( --Ohconfucius digame! 04:33, 27 September 2010 (UTC)Just stay anonymous.

I think it would be useful, even for them, to delay their own acceptation, notably when editing complex templates. I think they should be able to delay the acceptation, before confirming these edits themselves. This would allow them to perform immediate corrections, in multiple edits during these tests, before putting the changes online (without requiring them to create complex sandbox versions and separate test pages that may forget many cases).So I propose to remove "visible immediately" from Level 1 and Level 2 PC-protected pages, and replace them by "visible after accept"; it should require an explicit accept action by admins and reviewer (including by themselves), as an additional step that they could perform after reviewing their own changes and their effects:Wikipedia users, page protections, and page editsAnonymousNewAutoconfirmed, Confirmed, BotsReviewerAdministrator, Admin botsNo protectioncan edit;visible immediatelyPending-changes protectioncan edit;visible after accept;cannot acceptcan edit;visible after accept;can acceptSemi-protectioncannot edit;cannot acceptcan edit;visible immediatelySemi-protection +Pending-changes protectioncan edit;visible after accept;cannot acceptcan edit;visible after accept;cannot acceptFull protectioncannot edit;cannot acceptcan edit;visible immediatelyFull protection+Pending-changes protectioncan edit;visible after accept;can acceptNote that in this table, there are still two levels of full protection. Most probably, the full protection should also include the PC-protection, so the 5th row is probably not needed, keeping only the last row (which will still require an explicit accept action by admins for fully protected pages; this will protect from unexpected errors by admins that can also review their own changes or see their impact, before approving them: admins may benefit from an accelerated "accept" action, and generally have additional gadgets to perform such actions fast in a single click).With this scheme, there's no longer any need for PC protection level (levels 1 and 2 become equivalent). The discriminant level becomes the usal semi-protection or full protection that determines the edit rights (and revokes the accept right of non-admins for pages with full protection). There's also no longer need of the bottom note.Note that a page may not be under PC protection, but may still be including a PC-protected template. In that case, the "visible after accept" should still apply to these pages, so that one can see this page either with the pending change in the PC-protected template, or without it. (So with cascading effect). This would work by not just checking the status of the currently viewed page, but also by walkink through its dependency list, to see if it includes a PC-protected page (generally a template).But because such viewed page is not PC-protected, it would be displayed with its own edits applied immediately, except for anonymous and new users (including external indexing bots like search engines, that should perform their work as anonymous users, or logged on with a user account that has opted to only view the reviewed versions, and that would still view by default only the newest version up to but excluding to the first non-reviewed pending change.Identified users may still have in their preference which version they want to see by default (and will still see the alert at the top of page indicating that the page has pending changes, so that they can see them, or see the last reviewed version: this link in the alert box that allows selecting a version to view should have a bots policy attribute of "noindex,nofollow"). verdy_p (talk) 03:03, 14 October 2010 (UTC)In addition, the current "visible after accept" mode should not apply to edits made by the viewer itself, that should still see by default its own edits, even if the page shows the warning about his pending changes. And if he edits and save a page with existing pending changes (from himself or from others), this should not accept them.The accept action should be clearly separated from the save action, and not performed in a single operation (including edits made by bots: almost all bots should not be permitted to accept edits, except bots with admin privileges which may still be needed for massive accepts of long lists of pages built with extreme care, or needed for maintenance cleanup or reconstruction, or after importing a wiki, but these admin bots generally have database access privileges so we may ignore them). verdy_p (talk) 04:28, 14 October 2010 (UTC)You may wonder why I think that the two PC-protection levels are overkill and in fact not needed:In fact all users (independantly of their status, including anonymous users), should be able to view at any time the "stable" (reviewed) page or the last edited page (even if it contains changes that need review).All users (independantly of their status, including anonymous users) should also see that some page needing review has pending changes, even if they are currently viewing the last-edited version.Which version they will want to see by default (last-edited or stable) is part of their user preference. Only anonymous users don't have preferences, and so they will see by default only the stable version (but they can still see the last-edited version if they want, by following the link to this version, displayed in the warning box). This will be the case of external search engines connected anonymously without being logged on (except that they should honor the "nolink,nofollow" policy hint inserted in the link to the last-edited version within the warning box.Reviewers and admins can also have user preferences for selecting which version (stable or last-edited) they want to see ny default. This won't affect their ability to review PC-protected pages with pending changes.In conclusion, PC-protection level 1 is not needed and means nothing different than absence of PC-protection (its sole purpose is to allow all last-edited versions to be displayed by default, independantly of user preferences when many users will just want to see the stable version). Only the behavior of existing level 2 should be kept, but both levels should be merged into the same one. verdy_p (talk) 04:53, 14 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] RemovalI have just removed reviewer status from a user who has violated our copyright policies demonstrably in several articles since he was granted the status in July, including as recently as October 13th. I do not think it would be beneficial to this user or to the project to drag him out for community review. Many people who violate copyright do so through an improper understanding of our policies or of the US copyright laws behind them. Community review can be embarrassing and discourage people who may become good content contributors, but obviously we need to exercise some caution in granting rights to users who have demonstrated issues with copyright themselves. I trust that this removal will be uncontroversial; if not, I would propose to alter the guideline to permit unilateral removal of rights in such clear cut situations. If removals of this type prove controversial, then would seem the time to bring in the community or arbcom. --Moonriddengirl (talk) 16:23, 23 October 2010 (UTC)I was an objector to the random removal of this right but it has with experience of some removals not been an issue and I think we could relax the wording to reflect that. Off2riorob (talk) 16:36, 23 October 2010 (UTC)I have tweaked the wording to reflect what has been occurring anyways without issue or controversy. Off2riorob (talk) 16:55, 23 October 2010 (UTC)Thanks. If others have been acting similarly, it's probably best to note that. --Moonriddengirl (talk) 17:17, 23 October 2010 (UTC)Yes, there have been a few previous Administrator removals in cases similar to as you have removed here, and the original worries about removal just haven't materialized. Off2riorob (talk) 17:22, 23 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] Objection to policy/non-policy'Oppose' I just want to object to this becoming policy, until it includes proposed policy/guideline for granting (and revoking) the Reviewer right. The right is being granted to some (including me), and not others, based on, at best, unwritten rules. We're giving appointed-for-life admins more powers, and yet we're extending, not delimiting them. --Elvey (talk) 22:08, 26 October 2010 (UTC)The Wikipedia:Reviewing proposed trial guideline-thingy has some criteria, which are certainly more detailed than the one-liner stuck into the WP:ROLLBACK guideline. VernoWhitney (talk) 22:14, 26 October 2010 (UTC)Yes, I was just coming here to note that I'd found it (after seeing the thread above this one implying it existed). It's a start....--Elvey (talk) 22:16, 26 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] Pending Changes RevisitedFirst off, I'm sure some people will comment on this, telling me to stop beating the dead horse, that there was a poll, that an agreement was reached, and the changes implemented. Now, all of this is true, except for one thing: an agreement was never reached. True, there was a rough consensus to use pending changes, but beyond that, there was no agreement. There were surely at least half a dozen implementations suggested, from the uselessly conservative to the hopelessly absurd. Yet still the trial rattled forwards like a runaway train, angering many, confusing more, and satisfying no-one at all. Pending changes was implemented, all right. On about 200 pages. Except no-one's allowed to apply it to any more, or remove those already aboard. This is ridiculous, and I'm sure everyone will agree that it is entirely unmaintainable. We need real consensus, before it's too late. Discuss. Sithman VIII !! 23:28, 4 January 2011 (UTC)Yes, we still apply it if and when some experienced Admins that have a good understanding of it think it will be beneficial, and the new faster version is working now and it much better imo, have you tried it? I see your not a reviewer? Off2riorob (talk) 23:31, 4 January 2011 (UTC)Indeed, I am not a reviewer. I am a concerned wikipedian who feels that a current policy was applied without clear consensus and is dangerously vague. Sithman VIII !! 00:17, 5 January 2011 (UTC)Join the club. I'm actually amazed - and appalled - that an announcement wasn't made on-wiki regarding the revamped PC's test run (not counting a single Signpost article). It's as if they're almost afraid of it. Jeremy (v^_^v Hyper Combo K.O.!) 10:41, 5 January 2011 (UTC)I don't think there is anything to be afraid of, its a simple tool, I know you both dislike pending but some people do like it, so ...... there were quite a few discussions and comments about it around and about, scary indeed. If there was a consensus to switch it off that would be a good reason to switch it off. Off2riorob (talk) 10:49, 5 January 2011 (UTC)I totally agree that we need a stronger consensus in either direction. Just FYI, Rob and the engineering team asked if I could help Wikipedians form the next discussion about the feature so tech could act either way based on a community decision that was easy (well, easier) to read. We've stayed really busy between the fundraiser and 10th anniversary stuff in the meantime, but we haven't forgotten that we need to have more community discussion if we're going to make a move to keep it, expand use, or just turn it off.
