You may also be looking for Wikipedia:WikiProject Sociology.This page documents an English Wikipedia policy, a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus.Shortcuts:WP:SOCWP:SOCKWP:SOCKSThis page in a nutshell: The general rule is one editor, one account. Do not use multiple accounts to mislead, deceive, or disrupt; to create the illusion of greater support for a position; to stir up controversy; or to circumvent a block. Do not ask your friends to create accounts to support you.The Five PillarsEnforcement policiesAdministratorsBanning policyBlocking policyBot policyHarassmentProtection policySock puppetryUsername policyVandalismviewtalkeditWikipedia editors are generally expected to edit using only one (preferably registered) account. Using a single account maintains editing continuity, improves accountability, and increases community trust, which helps to build long-term stability for the encyclopedia. While there are some valid reasons for maintaining multiple accounts on the project, the use of multiple accounts to deceive other editors, disrupt discussions, distort consensus, avoid sanctions, or otherwise violate community standards  sock puppetry  is forbidden.Sock puppetry can take on several different forms:Creating new accounts to avoid detectionLogging out to make problematic edits as an IPReviving old unused accounts and presenting them as different usersPersuading friends or acquaintances to create accounts for the purpose of supporting one side of a dispute (usually called meatpuppetry)The misuse of multiple accounts is considered a serious breach of community trust. It is likely to lead to a block of all affected accounts, a ban of the user behind the accounts, and on-project exposure of all accounts and IPs used across Wikipedia and its sister projects, as well as the (potential) public exposure of any "real-world" activities or personal information deemed relevant to preventing future sock puppetry.[1]Editors who want to use more than one account for some valid reason should provide links between them on the respective user pages (see below), with an explanation of the purpose of each account or of the relationship between them. If so desired, the user and user talk pages from one account can be redirected to the other. Editors who use unlinked alternative accounts, or who edit as an IP separate from their account, should carefully avoid any crossover on articles or topics, because even innocuous activities such as copy editing, wikifying, or linking might be considered sock puppetry in some cases and innocuous intentions will not usually serve as an excuse.Contents1 Inappropriate uses of alternative accounts2 Legitimate uses3 Alternative account notification4 Meatpuppetry4.1 Sharing an IP address5 Handling suspected sock puppets5.1 Sockpuppet investigations5.2 CheckUser5.3 Blocking5.4 Tagging6 List of role accounts7 See also8 References9 External links10 Related informationInappropriate uses of alternative accountsPolicy shortcut:WP:ILLEGITEditors must not use alternative accounts to mislead, deceive, disrupt, or undermine consensus. This includes, but is not limited to:Creating an illusion of support: Alternative accounts must not be used to give the impression of more support for a position than actually exists.Editing project space: Undisclosed alternative accounts should not edit policies, guidelines, or their talk pages; comment in Arbitration proceedings; or vote in requests for adminship, deletion debates, or elections.[2]Circumventing policies or sanctions: Policies apply per person, not per account. Policies such as the three-revert rule are for each person's edits. Using a second account to violate policy will cause any penalties to be applied to your main account, and in the case of sanctions, bans, or blocks, evasion causes the timer to restart. See also WP:EVASION.Contributing to the same page or discussion with multiple accounts: Editors may not use more than one account to contribute to the same page or discussion in a way to suggest that they are multiple people. Contributions to the same page with clearly linked legitimate alternative accounts is not forbidden (e.g. editing the same page with your main and public computer account or editing a page using your main account that your bot account edited).Policy shortcut:WP:SCRUTINYAvoiding scrutiny: Using alternative accounts that are not fully and openly disclosed to split your editing history means that other editors cannot detect patterns in your contributions. While this is permitted in certain circumstances (see legitimate uses), it is a violation of this policy to create alternative accounts to confuse or deceive editors who may have a legitimate interest in reviewing your contributions. (Misusing a clean start by switching accounts or concealing a clean start in a way that avoids scrutiny may also be considered a breach of this policy.)Policy shortcut:WP:GHBH"Good hand" and "bad hand" accounts: Keeping one account "clean" while using another to engage in disruption. (This means using one for constructive contributions and the other one for disruptive editing.)Policy shortcut:WP:ROLERole accounts: Because an account represents your edits as an individual, "role accounts"accounts shared by multiple peopleare as a rule forbidden and blocked. If you edit for an organization please see username policy guidance. The sole exceptions are non-editing accounts providing email access to major internal mailing lists and accounts approved by the Wikimedia Foundation (list below), and approved bots with multiple managers. See Username policy - Sharing accounts.Deceptively seeking positions of community trust. You may not run for positions of trust without disclosing that you have previously edited under another account. Adminship reflects the community's trust in an individual, not an account, so when applying for adminship, it is expected that you will disclose past accounts openly, or to the arbitration committee if the accounts must be kept private. Administrators who fail to disclose past accounts risk being desysopped, particularly if knowledge of them would have influenced the outcome of the RfA.Policy shortcut:WP:ADMINSOCKAdministrators with multiple accounts: Editors may not have more than one administrator account, except for bots with administrator privileges. If an administrator leaves, comes back under a new name and is nominated for adminship, he or she must give up the admin access of their old account. Foundation staff may operate more than one admin account, though they must make known who they are. For example, Bastique uses the account Cary Bass for Foundation purposes.Posing as a neutral commentator: Using an alternative account in a discussion about another account operated by the same person.Voting more than once in polls.Misusing new pages patrol: Creating an article with one account, then marking it as patrolled with another.Strawman socks: Creating a separate account to argue one side of an issue in a deliberately irrational or offensive fashion, to sway opinion to another side.Editing logged out in order to mislead: Editing under multiple IP addresses may be treated the same as editing under multiple accounts where it is done deceptively or otherwise violates the above principles. Where editors log out by mistake, they may wish to contact an administrator or an editor with oversight access to ensure there is no misunderstanding.Legitimate usesPolicy shortcuts:WP:Multiple AccountsWP:SOCK#LEGITAlternative accounts have legitimate uses. For example, long-term contributors using their real names may wish to use a pseudonymous account for contributions with which they do not want their real name to be associated, or long-term users might create a new account to experience how the community functions for new users. If you use an alternative account, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not violate this policy. Reasons include:Security: Since public computers can have password-stealing trojans or keyloggers installed, users may register an alternative account to prevent the hijacking of their main accounts. Such accounts should be publicly connected to the main account or use an easily identified name. For example, User:Mickey might use User:Mickey (alt) or User:Mouse, and redirect that account's user and talk pages to their main account.Privacy: A person editing an article which is highly controversial within his/her family, social or professional circle, and whose Wikipedia identity is known within that circle, or traceable to their real-world identity, may wish to use an alternative account to avoid real-world consequences from their editing or other Wikipedia actions in that area.Maintenance: An editor might use an alternative account to carry out maintenance tasks. The second account should be clearly linked to the main account.Bots: A common special case of maintenance involves bots, or programs that edit automatically or semi-automatically. Editors who use bots are encouraged to create separate accounts, and ask that they be marked as bot accounts via Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval, so that the automated edits can be filtered out of recent changes; see Wikipedia:Bot policy.Policy shortcuts:WP:DOPPELGANGERWP:DOPPELGNGERDoppelgnger accounts: A doppelgnger account is a second account created with a username similar to one's main account to prevent impersonation. Such accounts should not be used for editing. Doppelgnger accounts may be marked with the {{doppelganger}} or {{doppelganger-other}} tag (or simply redirected to the main account's userpage).Compromised accounts: If you have lost the password to an existing Wikipedia account, or you know or fear that someone else has obtained or guessed the password, you may well want to create a new account with a clean password. In such a case, you should post a note on the user page of each account indicating that they are alternative accounts for the same person, and you may well wish to ask an admin to block the old compromised account. You may want to consider using WP:Committed identity in advance to help deal with this rare situation should it arise later.Clean start under a new name: If you decide to make a fresh start, you can discontinue the old account(s) and create a new one that becomes the only account you use. Clean-start accounts should not return to old topic areas, editing patterns, or behavior previously identified as problematic, and should be careful not to do anything that looks like an attempt to evade scrutiny. A clean start is permitted only if there are no active bans, blocks, or sanctions in place against the old account. Discontinuing the old account means it will not be used again; it should note on its user page that it is inactivefor example, with the {{retired}} tagto prevent the switch being seen as an attempt to sock puppet. It is strongly recommended that you inform the Arbitration Committee (in strictest confidence if you wish) of the existence of previous accounts before standing for adminship or functionary positions. Failure to do so is likely to be considered deceptive. See WP:CLEANSTART.Humor accounts: The community has tolerated humorous alternate accounts such as User:Bishzilla, User:Bishapod, User:Darwinbish, User:Darwinfish, and sometimes User:Ka of Catherine de Burgh.Alternative account notificationPolicy shortcut:WP:SOCK#NOTIFYExcept when doing so would defeat the purpose of having a legitimate alternative account, editors using alternative accounts should provide links between the accounts. Links should ideally take the form ofSimilarities in the username (for example, User:Example might have User:Example public or User:Example bot).[3]links on both the main and alternative account user pages, either informally or using the userbox templates made for the purpose. To link an alternative account to a main account, use the main account to tag any secondary accounts with {{User alternate acct }} (using the main account shows it's genuine). The main account may be marked with {{User Alt Acct Master}}.links in the alternative account signature: if not linking to both the alternative and main account, link to the alternative account, and if necessary provide a note there requesting contact be made via the main account, or simply redirect the user talk page.Editors who have multiple accounts for privacy reasons should consider notifying a checkuser or member of the arbitration committee if they believe editing will attract scrutiny. Editors who heavily edit controversial material, those who maintain single purpose accounts, as well as editors considering becoming an administrator are among the groups of editors who attract scrutiny even if their editing behavior itself is not problematic or only marginally so. Note that email is generally not considered a secure way of communication. Concerned editors may wish to log into Wikipedia's secure server then email the arbitration committee or any individual with checkuser rights through a secure connection to Wikipedia's computers.Editors who have abandoned an account in order to edit under a new identity are required to comply with the clean start policy.MeatpuppetryPolicy shortcut:WP:MEATDo not recruit meatpuppets. It is considered inappropriate to advertise Wikipedia articles to your friends, family members, or communities of people who agree with you for the purpose of coming to Wikipedia and supporting your side of a debate. If you feel that a debate is ignoring your voice, remain civil, and seek comments from other Wikipedians or pursue dispute resolution. These are well-tested processes, designed to avoid the problem of exchanging bias in one direction for bias in another.Meatpuppetry is the use of editors as proxies to sway consensus. While Wikipedia assumes good faith, especially for new users, the recruitment of new editors for this purpose is prohibited. A new user who engages in the same behavior as another user in the same context, and who appears to be editing Wikipedia solely for that purpose, may be subject to the remedies applied to the user whose behavior they are joining. The term meatpuppet may be considered derogatory and should be used with care.Wikipedia has processes in place to mitigate the disruption caused by meatpuppetry:Consensus in many debates and discussions should ideally not be based upon number of votes, but upon policy-related points made by editors.In votes or vote-like discussions, new users may be disregarded or given significantly less weight, especially if there are many of them expressing the same opinion.For the purposes of dispute resolution, the Arbitration Committee has decided that when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sock puppets, or several users acting as meatpuppets, they may be treated as a single user.[4]Sharing an IP addressPolicy shortcuts:WP:COWORKERWP:FAMILYWP:ROOMMATEWP:SHAREIf editors share a personal computer or an Internet connection, or use a public computer or shared network, their accounts may be linked by CheckUser. To avoid accusations of sock puppetry, users in that position should declare the connection on their user pages.Closely connected users may be considered a single user for Wikipedia's purposes if they edit with the same objectives. When editing the same articles, participating in the same community discussion, or supporting each other in any sort of dispute, closely related accounts should disclose the connection and observe relevant policies such as edit warring as if they were a single account. If they do not wish to disclose the connection, they should avoid editing in the same areas, particularly on controversial topics.Handling suspected sock puppetsSockpuppet investigationsWikipedia:Signs of sock puppetry lists some of the signs that an account may be a sock puppet. If you believe someone is using sock puppets (or meat puppets), you should create a report at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations. Only blocked accounts should be tagged as Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets and only upon sufficient evidence that would be stand up to scrutiny.CheckUserPolicy shortcut:WP:FALSENEGATIVEFurther information: Wikipedia:CheckUserEditors with access to the CheckUser tool may consult the server log to see which IP addresses are linked to which accounts. CheckUser cannot confirm with certainty that two accounts are not connected; it can only show whether there is a technical link at the time of the check. In accordance with the Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy, checks are only conducted with good cause, and results are given so as not to compromise privacy; "fishing"the use of CheckUser for a given user account without good cause specific to that user accountis prohibited.BlockingFurther information: Wikipedia:Blocking policyIf a person is found to be using a sock puppet, the sock puppet accounts should be blocked indefinitely. The main account may be blocked at the discretion of any uninvolved administrator. IP addresses used for sock puppetry may be blocked, but are subject to certain restrictions for indefinite blocks.TaggingFurther information: Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/SPI/Administrators instructions#Blocking and taggingList of role accountsNon-editing accounts that provide an easy way to contact internal email lists:User:Arbitration Committee User:Bureaucrats User:Mediation Committee User:Oversight User:Wikipedia Information Team.Accounts approved by the Foundation:User:Schwartz PR, a public relations firm.See alsoSockpuppet (Internet)Wikipedia:Anything to declare?Wikipedia:Don't be quick to assume that someone is a sockpuppetWikipedia:CabalsWikipedia:CanvassingWikipedia:Consequences of sock puppetryWikipedia:GriefingWikipedia:On privacy, confidentiality and discretionWikipedia:Signs of sock puppetryWikipedia:Single-purpose accountWikipedia:Sockpuppet investigationsWikipedia:Tag teamReferences^ Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy^ See Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Privatemusings#Sockpuppetry.^ Dissimilar names may cause confusion and create an impression of avoiding transparency; remember that the username appears in page histories even if you change the signature.^ Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Regarding Ted Kennedy#SockpuppetsExternal linksMeatBall:SockPuppetRelated informationvdeKey Wikipedia policies and guidelinesOverviewFive pillars Policies and guidelines  List of policies and guidelines (Summary list of policies Summary list of guidelines)Project-wide principlesWhat Wikipedia is not Editing policy Consensus Dispute resolution Ignore all rulesArticle standards policiesNeutral point of view Verifiability No original research Biographies of living persons Article titles DeletionBehavioral policiesChild protection Civility Edit warring No personal attacks No legal threats Ownership of articles Sock-puppetryBehavioral guidelinesAssume good faith Etiquette Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point Please do not bite the newcomers Gaming the systemClassification guidelinesCategories, lists, and navigation templates Categorization Template namespaceContent guidelinesConflict of interest Do not include copies of primary sources Disambiguation Do not create hoaxes Notability Patent nonsense Identifying reliable sourcesEditing guidelinesArticle size Be bold Hatnotes Signatures Talk page guidelines User pages SubpagesStyle conventionsManual of Style  Manual of Style (accessibility) Manual of Style (dates and numbers) Manual of Style (layout) Manual of Style (lists) Manual of Style (linking)Policies GuidelinesvdeSock puppetryGuidanceLegitimate uses Inappropriate uses Meat puppetry Canvassing Username policy Clean start Single-purpose accountSignsMotivations List of signs Duck test An obvious sock is obvious Don't be quick to assume that someone is a sockpuppet LurkersInvestigationsTriggers Administrators instructions Requests for checkuser CheckUser criteriaConsequencesBlock BanRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry"Categories: Wikipedia policy | Wikipedia sock puppetry | Wikipedia user conduct | Wikipedia enforcement policyHidden categories: Semi-protected project pages Personal toolsLog in / create accountNamespacesProject pageDiscussionVariantsViewsReadView sourceView historyActionsSearchNavigationMain pageContentsFeatured contentCurrent eventsRandom articleDonate to WikipediaInteractionHelpAbout WikipediaCommunity portalRecent changesContact WikipediaToolboxWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPrint/exportCreate a bookDownload as PDFPrintable version LanguagesBoarischBosanskiBrezhonegCataleskyDeutschEspaolEsperantoFranaisGalegoHrvatskiBahasa IndonesiaItalianoMagyarBahasa MelayuNederlandsNorsk (bokml)PolskiPortugusRomnShqipSicilianuSimple EnglishSlovenina / SrpskiSrpskohrvatski / SuomiSvenskaTrkeTing VitYorb This page was last modified on 8 January 2011 at 09:01.Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;additional terms may apply.See Terms of Use for details.Wikipedia is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization.Contact usPrivacy policyAbout WikipediaDisclaimers
