Due to the ubiquity of English speaking people and thecolonial influences, the language thrives by freely borrowing and adaptingwords from other languages. English words can take their origins not only fromthe traditional Greek, Latin, French and Spanish roots but also from diverselanguages such as Arabic, Tamil, Polynesian, Native American and a multitude ofother languages.  A child of 12 may carry a vocabulary of over 10,000 due tothe steep learning that takes place at this age. As we get older, our vocabularyplateaus out. An average adult may only have around 25000 words in their possessionunless they are professionals or have a passion for learning new words. Pursuinga profession further escalates the number of words in ones vocabulary to40,000. Professionals will have to learn a lot of new technical terminology asin computing, science, medicine, law etc. thus expanding their repertoire.   Passion for Words The reason that one's vocabulary hits a plateau, is because westop being curious about words. Words are magical, they tell stories of distantlands, adventures and thoughts from different cultures, religions and belief systems.They offer an insight into bygone times and have rich history and a window tothe civilisation.  Ive always been curious about words and how they came intobe. Sometimes the back story may be dire, but more often you hit a jackpot.There are curiosities and wonders, mysteries and magic, mirth and mayhem in howthese words came to be. They tell tales of hard work and discovery,selflessness and sacrifice, war and peace, and journeys to long forgottenlands. We will learn History and Geography, Medicine and Mathematics, Scienceand Technology, Religion and Philosophy just by knowing some of the wordstories.   In my quest to understandEnglish words and to remember them Ive come across many stories. I am going toshare some with you... Hope it educates and entertains, or at the very least, makesyou more curious about the words you use.  In learning these stories and their component roots, yourvocabulary will expand and will be enhanced.  As you may already know, the brain bestremembers when a word has a back-story rather than memorise it by rote.  Happy reading!  AtomATOM Long before John Dalton , English natural philosopher andscientific instructor, devised the atomic theory in 1803, the concept of theAtom has been discussed in ancient India in 600 BC. The Jain monks postulated that complexmatter is made up of more simple units. The learning then travelled to Greecewhere in 450 BC, Leucippus  who was a disciple of Democritus, coined the wordfor these units as that which cannot be cut or sliced  (further)  atomos      (Greek -  ).  A; being a negative prefix and tomos   ( temnein- to cut open) meaning cut or slice. The Tomos fromatom also puts in appearances in Anatomy ( ana: to separate from and Temneinto cut open) the study of internal structured by cutting bodies open. Some of you mayhave had a CT scan. This is an abbreviation of Computerised Tomographic Scan.And yes you guessed it right, its our old friend Tomos to slice or cut thatcontributes to the Tomography as it literally means pictures of slices! TheCT Scan does show you sliced up sections of various organs. If you reallywant to go out on a limb, I wonder if the Tomohawk represents something tocut you open.  But Ill stop while I am ahead.    anacondaAn intricate ivory netsuke of snake swallowing elephantANACONDA You all know that the anaconda is a massive snake that couldswallow its prey whole and is capable of stretching its mouth so wide by dislocatingits own jaw bone . It first wraps itself around the said prey and slowlysqueezes the life out of it. Charming!The Etymological origin of Anaconda  is fascinating. Manyscholars believe that this comes from Sinhalese or South Indian origins. InTamil ( a indigenous language from South Indian state Tamil Nadu)   - Aanai  means elephant and kondran  means killer.In Sinhalese Hena kandaya     may refer to an extinct species of boa constrictorthat used to crush baby elephants to death. Now how did a Sinhalese or Tamil name travel to SouthAmerica where the snake is indigenous to Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru generally inhabiting the Andes and the Amazon Jungle. The secret may be the Portugese.  Portugal colonised some parts of the West coast of India  and Srilanka long before the East India companygot therein the 16th century. In fact Goa , a famous holiday resort onthe same coasts boasts several Portuguese churches and the native cuisine isheavily influenced by Portuguese flavours. In fact, India only got chilli peppersfrom the Portugese who brought it over from the Americas and planted them inSouth India. Prior to that Indian cuisine relied heavily on the indigenous blackpepper for heat and spice.  There were a lot of Tamils from India who used to live andwork in the plantations in Sri Lanka. Some Etymologists and Historians believe thatthe Portugese may have transported some locals over to their new colonies inSouth America as labourers. The latter may have spotted the snake and thoughtit bore resemblances to their native elephant killer snake and would have takenthat name from their own workers rather than from the natives. Hence, Aana-Kondran became Anaconda.   Crusades: Edward I killing an AssassinSource: Gustave DoreAssassin's CreedASSASSIN The word that describes the ruthless slaying of a powerfulfigure by a secret killer trained in those arts, takes it origin from the Arabic'Hash shashin.  To get the origins youneed to travel back to the Crusades: the harsh realities of religious warfare inthe desert heat of the middle eastern lands. The sandstorms, the mountainpasses of Iran and Iraq.This goes back to the middle ages and the crusades andoriginally referred to the Nizari branch of Ismaili Shia who occupied manycastles in the Alamut region of Iran during the middle ages. They enhancedtheir political machinations by ruthless assassinations of key Muslim figuresand Christian Crusader elite.The word takes its origin from Hashish a paste like substance produced from Cannabis resin  and smoked in a hookah ora clay pipe. It is believed that the killers were under the influence ofHashish when they carried out their ruthless slayings  this kept them free ofguilt or remorse . Hence   Hash shashinbecome Assassin and now is an universal term for killer of a high rankingpolitical figure.

I dont want you falling over and hurting yourself. Here, let me light this torch. The fumes are acrid, but the flame is bright. Dont stand there... Jupiter- AmmonAmmonia MoleculeAMMONIA Who wouldve thought that this acrid smelling gas owes itsname to the shadowy Egyptian God Amun- Ra or Ammon.  This key figure in Egyptian theology, he ruledthe roost for many centuries, attracting millions of followers and encasingancient Egypt in a complex universe of deities. Ammon was self created, andexisted outside the pantheon of Egyptian Gods  he became so powerful at onestage to the point that he alone was worshipped as the supreme God and allother Gods became mere manifestations of him.Now what has Ammon got to do with Ammonia?  To this we need to go to Ancient Rome. TheRomans ( much like the British later) were canny colonialists. They spread farand wide not only with their disciplined military might, their understanding ofpolitics and diplomacy but also by freely adapting Pagan Gods and local mythologyto their own end.When they conquered Libya, Ammon quickly became Jupiter , asupreme Roman Deity and even took on the twin horns of a Ram appearance. Theybuilt a temple for Jupiter-Ammon  inancient Libya.Near the temple they found natural deposits of a salt thatthey called  Sal Ammoniacus due to its proximity to the Temple of Ammon. Thissalt was in fact ammonium chloride and was able to produce ammonia. The saltbecame important to Chemists during the middle ages, obsessed with alchemy andthe transmutation of base metals  Goldusing Mercury. While this quest may have been futile, it created so manyinventions and discoveries along the way and saw the birth of Chemistry fromthe middle ages to the modern times.Despite all the modernisation, the name Sal Ammoniacusstuck and hence, Ammonia.  The Ten Avatars of VishnuAvatar?AVATAR No, this is not a celebration James Camerons million dollarmovie mammoth. This is merely a meditation of how and where the word avataroriginated . In modern parlance it means ones online- appearance or digital incarnation.The word actually comes from Sanskrit, the ancient languageof India and Hinduism. In  Hindumythology the holy trinity is made of three deities, Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma (the Destroyer, Protector and Creator respectively). Vishnu , throughout theages of humanity, takes several incarnations to help humanity and other deities. In fact, in Bhagavad- Gita the  sacredHindu test, Vishnu in his avatar as Krishna says to the warrior prince Arjun. #Whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousnessincreases I send myself forth.  For the protection of the good and for thedestruction of evil,  and for the establishment of righteousness,  I come into being age after age  Bhagavad Gita  #This is an oft quoted Sankrit hymn from the Gita.It is powerful and creates an aura of safety that Vishnu will always be thereto protect us. This concept of God in flesh or incarnation, is called Avatar.It soon became adapted to versions of oneselfonline or in the case of the Cameron film, using a genetically engineered hostbody to transport oneself into. Who wouldve thought a Sanskrit word would travelso far.  StarsAsteroidAsterASTRONOMY And I will finish this hub (I hope I could do justice to allthe letters of the alphabet this way- finding words with intriguing stories- anambitious aim). You may already know the root Aster  means star. This combineswith other roots to give us many words. Astronomy  ( a study of labelling andnaming stars in its inception), Astrology  ( a study of stars and their movements), Asterisk  ( a little star!) (  this alsothe name of the famous French comic book character created by Goscinny and Uderzo .-Asterix ), Asteroids  ( which means star-like ). Even thebeautiful Aster  flower is named so because it looks like a star. But I wonder if you have considered the word Disaster . Thisalso literally means bad star( Dis- Aster) . The ancients believed thatnatural calamities are set upon humanity by the bad alignment of constellationsand influencing our fate.  This belief stillexists in modern day as we study star signs to predict our daily fortunes! Docmo's Poetry HubsChristmas Poem: Of all the GiftsOf all the Gifts...

I believe in ' If it needs doing- it is worth doing well' philosophy!richtwf3 weeks ago An awesome and very interesting hub my friend. I love reading about the background behind words. Each word has a story in itself and it's great that you're sharing those stories here and illuminating these words for us to appreciate. I learnt a few useful things here and it's my pleasure to sit in your classroom! I look forward to the next lesson!God bless you my friend!Docmo3 weeks ago Thank you, I am delighted to share these stories that give me a buzz and enhanced my learning.. you are very kind with your appreciation.japtaker46 hours ago This is a truly excellent hub on a subject that I never tire of exploring. Etymology is one of my favorite things to do. I feel like our words are such an expression of the collective unconscious--excuse what might be a trite pop-Jungian reference, as it is the best way I know to express what I'm thinking. Every word has such a history, and has grown in such symbiosis with us, that language, to me, really contains much of what it means to be human. So before I go off and begin to write an entire article in response to your article, let me simply congratulate you on putting out some very precious information in an accessible and engaging way.Docmo44 hours ago japtaker, thanks for dropping by. I always enjoy your erudite articles. Etymology is something I have been extremely interested in for the same reasons- every word we use has such resonance and history and also has the potential to teach so much about our culture and civilisation. Hopefully my attempts at teasing some out will set people to rediscover this curiosity.
