ARM has a strong pedigree in mobile computing devices with its designs already used in the iPhone and iPad and a slew of other tablet devices. Until now Microsofts PC software has been based on chips design by IntelIntel, the US microchip giant.  "This is really about enabling a new class of hardware, new silicon partners for Windows and bringing the widest possible range of form factors to market," Mr Ballmer said in a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Wednesday night. "This is an important step for Microsoft because customers expect the full range of Windows functions in any device."  "Windows PCs will continue to adapt and evolve," Mr Ballmer said. "It means Windows will be everywhere on every kind of device without compromise."  Mr Ballmer said the new version of Windows, dubbed Windows 8, will allow users a full PC experience in the palm of their hands. Microsoft did not indicate when the new version of the software will be launched, but Mike Angiulo, Windows hardware vice president, did give a demonstration of Microsoft Word and Powerpoint running on a tablet-sized PC. This isn't virtualization, this is real Windows running on ARM," Mr Angiulo said.         1 of 40         Microsoft to base next generation of Windows on Britain's ARM microchips      maksnext is based in Islamabad, Federal Capital Area, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (69.0%) Canada (3.4%) Germany (3.4%) Singapore (3.4%) 8 other countries (15.5%)           READ MORE: Windows 7, Microsoft Word, computing, Britain, Microsoft Windows, Mr Ballmer, Technology Internet, technology-news, Mike Angiulo, United Kingdom, london, Steve Ballmer, Windows NT, Intel Corporation, windows ce, microsoft, windows vista, Microsoft&rsquo, personal computers   More News From: London :  United Kingdom     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Microsoft unveils U.S. future structure of Windows System By: breeze84      TheU.S. software giant Microsoft today unveiled the structure of the nextversion of Windows operating system, a tiny processors called "Systemon a Chip" (SoC) already used in tablets and mobile phones.Thenew technology that Windows is based was presented at a pressconference before the opening ceremony of the largest electronics trade...  3 days ago     Microsoft to debut new Windows system By: kashifsiddiqui03      Microsoft to debut new Windows systemMiddle East: 2 hours, 40 minutes agoMicrosoft is set to announce a version of its Windows operatingsystem that runs on ARM technology for the first time, Bloomberg hasreported, citing two people familiar with Microsoft's plans.
