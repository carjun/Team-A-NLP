Nigeria Bomb Blasts Linked to Al-Qaeda, FBI to Provide Security    Abuja :  Nigeria|Jan 07, 2011By Success Kanayo Uchime        6 1     Views: 865      It has been revealed after all that the recent bomb blast in the Nigerian capital Abuja on the New Years Eve that killed and maimed scores of people was financed, planned, and executed by the Al-Qaeda - the Islamic terrorist network. The U.S Government through its agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) that is probing the explosions said in its preliminary report that local affiliated terrorist cells provided support on the ground. The FBI agents made the connection after they conclusively found that the signature of the bomb matched other blasts by the terror network. According to counter-terrorism experts, every bomb  like art  has the signature of its maker or group-based on funding, sophistication, and objective adding that some bombs are made to serve as warning with little damage while others are made to achieve as much collateral damage and deaths as possible, which is the hallmark of Al-Qaeda. An FBI official said that based on their findings, President Barack ObamaBarack Obama has approved a request by Nigeria for a permanent FBI counter-terrorism unit in the country stressing that these agents normally do investigations after a blast but their job in Abuja may now include preventing these blasts through better security coordination and surveillance. He noted that based on the FBI recommendations, Nigerian Government has awarded a contract for the installation of close circuit security cameras at sensitive locations countrywide, including airports, bridges, roads, hotels and other places determined by officials.        1 of 45         Dr. Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria      Success Kanayo Uchime is based in Dumaguete, Central Visayas, Philippines,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (62.8%) Nigeria (9.1%) United Kingdom (6.3%) Canada (3.8%) 38 other countries (14.9%)           READ MORE: Nigerian Capital Abuja, New years eve, Al-Qaeda, U.S Government, Federal Bureau of Investigations, FBI, counter-terrorism experts, Barack Obama, FBI counter-terrorism unit, job in Abuja, Nigerian government, your-story, Nigeria, Abuja, Barack Obama, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Osama bin Laden, political-news, islamic terrorism, Islam, bombs blasts   More News From: Abuja :  Nigeria     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 6            Reply  Posted By     Sam_Mckee95|2 daysagoThis sad how did this happen?
