Register  TODAY and provide us with very basic information such as your name, email, age, city, and state of residence.  You will receive email updates from us announcing new research studies looking for volunteers with or without breast cancer, just like you. There are many different types of studies. Some might require you to complete a questionnaire, while others might need a sample of blood, urine, saliva, breast fluid, or breast tissue. Some studies might be clinical trials testing a new detection marker or drug. You decide which studies you want to take part in.  The email will detail the research project and who and what the researchers need.  If you fit the criteria and youd like to participate, all you need to do is RSVP and let us know youve accepted our Call to Action. You will be asked to go through an online screening process to confirm you fit the criteria for the study.Once we confirm your eligibility for the specific study, your information will be given to the researcher conducting the study and you will be contacted by the researcher for a secondary screening to make sure you meet the study criteria and answer any questions you might have about study participation.   You are in complete control and you self select what you want to do!   You will never be pressured to take part in any study. The decision to take part is yoursand yours alone.Breast cancer has been around for decades, but it does not have to be our future. We can be the generation that eliminates breast cancer by identifying what causes this disease and stopping it before it starts. Sign up for your sister, mother, daughter, granddaughter, best friend, and the woman you met last week.Have more questions?  Visit our FAQ Ready to sign up Today? Current AOW Studies Looking for Volunteers  Sleep, Circadian Hormonal Dysregulation and Breast Cancer SurvivalToo much stress and not enough sleep are two things that many women know all too well. Could they be linked to breast cancer? That is what a group of researchers at Stanford University want to find out. They are studying the effect that stress and sleep-related hormones may have on the immune system and cancer progression.Learn MoreThe BEAM StudyToday, doctors rely on a womans personal and family medical history to help them figure out if she is at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer. But this method is far from perfect. Many women who develop breast cancer dont have any of the known risk factors. And many women who have all of the known risk factors never get the disease. Clearly, we need a better way to tell who is at risk. And thats what the BEAM (Breast Estrogen and Methylation) study is all about: Finding a better way to predict a womans breast cancer risk. Three hundred women are needed for this study.Learn MoreDCIS and BRCA1 and BRCA2 StudyThe goal of this study is to learn more about the genetic material, called DNA, of women who have had DCIS and have the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation. This DNA can be obtained through a saliva sample. Studying  DNA might help us to better understand the prognosis and outcome for this group of women and to find out whether there is a relationship between DCIS, BRCA1 and BRCA2.Learn MoreEffects of Depo Provera on Breast Tissue StudyThe purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of whether Depo Provera, which contains a high dose of a synthetic progestin, will have similar effects on breast tissue to the progesterone which is released during pregnancy.Learn MoreShift Work and Breast Cancer Risk StudyThe research team is studying breast tissue samples from women who have not had breast cancer, who have worked either day shifts (anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) or night shifts (anytime between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.) for at least five consecutive years to better understand whether wake/sleep cycle disruptions may increase breast cancer risk. Later, the researchers will compare the samples collected from women who have not had breast cancer to breast tissue samples collected from women with breast cancer.Learn MoreDiscovery of Early Markers of Breast CancerThe research team is analyzing normal breast tissue from benign biopsies for evidence of DNA damage in breast cells and then investigating whether the presence of this DNA damage can predict who will develop breast cancer later in life. This study will happen in two phases.Currently, the researchers are looking for women who had a normal breast biopsy and went on to develop breast cancer. In a few months, they will be enrolling women who had a normal breast biopsy but did NOT go on to develop breast cancer. By recruiting both women who did develop breast cancer and women who did not, the research team will be able to look for markers in the breast cells that might be an indicator of breast cancer risk. This Call to Action is for women who had a benign breast biopsy and then developed breast cancer.Learn MoreThe Milk Study:    Using Breast Milk to Screen for Breast Cancer and Assess Breast-Cancer RiskThe purpose of this study is to determine if breast cancer and breast cancer risk can be accurately assessed from a breast milk sample. Currently, there is no accurate way to give women information about their personal risk of developing breast cancer.  We will use the cells naturally present in breast milk to examine changes in DNA that occur in association with benign and cancerous breast lesions. Learning about the genetic changes associated with both breast cancer and non-cancerous breast lesions will help us develop a way to provide women with information about their breast cancer risk. Using breast milk to screen for breast cancer will reduce unnecessary biopsies among nursing women.Learn MorePathways to Recovery After Breast CancerIn an effort to find the best way to empower women with the information they need as they begin to live their lives after breast cancer, researchers across the nation and the National Cancer Institutes Cancer Information Service have developed a study that is investigating the best way to provide post-treatment education materials via the Internet or CD-Rom, to breast cancer survivors.Learn MoreGenomic Markers of Breast Cancer Prevention Induced by hCG in Women at High RiskBecause pregnancy and breastfeeding appear to reduce breast cancer risk in women, including those with a BRCA1 or 2 mutation, researchers are interested in seeing if giving hormones that mimic pregnancy can change these high risk womens breast tissue in ways that appear to reduce their risk.The researchers are looking for 18 women for this study.Learn MoreThe Impact of Colonic Microbiota on Breast CancerThe purpose of this study is to find out what type of bacteria can be found in the intestines and to look at the way the bacteria metabolize estrogen and other female hormones. The bacteria of women who have never had breast cancer will be compared to the bacteria of women who have been recently diagnosed with breast cancer. Thirty (30) women who have never had breast cancer are needed for this study.Learn MoreProtocol for Narrowing the Gap in Adjuvant TherapyAfrican American women are more likely to die of breast cancer than Caucasian women, even though fewer African American women are getting breast cancer each year and screening use has improved. This difference has gotten worse over the past 20 years. The Gap Study was designed to gather the information needed to better understand the differences in breast cancer treatment experiences between Black/African American Women and White/European American Women. The researchers want to know more about how to improve the survival rates of women with breast cancer.Learn MoreYoga for Breast Cancer Survivors: Effects on Fatigue, Immune Function, and MoodBreast cancer survivors can have a lot of post-treatment problems, such as fatigue, depression, and a decrease in physical function. It is possible that physical activities, like yoga, could help ease these symptoms. This is a study about how yoga affects fatigue, immune function, and mood of women treated for breast cancer.Learn MoreOmega-3 Fatty Acid Study and the Glucosamine and Chondroitin StudyThe research team is conducting two studies. One is investigating the effectiveness of Omega-3 fatty acid. The other is investigating the effectiveness of Glucosamine and Chondroitin. Both studies are assessing whether a dietary supplement can reduce the joint pain and stiffness associated with the aromatase inhibitors used to treat breast cancer.Learn MoreCombination of Low-Dose Anti-Estrogens with Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Prevention of Hormone-Independent Breast CancerThe purpose of this study is to find out if combining raloxifene with a dietary supplement called omega-3 fatty acid has an effect on breast density or urine and blood chemicals associated with breast cancer development.Learn MoreEarly Detection of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Using Exhaled Breath MarkersThe research team is using specially trained dogs and a chemical test to analyze breath samples for substances called biomarkers that may be useful in diagnosing ovarian cancer. This type of research has been done before with breast and lung cancer.Learn MoreHealing Choices for Women With Breast Cancer StudyResearchers throughout the country are working with the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service to determine the best way to get information to women who have been recently diagnosed with breast cancer. The information is about treatment options and it can help women in making their decisions. The researchers want to find out the best way to deliver the information: by mail in the form of print materials, by the internet, or by CD-Rom. The study is called Healing Choices for Women with Breast Cancer.Learn MoreBreathe for Hot FlashesThere is not a lot known about how women can manage hot flashes without hormones. Some breathing methods have helped hot flashes, but more research is needed to see if these breathing methods can be put into widespread use.Learn MoreIdentification of Novel Genetic Risk Factors that Contribute to the Risk for Breast CancerThe purpose of the study is to learn what genetic factors may play a role in the development of breast cancer in young women.The researchers need to recruit 5,000 women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer when they were 40 years old or younger for this study.Learn MoreTai Chi Effects on Chronic Insomnia in Breast Cancer Survivors: Immune MechanismsThe purpose of this study is to determine whether Tai Chi or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can change sleep patterns and reduce insomnia. The study will also investigate whether Tai Chi or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy changes levels of the immune cell products that are known to alter sleep. It will also assess individual genetic differences in immune cell products and their possible relationship to insomnia.Learn MoreJewish Women's Breast and Ovarian Cancer Genetic StudyThe research team is studying DNA from Ashkenazi Jewish women for two reasons: to try to identify new genes that might reduce breast and ovarian cancer risk in women who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation; and to try to identify genes, other than BRCA1 and BRCA2, that increase breast and ovarian cancer risk in Ashkenazi Jewish women.If you enroll in this study, you will NOT receive any individual genetic test results. Every participant is assigned an anonymous study number, and no information is connected to their name. This means that there is no way for the researcher to ever tell you anything about your test results. The benefit of taking part in this study is that you will be helping researchers develop better ways of assessing risk in future generations of Ashkenazi Jewish women.Learn MoreBreast Cancer Microbiota StudyThe purpose of this study is to find out what types of bacteria are found in the intestines and how these bacteria metabolize estrogen and other female hormones. The researchers are comparing the bacteria found in women who have never had breast cancer, women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer within the last 5 years, and women who have never had breast cancer but who have a first-degree relative WITH breast cancer.Learn MoreUrine and Tumor Markers StudyThe purpose of this study is to evaluate urinary markers and tumor markers in women with breast cancer to find out if these markers can be used to evaluate some potential therapies against breast cancer. It is also possible that these markers could help determine who would benefit from these potential new therapies.Learn MoreMemory Training Intervention for Breast Cancer SurvivorsThe research team is comparing two different types of memory training programs to see if one or both of the programs might be effective in breast cancer survivors. The study will examine the acceptability, usefulness, and preliminary effectiveness of the memory training intervention.Learn MoreThe Jewels in Our Genes StudyThe research team is searching for new genetic risk factors for breast cancer in African-American women by studying DNA from women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, their female relatives who have had breast cancer, and possibly also their female relatives who have not had breast cancer. They are also going to investigate whether there are similarities in tumor type that develop within the families that take part in the study.Learn More We Stand Ready to Help YouThe Love/Avon Army of Women, a partnership between the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation, and the Avon Foundation for Women, is dedicated to accelerating research into the cause and prevention of breast cancer.
