The top stories attracting comments over the last two weeks are all related to those issues. As we've seen in recent weeks, the comments are passionate, and quite a few are of the "shoot the messenger" variety.Steve Nunez' twin reports produced in the wake of his visit to a TUSD ethnic studies class attracted comments like these:"Anonymous:" "I am all for Hispanic ethnic studies but not what is being taught at Tucson High. A friend of mine had his son enrolled in that class and here is what was taught to him: 1.) AZ, Colorado, NM, California was 'stolen' from Mexico and not bought by the Gadsen Purchase. 2.) That the Gadsen Purchase was a story made up by the white man to cover this theft of land.... 3). That AZ, Colorado, NM and California should be given back to Mexico and Mexico should be compensated for the loss of this land since it was taken illegally by the USA. 4.) That all white people from this area should be removed, if necessary, by force. If white people said something like this (in reverse), it would be bigotry.""Rebecca:" "The truth is, the ethnic studies classes are here to stay! They do not violate any stipulation in the law. TUSD is supporting them wholeheartedly and if it all goes before a judge, we have no doubt the classes will be safe. Also, the classes taught are MEXICAN AMERICAN STUDIES (or Raza Studies as Tom Horne likes to lament) PAN ASIAN STUDIES, AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES & NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES. So folks, again, inform yourselves please. This is not a program that only focuses on Latino culture. Try not to be afraid.I personally know dozens of kids who graduated from high school after having taken these classes - they are now ranging from seniors to freshmen in college - with good GPAs. Also they are working and are upstanding members of our society. Ah, they will be taking care of you someday. You can find peace in the reality that they are going to do great things. :) See, not so scary after all, huh?""Rebecca" also had some choice words about KGUN9. "I'm so grateful that on the day KGUN came to the classroom, Mrs. Federico-Brummer chose to focus the class topic on the extremely biased news reporting that KGUN conducts. Blatant even in this piece! I'm appalled that KGUN, through implications and distortions, would, once again, attempt to make 'protesting' a horrendous subversive activity.... Today, Mrs. Federico-Brummer gave a voice to the voiceless, a voice for those of us who have grown weary of the distorted, slanted news that KGUN offers - as well as their misled, misinformed, and bigoted audience represented throughout the comment section. I have told her before, but I would like to use this forum to say THANK YOU to Maria Federico-Brummer for being a vital & uplifting member of our community - a dedicated, talented and inspiring educator, and for holding up a mirror to a disgracefully biased media outlet - on their OWN PROGRAM!! WELL DONE!!"Rebecca, you clearly are not a fan of KGUN9 News, and I don't think you're ever going to be. But I want to take a moment to address your accusations. No, KGUN9 News does not have an opinion against student protests. Do you? If you think no one should have a problem with such protests, then why would you be so alarmed that our investigation found evidence of a connection between the protest tactics students are learning in class and those they've been using lately in the streets of Tucson? May I remind you that it is Tom Horne, not KGUN9 News, who is objecting to the student behavior? We're simply trying to find out whether and to what extent TUSD's program violates his new law. That is going to be a very important question when and if TUSD has to defend its program in court.Second, if KGUN9 News is so biased, why would we go to so much trouble to allow someone to speak up in favor of the program -- and to allow that person to tweak our noses, as you would have it, in the process?In order to hold on to your belief that KGUN9 News is biased against your side, you had to come up with a theory that we were somehow tricked in this particular instance into airing a pro-Raza study viewpoint. No offense, but that is just plain silly. Neither bias nor stupidity had anything to do with KGUN9 News' decision to present Ms. Federico-Brummer's viewpoints and those of her students. Doing so was part of our basic mission. We neither endorse nor oppose Ms. Federico-Brummer's ideas -- but we are grateful that she trusted us enough to let us into her classroom. She's seen our work -- as you point out, she was showing it in class that day -- so obviously she knew we were not going to ask puffball questions. And we didn't. Yet she and her students still managed to get their viewpoints across -- so much so that it left youpractically chortling with glee. So I would challenge you to rethink the logic of your position.While you're at it, you might compare KGUN9 News' website againstthe websites of other news organizations in town to see if any of them have done any stories similar to this one -- and whether and to what extent they covered the United Nations human rights team that sided with TUSD against Horne. Hint: I already know the answer. If your accusation of bias were fair, you'd be seeing KGUN9 News covering fewer of these types of stories than our competitors -- not more.I'll have more to say on the bias issue lower down."Alan S:" "I just discovered that KGUN's associated story, regarding Sean Arce's response to John Ward's whistle-blowing, gives a VERY pertinent and enlightening fact. These Ethnic Studies classes were designed to be narrowly focused on Latinos as a result of a settlement to a lawsuit in 1997 brought against TUSD by a Latino couple, backed by numerous latino groups. Instead of standing strong, or offering a truly diverse class (teaching students and parents how to research their own heritages, on their own non-class time), they buckled under to the pressure and created this racially biased program. This 'albatross' now remains hung around the taxpayers' necks, without benefit to students of any other ethic background other than Latino.""mpier:" "I am finding it funny that you questioned kids in the class like they are going to say it is a bad thing. Duh. Of course no one in the class thinks that, they are the ones that want to take the class. There are two main points you did not ask. 1 Why should I, the taxpayer, pay for them to learn about their or some else's ethnicity? 2. Why should these classes be allow to do what racists do, which is to point out how much one race is better than another? ....Religion is not in public school therefore racial politics should not be either. If you want it do it on your own dime."Viewers had a lot to say about the story KGUN9 News broke regarding the city of Tucson's decision to turn against co-defendants and side with a police officer suing to block SB 1070, which is the state's crackdown on illegal immigration. These comments were typical:"Bill:" "This law is the start of a Nazi America era. Just look at the two immigrant that got killed by border patrol agents in San Diego. What can we expect from local hillbilly cops?"Frank Chavez: "I believe that any law officer should be discreet when asking citizenship. I believe that one can ask citizenship and be respectful at the same time. I do not agree with the lawsuit against the state. Didn't they take an oath to uphold the laws of this state? If so their personal opinion should not be a factor.""blancapz:" "He says there really could be an impact on commerce. Yes it would definitely curtail the drug and human smuggling commerce. Is this what he means?""George T:" What a loser this Cop is! He took and oath and now is not wanting to abide by it. He should lose his job.""Bill:" "Just listen at the type of language these people that support the law use. Aliens, invasion, diseases, infested, illegals. All the implications are prejudice."KGUN9 News' coverage of an ICE raid targeting illegal immigrants also attracted quite a few comments, as did the follow-up story showing how the deportation of one particular alien criminal was affecting the man's family.Chet Chapman: "During the broadcast there was an interview with a woman deploring the fact that when illegals are deported, it breaks families apart. Solution - the reporter could have asked her why the members of the family here in the U. S. don't go back to the country where those illegals being deported are sent - that would keep the family members together. What a concept! If this is such a racist and terrible country, it is beyond me why those family members living here would want to stay here.""DavidD:" "Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. I work down at the courthouse. This story is a daily occurrence down there. It's nothing dramatic or unusual. It's routine. Some dude who screwed up and broke the law breaks down and cries when he gets sentenced while his family cries as well. It's a simple solution: Don't break the law.""Mike:" "How difficult is it to understand? Don't break a law that could separate you from your family if not being separated from your family is important to you. These people have a choice."Ted Allen: "Thirteen years - that's about how long it takes for the border patrol to catch their man.""Marbleslnger:" "I feel for the family, a little. I feel for the taxpayers more. Maybe the girl should have pushed him to become legal, BEFORE she had his child. Bottom line, he was here illegally.... KGUN, I'm not proud of the angle this story takes. You have always been one of the few mostly balanced sources of local news.""arizona jim:" "Catch a bus to Mexico and be with your loved one. I do not feel sorry for you take your kid and go. BOO HOO.""willham:" "Are you really trying to get sympathy for this law breaking criminal KGUN?"Answer: no. It's not up to us to suggest whether viewers should sympathize with the family. But one of the things journalists do is to show how news events affect real people. That was the sole purpose of this story. And as you can see, it went over like a lead balloon with a lot of our viewers. We didn't get a single positive comment on that one.And finally, our coverage of L.A. County's decision to join the Arizona boycott drew some heated responses."Marcy" writes: "The recent opposition to SB1070 is and the perpetuation of it by our politicians and media is disgraceful and an abomination. Those boycotting our state and advocating such actions should be ashamed! We are a generous and kind nation that has every right in this world to protect our borders from those that would trample upon it and even worse do harm to its people. Every other nation has due diligence to protect their borders and they do. Do we deserve any less? We must protect our way of life and the freedom that its stands for from any and all that would put us in harms way.... I stand with the majority of this nations people who support this law, but, whose voices seem to be drowned out by the irrationality of those who oppose it. Let 'our' voices be heard, not those of angry rabble and attention seekers!"Michelle Musselman: "Myself and my family have been long, long time watchers of KGUN 9 news. Lately we have been turning our television to channel 4 News for the fact that we feel that 9 news is only reporting on the opposition side of the SB 1070 issue. We have hardly seen any news being reported about all of the people who do support the bill. I have been a Democrat my whole life but I am seeing a side to them that I don't want to. We live in Benson and are very close to the border as well as you are. My daughter was good friends and also dated Mr. Krentz' son at one time when they were both going to college rodeos. If you people would do more stories on people who live around these areas and even closer to the border you would see another side of the story. Talk to the ranchers and other people around who are around this all the time. I am not a prejudiced person at all. But I do feel something needs to be done. Because Mr. Krentz did not need to die, myself and my family are upset at the way that you are handling the news on this subject and how awfully one sided you are giving the news to all of us who watch, or who used to watch you."Neil J. Netley writes: "I am extremely disappointed with your unbalanced evening news. Between your support for the arizona vigilantes (minutemen) and your support for the racist state government (passing legislation on sparklers, guns in classrooms, no concealed weapons permits, incandescent light bulbs made in arizona, and racist bill sb1070) I will no longer watch your evening news broadcast. I think the state government should have been solving the state budget problems instead of passing the above issues. Your support of 'jackass john justice' reinforces my opinion. My attitude no longer supports capitalization of arizona. Is anyone on your staff educated??"We get that "bias" complaint a lot -- I've addressed it numerous times before. As the letters above show, we get it from all sides. But for KGUN9 News to be equally biased against all sides at once clearly is a mathematical impossibility. So what is going on here? Part of it probably has to do with the fact that KGUN9 News has devoted more coverage resources to these issues than our competitors. Thursday (6/3) was a good example of that -- when the governor met with President Obama, we not only covered the meeting in depth but also aired several additional elements seeking reaction from various parties. Some of that reaction was from some of the ranchers Ms. Musselman says we're not covering. But we actually have been covering them all along, from the very beginning. In fact, when the cattlemen went to Phoenix to present their plan for border security, I'm pretty sure we were the only Tucson station to go with them to cover the story.But we also try hard to bring other voices into our coverage as well -- which leads to the second reason we probably get bias complaints: It's just human nature, but when someone from one side sees someone from the other side on television, accusations of bias tend to fly. And because we've had more coverage overall, it follows that we've probably presented more stories with more opposingviewpoints for people to get mad about.Our decision to present a viewpoint on the news does not indicate an endorsement of that viewpoint. Our decision to heavily cover an issue indicates only that we think you are interested in that issue -- not that we have a viewpoint on it. We measure your interest in a couple of ways. One, we do it through direct feedback -- your comments. Second, we measure it by web traffic. Although it's probably safe to say that some viewers are beginning to get a little weary of immigration and ethnic studies issues, those are still the highest interest items on our website by a wide margin, as measured by page views. When we have a story that no one else is covering - such as the recent 9 On Your Side ethnic studies investigation, or our coverage of the city of Tucson's decision to side with its police officer against SB 1070, or last week's ICE raid and its follow-up -- those are often the most viewed and/or most commented-on items for the week or even the month.But we do appreciate it when our viewers take the time to let us know how they are feeling, even if the point of the feedback is to smack us around.
