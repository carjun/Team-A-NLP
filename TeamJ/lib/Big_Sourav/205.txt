The clashes have occurred after the Korean War Armistice Agreement which did not resolve the nature of the maritime boundary in the West Sea. They have been aggravated by the presence of a rich fishing ground which is valued by both countries.Contents1 History2 Chronology2.1 1999 incident2.2 2002 incident2.3 2004 incident2.4 2009 incident2.5 2010 incidents2.5.1 January2.5.2 March2.5.3 November3 Notes4 References[edit] HistoryIn 1953 the Korean Armistice Agreement ending the Korean War and establishing the Military Demarcation Line on land made no provision for the boundary between North and South in the Western Sea. In this area a number of islands, belonging to South Korea, lay off the Ongjin Peninsula, now occupied by North Korea.After the United Nations Command and North Korea failed to reach an agreement, the Northern Limit Line was unilaterally set by the U.S.-led United Nations military forces on August 30, 1953. The line was originally drawn, when North Korea had no significant naval forces, as a practical operational control measure to prevent southern incursions into the north. However, its role has since transformed to prevent North Korean ships heading south.[1][2] This line identified the northern ambit of the area patrolled by UN forces in the Yellow Sea. It is unclear when North Korea was informed of the existence of the NLL. Many sources suggest this was done promptly, but in a now declassified 1973 joint diplomatic cable, the U.S. Department of State and Department of Defense stated that "We are aware of no evidence that NLL has ever been officially presented to North Korea."[3][4]In 1973, the status of the NLL was challenged by the DPRK negotiators at the 346th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission.[5] At that time North Korea sent its patrol ships south of the NLL approximately 43 times in October and November 1973.[6]In 1999, the words of negotiators were matched with more assertive actions as DPRK vessels began challenging the NLL, although there was no dispute that a few small islands close to the North Korean coastline remained within the jurisdiction of the United Nations Command since 1953.[2]In 1999, the DPRK unilaterally asserted a maritime Military Demilitarization Line which was configured in waters to the south of the NLL. The dissimilar maritime boundary lines became the foundation of the overlapping territorial claims of the two Koreas.[7]Since 1999, DPRK fishing and naval vessels have regularly ventured across the NLL. In many cases the North Korean vessels return north of the NLL when challenged by the South Korean military, however in some cases there have been collisions between vessels and exchanges of fire have occurred. As the waters along the NLL are rich in Blue crab, the seaborne clashes have sometimes been dubbed "crab wars".[8] Serious naval battles have taken place between North Korean and South Korean vessels in June 1999, June 2002 and November 2009. In March 2010 the Cheonan, a South Korean naval vessel, was sunk by an explosion near Baengnyeong Island. In November 2010 North Korean artillery fired on Yeonpyeong Island.[edit] ChronologyThis Section's tone or style may not be appropriate for Wikipedia. Specific concerns may be found on the talk page.

(December 2010)The disputed maritime border between North and South Korea in the Yellow Sea:[9] A: United Nations Command-created Northern Limit Line, 1953[10] B: North Korea-declared "Inter-Korean MDL in the Yellow Sea", 1999[11] The locations of specific islands are reflected in the configuration of each maritime boundary, including  1Yeonpyeong Island  2Baengnyeong Island  3Daecheong IslandOther map featuresOther map features: 4-Jung-gu (Incheon Intl. Airport), 5-Seoul, 6-Incheon, 7-Haeju, 8-Kaesong, 9-Ganghwa County, 10-Bukdo Myeon, 11-Deokjeokdo, 12-Jawol Myeon, 13-Yeongheung MyeonThe chronology of serial events is a list of discrete incidents and a cumulative narrative. In the two Koreas, the unfolding story was shaped across the arc of an unfolding history.[12]The significance of each naval engagements was construed differently in the two Koreas. Details about event were widely disseminated via newspapers, radio, television and the internet.[13][edit] 1999 incidentMain article: First Battle of YeonpyeongOn 15 June 1999, North Korean torpedo boats and two patrol boats crossed into the disputed waters, escorting a group of fishing boats. High-speed South Korean patrol boats approached the vessels, attempting to ram and repel them. The North Koreans then opened fire, which the South Koreans returned.[14]The battle resulted in the loss of a North Korean torpedo boat, five patrol boats were damaged, 30 sailors killed and 70 wounded. One South Korean patrol craft was lightly damaged along with a corvette.[14] As this was done against the backdrop of high level talks between the Koreas in Beijing, it generated considerable tension. However, neither side escalated, and the talks continued.The United States and China both expressed concern regarding the clash and both expressed hope of a diplomatic solution. Furthermore, it drew attention to the widening gap in military capabilities between the two Koreas and humiliated the North, which styles itself a military power.[15]The consequences of this 1999 incident would be revisited by Koreans during the course of subsequent clashes in the Yellow Sea.[12][edit] 2002 incidentMain article: Second Battle of YeonpyeongOn the morning of 29 June 2002, two North Korean (DPRK) patrol boats crossed the NLL near Yeonpyeong island. When approached by two South Korean (ROK) boats, they opened fire, which was returned. After a half-hour exchange, the DPRK boats withdrew to their side of the boundary line; one was seen to be on fire and badly damaged.One ROK boat was also badly damaged, sinking later whilst under tow back to port. Four ROK sailors were killed, and 18 wounded; DPRK casualties are unknown.[edit] 2004 incidentOn 1 November 2004 three North Korean vessels crossed the NLL. They were challenged by South Korean patrol boats, but did not respond. The ROK vessels opened fire and the DPRK boats withdrew without returning fire. No casualties were reported.[edit] 2009 incidentMain article: Battle of DaecheongOn 10 November 2009, a North Korean gunboat entered South Korean waters off Daecheong Island in the Yellow Sea. The craft was intercepted by a corvette and four patrol boats of the South Korean Navy and a battle began. The North Korean vessel was heavily damaged by South Korean fire and fled back into friendly waters. One South Korean patrol boat was slightly damaged. One North Korean was killed and three others were wounded, the South Koreans sustained no casualties.[edit] 2010 incidents[edit] JanuaryOn January 27, 2010, North Korea fired artillery shells into the water near the NLL and South Korean vessels returned fire.[16] The incident took place near Baengnyeong Island.[17] Three days later, North Korea continued to fire artillery towards the area.[18][edit] MarchMain article: ROKS Cheonan sinkingOn 26 March 2010, the Cheonan, a South Korean naval vessel, was sunk by an explosion near Baengnyeong Island in the Yellow Sea.A rescue operation recovered 58 survivors, but 46 sailors were lost.In May, a South Korean led international investigation group concluded that the sinking of the warship was in fact the result of a North Korean torpedo attack. Included in this multinational group were experts from Australia, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.[19][20]In June, North Korea denied involvement.[21]In July, the United Nations Security Council made a Presidential Statement condemning the attack but without identifying the attacker.[22][edit] NovemberMain article: Bombardment of YeonpyeongUSS George Washington monitoring center during a joint US and South Korea military exercise in the Yellow Sea following an artillery exchange at Yeonpyeong IslandNovember 2010.On 23 November 2010.[23] following a South Korean artillery exercise on Yeonpyeong Island, North Korean forces fired around 170 artillery shells and rockets at Yeonpyeong.[24] The bombardment caused widespread damage on the island, killing four South Koreans and injuring 19.South Korea retaliated by shelling North Korean gun positions. As images of the shelling were spread by media and across the internet,[25] the sight of burning houses and plumes of smoke prompted international reaction.[26]As an immediate response to the increased tensions in the area, the American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington was sent from Japan to demonstrate "the strength of the Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance and [ROK-US] commitment to regional stability through deterrence.".[27][edit] Notes^ Kotch, John Barry; Abbey, Michael (2003).
