Video: Swami Aseemanand- the New Face of Terror    New Delhi :  India|Jan 07, 2011By aymaan30        1 0     Views: 107      The focus has shifted to what is now termed as Hindu Terrorism. Jailed Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh [RSS] leader, Swami Aseemanand has confessed to plotting the Samjhauta express blast, including a host of other violence like Malegaon blast, Mecca Masjid and the blast at the Ajmer Sharif Shrine in Rajasthan. A self-styled spiritual leader, Swami Aseemanand, 59, provided a detailed description of his involvement in terror attacks across the country, since the last three years. This came as a confessional statement to a specially instituted Central Bureau of Investigations [CBI] court in New Delhi. The confessions of Swami Aseemanand bears significance as it throws light on the role of right wing extremists in executing terror inside the country. Swami Aseemanand, alias Jatin Chatterjee, is a Bengali by birth and a post-graduate in Science. He confessed that several activists of the RSS had direct role in the execution of terror, and providing finance and other logistical support. The swami was known for his fiery hate speeches against the minorities, He was arrested by the CBI from Haridwar in November last year for his links in the Mecca Masjid blast in Hyderabad that left at least 9 people dead. During the probe, his name also got associated with the other blasts and his links with Sadhvi Pragya, another accused in the Malegaon blast case. Aseemanand, who seems to have apparently transformed during his stay in prison is filled with remorse. He has apparently revealed the names of key leaders from RSS, Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, including some members of other fringe extremist groups like Abhinav Bharat, Jai Vande Matram and Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram. The next few weeks will be a significant, as it is to be seen how much of ripples will Swami Aseemanands confession create. The BJP as a political party has ideological moorings with that of RSS. The involvement of key RSS functionaries in such incidents of terror does not bode well for the partys image, especially when it is trying to keep its crumbling leadership, and eroding political base intact.        1 of 1              Swami Aseemanand admits hand in Blasts across India     aymaan30 is based in New Delhi, Delhi, India,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (38.5%) India (20.9%) Senegal (11.0%) Canada (6.6%) 12 other countries (17.6%)           READ MORE: Swami Aseemanand, rss leader, malegaon blast, Confessions of Swami Aseemanand, hindu terror, Rss, Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh, Sangh Parivar, political-news, causes-news, India, new delhi, Hinduism, Abhinav Bharat, Vishva Hindu Parishad, Malegaon, Pragya Singh Thakur, Swami, Hindutva, religion, Religious violence in India, Religion in India   More News From: New Delhi :  India     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 4            Reply  Posted By     solarp|2 daysagoHey that may or may not be true..is it just analysis?
