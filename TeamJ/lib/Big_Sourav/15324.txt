Pondering Who in History I Would Like to Meet    Helsinki :  Finland|Jan 07, 2011By Nathaniel Hines        9 0     Views: 472      With a plethora of history-making characters to pick from  both good and bad, the beginning of 2011 has me thinking about who I would like to be acquainted. Would it be John F. KennedyJohn F. Kennedy, Martin Luther KingMartin Luther King or Oscar WildeOscar Wilde? Would I benefit from from a deep conversation with Camus or Confucius or be better off in the quiet presence of Ghandi?  I settled on Jackie.  Not Jackie RobinsonJackie Robinson, the great baseball player who has been credited with breaking the color barrier in United States professional baseball. Nor the likes of Jackie Onasis, formerly the first lady of the United States that startled the fashion world. Not even Jackie Geason, who has provided laughs for millions of people worldwide. The Jackie I speak of is a dog. A hound dog.  During the Second World War, this dog of Finnish origin drew the ire of the entire Nazi regime. Not even Omar BradleyOmar Bradley got the personal attention from the Fuhrer that Jackie did. Jackie developed a paw-raising salute and accompanying bark that had his owner's wife nicknaming him Hitler. Needless to say as word got around the Fuhrer and his trolls were none to pleased.  A cache of newly discovered documents show that Jackie's owner, Tor Borg was interrogated by the Germans on suspicion of insulting Hitler via his dog. Apparently, Borg's wife thought little of the mustached guy.   According to these documents attempts were made to sabotage his business. According to a newspaper account in early 1941, Borg was interviewed by German Nazi officials who had heard reports of the dog's special tricks. Finland at that time was considered a Nazi ally and anything perceived as an insult to the German Reich was questioned.  For three months, the German Foreign Office investigated a path to bring Borg to trial for insulting Hitler, but no witnesses would come forward. Evidence appears that other methodology to affect Borg's pharmaceutical business was also employed. But in March 1941, the Chancellery decided that "considering that the circumstances could not be solved completely, it is not necessary to press charges. Borg's company, Tapereen Rohduskuppa Oy, later renamed Tamro Group, became one of the Nordic region's most successful pharmaceutical firms, according to the Associated Press.  I just like the idea that Jackie gave Hitler a bone to pick. I would have enjoyed doing that myself.        1 of 1         A dog who could get under Hitler's skin     Nathaniel Hines is based in Florianpolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (49.2%) Saudi Arabia (5.6%) Senegal (4.8%) France (4.0%) 37 other countries (32.5%)           READ MORE: Hitler, Nazi, Dog, Jackie, Trouble, Finland, baseball, Jackie O, surnames, Tog Borg, political-news, odd-news, human interest, Helsinki, Martin Luther King, Jr., Oscar Wilde, Camus, John F.

Maybe that's another reason Hitler was mad.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|2 daysagoHe is pretty cool looking. It's one of those looks that can't be manufactured. I wish there would have been some video of his trick - I would've enjoyed that.            Reply  Posted By     Dava Castillo|2 daysagoGreat story Nathaniel! He is good looking dog with or without his shades. LOL            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|2 daysagoLooks like he has one of those permanent smirks on his face. I have been similarly accused.            Reply  Posted By     mrspleats|2 daysagoI rather love this ,pretty interesting. Maybe Hitler had a crush as well(lol)She is a classy lady,love the Jackie O sunglasses too. She understood herself and did her thing she is what I call every woman in many ways.You mentioned many great choices,very hard to choose but I love that you ended up with Jackie O (lol)Rated up!Have a wonderful evening            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|2 daysagoFor the life of my, I couldn't figure out what breed or breeds that Jackie happens to be. If you know, I would be happy to be let in. I see a mix of several 'brands' but I am not a dog connoisseur. Anybody have suggestions?            Reply  Posted By     sunsetgirl|2 daysagovery nice pondering for the new year. great story!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|2 daysagoThanks for the note. The year has started out great and for what ever reason, once I saw that dog smile and found out about this story I started to think.            Reply  Posted By     RaulDeSouza|2 daysagoI would like to meet Hitler and I would like to ask him that how he died :)            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|2 daysagoRaul, I like that. I realize how much of a mystery that remains to this day. thanks for the thought.            Reply  Posted By     BorderExplorer|2 daysagoA wonderful story from a great story-teller. You fooled me: I thought for a second that you might choose Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Guess my mind was still on your Bardot report!            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|1 dayagoI am mesmerized by this dog. Just that one simple picture captures the essence of what he or she was about. I see a Dalmatian, a retriever, and a mix I cannot identify.            Reply  Posted By     George Vieto|2 daysagoDogs are a lot smarter than people think.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|1 dayagoYou will get no argument from me. My favorite dog in my life was a dog called Tiger. As a paperboy, there was never, ever an issue of security. He loved me.            Reply  Posted By     dhreff|1 dayagoNATHANIEL HINES, INTERESTING NEWS REPORT AND IT IS WORTH KNOWING THAT YOUR DOG IS SERVING YOU WELL. LET US BECOME FANS AND FRIEND FOR EACH OTHER. RATE YOU UP.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|1 dayagoI just wish I had a chance to meet him. Thanks for the note.            Reply  Posted By     Robert Weller|1 dayagoI think Mozart would be my first choice, Freud my second, and Nikola Tesla third. If I did meet Hitler I would try to kill him.            Reply  Reply By     Nathaniel Hines|1 dayagoI really like the Tesla choice. Pretty interesting guy.            Reply  Posted By     catspirit|1 dayagoWonderful story. I have thought of this question many times. I belive first would be Hitler - have to get into that diabolical mind. Having studied the subject so long,I need to know the why's and propoganda how's. Jesus Christ, whether Christian or not would love his take on how the world views him.
