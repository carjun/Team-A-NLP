Las Vegas :  NV :  USA|Jan 07, 2011By SarahWyne        2 0     Views: 97      As technology firms rush to cash in on the success of Apples flat touch-screen tablet computer the iPad, a device from the firm behind the BlackBerry smartphone is being hailed as the first serious contender.  Research in Motions seven-inchPlayBook is expected to launch in Britain this summer for around 320, after it was unveiled at a U.S. trade show yesterday. Technology experts have reacted approvingly to the device despite questions about its battery life. Manufacturers hope sales of tablet computers will take off this year, with market researchers predicting a third of online shopping will be done on the devices by 2015.   As many as 60 new tablets  flat-screen computers that allow users to browse the internet and watch videos by touching the screen  could be on the market by the end of the year. BlackBerry smartphones are already a rival to Apples iPhone and RIM executives hope to attract die-hard fans of the brand, who include Barack ObamaBarack Obama.  It is hoped they will forego the iPad, which costs from 439, and flock to their cheaper PlayBook which is designed to synchronise with other BlackBerry devices.  The PlayBook is smaller than the iPad and less than a centimetre thick, a feature that RIM hopes will appeal to younger buyers who dont want to lug around bulky devices. It also performed smoothly during a demonstration in Las Vegas yesterday, loading websites quickly and playing videos with ease.  Concerns about how its battery life will compare with the iPads ten hours were dismissed by RIM, although it did not provide details. Last night, technology experts praised the PlayBooks fast performance, with CNET UK calling it a genuine contender. Apple has sold more than seven million iPads since launching the device in April.         1 of 40         Playbook Vs Ipad      SarahWyne is based in Wauchula, Florida, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (35.6%) Canada (21.8%) Pakistan (16.1%) Japan (6.9%) 7 other countries (12.6%)           READ MORE: Technology Internet, entertainment-news, Las Vegas, Barack Obama, technology-news, Input/Output, Multi-touch, smartphones, iPhone, tablet pc, Personal digital assistants, Research in Motion, computing, Blackberry, Touchscreens   More News From: Las Vegas :  NV :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Apple's Steve Jobs hit new heights in 2010, Person of the year By: rashidhussain      Apple dethroned Microsoft as the world's most valuable technology company in 2010 as its co-founder Steve Jobs soared to new heights with the touchscreen iPad tablet computer and the latest iPhone.Britain's Financial Times last week named Jobs its "Person of the Year" and even US President Barack Obama joined in the plaudits to the 55-year-old ...  12 days ago          Loading News Contributions...
