I was a student at UCSD, and we had just taken over the 5th floor of Urey Hall  a Science building  in protest of the Universitys complicity in the Vietnam War, when we heard the bad news from Kent State. It came over a small radio someone had perched on a chair out on the balcony overlooking the Quad. 13 commentsRead the full article May 4, 1970: 4 Dead In Ohio  We Wont ForgetMay 3, 2010May 4, 1970: Four students murdered, nine wounded by National Guardsmen, on the campus of Kent State in Kent, Ohio.Allison Krause, William Schroeder, Jefferey Miller and Sandra Scheuer were killed in the 13 second fusillade of 67 shots fired by the Guardsmen, after an order to fire was given.19 commentsRead the full article Mike Hardin: Hodads my livelihood, not my life.April 18, 2010Originally posted May 9, 2009by Frank GormlieIts readily apparent that at least in one little corner of Ocean Beach, the recession hasnt really hit  the corner of Newport Ave and Bacon Street, you see the lines end of people waiting to get into Hodads  OBs famous hamburger joint.

Exactly 36 years ago today, on February 22, 1974  all hell broke loose in Ocean Beach  and for many of the seventies generation, this day will always live on in their memory as a day of infamy  the day the world came crashing down on our little seaside community.  It was the day that Pete Mahone, a politicized ex-convict and member of OBs anti-Vietnam war community, tried to commit suicide by cop.  It was also the breaking point in police-community relations, relations that had been simmering for years.25 commentsRead the full article It takes a village.October 31, 2009It never ceases to amaze me what people will do for others when called upon to help and today was no exception. This morning I got to meet Jim Dent, the Point Loma electrician who was compelled to help an elderly gentleman who had called him needing some electrical work done. Jim discovered that was just the tip of the iceberg A call for help went out and the community answered. There is much more work to do and I have no doubt that call will be answered too, but I have to tell you about what happened today.The group of people that came together this morning was as diverse as it was courageous. Jim had warned everyone in his emails and comments leading up to todays cleanup that the conditions were bad and he was well prepared, providing everyone with respirator masks and sturdy gloves. As folks showed up he asked that everyone sign in so we could keep track of who had volunteered (well do a more complete report later) and we passed out supplies.

Over the next few days theyre planning sharing their message of hate at thirty locations around the city. Several hundred students, supported by community activists and church congregations, turned out to voice their disapproval with WBC pickets across the street from San Diego High School on Friday.The student crowd got their message across by beating on pots and pans, chanting Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, Homophobias Got to Go and waving a wide variety of homemade signs. The crowd, initially estimated at 250, more than doubled in size as SD High students were released from classes at 2:20 pm.15 commentsRead the full article The OB Peoples Food CoopSeptember 29, 2009Waaay back in the mists of the sixties, the OB Peoples Food Coop was born. As best I can tell, its beginnings came in fits and starts. I remember participating in a Coop back in 1971, where we went to the North County to buy produce and eggs from small farmers. We drove back to Ocean Beach in a my 1962 Corvair (It was unsafe at every speed!) full of assorted boxes and sorted them out into individual orders at the STP (Serve The People) storefront, located on the 4900 block of Voltaire St. That storefront didnt last very long, due to our landlords distaste for the vandalism incurred on the property by assorted right wingers. After the plate glass window on the front of the building was smashed a second time, we were gone.57 commentsRead the full article The Lie MachineSeptember 29, 2009On the first day of August, a mob of 200 right-wing Texans stormed the parking lot of a Randalls grocery store in southwest Austin. They were united in a single goal: Disrupt the office hours that Rep. Lloyd Doggett, the districts congressman, had scheduled for his constituents. The protesters targeted Doggett for his role in crafting the Houses bill to reform health care, brandishing signs that read No Government Health Care and No Government Counselor in My Home!!! But their anger seemed to encompass a universe of conservative fears: higher taxes, illegal immigration, socialism. 5 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
