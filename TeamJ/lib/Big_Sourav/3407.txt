No, Palin is still gunning for power with her 'blood libel' video on the Tucson massacre By Tom LeonardLast updated at 9:29 AM on 14th January 2011Comments (118) Add to My StoriesThe trademark pillar box red jacket had gone for a more sombre grey one; the lipstick was a more muted shade than usual. Missing, too, was the hectoring tone that we have all come to know. But there was still the tell-tale Stars and Stripes hanging to one side, as Palinesque as the massive, no-nonsense slate and stone fireplace behind her.Scroll down for video Sarah Palin posted a video on Facebook slamming the media for 'blood libel'The wait was over. In an eight-minute long video posted on her Facebook page, Sarah Palin finally responded to the tragedy in Tucson, in which a mentally unhinged gunman shot dead six and wounded 14 others including a Democratic congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords. That America should be waiting for a comment from a former vice-presidential contender and reality TV star about a shooting more than 2,000 miles from her Alaska home says it all about this countrys fixation with her.Barricaded in despair and shame inside their modest home, the distraught parents of Jared Loughner, the alleged gunman, can at least console themselves that most Americans have been far more interested in dragging Mrs Palin out of her own media cocoon to see what she had to say for herself.More...President Obama hoping to 'heal the nation' as he flies in to honour Arizona shooting victims at memorial serviceHolding on: Astronaut Mark Kelly clutches his wife Gabrielle Giffords' hand as she fights for life in Arizona ICU'Our high school love split tipped 'gun killer' over edge': Jared Loughner's childhood sweetheart reveals his descent into madnessPresident Obama arrives in Arizona for memorial service as he prepares to meet family members of shooting victimsMajority of Americans do NOT believe political vitriol is responsible for Arizona massacre, says pollPolice find black bag carried by Arizona 'gunman' hours before massacreHours after she broke cover, Barack Obama delivered a powerfully emotive speech in Tucson at a memorial service for the dead.For many, it was a day in which the two most likely challengers for the 2012 presidency squared up to each other with their own very different solutions to Americas problems  the one calling for unity and civility, the other insisting on the citizens right to express their political views fiercely. As to who won, the jury is out and  as youd expect in the U.S. nowadays  bickering wildly.Sarah Palin's 'target list' of Democrats she wanted to see removed in the November mid-term elections - including Gabrielle GiffordsAnyone who has watched even five minutes of Mrs Palin in action  whether decrying Washingtons socialism from the campaign trail or outhunting caribou in her reality TV show  would not have been surprised that she didnt give an inch to those who claimed her aggressive political rhetoric (often full of shooting metaphors) might have played apart in influencing the mentally unhinged Loughner.Instead, she accused critics of blood libel by trying to assign blame to anyone but the killer. And those two words did what the former Alaskan governor always manages to do when she opens her mouth nowadays, which is create instantcontroversy and instant headlines.'BLOOD LIBEL': ANCIENT TERM USED BY PAGANS A blood libel is a false allegation that Jews used the blood of slain Christian children for ritual purposes. The accusation was originally levelled against both Jews and early Christians by pagans. The libel was ultimately turned against the Jews by Christians, often at the instigation of the local clergy, with resulting executions, massacres, and expulsions in countless localities throughout Europe over a period of nearly 1,000 years. The libels and their resultant trials with their legal expenses and fines also led to the financial ruin of numerous Jewish communities. Among other false charges brought against Jews with similar results were Host desecration and well poisoning.The term blood libel is traditionally applied to the untrue accusations dating back to medieval times that Jews killed Gentile babies as part of religious rituals.Mrs Palin was actually only the second person to use it in connectionwith the Tucson row (a conservative commentator in the Wall Street Journal was the first) but it was the cue for outrage. Jewish groups and politicians accused her of breathtaking insensitivity, particularly as Mrs Giffords is Jewish. It was either that or breathtaking ignorance, they said, leaving unsaid the fact that Mrs Palin has been derided for both failings.Was it also anti-Semitism, some suggested? No, said others such as the respected Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz (who is also Jewish), Mrs Palin was perfectly entitled to usethe metaphor. And as with everything about Mrs Palin, it only served to polarise further those who revere her and those who despise her.Little more than two years have passed since the former beauty queen and youngest governor in Alaskas history was plucked from obscurity by aRepublican Party desperate to find a presidential running mate for JohnMcCain who might match Obamas populist touch.It ended disastrously in a string of gaffes, such as her claim that her foreign policy credentials were strengthened because she could see Russia from Alaska. Now 46, she remains a lightning rod for criticism and derision on theLeft just as her libertarian, anti-establishment rhetoric has endeared her to the Right.As Todd Harris, a Republican strategist, predicted, the video will be loved by those who love her, hated by those who already hate her. Fox News talk-show host Glenn Beck has rubbished the idea that alleged Arizona gunman Jared Loughner was moved to act by either himself or Sarah PalinThe more the establishment attacks her, the more her fans close ranks.Her critics (and they include more moderate conservatives) are appalled. For them, it was Mrs Palin at her worst  tactless, self-obsessed andnot bothered about speaking to anyone but her support base. How like her, they said, to spend so much time defending herself and not mentioning the victims by name. Likewise, her conservative fans, many of them members of the anti-biggovernment Tea Party, lapped up her defence in the video of their angerand their right to express it.More than 30,000 supporters on Facebook posted messages backing her comments within hours of the videos release. Others testing the waters on whether to run for president in 2012 might have chosen more neutral language but not their heroine, the greatWashington outsider who tells it exactly how it is.Nobody understands her base better than she does'Inevitably, the video is being picked over intently. Ken Khachigian, a Republican strategist and former speechwriter for President Reagan, said he was impressed by her more conversational, more dignified bearing, adding that she appeared more grown-up. Mr Harris thought her speech was beautifully written and she delivered with the same star power that she always brings but criticised her failure to try to connect with Americans who arent her natural supporters. Erik Smith, a Democratic consultant, was gobsmacked by the videos political savvy. Nobody understands her base better than she does, he said. Apart from giving occasional interviews to Fox News, the Rupert Murdoch cable TV station on which she is a highly-paid contributor, Mrs Palin only talks to the world nowadays through Facebook and Twitter.Sceptics note  or is that hope  that she wont be able to avoid the conventional media if she runs for president, but for now, in the words of Mr Smith, shes a very savvy practitioner of new media. Jim Jordan, a Democratic consultant, says: Every time she pops off, she excites her narrowing band of partisans and probably makes herself more money, but she further alienates everyone else.Other forensics teams have pored over the video for clues on that popular Washington parlour game  will she run for president? Some saw it as a sign she is keen to challenge Mr Obama  she did, after all, release it on the day he made his speech.Supporting evidence includes the fact that she twice referred to America as exceptional. Conservatives love to trot this out as they know the public feels the president is bad at acknowledging Americas greatness.As to what the wider public thinks, polls showed that two-thirds of Americans did not link Mrs Palin and the Tea Partys rhetoric to the Tucson shooting. Many will probably feel she had a right to defend herself in the video, even if the language might have been better chosen.And the future? Mrs Palins disregard for conventional wisdom then  as now, over the new video  is so much a part of why her fans love herThe conventional view is that Mrs Palin could easily win the Republican nomination as there are no other strong candidates. But she would then, so the theory goes, prove a disaster as appalled independent voters would run to support the Democrats. But to understand the effect she has on rank-and-file Republicans you need to see her in action.Last October, I followed her to Des Moines where she was addressing a1,500-strong audience at the Iowa Republican Partys annual fund-raising Reagan Dinner.Her 33-minute speech, entitled Salute To Freedom, was high on emotionand hyperbole about the need to fight Obamas socialist agenda. The party bigwigs at the front were clearly none too smitten, but the activists at the back lapped it up. At the end, declining to take questions and having done the minimum of glad-handing, she left. The self-proclaimed small-town hockey mom whos earned an estimated $15 million from books, TV and speeches since 2008 headed off to her private jet.The Iowa caucuses are the first national event in the presidential nomination process  conventional wisdom is that visiting politicians have to pull out all the stops to charm the locals. Mrs Palins disregard for conventional wisdom then  as now, over the new video  is so much a part of why her fans love her.Emily Lofgren, at 19 the youngest ever member of Iowas Republican central committee, admitted she gets a lot of ribbing for supporting Mrs Palin but added: I dont care what other people think.And shes not the only one. Inspiring to some, despicable to others, Mrs Palin continues to plough her own political furrow as she heads towards what many see as a showdown with her political opposite next year.Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyNow Watch Sarah Palin's video: Sarah Palin: "America's Enduring Strength" from Sarah Palin on Vimeo.Explore more:People: Jared Loughner, Sarah Palin, Gabrielle Giffords, Barack Obama, John McCain Places: Washington, Russia, America, Europe Organisations: Republican Party Print this articleRead laterEmail to a friendShare this article: TwitterDigg itNewsvineDeliciousMySpaceNowpublicRedditFarkAdd your commentsComments (118)Here's what readers have had to say so far.

Who said "If they bring a knife to a fight, we bring a gun?" Why Barry Obama of course.The REAL story not being reported by the useless press is this. The gunman was well known to the Congresswoman AND he was well known to the Police.The reason the Sheriff shot his mouth off about Sarah Palin was to divert the stupid 'meeja' from asking why the Police and local authorities who were well aware of this idiot yet did NOTHING to stop him. Gifford had had dealings with him long before Sarah Palin came on the scene and as people who knew him have said, he NEVER watched TV or read politics stuff on the internet.Gifford was a gun lover herself, something the 'meeja' have ignored. Luckily most sensible Americans don't trust the lamestream meeja these days.If a Democrat female were bullied like Palin there would be an outcry.- Martin, Ashford, 14/1/2011 09:42Click to rateRating2Report abuseSarah Palin has spoken so much in her speech, yet the only words American lamestream media deliberately and maliciously pick up are "blood libel", and then they try to distort and smear her yet again. There is no better example of "blood libel" than this.... This constant distortion of words and images by American lamestream media to destroy Sarah Palin brought back sad memories of the Great Chinese Cultural Revolution when every word spoken by people were analysed and distorted so that they can be intimidated into silence and submission. Every words and images used had to be approved so as not to offend the Great Leader.....- skponggol, Singapore, 14/1/2011 09:38Click to rateRating18Report abuseGod bless this God fearing Alaskan. Heaven is smiling on her, she will be America's next President. Nay sayers "Get over it."
