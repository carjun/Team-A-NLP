According to preliminary information provided by the news agency Fars semi-state, at least fifty people had survived the tragedy after being rescued from the fuselage and snow. All survivors were taken to different hospitals in the area, while rescue and relief services are still working on the scene even though night has fallen, has indicated the official press. The accident occurred about 19.45 local time, near Lake Urumiyeh, near the border with Turkey, while the plane was preparing to land in the fog, as reported by the chairman of the State Emergency Centre of Iran, Gholam Masumi Reza. The manager has corrected the figure of 156 passengers first announced on state television and has said that onboard the plane traveled 105 people in addition to the flight crew. "The details of the tragedy will be communicated shortly," added Masumi, quoted by state television IRIB. The plane had left this afternoon's National Mehrabad airport, south of Tehran, with more than one hour late due to problems of visibility and cold in the route, which had informed the control tower Urumiyeh. Air crashes are frequent in Iran, mainly due to the precariousness of its air fleet, obsolete and subject, like the rest of the country to an international embargo that prevents from buying replacement parts.         1 of 6         Sarah Shourd waits for her departure flight from Iran at Tehran's Mehrabad airport      Ranasafdaralikhan is based in Karchi, Sind, Pakistan,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (63.6%) Colombia (8.1%) Kuwait (6.1%) Turkey (6.1%) 7 other countries (9.1%)           READ MORE: disasters-news, Tehran, fars province, Aviation accidents and incidents, Iranian Air Force C-130 crash, Mehrabad Airport, Aviation, Masumi Reza, Disaster Accident, Gholam Masumi Reza, Iran   More News From: Tehrn :  Iran     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     Ranasafdaralikhan|about 8 hoursagoVery sad incident,may their soul in rest in heaven.
