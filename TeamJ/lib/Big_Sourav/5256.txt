My only fear is that the weapons will be confiscated by the wrong people and used against the potential victims.  It is a very sad situation.  A whole mindset needs to be changed, but until then, you have to work within the confines of what will work. 4 hours agoflag  reply+5ImConcernedIn the last 10 years:*31 lesbian women have been murdered because of their sexuality*More than 10 lesbians a week are raped or gang raped in Cape Town alone*150 women are raped every day in South Africa*For every 25 men accused of rape in South Africa, 24 walk freeMeanwhile, in america.... In the United States, 1.3 women are raped every minute. That results in 78 rapes each hour, 1872 rapes each day, 56160 rapes ech month and 683,280 rapes each year.1 out of every 3 American women will be sexually assulted in her lifetime.Only 16% of rapes are ever reported to the policeOnly 6% of rapists will ever spend a day in jail, in America.

Rapists are not going to stop raping because u sign a petition. To make a real difference, you could volunteer your time or donate money to a battered or raped womens organization. I'm afraid u were reading my tone wrong. I was just making the point that we cant do anything about what happens in south africa, but we can start at home. 23 hours agoflag  reply0Itsbatman_Durr  ImConcerned:ok i apologize, and htose are all great suggestions. in fact i will see what i can do locally to volunteer at a counselling center as well as donate some supplies and books and such to any in the region i can track down. i didnt mean to come across as accusatory or even argumentative, i wasnt sure is all. i do however feel petitions can help some, if for no other reason thatn they can get a spotlight on an issue that is under represented in the so called media, and maybe get discussions such as ours going that some good might come from, like your suggestions hopefully leading myself and others to do more where they can 23 hours agoflag  reply+1Radical_CentristUnder Apartheid South Africa was hell for Black South Africans.

Also the cultures in America and South Africa are much different. Don't get me wrong rape is rape, and a horrible brutal act at that, but in South Africa they rape not only for physical enjoyment but to psychologically change their raped and their culture supports it. Thats what the petition is for, its supposed to change the government activity over there to be more opposed to this culture of lesbian/gay. In America rape is much more common, but it's also much more non-life threatening than a rape in South Africa. Also, on another post I read of yours it is wise and good to help those who have been raped get through their ordeal and help them move on and be strong, but if you don't change the culture and society that is spawning the rapists then your overall effort is futile (wether in america or south africa). I'm not trying to be argumentative, just want to make you think. 6 hours agoflag  reply+4FishaHouse777barbaric, immoral, and heinous... It's amazing how South Africa was the first to legalize gay marriage yet there is still a war against it there. 1 day agoflag  reply+4mojojujuAnd here I thought that rape had the potential to turn women into lesbians, not to make them heterosexual. 1 day agoflag  reply+5keithponderUNIMAGINABLE . 1 day agoflag  reply+4Itsbatman_Durr  keithponder:its so devastating to think of all the things day in day out that pass for 'problems' when stuff like this is going on in the world. i really just don't know how to even begin to justify why we deserve to exist sometimes 1 day agoflag  reply+3EtVoilaHorrific...I signed it. 1 day agoflag  reply+3CitizenHillAbsolutely despicable, I signed. 2 days agoflag  reply+2ThatCrazyLibertarianThat's just fucking barbaric....signed. 2 days agoflag  reply+3KSirysI did this!!
