Most of the sentiment is running strongly against the strikers, and some of it has been ugly. Here is a sample of some of the more civil comments:Samantha Joy: "Armed with only outside knowledge about this strike, I think that this a terrible time for this to happen. It seems that the only people that are suffering in this situation are the people that depend solely on the transit system. Many are handicapped in some way and have no other means of transportation. I wish that there was another way to settle this dispute."Nolan Gillooly: These people need to go home. They are lucky to have a job. It took me about 6 months to get a job and I take the bus to get to work and now I will have to tell my boss about this and they will not be happy now. People could lose there jobs from this. STOP being so greedy and do your JOB!!!!"Neil J. Netley: Due to the current economic conditions I can not support any strike by greedy unions. Now is an excellent opportunity for SunTran to hire some unemployed people."From BIGNBAD (sent in all caps): "WE ARE ON STRIKE TO KEEP WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THE CITY CLAIMS 'NO MONEY.' DON'T BELIEVE THIS CRAP. IF YOU ONLY KNEW THE AMOUNT OF WASTE $$$ SUN TRAN PRODUCES WITH OVERPAID ADMINISTRATION YOU WOULD BE FLABBERGASTED. IF THERE IS NO MONEY, WHY IS MAYOR + COUNCIL ASKING FOR AND PROPOSING A 60 - 80% PERCENT PAY RAISE - NOT CUT. IT SEEMS YOU THE TAXPAYERS OF THIS DEAF / DUMB AND BLIND CITY WISH TO REWARD FOR BAD SERVICE. NOW THEY CRY 'WE HAVE NO MONEY'. WAKE UP FOLKS. THE CITY HAD 3 + YEARS TO PLAN FOR THIS AND APPROPIATELY MANAGE THE MONEY CORRECTLY. PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T KNOW HOW."From Sharlie Deschaines: "My answer is this: You have a job where thousands of people don't. Quit being greedy. It is because of your greed that thousands of people can not get to their jobs, appointments, medical etc."Cathy Casey: I think it is important to realize that bus drivers hold the safety of their passengers in their hands, just as teachers hold the futures of our students in theirs. To think that City of Tucson garbage truck drivers earn a higher starting wage is very disturbing to me. Even after allowing for the differences in benefits and current COT furlough day requirements are taken into account, it still does not bring the garbage truck drivers' pay to the lower level it should be, compared to the wage bus drivers should be getting for their increased responsibility."Kathryn Ridlehoover: In a time when people have lost jobs and some have no jobs, these apparently self-caring people want a raise. Don't you think this is a little ridiculous? I truly feel that the average mechanic and driver doesn't feel this way but is forced by a Union to act in such a manner. In the past when the air traffic controllers struck, the leadership then fired them and hired new people to take their jobs. Apparently the mechanics and drivers do not care about their job, by letting the Unions bully them. There are many others who would love to have a job. I think the city council should fire the strikers and hire someone who would appreciate having a job."From "Traderjack:" "The Tucson City Council is obviously in the "pocket" of the Sun Tran Union or the City would have had plans in place to have substitute drivers to fill in for the striking drivers during the strike. The City is completely negligent in not providing public transportation!"From Eric & Nadine Maurer: "Your most recent reporting on the SunTran/Teamster contract negotiations was so heavily biased against the union as to be ridiculous. Your interviews were heavily weighted toward the suffering 'poor' who can barely afford the $.40 discount fare. Did you even think of researching what percentage of the riders pay that tiny fare? (Hint: it's over 50%) Did you research other cities to determine competitive fare structures? (Hint: Typically "basic" fares are around $2.00, discount fares around $1.00, transfers (which are free on SunTran) always are additional in other cities, and 'day passes,' $3.00 in Tucson, run as high as $7.50 in St. Louis). While public transit systems are never profit-makers, Tucson is giving away rides almost for free. How about a little "investigative" reporting?"From "RC:" "Fire them all and replace them with new people who appreciate having a job. These selfish people can be replaced by workers who will work a lot harder than the current bus drivers. I have seen bus drivers ignore and pass by customers. They are rude and do as little as possible just like all City employees. Replace them with non union people and you can pay them less and they will work harder. FIRE ALL SRIKING WORKERS NOW."Manuel Barredo: "I think the City of Tucson should have spent time on the bus transportation problem, instead of the half a billion dollar hotel being proposed. Also the City of Tucson should remember the 13 schools that are closed, the half a billion dollar hotel will be vacant 6 months out of the year. We will have less schools, no transportation, and a half a billion dollar hotel that will not work. Let's get a city government that cares about its youth and citizens that need to ride public transportation."John Bravado: "Well let's see. They sign a contract for 3 years. So no raise for 3 years.... This strike is about more than money. Because of Tucson's financial situation they also wanted to reduce service and layoff 100 people. So sure Sun Tran should accept the terms and then put 100 people on welfare. I am sure that would make all you government dependent Dems happy, but these people are trying to look out for each other."From "Eagle_one:: "Boos, Jeers & Sneers to the Union. In a time of economic crisis, their drivers (who provide extremely poor customer service to their riders) are more concerned about how high their pay can go and further gouge the taxpayers. This transit service needs to be voted out just like the Dems will be in November."From "Stan:" Thanks Unions. Once again, everyone is expected to tighten their belts except union members. Most companies who have had to cut back to save jobs have employees happy or at least willing to do that. Not the unions though. Whatever, we should break the Unions and just get people working again."From "Smurfyone:" Before people condemn unions, such as Sun Tran, they should get all the FACTS from both sides as to why this strike was voted in. People would learn that it's not as simple as give us a raise or we will strike. There are other factors involved in the contract and how the management company wants to take benefits away or change wording in the contract that would basically hurt their hard working employees. It not about the money its about at least being able to keep what they have. To bad some people are so narrow minded that they don't look at whole picture and believe just what they read without getting all the details."Also this week, we heard from people commenting on my explanation of why KGUN9 News aired an hour of live coverage of Thursday's anti-SB 1070 protest. The majority of those who wrote made it clear that they didn't buy my explanation.Many repeated comments we've heard before, saying that the public opinion polls, which show that the majority of Arizonans favor SB 1070, should be guiding our coverage decisions. "Paul C's" comment was typical: "My question is why would this station cover a protest against a law that 65% of Americans, not just Arizonans support? If you want to loose viewership that is the way to go. This station basically just stated it supports criminals."While Paul was predicting decreased viewership, "Kristina Rogers" felt our decision was motivated by ratings: "As they say, the more words you need to defend your actions - usually suggests you are trying to convince a wrong. And to add, using a competitor as justification is weak - much like a child saying the others were doing the same. It is not what you say - it is your actions. I am not one to respond to any news event - the 'why' - because it only increases ratings or more importantly convinces your management team it what the right decision. End of the day money drove your decision - not the event."For almost everyone, the writers' political views on SB 1070 seemed to drive their opinions of the coverage. Comments from "1justice1" illustrate that point: "I am satisfied with what Jan Brewer has done to highlight an extremely salient issue. I feel the outcome of the first hearing (though not "ideal") is the beginning of the end regarding the feds poor lack of initiative. GOOD JOB GOV. BREWER. EXCELLENT WORK! If you live in the U.S. and are only here to sponge off our systems then BE GONE. We are in need of PATRIOTS only! As far as the extended news coverage; It seemed to be overkill and really covered nothing of substance after the first 5 minutes. A 1-2 minute story covering the incident would have been appropriate. Sorry KGun9, but I have to give you a 1 out of 5 stars on this one."Many felt KGUN9 News had no business publicizing what they felt was repugnant and/or illegal behavior by demonstrators. From Arizona Jim: "That no good sorry [deleted] that is dragging the American flag around on the ground is lower than whale dung and is too ignorant and disrespectful to be deported. He or she should be jailed for 50 years and then sent home to Mexico. Why do the news media give these pigs air time....?"From "Camtoy97:" "These protestors want their rights, yet they impede the rights of others by blocking their way home, and you gave them the platform. Rights go along with respect for the country that puts food on their table, not the Mexican flag they wave. They walk all over our flag, yet they want rights. Are you kidding me?"Many stuck to their guns that KGUN9 News had no business giving a live coverage platform to one side of an issue. From "Tucsonray:" "Your one sided coverage reflects the general lack of integrity in the news media. In tonight's broadcast there was more concern to get comments from those who broke the law than concern about bringing them to justice."A few didn't feel the coverage was biased, just overdone. From "i": "I don't think this was biased newcasting at all. I don't know why people are freaking out over it. There was a protest. You covered it. That's the fact of the matter. And you did a fine job with it. HOWEVER you beat the horse dead. What i am upset about is that you spent AN HOUR!"But some didn't want the news coverage to be shouted down by supporters of SB 1070. From "anonymous: "Thank you for your coverage of the protest and of your response to the avalanche of comments, emails, and phone calls. I'm sorry that you had to undergo abuse for doing your job. I'm emailing you personally instead of posting a comment because your team did such a good job, as did you in your explanation, that I am switching to KGUN9 from KVOA. I did not find your coverage to be biased at all, and those who thought it was were reacting without thinking. The protest was news and history unfolding before our eyes because you gave us the opportunity to watch it. That is a rare opportunity these days, especially from local news. To hear a condensed version later with a few sound bites, that's when bias can sneak in. We got to see the events unfold and judge for ourselves. Thank you for continuing to do that, despite the vitriolic outpouring of loud viewers.... You did what the news media is supposed to do, you went out of your way to cover important news unfolding live. That's really something to treasure. Thank you for your dedication to your work. Please keep it up!"Some just wanted to talk political strategy. From "Swisslady: "On one comment site a pro illegal protester asked why more for SB 1070 were not out demonstrating. They followed the rules, and I replied 'it can be done intellectually, we write, call and fax. We don't have to go out and yell and scream, and block traffic."Some, in the minority, just felt that the news was the news and that KGUN9 News did what it was supposed to do to cover it. From "Todd-debt-free": "No way. You did what you had to do and covered the NEWS as it occurred. You did not make it up. You reported with a multi-national staff that did and dose represent Arizona's population. Having recorded other news casts I see they took your tact. :) but only after you were already there. You did not give in to sensationalism. You never gave any opinion. You stuck to the facts. You read e-mails. No journalist could do more. I could not be more proud of you all. Thank you. Honestly, you set the mark. You did not follow it."I also heard from two people who wrote me directly (I hyperlink my personal e-mail address at the end of every blog entry). One accused me of being a "shill" for the right wing, and invited me to drop dead and then go to, well, you know where. The other accused me of just the opposite, declaring that I was in the pockets of the left wing,but did notwish me any health problems or suggest any trips, which I appreciated.Is that an indication that the right tends to be kindler and gentler than the left? Two examples probably don't give enough data to answer that question, but the e-mails were certainly interesting.Please keep those comments coming.
