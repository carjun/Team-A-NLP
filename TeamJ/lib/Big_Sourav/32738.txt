The random thought can be connected to many other topics of thought, but consist within one train of thought.I know that sounds bizarre or strange, but I do not claim to be normal and should you decide to read any of my other writings, besides my poems, then you would have a clearer understanding.All my poems contain messages and bring to life an understanding, that has long been dismissed among many people, all across Nations, cultures and ages.As you check out my random thought of the day.....try to remember......life is more about others than you.I do hope you enjoy the poem and feel free to leave a comment. Thank you for your time. A Random Thought........The people I have met over the last six months,Have been great to me in many ways.There has been differences between many,But, life continues to bring each one into harmony.I could point out that most of the people I have met,Are women more than men and they love to play hard to get.Some pass on compassion to others so as to help them along,However, it seems like a lot of other people rather simply hit a bong.There are plenty of poets, writers, sellers, and others who care not,Some of their words will tie you up into a knot.Many do not realize that we are all connected to one another,Similar to say family- such as mother, father, sister or brother.The simple fact that we are all human beings should say it all,And if it is never realized then it will make for the humankind's downfall.Too many governments trying to play ruler,Too many people pretending to have a clue when in truth they are bitter.The Poetry of Robert Frost: The Collected Poems, Complete and UnabridgedAmazon Price: $18.75List Price: $45.00When does enough become enough to warrant action,The main cause of problems of many people's lives is stagnation.People in America are dependent on government more than self,This ultimately ruins or destroys one's life or recognition of self.The serious lack of knowledge going around in America is sad and true,It is almost so bad that it could make one blue.The most appalling aspects of other people interfering in other people's life,Is that these people think that they have a right to do so without a fight.They are sadly mistaken and poorly misinformed about what rights are,Kind of like, the misconception of driving a car.Oh Yes driving a car is a misconception supposedly bestowed privilege,However, it cannot be a privilege because the required instructional knowledge.It is passed down from parent to child, so as to help with the bonding process of family,It is not a given privilege to operate a car or to learn how to use one daily.Operating a car is your right because it is a product or goods offered to you,It comes from the open free market economy so you can improve.The myth driving is a privilege given to citizens has gone on long enough,It is almost time for the citizens to get rough.Written and Created ByRaymond Choiniere II - Cagsilvote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...?

I get it, as I do your other hubs.What you're saying here is that driving a car (or any other action that has a potential impact on others) comes with a responsibility.  If one ignores this responsibility, thinking they have a right or privilege to take that action, then they are compromising their safety as well as the safety or well-being of others.Nicely written.lyricsingray9 months ago Cagsil, this was sooooo cool and spot on.  Many more than just one message and full of truth, some sadly so true. Imagine a world where it was just instinct to put others before ourselves first, I wish, but I am no Princess and this (life) is no fairy Tale.Thoroughly enjoyed all of it my friend, thank you for sharing more of your inspiration about life with us.Which by the way is all about putting others first.Way CoolKimberlyPetra Vlah9 months ago I liked your random thoughts, but why would you call them a poem? Even prose poetry is based on metaphors... Other than that very engaging and enjoyableCagsil9 months ago Thank you everyone. Very much appreciated.@Petra Vlah. Yes, it is a random thought, but crafted in poem style. I felt like putting it into a poem format, instead of simply expressing it as a single hub. At least as a poem format, I can group it together with my other poems. I'm glad you liked it. Thank you again. :)Shalini Kagal9 months ago Hi Cagsil - as I was reading that, it sounded almost like a rap song in my mind looking at things one takes for granted with an entirely new perspective. Thanks for sharing!shazwellyn9 months ago Caggie... this has been written in an extraordinary way!  Very creatively written with some explanation.  It seems that you have grown - like me - since we both started on hubpages.  Haven't we seen a lot of people come and go?You are particulary right about stagnation - it stops people from living a life!  That cant be a good thing.  Some great points, well formed.  Thanks :)Cagsil9 months ago Thank you Shalini Kagal, I am glad you stopped by to read it and leave a comment. I'm very grateful. :)Thank you Shazwellyn, I appreciate the compliment and I'm glad you found it creative. That was what I was trying to do, be creative with a random thought. That is why I put it in a poem. :) Thank you again for stopping by my hub. :)katiem29 months ago I so get it and agree... Peace :)Cagsil9 months ago Thank you Katiem.

I'm very grateful for everyone visiting and leaving such wonderful comments. :)akirchner9 months ago Very good random thoughts! I like the when is enough enough? Sadly, I think we must all be brain dead to allow so many travesties of justice to simply go by without doing something.  And yes, we are all connected - it would be nice if folks actually thought about that once in a great while.....good thoughts to bring to our attention.Philipo9 months ago This is a nice random thought just straight from the heart.  You are aboslutely ight in all ramifications.  Nice hub.  More please.Cagsil9 months ago Thank you very much Philipo. I'm glad you liked it. Also appreciate you taking the time to leave a comment. :)samiaali5 months ago Cagsil, A lot of truth, and very well written!  Thank you!Cagsil5 months ago Thank you samiaali for reading and commenting. Also for the compliment. I'm glad you liked it. :)Daniel J. Neumann4 months ago "Operating a car is your right because it is a product or goods offered to you,It comes from the open free market economy so you can improve."I like this poem, and the resonating message. I agree that we need to get to places and, if we buy a product, we should be able to use it without being "approved by the state."At the same time, I really wish we could invent a safer, automated transportation system.I think conglomerated industry ownership has created a stagnating, non-competitive corporate oligopoly in almost every industry. A truly free-market allows small and medium sized business to succeed and fail. Too-big-to-fail my ass.Thanks for sharing this,DanCagsil4 months ago Hey Dan, I don't have a problem with the government telling me that I require a license to operate the product I buy, but what have detest is them passing of that their approval or requirement(license) is something that is not. Government claims it is a privilege that they allow people to drive when it is a right of a person, because they are a legal age and can buy the product. As for a company being too big to fail...that's just political spin by politicians, so as to continue protecting the upper 1% of food chain, so they can continue to manipulate the lower bottom 99%. Thank you for the comment and compliment. I'm glad you enjoyed it. :)Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sitesOther Hubs From Other WritersTime For Lights Out  He tells me he loves me  As the pain grows  I want to scream  What no one knows  Where is the love  Did he run away  Where did he go  I wish he would stay  But this is my curse  None stay long ... - 2 hours agoMy first love poem uncoveredTrue loveunbolted  Forgive my tendercourse of minimal affection,  It seems you wisha more memorable attention,  So true and howmy shame is killing the redemption,  And what I hopeto reach thy... - 6 hours agoLove HaikusIf you have ever readlove haikusyou know that these short poems are strangely captivating.
