Gabriel Giffords (D-AZ), but told TPM that this doesn't mean her group is going to tone down their rhetoric: "I think anytime you start suppressing freedom of speech, I think it's wrong. I live here and I didn't hear anything  that concerned me in terms of inciting violence."Allyson Miller, a founder of the 500-member Pima County Tea Party Patriots, told TPM in an interview today that the members of her group, as well as the entire city of Tucson, were "deeply saddened" by the events of today and said "there is no place for violence" in political debate."This is outrageous," she said.Miller was quick to distance her group from the shooting and said that she felt she had to go on the defensive after news of the tragedy began to spread. "I did feel, you know, very like 'why are they jumping to this conclusion before they even knew the person's name?' They're jumping to this conclusion that it has to do with the hotly contested Congressional race," she said. "Well, apparently, from what I've seen so far...it's looking like that's not the case."Read more: http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/01/tucson-tea-p...

Well, the thing is.. it's ALL on the side of the republicans and libertarians.  They are the ones doing this.  And the typical media response is to somehow make it seem like "well, they're ALL doing it" and that's wrong. It's one side, one TV station, and they're wrong.  All I can hope is that some reasonable people on the other side will look into their hearts and realize it's time to pull it back.  John Stewart was right... we gotta stop this.  But it's not up to the Democrats to do this. WE don't own the airwaves, the repubs do.  We don't own the shadowy industry groups that are fronting for the NRA and insurance industry that have promoted this death before defeat mentality.  It has to stop.

Gordon Liddy saying "shoot ATF agents in the head" and the non-stop vitriol of right-wing radio. Does the mainstream left in America really embrace the violent vitriol of let's say the Nation of Islam, Communist Party USA, other leftist groups?

They were only convicted in federal court (by a Democratic-appointed judge BTW) of conspiracy and malicious destruction (not attempted murder) after plea deal. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd's (a Democrat) office and a portrait of Daniel Webster got damaged.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_United_States_Senate_...

I was raised in Arizona, and I can't fathom how totally fekked up that state has become.  Gov.
