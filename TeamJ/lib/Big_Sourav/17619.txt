They would blend into the setting almost unnoticed until the Spring of the year when they would become one of the stars of the forest.Eye popping colors of clusters of light to deep magenta pink flowers blooming along the branches and in some cases even the younger trunks could not help but draw one's attention to these majestic beauties.Birds and bees feast upon these flowers and in early days the native Indians would have also incorporated the blossoms into their diets.In fact, from what I have read from various sources, these redbud tree blossoms are edible.Perhaps this Spring I will pick a few and add them to dress up a salad. The bright blossoms would certainly add dazzling color to a dish! Redbud trees send forth their bouquets of color prior to them leafing out. Depending upon where the trees are grown and the variety of tree, blooming time is typically anywhere from March to May and can last a month or longer.The leaves of the redbud tree unfurl to form a beautiful heart shaped leaf and those leaves turn yellow in the Fall of the year adding to the other Fall colors before dropping their leaves for the Winter months.20 to 30 feet (or 6 to 9 meters) is the average height of a redbud tree and the width pretty well matches the height. It has an upright growth habit for the most part, although there are some varieties that are smaller and have an umbrella-like drooping growth habit as can be seen in one of these attached videos.This makes it perfect as an ornamental plant for most home landscapes depending upon lot size. Often smaller city lots cannot accommodate large trees so this is one to consider when planting trees for the first time just because of its size...not withstanding its profuse Springtime show that it performs each year.The redbud tree is fairly hearty and can be grown in various types of soil.The bark as it ages becomes a reddish brown in color and has a gnarly scaly surface which is quite interesting to behold.Redbud tree wood is quite hard and if pruning branches when the tree is dormant (which is always the best timing for such projects) and if sawing by hand, be prepared to use some strength in cutting that wood.While most of the varieties of redbud trees bloom in various shades of pink, there is a white blooming redbud tree that can be found in nurseries if one wishes to have that color in the landscape.Where these Redbud tree photos were taken.Houston, Texas - Houston, TX, USA [get directions]{"lat":29.762884,"lng":-95.383064,"zoom":8,"mapType":"TERRAIN","markers":[{"id":"11224","lat":29.762884,"lng":-95.383064,"name":"Houston, Texas","address":"Houston, TX, USA","description":""}]}Conditions for Houston, TX at 7:34 pm CSTCurrent Conditions:Cloudy, 43 FForecast:Sun - Cloudy.

Our yard it rather small and has a  large maple tree in back. Actually another one behind it which we could probably do without. It does usually look nice especially in the fall.tnderhrt239 days ago Very lovely hub, indeed, Peggy W! Your photos are fabulous, your information well-written, educational and interesting! Although  Autumn is my favorite season in the fall, Spring is definitely my favorite season in the Spring! Sounds silly, perhaps, but tis true...nonetheless! Thank you for reminding me that there is something spectacular to look forward to just around the corner! Voted up!Peggy W9 days ago Hello DiamondRN,Oh you will be very happy with your two new redbud trees I am sure.  Just wait until you see them flowering in the Spring!  We had planted two 5 gallon sized redbud trees in our former home and at least in this climate they grow fairly quickly.  Thanks for the speedy and first comment.Peggy W9 days ago Hi dahoglund,Actually unless one has hundreds of acres it would be impossible to have every tree one might like to have growing there.  Our yard had this redbud tree already growing there when we moved in and like you...we do not have room for more.  Sugar maple trees are so beautiful in the Fall of the year up north.  I remember their beauty well!  Thanks for the comment.Peggy W9 days ago Hello tnderhrt23,Glad you liked these pictures of the beautiful flowering redbud trees.  I've had them in the computer since last Spring and finally decided to do something with them.  As to the seasons...they are all pretty in their own way, Fall and Spring probably being my two favorites.  Thanks for the vote up and your comment.tonymac048 days ago These trees are very beautiful. I love trees and your words have given me a lot of interesting information about these redbuds - thanks. A good education!Love and peaceTonyPamela998 days ago I have always thought Redbud trees were beautiful and your pictures are great.  Beautiful hub, rated up.katrinasui8 days ago I always like spring lowers. Its great to read interesting information about these trees. Another great hub from a good writer.Micky Dee8 days ago I've seen so many of these in NC. They are such a treat in the mountains. Great hub as always Peggy! I love these Redbuds!Peggy W8 days ago Hi Tony,So happy to have been able to share this information about the redbud trees with you.  Do you have any type of a similar blooming tree in South Africa?Hello, hello,8 days ago They are absolutely beautiful.  Thank you for writing this lovely hub especially now where there are no flowers outside.Peggy W8 days ago Hi Pamela,Like you, we have always admired redbud trees especially when they are in bloom.  Thanks for the comment and vote up.Peggy W8 days ago Hello katrinasui,So happy to hear that you enjoyed this hub about the beautiful flowering redbud trees in the Spring of the year.  I enjoyed taking these pictures last Spring.  Thanks for your most complimentary comment.Trish_M8 days ago How beautiful! I hadn't heard of these before. :)Peggy W8 days ago Hi Micky,As you go on those bike rides passing wooded areas, those redbud trees when they are in bloom certainly add a splash of color.  I think that most everybody enjoys seeing them in the Spring of the year.  Thanks for the comment.Peggy W8 days ago Hi Hello, hello,For those like you who live in northern climates, you may not have flowers outside but you probably have the beauty of pristine white snow...at least at times, and that has a beauty all its own.  It won't be many months now before the redbud trees will be gracing our yards with beautiful color adding to the mixture of other blooming varieties of plants.  Thanks for the comment.GusTheRedneck8 days ago Hi Peggy - You did a real good number with the redbud trees. Sure are nice photos. We have three redbuds in our yard, two of them planted with cutting from the first. Here's something else that is nice about redbuds - the smoke from a redbud stick in your BBQ is very aromatic and flavorful.Gus :-)))Peggy W8 days ago Hello Trish_M,You had not heard of Redbud trees?  Well now you know a bit more about them.  Perhaps they do not grow in your area?  They would be hard to overlook when they are in bloom.  Thanks for taking the time to comment.Peggy W8 days ago Hello GusTheRedneck,So glad that you liked these pictures that I took of the redbud trees in our area.  I had no idea that one could propagate redbud trees from cuttings.  Growing them from seed probably takes a lot longer!  Also good to know about the wood being used to flavor BBQ's.  Thanks for adding this information about the redbud tree.  :-)prasetio307 days ago Wow and wow... I love this hub very much. I am glad to know how you made this so beautiful. You have great presentation  which made this hub easy to understand. Thanks for share amazing pictures and video. This time, I learn much from you. Keep on writing. I believe 2011 is the best year for you. I hope you always do the best for us. Rating up. Happy New Year, and wishing you all the best in 2011. Cheers,Prasetio:)Sally's Trove7 days ago Redbud isn't too common in our area, southeastern Pennsylvania, but it is becoming more prevalent than it was. Twenty years ago, I don't recall seeing any. Now I see them most often as cultivated specimens, but less often growing in the wild.This observation might be a very subjective matter. Ten years ago I spent a lot of time traveling in West Virginia in the spring and was amazed at these magnificent trees that lit up the landscape like neon lights. Shortly after those trips, I began noticing the redbuds in my area. I kind of wonder if my perception about these trees is akin to that of pregnant women...once you are pregnant, especially for the first time, you suddenly discover that the whole world is pregnant! It could be that redbuds were always here, but I only became aware of them because of the intense concentration of them I'd seen in West Virginia.On the other hand, it could be that the redbuds appearing in the wild here had their start as seeds from the cultivated trees.With all that said, I think you can see this is one of my favorite spring-blossoming trees. Rated up and beautiful for the text and your fabulous photos!KoffeeKlatch Gals7 days ago Peggy, your redbud tree is absolutely beautiful.  I didn't know they looked like that.  It makes you want to go out and purchase one.Peggy W7 days ago Hello Prasetio,So very happy that you not only liked this hub about the beautiful redbud tree as seen via pictures but that you also learned some new information about it.

It is true that once our attention has been drawn to something, we seem to see it much more often than previously.  Nice to know that you are now enjoying the beautiful redbud trees and thanks for your comment.Peggy W7 days ago Hello KoffeeKlatch Gals,We have purchased and planted redbud trees at our former house and inherited the one where we now live.
