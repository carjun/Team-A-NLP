It was gratifying work and allowed me to care for my family in a simple fashion, we didnt want for much, but we didnt want much either. I went about my daily life pretty isolated from the issues that affect so many, I had a job, we had health insurance and until that company closed I didnt really understand how good we had it.4 commentsRead the full article Welcome to OB  Generosity, Caring, Empathy, ToleranceJuly 2, 2010A new sticker that we can relate to.Tell us what you think about the new sticker put together by the folks at the Regional Task Force on the Homeless, who will be present at the community forum on Tuesday night.(MORE DETAILS AND ALL LINKS INSIDE)99 commentsRead the full article San Diego Coffee Party Movement first meeting gets a big turn-out!March 13, 2010We had a wonderful turnout  75 people signed in and signed the civility pledge! It was wonderful to see the packed house, it was standing room only.Lots of people stood and attested to why they had come, many saying they were frustrated the way the media was portraying the average citizen and that they felt we needed a voice, a sane and civil voice, to be heard on the issues that matter to us all.11 commentsRead the full article Was the Compton Cookout an Expression of Free Speech?February 22, 2010We just watched a 10News broadcast that showed the results of poll they did regarding the Compton Cookout and whether folks thought the people throwing this party were exercising their right to free speech. I was pretty astounded to see the 53% agreed. My first thought was that anyone who said yes didnt actually read the invitation, didnt hear the actual words used to describe this event.The following was supposedly posted as a Facebook event invitation, read it and tell us whether you think its an expression of free speech, or not.    February marks a very important month in American society. No, im not referring to Valentines day or Presidents day. Im talking about Black History month. As a time to celebrate and in hopes of showing respect, the Regents community cordially invites you to its very first Compton Cookout.48 commentsRead the full article Classified Ad Listings, by OB for OB!February 21, 2010We must be crazy. but were going to give this a shot!Were not looking to be another Craigs List so were going to start small with just a few categories:    * Jobs  Help Wanted and Jobs Wanted    * Housing  For Rent and Roommates    * Services  legit services offered by individuals    * Stuff  for sale, for trade, for free!Its very simple to post a listing, just post a comment under the section where you want to place an ad.

Make sure you include some kind of contact information in the big comment box, the email address you put in the small box IS NOT VISIBLE to the public.5 commentsRead the full article Johnson & Johnson, Omnicare, Risperdal, Grandma and big bucksJanuary 16, 2010Sometimes some of the scariest news I read is in the business section. This morning, for example, Johnson & Johnson accused of paying kickbacks, Federal case involves drugs in nursing homes.I am getting more and more anti-drug. Or maybe I should say anti-pharma. When I watch television I have to hit the mute button during all the pharmaceutical ads just to drown out the fine speak, the hurried, monotone spiel informing consumers of all the possible side effects of the wonder drugs they are trying to promote. What really torques me is that a lot of the time they dont even say what the drug is supposed to do for you, but inform you to ask your doctor if it might be right for you. How many people ask doctors about drugs to treat conditions they dont even have? Probably more than I would be willing to admit, and those people trust their doctors, dont they. And they trust their pharmacists to give them the straight dope, right?10 commentsRead the full article Free Frank! More History of OB and the RagDecember 15, 2009Today a good friend sent us a tidbit that he found tucked away in his morgue file, and that got me sidetracked in a real fun way.Frank has written a lot of historical pieces on Ocean Beach (click on HISTORY up there in the navigation bar, you wont be sorry) and in my opinion this article needs to be part of the story of the Collier Park Riot. Originally published in the door (another San Diego underground paper) in May of 1972, it tells a bit of the story of our very own EditorDude on that infamous day in March 1971.26 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
