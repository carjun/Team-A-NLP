I hate false equivalency. it's been the weakness of the media for the past 10 years.  They cannot just report or opine on the wrong of the right wing, they have to find something.. even a crumb of something that the left may have done, to make it seem as if we're all guilty. The two are never equal...  like holding the class after school because one student misbehaved.

How were DEMS responsible for that murder?  They worshipped the ground JFK walked on.It's just another Pug trick to pass the buck when they're caught.  "Well he did it, too".Saint Reagan was a master at that.  He slithered out of Treason charges.  Bush, not so good.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmistertrickster      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:46 AMResponse to Reply #714.Yup, also agree.  It's not the Libs who put the targets on the faces of their political opponents.It's not the Libs who called Kerry a "traitor."  It's not Libs who said if you didn't support Bush's Iraq adventure based on a pack of lies you were a "terrorist lover."  It's not the Libs who called Dr. George Tiller a baby killer until Scott Roeder shot him in the head.  It's not the Libs who shot up a Unitarian Church to "kill liberals." It wasn't a Lib but a RAD-CON Byron Williams who was arrested after firing at police and injuring two officers. He claimed he wanted to wanted "to start a revolution" by "killing people of importance at the Tides Foundation and the ACLU.  Or how about Richard Poplawski who opened fire on two Pittsburgh Police officers responding to a 911 call from Poplawski's mother. Three police officers killed and another two were seriously injured. Poplawski held many right-wing views such as Obama would confiscate guns, and FEMA runs concentration camps.  He was not a liberal.Not a liberal James W. Von Brunn did time for attempting to kidnap members of the Fed Reserve and in 2009 shot and killed a guard at the Holocaust Museum in DC.Until the Weather Underground comes back and starts blowing things up, there's no way one can say "both sides are at fault."So far the hate speech leading to violence has been entirely on one side.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNuclearDem      (881 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 03:09 AMResponse to Reply #717.You notice he named himself as one of those on the left, right?And by and large, he was naming only right-wing politicians and commentators, but his whole message was that no matter who you are, or what political persuasion you may be of, violence and violent rhetoric are unacceptable.He had a really good message in there.

Another guest said the same and Keith emphatically agreed. Keith was making the point that in the past it has come from the left like the black panthers and the weathermen. That's why Keith said what he did in his special comment.I had hoped Obama would have called for an end to the hate mongering that's coming from the right but he didn't. As usual I have to watch Keith to get that. This incessant mocking of Obama's birth, his religion and loyalty to this country has gone over the edge. Which is what the likes of Limbaugh, Beck and Palin wanted. I am still profoundly disillusioned that the likes of Westboro Church are allowed to abuse families at funerals in the name of freedom of speech. The right to threateningly harrass and intimidate congressmen/women..voters or the president is NOT what the founders meant by protected speech. What Beck and Limbaugh do in their daily rants of lies and provocative bombasts of the left is not protective speech. It's emotional pot stirring and enticement. This is where it has led. The shooting of innocent people.I was so relieved that the sheriff of Tucson had the courage to say what he did. It's time somebody did. Congress needs to have a hard look at the abuses being done to our 1st amendment. Sharon Angle and her second amendment remedies proposition was completely out of line. This stuff needs to end right now. We need to openly discuss why hate speech is protected speech.

The panthers fed children. There is no comparison between what they did and the right. The right wants corporations to rule. It is corporations or US. Can't be both .Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topflorida08      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 08:48 AMResponse to Reply #2527.I don't think Keith was making a judgement callagainst them..just pointing it out. There were some militants in the party unfortunately as there always are. They did openly carry guns and chant "off the pigs" and some policemen were killed. That's why it's dangerous to pander to the fringe in our society. Not that the panthers were. Just some elements. You're right about the teabaggers wanting the corps to rule. I still don't get that at all.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopStuart G      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 07:49 AMResponse to Original message21.K and  RPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopScottLand      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 07:56 AMResponse to Original message22.I agree.

They have never solved a disagreement, and never will.  We need an open dialogue that promotes intelligent, peaceful discourse, and need to work toward solutions that benefit everyone.  I'm not at all a proponent of censorship, but when it threatens one's civil liberties and personal safety, there needs to be a line drawn - the Billos and Becks and Palins need to be brought down to Earth.  We may not all agree on the issues, but it only compounds them when acts like this happen, and KO nailed that in his special comment.I wish a speedy recovery to Rep. Giffords, a brave and distinguished woman who embodies what it is to stand up for what's right for the whole of the people she represents.  And peace to all of those who were directly affected by this tragedy.  May we find the answers we're looking for, so this never happens again.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDemocraticPilgrim      (459 posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:30 PMResponse to Original message43.A very noble commentary will the right people listen though ???Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOn the Road      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:34 PMResponse to Original message44.How ANYONE Can Portray This Manas a left-wing counterpart to Limbaugh or Beck is completely beyond me.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topkd7gkn      (5 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:51 PMResponse to Original message45.Bravo!
