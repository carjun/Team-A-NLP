Salvador Reza sues Joe Arpaio for illegal detention     Phoenix :  AZ :  USA|Nov 21, 2010By Richard Harrison        1 0     Views: 582      Salvador Reza, the Phoenix civil rights activist, is set to sue Maricopa County SheriffSheriff Joe Arpaio and many others for the unjustifiable arrest of Salvador Reza on July 30. Salvador Reza and his attorney announced the assertion for damages today at a press conference. They stated, "the violation of Salvador Reza's rights to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of movement, and due process under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States." Salvador Reza is pursuing indefinite penalizing and compensatory reparation for his illegal detention and captivity by the group he's condemn so severely over the years. The head of the pro-immigrant faction, Puente was detained on July 30 this year for an act of civil disobedience. Other demonstrators were also arrested along with their leader. The MCSO stated that by emerging up from its head office for an anti-immigrant brush on July 30, Salvador Reza had debased the conditions of his discharge. It was further stated that Salvador Reza was to be re-arrested. "Sal Reza wanted to get arrested during July protests surrounding the implementation of Arizona's controversial immigration law - he just didn't want to get arrested twice", Republic Reporter Hensley stated.         1 of 12         A demonstrator is arrested during a protest against Arizona's controversial Senate Bill 1070 immigration law outside Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office in Phoenix      Richard Harrison is based in California, California, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (85.0%) Spain (4.5%) Canada (3.2%) Pakistan (1.1%) 13 other countries (4.8%)           READ MORE: Salvador Reza, Phoenix civil rights activist, political-news, phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona, Reza, law crime, Hensley, Puente, Joe Arpaio   More News From: Phoenix :  AZ :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              More From Phoenix          Update: Second man could have been involved with Congresswoman shooting        Who is Jared Lee Loughner?
