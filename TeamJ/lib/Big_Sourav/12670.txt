I am not being Conservative, Reactionary, Luddite, or anti-Modern Primmie.I am merely saying that Corporations, even the more left leaning such as MSNBC, are plastic with things.People need to spend more time with the history of politics and books of good, sadly uncommon sources than the typical "liberal" versus "conservative" banter of things. The rabbit hole is much deeper than the trite stereotypes of things.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Fri Oct-23-09 04:37 PMResponse to Reply #311.Deleted messageMessage removed by moderator.
