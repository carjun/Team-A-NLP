I can't believe government oversight committees are allowing this unethical behavior of AT&T with their clients. Its unfair for a customer to be charge a fee to pay his/her bill with cash.groups:News tags:Abuse,unethical,unfair,catch-22 |44 comments// AT&T charging money to pay bill with money?hide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

Just pay online with your cc/debit card to avoid it, lol. 7 days agoflag  reply+1idealistcricket does the same thing. it's b.s. why should i have to pay more for walking down to the store in person? im i being punished for not paying online of with my debit card? M**#** FUC**#RS!!! 7 days agoflag  reply0desmosabieMetro has been doing this for years. 7 days agoflag  reply+1MotherForTruthBest Buy will not accept cash for a couple of hundred dollars purchase. 7 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  MotherForTruth:I've never heard that. I am not sure that is legal. 7 days agoflag  reply0MotherForTruth  hammywill:Not sure either but I bet their lawyer did all of the research. 7 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  MotherForTruth:Even the Police act in a manner that is not within the bounds of the law. It is a process called "The Color of Authority." It is a term to refer to when someone acts as if they have the Authority to do a thing, and those who are being questioned or being subjected to said "authority" assume it is true. Given that the person (corporation) is in a position of assumed authority already. 7 days agoflag  reply0MotherForTruth  hammywill:They sure do. 7 days agoflag  reply0pissedoffinarkansas  hammywill:That is how the IRS works. They have no legal authority to make you file income tax forms or pay taxes on wages earned but because everyone is afraid of being audited, no one questions said authority. 6 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  pissedoffinarkansas:They may not have the legal authority, but if you don't pay your taxes you will go to jail. Without fail. 6 days agoflag  reply0neocongoLot of anti-government Libertarians and Conservatives complaining about this type of thing, which is hilarious given it is your ideology to eliminate regulation and "big" government.  Regulation which would prevent precisely this sort of behavior from companies.  Keep on hatin, schlubs. 8 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  neocongo:You know what else would stop it? Stop doing business with AT&T. Lazy ass Americans always bitchin for someone else to do all the work for them. Want to have their cake and eat it to. Screw government regulation on this issue, don't like it, DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THEM! How could it be any more simple? 8 days agoflag  reply+5MotherForTruth  hammywill:I do agree we have the power but I am afraid American do not use their power for two reasons. One, we are not united, even if hundreds will stop using AT&T there will be others in thousands to replace (may be even those who emigrated and do not know any better). Two, Americans are slaves to consumerism and there is no way they will give up on their gadgets. 7 days agoflag  reply-1neocongo  hammywill:You think it's just AT&T?  What a dumbass.  If you cease business with every company that tries to fuck you, you'll be living in the forest fighting squirrels for nuts.  Which you are.  Nuts. 7 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  MotherForTruth:Then they are slaves by their own choosing and they should stop bitching about what their "master" does. 7 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  neocongo:That is not what it would take, and you are ignorant for thinking so. If there was ONE single day of a general strike everything in the United States would change overnight. But like I said above, if you continue to choose being a slave, stop bitching about your "master's" treatment of you. 7 days agoflag  reply0MotherForTruth  hammywill:I agree with that. 7 days agoflag  reply+1ghostofamericayeah, when i signed up with these bastards, they sold me expanded unlimited wireless, which meant all calls to any wireless carrier were free, now they are in complete denial that it ever existed. they say,' oh no, that was sprint'. 8 days agoflag  reply+3csmonutOnce again, my mortgage was sold to another company. I went to set up on-line payments, as I did with the old one, and they want to charge me 5.00 bucks extra a month.Screw em'. Let them pay the people to pack the envelopes and the post office to deliver the bill. A stamp and a check is all I expend.Also, a credit union I belonged to for a couple of weeks wanted to charge me 2.00 dollars to withdraw money from my sccount while I was at the window depositing a check. They said I could use the ATM for free. I closed my account right then. Oh...and Nevada State Bank charges people 5.00 for cashing checks if they don't have an account. Same with B of A if I remember right.Talk about rip-offs! But hey, we have a good-ol'-boy system and even though the PEOPLE bailed these bastards out, they want ALL of our money, and then some, back. 8 days agoflag  reply+2bailey78  csmonut:Don't worry it is going to get worst as time goes by. Plus they will have the goverment helping them to do it. 8 days agoflag  reply0csmonut  bailey78:Gee....thanks for those encouraging words:((Though I know you are right 8 days agoflag  reply+1bailey78  csmonut:I try not to lie to others or myself today. that way when the shit hits the fan I'm not surprised 8 days agoflag  reply0Daena_SmithIf I remember right, I had a friend that had something similar like this w/ Sprint when she went in to pay at the counter.  But they had these atm like things where she could pay for free inside the store as well...been a while ago. 9 days agoflag  reply+2dalistuffIf u have to pay the $5, take it in pennies. They never said u can't pay in coins. 9 days agoflag  reply+1hammywillIf it does not state that you have to pay a fee for paying in cash at the store, then they can not charge you one. You need to go over your contract again. 9 days agoflag  reply0vicgalleave the dark side... 9 days agoflag  reply+1bailey78  vicgal:But WE have cookies 8 days agoflag  reply+2Avatarpoint  bailey78:~\/~ Keep on Rockin in the Free world~ Happy New Year 7 days agoflag  reply+1bailey78  Avatarpoint:Thank You I hope you have a great year also. 7 days agoflag  reply+1PrijedorJust like I will have to pay 6$ to cash a check at the bank starting 2011 9 days agoflag  reply+3nanacThis is absurd! Consumers can't win for loosing...Every time that you think, that you are going to make ends meet, some jerk will move/steal one of the ends..They want you to pay for paying your bill..If you pay over the phone, there is a fee..Your bank charges a fee for paying online, and some companies charge a fee for paying a bill on the due date online... 9 days agoflag  reply0emerald23  nanac:They call this a convenience fee.  So if you don't want to pay a fee, you send a check, and the only cost you have is the postage stamp.  But then, if you send it before the due date, and it doesn't get there until after the due date, you get charged a late fee.  Catch-22.  Pay their convenience fee and know that you paid on time, OR try to avoid it, and possibly pay a late fee.  In any case, they get more money out of you either way you look at it. 7 days agoflag  reply0MotherForTruth  emerald23:They already figured it all out. They win. 7 days agoflag  reply+2artemis6You are being robbed . 9 days agoflag  reply0csmonut  artemis6:we are all being robbed. Until we quit playing, we will continue to lose. 8 days agoflag  reply0artemis6  csmonut:Indeed . As it is the monetary system is unsustainable . Like in monopoly , when one player ends up with all . 8 days agoflag  reply0csmonut  artemis6:So far I have quit playing the Serius/XM radio game. I will NOT be playing the Dish/DirectTV game in a couple of months....and...if my Tmobile gets like some of these others, I will quit playing their game also.As for banks....one thing about living in NV. casinos love your cash, and they don't charge you just to cash a paycheck. At least not yet. 8 days agoflag  reply+3Itsbatman_Durrif you pay that fee in cash, is it another $5? 9 days agoflag  reply+5Itsbatman_Durri am not a violent person by nature.. ok i sometimes am... but i would have had to punch whoever told me that square in the nose .. 9 days agoflag  reply+4KSirys  Itsbatman_Durr:lol.. you and me think alike!!  lol... voted up! 9 days agoflag  reply+4ankabYes they really know how to stick it to their customers. 9 days agoflag  reply+4ThatCrazyLibertarianSounds to me that you need to get out of that contract....at the least, don't renew it.  But they've been screwing their customers for a long time....AT & T can suck it.http://redtape.msnbc.com/2008/04/paying-cash-at.html#posts 9 days agoflag  reply0Avatarpoint  ThatCrazyLibertarian:~\/~ I think AT&T will get whats coming to them and it will cost them more than a fee, 2600 reasons to wage war! 7 days agoflag  replyAvatarpoint added thismore fromNews:Suspected CIA Banker Allen Stanfords Trial Indefinitely Delayed Online USA News: Fernanda Vasconcellos with her shoes Michael Vick More Important to Obama Than Family of Soldier Killed In Combat The #1 Work From Home Business Of 2011 . . . most populartop rankednew & rising1Remember When Beck Ridiculed Pelosi For Speaking Out Agains... 2Obama lays blow to closing Guantanamo 3Obama Created More Jobs in One Year Than Bush Created in Eight 4Corporations or politicians hurting America? 5Congress to Reduce Free Speech? -- In Response to shooting 6The system suited everybody until the crisis hit  Ron Paul 7LIFE'S GOOD, SHUT UP ! 8A Real Hero....
