Of course, it would be interesting if Toshiba comes as a serious competitor for both.Toshiba tablet computers, which have not known the name, will be one of a series of products that will appear on Tuesday before the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2011) held on 6 to 9 January 2011 in Las Vegas, USA."The tablet will come out in the spring of 2011.
