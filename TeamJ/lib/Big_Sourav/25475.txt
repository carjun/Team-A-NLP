Despite new stimulus programs, recovery seemed far off. Opponents in the GOP (and even some in the presidents own party) called for cutting spending to reduce the budget deficit. Democrats were split: Was the president acting as boldly as possibleor was he not nearly bold enough? Pundits on the left accused him of dithering and caving in to big business. 5 commentsRead the full article What We Learned From WikiLeaksNovember 14, 2010by Jonathan Schell / The Nation / November 10, 2010The Army intelligence analyst Pfc. Bradley Manning, 22, now in a military detention center charged with having leaked classified documents related to the Iraq War, once explained why he was contemplating his deed. (He is additionally suspected of having leaked the 390,000 documents made public by the whistleblowing solicitor WikiLeaks, but he has not been charged with this.) Manning was not yet in prison or in the media spotlight. 0 commentsRead the full article Book Review: Obamas Wars by Bob Woodward  the capitulation of civilian control over American militaryNovember 14, 2010Most reviews of Bob Woodwards new book, Obamas Wars, focus on the perceived failures and incompetency of Barack Obama, or on the in-fighting between the generals or within the White House staff, or intellectualize on the over-all abilities and shortcomings of Woodward as a chronicler of modern American history. And in doing so, they miss the point.6 commentsRead the full article Ocean Beach VFW Outpost Being Forced Out After 27 YearsNovember 11, 2010Since 1983 war veterans of Ocean Beach have had a place to call home.  Since 1983, VFW Outpost 1392 at 4944 Newport Avenue has served as a refuge.  Its not much.  Its a small storefront facing an alley.  The inside is not fancy; a big screen HDTV, a pool table, and your usual assortment of stools and tables (all handmade by Outpost members).There is nothing fancy about the dcor.  .24 commentsRead the full article 2010 Mid-terms: the Number of Women in Congress DeclinesNovember 10, 2010For the first time in nearly three decades women have not increased their ranks in Congress.Washington  Ask Republican Rep.-elect Nan Hayworth how important it is to have women in congressional leadership roles, and she answers that gender shouldnt matter much.The overwhelming consideration to someone like me is merit, Hayworth insisted.  Yet, as she continued to talk about her own campaign experience, Hayworth practically stopped herself.  I did make it part of my theme, thinking about it now, Hayworth said, referring to the fact that she is a woman and mother of two grown children.1 commentRead the full article Noam Chomsky on Mid-Term Elections: Misguided OutrageNovember 9, 2010by Noam ChomskyThe U.S. midterm elections register a level of anger, fear and disillusionment in the country like nothing I can recall in my lifetime. Since the Democrats are in power, they bear the brunt of the revulsion over our current socioeconomic and political situation.More than half the mainstream Americans in a Rasmussen poll last month said they view the Tea Party movement favorablya reflection of the spirit of disenchantment.The grievances are legitimate. For more than 30 years, real incomes for the majority of the population have stagnated or declined while work hours and insecurity have increased, along with debt. Wealth has accumulated, but in very few pockets, leading to unprecedented inequality.5 commentsRead the full article Tom Hayden in HillcrestNovember 8, 2010By Colleen DietzelI attended Tom Haydens talk on Thursday with the rest of the mostly over 50s crowd to hear his take on the depressing results of the election.He was somewhat comforting with his wit and that not all the outcomes were bad. California elected Jerry Brown and possibly Kamala Harris for attorney general. He reminded us of the important work Jerry Brown did as past governor in promoting alternative energy. As with any politician Jerry Brown is not perfect but he will move us forward in the area of green jobs and alternative energy.3 commentsRead the full article Mainsteam media ignore anti-Semitic violence against Bob Filner at Election CentralNovember 5, 2010The incident the other night at Election Central at Golden Hall where defeated tea bagger Nick Popaditch and his supporters corralled, harassed, and shoved the winner of the Congressional race Bob Filner up against a column, has not been covered by the mainstream media. Except for the OB Rag, the San Diego CityBeat, and the Chula Vista Starnews, San Diego and national press have ignored this violent and anti-Semitic incident against a sitting member of the US House of Representatives. (The OB Rag  with the help of CityBeat and others  broke this story.)The story also has even more ugliness and a deep undertone of white supremacy. 16 commentsRead the full article  remember, remember, the fifth of November: Guy Fawkes Day !November 5, 2010November 5th is Guy Fawkes Day!
