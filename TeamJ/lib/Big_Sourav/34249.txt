Security officials arrested two members of Iran-backed Hamas they say were planning the attack. Two other men were arrested for supplying weapons to the would-be perpetrators and for being members of a terrorist organization. Both were employed as maintenance workers at the United Kingdoms consulate in the Israeli capital.  London said it is reviewing vetting policies for staff in Jerusalem. Hamas has on occasion attempted to fire rockets from the West Bank into Israel but its efforts have always been thwarted. Increased cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian Authority security forces in recent years has led to a clamp down on terrorists operating out of the West Bank.  That coupled with the construction of Israels anti-terror security fence has produced a dramatic decline in the numbers of terror attacks from the West Bank. Hamas, armed and financed by Iran, is committed to the destruction of Israel. While it struggled to carry out terror attacks from the West Bank in recent years, it fired thousands of rockets from Gaza at Israeli civilians, despite Israels withdrawal from the coastal enclave in 2005. Hamas reaffirmed its charter during celebrations in December marking the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the organization. The document makes clear the destruction of Israel is a core objective of the movement.        1 of 42         Palestinian men cross into Jerusalem through an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank town of Bethlehem      LouiseRoys is based in Lowell, Indiana, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (75.7%) India (5.4%) Italy (2.7%) United Kingdom (2.7%) 4 other countries (8.1%)           READ MORE: Russia and the ArabIsraeli conflict, west bank, israeli-palestinian conflict, construction of Israel&rsquo, Western Asia, Israel Foils Terror Plot, Middle East, Hamas, political-news, disasters-news, War Conflict, Israel, Jerusalem, Islam and antisemitism, Asia, islamic terrorism, Gaza Strip, Palestinian nationalism, israeli, gaza war   More News From: Jerusalem :  Israel     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Israel Arrests British Consulate Workers By: mfaisalrafique      British officials say Israeli authorities have arrested two Palestinian workers at the British consulate in Jerusalem for alleged ties to a plot to attack a football stadium.Officials at the British Foreign Office in London said Monday they are seeking confirmation from Israel that the two employees were arrested on charges of selling weapons ...  5 days ago     Israel thwarts attack and arrest workers British Consulate By: breeze84       The Israeli authorities have two local employees of the British Consulate in Jerusalem arrested.
