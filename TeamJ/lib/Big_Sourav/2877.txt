Viktor Bout - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaViktor BoutFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation,searchThis name uses Eastern Slavic naming customs; the patronymic is Anatolyevich and the family name is Bout.  Viktor Anatolyevich BoutBorn13 January 1967 (1967-01-13) (age43)Dushanbe, Tajik SSR, Soviet UnionOther namesVictor Bout, Viktor Butt, Viktor Budd, Victor But, Boris, Vadim Markovich Aminov, Viktor BulakinKnownforArms traffickingViktor Anatolyevich Bout (Russian:   ) (born 13 January 1967, near Dushanbe, Tajik SSR, Soviet Union) is a Russian businessman who established a number of air cargo companies. He is currently in US custody facing trial on charges that stem from his alleged agreement to arm a terrorist group.[1][2][3]A former Soviet military translator,[4] Bout had reportedly made a significant amount of money through his multiple air transport companies[5] shipping cargo mostly in Africa and the Middle East during the 1990s and early 2000s.[6] Just as willing to ship cargo for Charles Taylor in Liberia as he was for the United Nations in Sudan and the United States in Iraq,[5][7] Bout may have facilitated huge arms shipments into various civil wars in Africa with his private air cargo fleets during the 1990s.[8]While claiming to have done little more than provide logistics, he has been called a "sanctions buster"[5] by former British Foreign Office minister Peter Hain who described Bout as, "the principal conduit for planes and supply routes that take arms... from east Europe, principally Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine to Liberia and Angola."[9]In cooperation with US authorities,[7] Royal Thai Police arrested Bout in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2008.[10] The US demanded his extradition, which was eventually mandated by the Thai High Court in August 2010.[3] Before his extradition to the US in November 2010, he expressed confidence his trial in the US will eventually lead to his acquittal.[11][12]Contents1 Personal history1.1 Soviet military service1.2 Africa1.3 Places of residence2 Suspect shipments2.1 Eastern European arms to Angola2.2 Afghanistan2.3 Lebanon2.4 Second Congo War2.5 Other customers3 Alleged Russian government and intelligence ties4 Arrest warrants4.1 Interpol4.2 Executive Order 133484.3 CAR trial5 Thai arrest and extradition5.1 Arrest5.2 Extradition hearing5.3 Extradition5.4 Russia's protests and other actions6 US charges6.1 Additional charges7 In the media8 References9 External links[edit] Personal historyA UN document, and Bout himself, state his birthplace as Dushanbe, USSR, (now the capital of Tajikistan)[13][14][15][16] possibly on 13 January 1967.[13][16][17] But a few other birthplaces have been suggested;[14][18] a 2001 South African intelligence file listed him as Ukrainian in origin.[19][20][edit] Soviet military serviceThere is confusion regarding Bout's military career although it is clear he served in the Soviet Armed Forces. Having graduated from the Military Institute of Foreign Languages,[16][21][22] he is said to be fluent in six languages.[23] Bout's personal website states that he served in the Soviet Army as a translator, holding the rank of lieutenant.[4]Bout is thought to have been discharged in 1991 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.[17] But other sources state he rose to the rank of major in the GRU[5] (an arm of the Soviet military that combines intelligence services and special forces),[5] that he was an officer in the Soviet Air Forces,[7] that he graduated from a Soviet military intelligence training program,[17] or that he was a KGB operative.[13][edit] AfricaBout served in Angola, part of the Soviet contingent of a 1987[21] peacekeeping operation there.[16][21] He has said he was in Angola for only a few weeks.[13] Bout's website states that he began an airfreight business in Africa around the time of the collapse of the USSR.[15][edit] Places of residenceBout has lived in a number of countries, including Belgium,[24] Lebanon,[25] Rwanda,[18] Russia,[24] South Africa,[26] Syria[27] and the UAE.[27][edit] Suspect shipmentsBout's nickname, "Sanctions Buster", is due to his having been implicated in facilitating the violation of UN arms embargoes in Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo.[28][edit] Eastern European arms to AngolaA 2000 United Nations report stating that, "...Bulgarian arms manufacturing companies had exported large quantities of different types of weapons between 1996 and 1998 on the basis of (forged)[16] end-user certificates from Togo,"[29] and that, "...with only one exception, the company Air Cess, owned by Victor Bout, was the main transporter of these weapons from Burgas airport in Bulgaria."[29] This was the first time Bout was mentioned in connection with arms trading,[30] and the weapons may have been destined for use by Unio Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA),[29] one faction in Angola's 19752002 civil war.Another suspected arms dealer, Imad Kebir, is said to have employed Bout's aircraft during the mid-1990s to transport weapons to Africa from Eastern European states.[31] The cargo supposedly had Zairean end user certificates, but the true end-user was UNITA.[31]From 1993, UNITA was under a United Nations Security Council embargo prohibiting the importation of arms, established in Resolution 864.[32][edit] AfghanistanSoon after the beginning of the 2001present war in Afghanistan, al Qaeda is said to have moved gold and cash out of the country; "credible reports" state that some of the planes used to do this were linked to Bout.[31] Bout says he has been to Afghanistan many times in the mid-1990s,[14][33] but he denies any dealings with al Qaeda or the Taliban.[34]Starting in 1994[34] he made shipments for the pre-Taliban government, which later became the Northern Alliance, as well as having known Ahmed Shah Massoud, an Afghan Northern Alliance commander.[13] In 1995 he was involved in the negotiations to free Russian hostages during the 1995 Airstan incident.[35][edit] LebanonBout is supposed to have met with Hezbollah officials in Lebanon during the run-up to the 2006 Lebanon War.[36][37] Other sources suggest he may have been in Russia instead when the supposed meeting took place.[25][edit] Second Congo WarBout is also suspected of supplying weapons to numerous armed groups in the Second Congo War and may have employed an estimated 300 people and operated 40-60 aircraft to do so.[18][edit] Other customersAs well as some more-controversial customers such as Charles G. Taylor, the French government,[13] the UN[20][38][39] and the US[20][27][38][39] have also used his planes. Bout has reportedly shipped flowers,[22] frozen chicken,[5][22] UN peacekeepers,[22] French soldiers and African heads of state.[13][edit] Alleged Russian government and intelligence tiesIt is thought Bout may have been of help to Russia's intelligence agencies,[3] and he is alleged to have connections to ranking Russian officials, namely Igor Sechin.[40]The language institute Bout attended has been linked to the GRU, one such agency.[18][24] Bout is thought to have worked alongside GRU-affiliated, and current Russian deputy prime minister, Igor Sechin in Africa in the 1980s,[22][41] although both men deny this allegation.[22] And according to a 2002 United Nations report Bout's father-in-law Zuiguin, "at one point held a high position in the KGB, perhaps even as high as a deputy chairman." [18][edit] Arrest warrantsConstantly moving location, owning numerous companies and frequently re-registering aircraft[5][29] made it hard for authorities to make a case against Bout. He has never been charged for the alleged African arms deals to which he owes his notoriety.[42][edit] InterpolThe Belgians requested that Interpol issue a notice for Bout on charges of money laundering, and in 2002 an Interpol red notice on Bout was issued.[38]Bout's website states that because he failed to appear in court a Belgian warrant (not the Interpol notice) for his arrest was issued but later cancelled.[4] The site has a document in Dutch to support the claim that the Belgian case against him was dismissed due to his lack of having a fixed residence and because the case couldn't be treated in a timely fashion.[43]The day of his Bangkok arrest, an Interpol red notice was requested by the US against Bout. The alleged crime was conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization.[10] His wanted poster can be viewed here.[edit] Executive Order 13348Bout's U.S. assets were among those frozen in July 2004 under Executive Order 13348. The Order describes him as a, "businessman, dealer and transporter of weapons and minerals" and cites his close association with Charles Taylor.[44][edit] CAR trialCharged in 2000 with forging documents in the Central African Republic, Bout was convicted in absentia and the charges were later dropped.[21][edit] Thai arrest and extraditionBout was arrested in Thailand on an Interpol red notice and on 16 November 2010, Bout was extradited amid protests by the Russian Government.[3][edit] ArrestRoyal Thai Police arrested Bout in Bangkok on 6 March 2008[10] the culmination of a sting operation set up by US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents.[7] Bout allegedly offered to supply weapons to people he thought were representatives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels.[5][7][edit] Extradition hearingAfter months of delay, the Criminal Court in Bangkok began an extradition hearing for Bout on 22 September 2008.[45]In February 2009, members of the United States Congress signed a letter to Attorney General Holder and Secretary of State (i.e. Foreign Secretary) Clinton expressing their wish that the Bout extradition would "remain a top priority".[46]On 11 August 2009, the Criminal Court ruled in his favor, denying the US request for extradition and mentioning the political, not criminal, nature of the case.[47] The US appealed that judgement and on 20 August 2010 a higher Thai court ruled that Bout could, in fact, be extradited to the United States.[48][49][50][edit] ExtraditionOn 16 November 2010 at 1:30pm, Bout was extradited to the United States;[1] the Russian government reaction was that the extradition was illegal.[51][52][edit] Russia's protests and other actionsRussia did not want Bout to face trial and called the Thai court decision in 2010 politically motivated.[53][54] Its Foreign Ministry took steps to prevent his extradition to the US;[22] Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested that Bout was innocent.[22]On 18 November 2010 shortly after Bout's extradition to the US, Russian President Medvedev's aide Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko claimed that Russia had "nothing to hide" in Bout's criminal case stating, "it is in our interest that the investigation... be brought to completion, and [Bout] should answer all the questions the American justice system has."[55][56][edit] US chargesThe day after his Bangkok arrest, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Bout with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization,[57] conspiring to kill Americans, conspiring to kill US officers or employees and conspiring to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile.[45][edit] Additional chargesAdditional US charges against him were filed in February 2010.[58] These include illegal purchase of aircraft, wire fraud and money laundering.[2][edit] In the mediaThe 2005 film Lord of War, starring Nicolas Cage, is thought to be based, in part, on stories of his alleged gun-running.[5][22][59][60][61]In 2007 Stephen Braun and Douglas Farah published a book about Bout entitled Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible.[62][edit] References^ a b Viktor Bout Extradited to the United States to Stand Trial on Terrorism Charges US Justice Dpt release, November 17, 2010.^ a b U.S. ANNOUNCES NEW INDICTMENT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL ARMS DEALER VIKTOR BOUT AND AMERICAN CO-CONSPIRATOR FOR MONEY LAUNDERING, WIRE FRAUD, AND CONSPIRACY US Indictment released Feb 17, 2010.^ a b c d Appeal Court verdict on the extradition of Bout The Nation, Sept 1, 2010.^ a b c Victor Bout's Personal Website, FAQ^ a b c d e f g h i Flying Anything to Anybody The Economist, Dec 18th 2008^ , ^ a b c d e Revealed: trap that lured the merchant of death 'The Observer', Sunday 9 March 2008^ 'Lord of war' arms trafficker arrested, The Guardian, 7 March 2008.^ BBC Profile, Viktor Bout^ a b c INTERPOL media release, 07 March 2008^ "Arms Suspect Vows to Win Case in U.S. After Extradition Order" nytimes.com, 21 August 2010^    " " ,       NEWSru, 20 August 2010.^ a b c d e f g Arms and the Man New York Times, Aug. 17, 2003^ a b c Meeting Viktor Bout, the Merchant of Death BBC Channel 4 Snowblog, 16/03/09^ a b Victor Bout's Personal Website^ a b c d e Addendum to the final report of the Monitoring Mechanism on Sanctions against UNITA S/2001/363^ a b c Trapping the Lord of War, The Rise and Fall of Viktor Bout Part 2: Secretive about His Past. spiegel.de, 10/06/2010^ a b c d e "The deadly convenience of Victor Bout".
