Europe does it this way and they're way ahead of us.  We could solve our dropout problem overnight and stop writing these kids off and keeping them in the underclass.Kids who stick it out would get academic diplomas that would entitle them to apply for higher academic education.And yes, we need to raise the standards by a lot.

It seems like the schools just keep dropping the standards a little bit year after year... Pathetic.I have another discussion that ties in with your question:http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph... Are the kids dropping out because they're dumb? Or is it the school that needs to learn how to teach them? All students do not learn at the same pace, yet we stuff 30 to 50 kids in a classroom and force them all to march to beat of the same drum. It makes more sense to me that each student should be able to study at his or her own pace --and get assistance from a highly educated and highly skilled teacher only when they need it. I wonder how many students give up because the teacher either can't or doesn't feel like trying hard enough to reach them, to bring them up to speed with the rest of the class. Just a thought.On the larger issue, there may be students who want to quit school early and start working so they can get a car and impress some girl or buy some stuff... but should we let students do whatever they want? Or should we, as parents and as society, impose some expectations on them that cannot be waived so easily?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWarpy      (1000+ posts)      Sun Dec-19-10 04:41 PMResponse to Reply #1012.Kids can drop out at 16 now.  Schools are not prisonsalthough they do feel that way from time to time.  The GED is available to anyone who quits early and wants to complete the work, get a diploma, and move on.The general diploma should be at 16.  Expecting all kids to be good academics and soldier on until 18 is clearly unrealistic.  That's why we have dropout rates of 50% and higher in many schools.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptxlibdem      (1000+ posts)      Sun Dec-19-10 04:49 PMResponse to Reply #1215.Yes, but why aren't you asking them WHY they want to drop out of schoolThat should be the first question asked of them. BTW, I am also free to shoot myself in the foot. And to cut off my own arm with a butter knife. Read some of my posts and ask yourself if I've done either of those things. And why not? Because I know that would be harmful for me in the long run. Freedom does not come free. We all need to make sure that each and every citizen of this Democracy is educated as much as possible so they will be less likely to be swayed by idiots on TV or hate radio. These aren't optional in a functioning Democracy, and a Democracy will not long survive without an intelligent and well educated voting population.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWarpy      (1000+ posts)      Sun Dec-19-10 06:07 PMResponse to Reply #1520.What we are doing now is not workingIs.  Not.  Working.It doesn't matter what the kids toss off as reasons.  Of course they'll sound stupid to adults.  Behind all those surface reasons of wanting to work full time to get a car or being bored is a kid who has no talent for or interest in academics and wants to get the hell on with his life and chances are very good that he's right most of the time.Either you bull on ahead and try to bully these kids to stay in school, in which case they'll just ditch anyway, or you give them a general diploma that allows them to do more than be janitors or dig ditches, like train for a skilled trade.I'm recognizing what is and going with that.

He or she is a child whose teachers failed to take the time to help him or her get up to speed and they got so far behind that it was an embarrassment just going to class each day, and an exercise in extreme frustration. Cause and effect: check up on it when you have time.Give each child the ability to study at his how pace and give him access to the brightest minds in the nation starting from kindergarten and you will not see a child with "no talent" you'll see a child who had some rough patches but worked through them.I'm not saying to turn it on like a light switch for all students. I'm saying to start with the kindergarten age students and any other student in higher grades that wants to switch. Those that do not want to switch can stay with the status quo.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWarpy      (1000+ posts)      Mon Dec-20-10 01:05 AMResponse to Reply #2325.BaloneyFace it, the world isn't just the way you want it to be and kids have talents that are different from your own and those talents don't include academic study.You just want to continue doing the wrong thing over and over again and expecting a different result and you know what that means, don't you?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHannah Bell      (1000+ posts)      Mon Dec-20-10 03:49 AMResponse to Reply #2326.yeah, the bill gates model will be better.  lol.  dream on.Edited on Mon Dec-20-10 03:51 AM by Hannah Bellthe only kids that are going to get tlc from kindeygarden are those whose parents can pay for it.the masses are going to get bigger classes, cut-rate revolving teachers, & canned curricula.you folks can dream up as many lovely schemes as you like.the money men aren't listening; they have their own dreams, & *your* children don't figure in them except as profit centers.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptxlibdem      (1000+ posts)      Mon Dec-20-10 07:26 AMResponse to Reply #2627.Poor sweet Hannah, I knew thee not wellI understand your cynicism when it comes to big companies trying to make money off of our childrens' schooling. Like the text book industry which is a multi-billion dollar industry with a captive customer base that has zero ability to "shop around" for better deals --it's always take it or leave it when it comes to buying books for your schools. The CEOs of these textbook publishers are the cynics when it comes to school. All they see are $$$ Dollar Signs $$$ instead of children in those seats.The only thing that keeps this current corrupt educational system we have today is the over-the-top hard work and dedication of the teachers. Every other aspect of the educational system is an impediment to the success of our children. The teachers are the only, the singular thing that is keeping this leaky, rusting education freighter from plunging under the waves is the kick-ass job our teachers are doing. I want the educational system to get out of the way of teaching our kids and provide the best we, as a nation, can provide and provide it to each and every child no matter where they live, no matter what the "budget" of the school is. And by the way, budgets only get cut for the children and teachers --a recent report shows school administration gets nice, fat pay raises even in troubled times. Wonderful job if you can get it.And please don't forget to include in your definition of "the money men" the multi-billion dollar text book industry. You are fighting, and that's good, but don't forget to include all the villains, not just the one on tv.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHannah Bell      (1000+ posts)      Mon Dec-20-10 01:52 PMResponse to Reply #2729.bullshit.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptxlibdem      (1000+ posts)      Mon Dec-20-10 06:44 PMResponse to Reply #2930.You'll have to do better than a one word postIsn't there some kind of etiquette to online posting?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDavis_X_Machina      (1000+ posts)Sun Dec-19-10 04:50 PMResponse to Reply #1016.This is moot......

Our educational system has been reducing standards for decades, more parents have to work two or three jobs, schools and society pushes our kids to focus on sports so they get what amounts to a free pass all the way through school (just listen to interviews with most of the "Pro" ball players for you proof of that. So it is only by the exceptional work and constant struggle of our teachers that we've been able to prevent collapse thus far.But we're at the breaking point right now: the ignorant and easily manipulated greatly outnumber the citizens who have the ability to think critically.

But the school board that replaced the poor, usually accidental, rebels who backed the change? -- they keep getting re-elected for their role in re-instating the status quo.Stuff we know works, but costs too much, or doesn't look like a traditional school, or rubs voters the wrong way for some reason. Wars over things like what the report card looks like.There's a reason why attempts to move the stone always come from foundations, or higher academia, or philanthropic millionaires.
