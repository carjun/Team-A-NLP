It is hogwash.  "In England, the incidence of polio had decreased by 82% before the polio vaccine was introduced in 1956." Here are the actual numbers of polio cases in England from 1912 to 2000: PHI: Incidence Rates of Poliomyelitis in England   . Note that there was always a variation in the incidence of polio.   Some years were worse than others. There were 1960 total cases in 1954   and 6331 cases in 1955. By my math, that is a 323% increase. I cannot   figure out where the "82% decrease" came from by looking at the actual   numbers.  After the vaccine was introduced, the number of cases steadily   decreased.  There have been no cases of polio in the UK since 1998.   Thanks to the vaccine, polio has almost been eradicated from the entire   world, with the possibility that that could happen in the next 2 or 3   years.  What about the risk of the vaccine itself? There are two polio vaccines.   One contains inactivated virus, the other live attenuated (weakened)   virus. The inactivated vaccine is given by injection; the attenuated is   given by mouth. The vaccine used in the US is the inactivated vaccine.   There is a risk of getting polio from the live virus vaccine, but not   the inactivated one. The current polio vaccine recommendations are here:   Polio immunization (vaccine): MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia . One more thing about polio: post polio syndrome. There are survivors of polio who are still suffering its aftereffects: Post-polio syndrome - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia .  In England, diphtheria, pertussis and measles child mortality had declined 90% 'before' mass immunization for these diseases.  First of all, why lump mortalities for 3 diseases? And why ignore   morbidity as well as mortality? How many children were hospitalized or   had handicaps related to these diseases? How about subacute sclerosing   panencephalitis from measles? Here is some interesting info for diphtheria in England and Wales. http://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/021007.pdf and here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...04307-0004.pdf . It appears that "a vocal minority" of vaccine opponents was able to   delay immunization in the UK, with the result that England had higher   rates of infection with diphtheria than New York. Once vaccination   started, there was a steady decline in cases and deaths.  How about pertussis? This one tells the story: Bordetella Pertussis (Whooping Cough) | Doctor | Patient UK and this one shows what happened when anti-vaccine movements occurred in Sweden, Japan, Australia, and Russia: CSI | Anti-Vaccination Fever: The Shot Hurt Around the World Measles, anyone? UK story: Medical Research Council*-*Measles* . See the numbers here: HPA - Measles notifications and deaths in England and Wales, 1940-2008 "The measles vaccine was introduced in the US in 1963 and the UK in   1968.  As the proportion of children vaccinated increased, notifications   of  measles gradually fell in the UK from half a million cases and 100    deaths each year to fewer than 100,000 cases and 13 deaths a year by   the  mid-1980s."   And what happens when immunization rates decrease: BBC NEWS | Health | Rise in measles 'very worrying' .and here: Measles and the importance of maintaining vaccination levels | Practice | Nursing Times.   Between 1871 and 1880, the incidence of smallpox escalated from 28 to 46 per 100,000.  Why is he talking about smallpox in the nineteenth century? Smallpox has   been eradicated worldwide --- the most effective vaccine ever. A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: World Health Organization declares smallpox eradicated .   In the US, tuberculosis mortality declined 96% without the benefit of any vaccine.  TB can be treated with antibiotics, but the function of a vaccine is   prevention, not treatment. This statement trivializes the severity of   tuberculosis, and multi-drug resistant TB is now a serious problem.   There is a vaccine, BCG, but it is most effective in children. New   vaccines are in development now, and the potential impact worldwide is   enormous.   In 1975, Germany stopped requiring pertussis   (whooping cough)  vaccination. Today, less than 10% of German children   are vaccinated  against pertussis. The number of cases of pertussis has   steadily  decreased even though far fewer children are receiving   pertussis  vaccine.  The facts about pertussis vaccination in Germany: BioMed Central | Full text | The Epidemiology of Pertussis in Germany: Past and Present This is complicated by the fact that there were two Germanies for a while.  Germany does not "require" any vaccines. It does recommend them, however. See here: http://venice.cineca.org/documents/germany_ip.pdf .  And here: Eurosurveillance - View Article "In July 2009, the German Standing  Committee on Vaccination (STIKO)   modified its recommendations for  varicella and pertussis vaccination,   based on newly available data on  disease epidemiology, vaccine   effectiveness (VE) and safety, and an  evaluation of the feasibility of   the recommended immunisation strategy.  The recommendation for  varicella  vaccine now includes a routine two-dose  schedule with the   administration of the first dose at the age of 11 to  14 months and the   second dose at the age of 15 to 23 months, with a  minimum interval of   four weeks between these doses. Furthermore, STIKO  recommended adding a   one-time pertussis booster to the adult vaccination  schedule to  expand  the cocoon strategy in place since 2004. The  recommendation of a   booster vaccination with an acellular pertussis  vaccine every 10  years  for persons employed in the care of pre-school  children and for   healthcare personnel in paediatric, gynaecologic and  obstetric health   facilities was extended to persons employed in schools  and in other   institutions caring for older children, and to all  healthcare   personnel. These recommendations were based on available    epidemiological data showing an increase in incidence from 7-10 cases    per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002-2004 to over 30 by 2007. Moreover, the    high burden of pertussis in infants at 94 hospitalised cases per  100,000   infants in 2007 suggested that the previous cocoon strategy  was   insufficient."  So German kids do get vaccinated against pertussis, and there is effort to increase vaccination rates in adults and adolescents. Vaccines do not cause SIDS. SIDS can be largely prevented by placing infants on their backs to sleep.                    10-25-2010, 11:44 AM          purehuman  Senior Member            Join Date: Jun 2010 565 posts, read 84,300 times Reputation: 286           Quote:    Originally Posted by Grim Reader   I must say, it is deeply refreshing to have someone admit that straight up!

CDC Press Briefing Transcripts September 3, 2009 :CDC Press Briefing Transcripts September 3, 2009 "In an  average flu season, just as an example, around 500,000 pregnant   women get  vaccinated. That's important, because pregnant women are  more  likely to  get severely ill from flu. So, it's a way of protecting  them  and ensuring  that they have a healthy pregnancy.  Among those 500,000  women, if they  hadn't gotten vaccinated, we would  have expected more  than 1,000 miscarriages  within a week after  vaccine. If they hadn't  been vaccinated. If  they're vaccinated, we  expect about 1,000, 1,500  among 500,000 women who are  vaccinated."  It does not mean that flu vaccine causes miscarriage.
