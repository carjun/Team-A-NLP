The Innocence Project, a New York legal center that uses DNA to exonerate inmates, said Friday in Houston that the execution of convicted killer Claude Jones 10 years ago occurred only because then Gov. George W. Bush wasn't aware Jones' lawyer was asking for DNA testing on a tiny piece of hair prosecutors used to link Jones to an East Texas liquor store slaying. Tests now have shown the hair did not belong to Jones. Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project, said while the DNA test doesn't prove Jones was definitely innocent, "in and of itself this is pretty significant."

But this group is going NO WHERE, if they don't find an attorney to take on TEXAS. This can be done, they should fallow groups or contact those that have been successful in getting the states attention on LAWS.  Their are attorney's who could take up the cause on a PRO-Bono deal.  And one who would love to just make a name for himself.  Just for BASIC'S use the drunk drivers case on how they harm innocent people. Or someone who has murdered someone. Why those groups don't have to register but someone accused of a sex crime does. Why single out one group in society?  Our sex offender laws again THEY DON'T NEED DNA EVIDENCE, they don't need to do a breath test.  All they need is somones word.  But it seems also that DNA evidence is not good enough either.  NO WAY SOMEONE CAN LIE about their own DNA.  But a crime LAB can make mistakes and can be corrupted.55683502Flag this commentbeard said on November 13, 2010 at 9:19 AMI just hope a good attorney who wants to fight for REAL JUSTICE. And wants to save TEXAS TAX payers dollars going to waste.  Over our money making Scam called the justice system.  TAKES up sueing the STATE, and I believe THE TEXAS SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY is a good place to start.  On just the count "SOME" of them  on that list.   DNA evidence could not be used for a conviction, and they were convicted anyway. Plus they have made it to easy for example some punk Teen to lie to the police. And they know they can get away with it.  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY OUR POLICE TO CHECK on some sex offender that someone cried wolf on.  OR it was never proven they really did the crime.  AND using protecting the child is not good enough.  So the person who was accused has to lose everything. THAT is criminal itself.  ALSO TEXAS needs to make Sure DNA crime labs. DO NOT mess with DNA evidence just so JOHNNY DA can get a conviction because he wants to look good when he runs for a higher position.55682469Flag this commentbeard said on November 13, 2010 at 8:49 AMMadintx.. Sarcasm is way to easy for me to use. Because so many people in TEXAS are asleep on our Justice system as a whole. They use fear,and emotions to rule their common sence. Then Buy into the propaganda into the get tough on CRIME. Really it just keeps crime going and that is the way TEXAS wants it. IT IS ABOUT $$$$$$ And they use protecting the CHILDREN to sell the snake oil.      AND Yes I agree. But time after time we have had too many misconducts with our Justice system.    Our legislators know very well what is going on. If they don't they may soon be forced to see first hand.   TAX Payers should not have to pay for our justice systems misconduct. NOR should they have to pay someone who was innocent of an offense to live off of FOOD STAMPS or welfare. Because that person is denied  employement for which someone cried WOLF OVER. And they were convicted over circumstantial evidence. Also Our media is about marketing its not about Real News reporting.55681134Flag this commentmadintx said on November 13, 2010 at 8:03 AMok beard, now i am with you.  wasnt sure about the sarcasm thing.  The s.o. laws are undeniably unconstitutional.  Sheeple fail to see how easy it would be for any of them to land on there.  check out txvoices.com  Keep spreading the truth and I will help.  But, back to this topic,  THERE SHOULD NEVER BE ANYONE INNOCENT CONVICTED OR PLACED ON DEATH ROW.  PROSECUTORS, JUDGES, LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD ALL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, IF THERE IS ANY MISCONDUCT PROVEN ON THEIR PART.55678884Flag this commentbeard said on November 13, 2010 at 7:52 AMAnd one other point. IF OUR LAW Makers cannot prove all that are on the TEXAS SEX OFFENDER LIST really did the crime. THAT ALONE IS ENOUGH for a law suit. Because it means they KNOW it is nothing but a false safety net for our society. And they will be forced to admit they have violated innocent people's civil rights over bad laws. OR to say innocent people have to suffer because of the creeps who really did the crime.  In otherwords a victim has to suffer again when one CRY'S WOLF.   OR another MADD should sue TEXAS to make ALL drunk Drivers register just like SEX OFFENDERS.  I can almost bet plenty of DRUNK drivers have killed plenty of Innocent people & CHILDREN.55678401Flag this commentbeard said on November 13, 2010 at 7:40 AMMadintx  YES I AM FOR REAL. And the word is called Sarcasm.  OUR Sex Offender laws is a prime example.   AND YES I would like to see our Law makers prove all that are on theTEXAS SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY really did their crime and are a threat to society. And also prove that those that were Convicted over Circumstantial evidence.  Actually did their crime, I will bet they cannot.  But I will bet those who got " convicted" over such evidence can prove how their lives was destroyed.  This alone is not acceptable, and neither is someone found innocent after the fact that DNA evidence has shown they did not due the crime. THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS AND LAW MAKERS  IS TO FILE A CLASS ACTION LAW SUITE.  ONE OTHER POINT.  THEY also need to understand what the STATUE OF LIBERTY MEANS. ONCE A PERSON who has paid their dept to society they should be able to move on with their LIFE.  I believe a good attorney who wanted to make himself known could Pin Texas to a cornor55677909Flag this commentmadintx said on November 13, 2010 at 1:03 AMis beard for real?55668711Flag this commentmadintx said on November 13, 2010 at 1:02 AMmommy 10 could you contact txvoices.com.  We  would love to hear from you about your loved one.55668701Flag this commentbeard said on November 12, 2010 at 10:04 PMmommy10  You don't understand Texas get tough on crime. Yes if someone is on probation. Once they have done their time they should be denied employement.  Another example yes Circumstantial evidence should be enough for a conviction and IT IS. EXAMPLE.. Such as an innocent 15yr. girl accusing someone of indecent exposure.  Because we know most teens would never lie. WE MUST PROTECT THE CHILD.  AND BY the way you cannot get DNA evidence off those CASES.  AND YES if had a daughter I would teach her this is how you can wipe someones life out. AND IT IS LEGAL IN TEXAS TO LIE TO THE POLICE in THESE Types of CASES. BECAUSE they are going to protect the child NO MATTER WHAT. SO BIG DEAL WE HAVE REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS That are INNOCENT.  General PUBLIC reacts to fear over common sence anyway. AND IT WORKS VERY WELL.55663574Flag this commentmommy10 said on November 12, 2010 at 9:48 PMTo beard and dfwsooner- A relative of mine was one of the first to be released because of the Innocence Project.  He sat in prison for over 15 years for a crime he didn't committ.  It's so easy for you to say "Well this world isn't perfect."  Believe me, I thought the same thing.  But when it happens to you or someone close to you, you change.  That's time he will never get back.  No amount of money, no amount of "OOPS or "SORRY :( "  will ever change that.  As for taking away the rights of folks on probation, if you do that, you almost guarantee they will reoffend.  Deny them a job because of probation? Who would that apply to?  So if you get probation for a traffic violation, you should never be able to work again?  I understand the need to get tough on crime.  Those who deserve prison time and death should get it.  But mowing over innocent people and ruining the lives of good people who make bad choices is not the answer.  It really is that simple.55663074Flag this commentmadintx said on November 12, 2010 at 7:56 PMIf Jesus was born in tx today God and Joseph would be registered sex offenders. Mary was about 14 when she gave birth.   Wow, does that mean you would want God and Joseph ( Marys husband) on death row.  A lot of you can talk your nonsense.  You would not be saying these things about those on death row if it were your innocent family member there and you knew they were innocent.  What about the prosecutors that withhold evidence just to get a conviction?  Is it fair that these people are convicted because a prosecutor is so self centered?  Just remember for every innocent person sent to prison, a guilty person goes free.  I think there are some that should receive death.  THERE SHOULD NEVER BE ANYONE PUT TO DEATH OR CONVICTED iF THEY ARE INNOCENT.55659369Flag this commentdfwsooner said on November 12, 2010 at 7:48 PMHey - and as for the child molesters and rapists, you bet they ought to be on death row.  They take a life away just as much as a murderer.  Breathing in and out makes an existence, not a life.  There's more to it than that; and ruining a life forever is the same as snuffing it out.  If it were up to me, and I had to, I'd put some of the child molesters on death row, and let some of those guys that are on death row now have their sentences commuted to life.  I mean, take the Texas seven for instance.  George Rivas is the one that killed Officer Hawkins.  The others were just there with him.  Now, they sure aren't any angels, and they deserve to be where they are.  But, who do you think is more of an actual detriment to society - the ones with George Rivas who didn't kill Officer Hawkins or some vile child molester?55659066Flag this commentbeard said on November 12, 2010 at 7:45 PMThe deal about this one is. In a few weeks or so most will forget it. And most people in Texas have no clue what our court system to our law makers are doing anyway.  IT is true CRIME in TEXAS does PAY.  It means more TAX PAYER dollars going to special interest groups to build prison's.  Also more Tax Payers Dollars for DPS and their Lobbyist.  So yes the courts have the pressure on them to push a defendant into a plea deal so they can get a conviction.  TEXAS has a real serious issues to its get tough on CRIME POLICY. And yes their are plenty out their who are innocent and lives have been destroyed over it.  It does not have to be  a case like this but all through the system.  TEXAS does need to be SUED how they run the Justice system. Another Example  THE DPS sex offender Registry can we trust that all on the registry did the crime?  Or is it really just a political propaganda tool? Because drunk drivers harm or kill children also and they don't have to register.55658954Flag this commentdfwsooner said on November 12, 2010 at 7:42 PMbeard is right.  Until the Good Lord himself comes down and sits in a courtroom, mistakes are going to be made.  I'd rather err on the side of society as a whole than for the few.   You want perfection?  You're gonna have to wait; because it ain't in this old world.55658758Flag this commentbeard said on November 12, 2010 at 6:24 PMridavis70 I don't  agree, total agree. A conviction is just that, regardless If the person is innocent or NOT.  Again I could careless if he/she is setting on death row or probation.  Oh I do agree Molesters and Rapists should be put to death. And we can trust DNA crime labs never make a mistake. Again if so we are human. And if that person is put to death over a lab mistake that is LIFE. Also I think if some is accused of indecent exposure to a child. They should be put to death also. We can trust the fact a 15yr.old girl would never lie about that.  THIS IS TEXAS WE MUST get tough on crime. WE NEED to make sure also if a person is on PROBATION and done thier time. THEY are denied employement and also a place to live.  This will make sure they want do anymore crimes.  ALSO we need to make sure we don't elect any DIE HARD LIBERALS to our legislators.  LIBERALS ARE soft on CRIME.55655412Flag this commentrldavis70 said on November 12, 2010 at 4:57 PMNo! The death chamber should have a revolving door to get these people off death roll! The death penalty should also be for molesters and rapist !55651614Flag this commentbeard said on November 12, 2010 at 4:50 PMThis is a waste of Tax Payers dollars.  We are all not perfect and we make mistakes. If an innocent person is convicted and put to death.  That is life, not different than someone who has spent yrs. in prison or been on probation for a crime they are innocent of.  It all goes back we are not perfect.  But I do believe in get tough on crime, regardless.  And that means if innocent people get caught up in the system.55651358Flag this commentdannyc said on November 12, 2010 at 4:25 PMThere is a possibility Texas has executed an innocent man---maybe two. That horrible tragedy cannot be un-done but to insure an innocent is not put to death because of some political stance or Old Trestament sense of revenge--- yes--rethink the process all the way through.  Why not be sure-absolutely positively sure beyond a doubt---not a reasonable doubt-not for the death penalty----absolutely positively sure beyond any doubt? Why not?55649954Flag this comment12Next 15 CommentsSign OutProfileMobileRSS FeedsSpecial OffersNewslettersTwitterFacebookCrime VideoArizona congresswoman still sedated after assassin's attack Lawmakers, aides urged to take safety precautions  Funeral for Arlington shooting victim Kimberly Carter Reaction to Rep.
