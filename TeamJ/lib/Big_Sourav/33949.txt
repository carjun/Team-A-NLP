These are the Winter Palace, Hermitage Theatre, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage and New Hermitage.Empress Elizabeth of Russia Public domain photo of portrait by Charles Andr van Loo (1705 - 1765) - photo courtesy of WikiPedia.org  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elizabeth_empress.jpg )Winter Palace Started by Empress Elizabeth Daughter of Peter the GreatThe largest of the buildings is the Winter Palace, the home of Russias Tsars since it was first built for the Empress Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great.  The Baroque style, three story green palace was designed by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli and constructed between 1754 and 1762.Elizaveta Petrovna (Empress Elizabeth) died in 1762 just before the palace was completed.  Elizabeth was succeeded by her nephew, Peter III whose reign lasted only a few months before he died and was succeeded by his wife Catherine, known to history as Catherine the Great.Catherine became the first of the Tsars to live in the palace which was the official residence of the Tsars until Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and the monarchy abolished following the liberal February Revolution of 1917 which preceded the Bolshevik coup in October 1917 (known as the October Revolution) which brought Vladimir Lenin and the Communists to power..State Hermitage MuseumState Hermitage Museum, St.  Petersburg,  Russia - Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Russia, 190000 [get directions]State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia{"lat":59.9408,"lng":30.313101,"zoom":13,"mapType":"ROADMAP","markers":[{"id":"6378","lat":59.9408,"lng":30.313101,"name":"State Hermitage Museum, St.  Petersburg,  Russia","address":"Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Russia, 190000","description":"State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia"}]}The Winter Palace in St. Petersburg Catherine the Great Sets the Tone for the PalaceAs Empress, Catherine moved into the completed Winter Palace and made it her official residence.  From Peter the Great onward, the Russian monarchy looked to make Russia more European.  Peters conquest and annexation of St. Petersburg was part of  this attempt to extend Russia more into Europe socially and culturally.  To this day St. Petersburg is the most  European of Russian cities.Peter the Great began the Tsarist tradition of collecting art  from Western Europe and Catherine the Great continued it on a grand scale.In 1764 Catherine the Great initiated the construction of a small twostory palace next to and adjoining the Winter Palace. Today, this isknown as the Small Hermitage. When I first visited St. Petersburg(then known as Leningrad) as a college student this little palace wasknown as the Hermitage with the Winter Palace and other parts of thepresent State Hermitage Museum remaining separate museums or used as administrative offices by the Soviet Government.Catherine the Great of Russia Public domain photo of portrait by artist Johann-Baptist Lampi the Elder (17511830) Photo courtesy of WikiPedia.org ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Johann-Baptist_Lampi_d._%C3%84._007.jpg )Catherine's Private Hideaway and Start of the Original MuseumWhat is now known as the Small Hermitage, was Catherines private hideaway for herself and close friends.  It was Catherine who created what was to become the core of the Hermitage collection.  Catherine purchased huge amounts of art from Western Europe and displayed them in this private hideaway of hers.I still recall touring what was then known simply as the Hermitage with our college tour group and the guide telling us that Catherines collection contained many paintings by famous artists, but because the Hermitage was off limits to all but a select few friends of  Catherine and her successors, many of these masterpieces were assumed by the art world to have been lost or destroyed.  It wasnt until the Soviets opened the Hermitage to the public in the years after coming to power following the October 1917 Bolshevik coup.La gazza ladra, The Thieving Magpie, OvertureAmazon Price: $0.99The HermitageAmazon Price: $100.25List Price: $25.00Tchaikovsky, Myaskovsky, Sviridov : Einsamkeit, Liebe, VerzweiflungAmazon Price: $10.98Travel Bundle (2-Pack, 3-Discs) ~ The Hermitage: The State Hermitage Museum at St. Petersburg (2004, Russia, Import) / 1000 Places To See Before You Die: France, Italy, Australia, Brazil, Hawaii & Alaska (2007) (Total 5 hrs 23 min)Amazon Price: $49.95State Hermitage Museum St. Petersburg Russia Photographic Poster Print, 36x48Amazon Price: $99.99Like Catherine, her successors were also great collectors of art.Following the collapse of communism and the removal of the shacklesplaced on Russian history, culture and religion by the Soviets, theRussian people took a great interest in re-discovering their hiddenpast. Part of this involved restoring many of the old palaces,churches, monasteries and other pre-Soviet historic sites.Thus,while the Hermitage and Winter Palace were operated as public museumsduring the Soviet era, the rest of the complex was used for governmentoffices. Now, the entire complex is operated as one of the worldsgreatest art museums. However, despite the vast quantity of art ondisplay, it is only a portion of the vast art collections of the Tsars.Whetheran art lover or not, anyone visiting St. Petersburg should take a fewhours to squeeze in a visit the Winter Palace and Small Hermitage. Evenif one is not interested in the art itself (and the collections are notlimited to painting and sculptures but cover wide range of historiccollectibles) the sheer beauty of the interior architecture alone isworth the visit.A Digital VisitIf you are one of those who have no plans for a trip to St. Petersburg in the near future, you can still visit the website of the State Hermitage Museum , click on the link for Russian or English language and then click on the Digital Collection link. You can then select the type of collection you wish to view and settle in for a few hours of viewing the art of your choice. A second option is to click on the Exhibitions link to see if an art museum near you is hosting an exhibit from the collections of the State Hermitage Museum.

She married Peter III, the son of Peter the Greats daughter Anna and successor to Peter the Greats other daughter, the Empress Elizabeth.The marriage of Peter and Catherine was not a happy one and both spent more time in bed with their lovers than with each other. Like Catherine (who took the name Catherine upon converting from the Lutheran faith of birth to the Russian Orthodox faith of her adopted country), Peter was also German as his Russian mother had been married to a German noble and had given birth to and raised Peter in Germany.While Catherine worked and made herself very popular with the Royal Family and the Russian people, Peter was very unpopular, especially with the powerful nobility. Catherine, fearing that Peter planned to divorce her and marry his lover, Elisabeth Vorontsova , thereby replacing Catherine with Elisabeth as the Tsarina, conspired with her then current lover, Grigori Orlov, to overthrow Peter as Tsar. Catherine obviously didnt mind losing Peter as her husband but definitely didnt want to lose her position as Tsarina which would be lost if Peter divorced her.However, before Catherine and Grigori could make their move, the Russian Imperial Guard, angered by Peters plans to institute harsher discipline on them, revolted and imprisoned Peter and then forced him to abdicate. While imprisoned by the Guard Peter was killed. It is unknown whether Catherine ordered the killing of Peter or whether his captors decided to do this themselves. Regardless of whether the killers acted under orders or on their own, Catherine took no action against them.Catherine the Great: Love, Sex, and PowerAmazon Price: $10.30List Price: $18.99SYSTEMA RUSSIAN MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTIONAL DVD GIFT!

How cool that, due to the intimate nature of the Hermitage, so many of Catherine the Great's acquired masterpieces were assumed by the art world to have been lost or destroyed.

Thanks for great information.brandrocker3 months ago Wonderful hub! I liked it and learnt a lot of historical events.GmaGoldie3 months ago I tried the digital museum a while back searching for the history of Catherine the Great's jewelry but alas they weren't as forthcoming on the opulent gems.  We forget how grand Russia once was - the epitome of art and of the world.  I have a replica set of jewelry that the Tzarina was said once to have had - made out of malachite.  The malachite is real, the gold is not but I love it just the same.  The history is fascinating.Any idea of the square footage of the museum - it has to be one of the largest in the world?ocbill3 months ago definitely a place to visit when going to Russia.

I am a big fan of art museums. I so very like the old portraits and the way they are painted. They take me in some fantastic world.Doug Hughes2 months ago Fabulous place. I visited almost a decade ago and barely scratched the surface. I was surprised by an exhibit of Native American artifacts, collected by Russian explorers of North America. But there was Egyptian artifacts - and at that time a controversial exhibit of paintings that was stolen from Berlin after the war, if I recall, containing some art that the Nazis stole from France. The decision from Moscow was 'finders keepers'.As I recall, one of the problems of the museum was properly funding the climate upgrades to maintain proper levels of heat, humidity and light. The structure is 200 years old - it's the only major museum where the building is as much a historical antique as the exhibits.Kudos on a good article.I would love it if someone with access to photos would do an article on the Moscow subways. Many of the underground stations are cathedrals to the worker, created as socialistic shrines to the working man - Bronze statues and tile mosaics. They are overlooked, I guess, because the natives don't notice, and foreign tourists for the most part don't use the subways which are confusing without a Russian guide.nikitha p2 months ago Nicely written, thanks for sharing this.burning bush2 months ago I visited Russia back when it was the foundation of the Soviet Union. Even though I was constantly watched or accompanied by a "guide", there was so much history and beauty that a couple of weeks would not begin to be enough time to absorb it all. BUT, your hub is a great start. Thanks.Lake Mary Hotels4 days ago I'm planning a trip this year to St. Petersburg, so your information comes in handy. I am a huge fan of museum, so I won't miss visiting the Hermitage.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites100ChuckFrom Tucson, Arizona3184 Followers567 HubsJoined 4 years agoRead more hubs by ChuckContact ChuckFollow ChuckSubscribe to Chuck's RSS feedAnswers The QuestionHubMob Weekly topic: Vacation Destinationsasked by Princessa 3 months ago70 answersAnswer this questionRelated QuestionsI live in Washington state, where can I go on vacation for $3000 or less.asked by CennyWenny 2 years ago4 answersAnswer this questionWhat are some quirky places unique/different fun experiences in Chicago?asked by Smax115 3 months ago0 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsThe Columbus Museum of Art Presents the Complaints Choir of...by Patty Inglish, MSThe Temecula Children's Museum Pennypickles Workshopby In The DoghouseThe  Beautiful Hermitage Museum in St.Petersburg Russiaby ladyjane1The Best Museums and Exhibits in Chicago Illinoisby melbelCambridge Atrractions: The Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciencesby 2patriciasA Visit to the Arizona Military Museumby Chuck Travel Activities and Ideas ForumTopicRepliesTraveled 94 countries, anyone want a tip.posted by Castlepaloma24Travel Savingsposted by jerrysparke20places to liveposted by iyah0518Post a new topic22 more topics Tagstravel vacation art hmtswk4 hermitage catherine the great Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
