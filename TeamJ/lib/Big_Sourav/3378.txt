This interview will be Palin's first extended interview since the shooting rampage in Tucson that killed six people and wounded 12, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords was holding an event outside a grocery store to meet with her constituents.   Palin has been taking heat from both sides of the political spectrum since the shooting. In the days following the shooting before details of alleged gunman Jared Loughner's plans emerged, Palin was blamed by some on the left for using incendiary speech, including violent words and imagery.   When it became clearer that the alleged gunman, Jared Loughner, did not seem to be a follower of Palin's, critics on the right cried foul at all those who blamed the former Alaska governor for the rampage.   On Wednesday, Palin released a video in which she said Saturday's shooting in Arizona had nothing to do with political rhetoric, and media figures who invoked a map featuring gun sights on congressional districts are guilty of "blood libel."   Liberal and conservatives have criticized Palin for the video, which equates criticism of Palin's rhetoric with the historical persecution of Jews by accusing them of taking the blood of Christian children.

Damage 2. Control"Absolutely, because her first attempt at damage control where she talked about the victims (as ALBrainTrust12 points out) for a whole 30 seconds before launching into 7-1/2 minutes of poor-poor-pitiful-me didn't go over so well.Not only did she try to say that she was innocent of inciting hatred and violence because criminals alone are responsible for their crimes, but then she claimed to be the victim because discussions of her rhetoric might cause hatred and violence. HUH?It caused so much backlash that you can see the posts against her being removed from her facebook page as fast as they are posted (YouTube - Sarah Palin Facebook scrubbing in realtime).One has to wonder when Palin will have guts enough to be interviewed by a real journalist from (as president of Fox News, Roger Ailes calls them) "the other side". (How can you be fair and balanced if you admit that you represent a side?)I wonder who many times they are going to rehearse the interview before they film it?

Maybe.     Reply to this comment           by pahgre January 14, 2011 11:48 AM EST  I agree.....I used to watch faux nooz before 2008, just to get the "conservative" view, but once they became the fox political network and republican campaign arm of the GOP only to bash everything that Obama says and does, I also cannot stand watching their constant LIES, DECEPTIONS and one-sided propaganda and edited videos just to incite the far-right and teabaggin' extremists!                         by gep1955 January 14, 2011 11:29 AM EST  This is a dead issue, why do you keep headlining it in your presentation of "news". It proves you are scared to death of her. She would blow away Obama in a vote because she won't bow to foreign leaders, spend our grandchildrens wealth or tax the citizens into oblivion like Obama does.     Reply to this comment           by pahgre January 14, 2011 11:37 AM EST  This is obviously "not a dead issue," since caribou barbi has scheduled a MONDAY faux nooz interview to plead her case to the fox political network parrots, and the ONLY Americans that support her, are the 20% from the far-right like yourself making excuses for her constant missteps!                      by USA__Is-back January 14, 2011 11:40 AM EST  Did you read the article? The only thing "it proves" it that Sarah Palin is an idiot and her diciples even more so. "It proves" SHE is "scared to death" to make ANY appearance where the "script" is not pre-screened by her first. "It proves" SHE is "scared to death" to face the publlic.                         by pahgre January 14, 2011 11:26 AM EST  by sam_osborne January 14, 2011 10:50 AM ESTAnd for whatever self-serving reason squirming demigods and their minions now find fault or forgiveness from blame, the lesson to be sanely taken away is that the insensitive targeting of a potential victim is akin to playing with matches atop a powder keg.=================================================Yes, and the proof of what you say, was the MSNBC interview with Gabby Giffords in March 2010, when she said palin's targeting of congressional districts like hers, HAD CONSEQUENCES!The "no retreat....RELOAD" vitriolic political rhetoric that republican attack dog caribou barbi is so proud of, proves she has no shame!     Reply to this comment            by mecury69 January 14, 2011 11:18 AM EST  This should be a very in depth interview! Sean will no doubt ask the tough questions he is known for. LOLI remember previous interviews between these two. The only suspense was wondering which one was going to go down on the other first.Just get a room and skip this fake interview.     Reply to this comment           by pahgre January 14, 2011 11:43 AM EST  Certainly, not to be caught off-guard, palin will be given the questions ahead of time, so she can prepare her answers to the softballs, so that all the faux nooz parrots will be happy!                         by pahgre January 14, 2011 11:07 AM EST  by USA__Is-back January 14, 2011 10:51 AM EST WHY did Palin remove the map from her site and WHY do you keep avoiding this question?=======================================================NOT ONE palin supporter, nor palin, has been able to answer that question, and I'm willing to bet she won't touch it in Monday's softball interview on faux nooz!The "blood libel" quote by palin shows how ignorant she really is.     Reply to this comment            by hillarynow January 14, 2011 10:55 AM EST  I noticed alot of Palin supporters type in ALL UPPER CASE LETTERS. This says alot about the level of their intellect, it must make them feel big and important, alot like their idol Sarah. Stupid is as stupid does..     Reply to this comment           by meboard January 14, 2011 11:05 AM EST  Yep...you know what they say about boys that drive big trucks...have small packages.                      by pahgre January 14, 2011 11:21 AM EST  Yeah, it's very telling about the poster, when it's in ALL CAPS and littered with misspellings and poor grammar!The southern RED welfare states have the worst education in our country, among so many other poor economic statistics, and continue to have their hands out for more welfare dollars from the federal government, subsidized by the BLUE states! We should just cut them off, and make them understand their "personal responsibility" hypocrisy!

Reply to this comment            by sam_osborne January 14, 2011 10:50 AM EST  In Sara Plain's latest video appearance she excoriates the news media for their pictorials and words that she says have stirred up a volatile climate; then she pretends that her graphic displays of gun-sight crosshairs on a map targeting peoples and encouraging people to reload do not do what she pretends to now find fault with. Out of a hostile context of this insane tragedy we are not going to know what all set off this deranged person and ignited this life-exploding devastation. And for whatever self-serving reason squirming demigods and their minions now find fault or forgiveness from blame, the lesson to be sanely taken away is that the insensitive targeting of a potential victim is akin to playing with matches atop a powder keg. Weeks ago, the warning was given and plain to see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mlYHiJCqBI&feature=player_detailpage     Reply to this comment            by ALBrainTrust12 January 14, 2011 10:43 AM EST  DID YOU LOOK AT THAT MAP CLOSELY? THE MAP INCLUDED 3 PEOPLE WHO WERE RETIRING....NO NEED TO SHOOT THEM, THEY WERE GOING ANYWAY. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE EVER LOOKED THROUGH A SCOPE, THE VERTICAL ADN HORIZONTAL REFERENCE LINES DO NOT PROJECT OUTSIDE OF THE CIRULAR FIELD OF VISION.....I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE, BUT THEY ARE NOT ACCURATE PORTRAYALS OF SCOPE SIGHTS.     Reply to this comment           by meboard January 14, 2011 10:47 AM EST  Yep, you're right...these are more like the sights you'd find on a howitzer... I guess she meant to "blow them away".                      by hillarynow January 14, 2011 10:48 AM EST  and I suppose the words "Don't retreat, RELOAD!" her words, don't really mean anything either right? they really must mean, "I love the Easter Bunny, YAYYYY!" I see now..
