Their forecasts have been quite reliable in the past as well, which is why we incorporate them  along with forecasts from Cook Political, CQ Politics and Mr. Sabato  into our own House race projections.Much earlier in the political cycle, however, Mr. Rothenberg had made a very silly forecast.Read moreNote .Stu Rothenberg is already out with a caution that Democrats have a better chance of retaking the House back than keep the Senate come the 2012 Elections.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Polls, UpdatesApril 23rd /2009 Rothenberg call, Macro vs Micro forcasts, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polling giants, Predictions vs Forcasts, Stu Rothenberg political reportRead moreRomeny still leads in the early GOP 2012 Presidential sweepstakes.January 7, 2011jamesb10119 commentsPawlenty Brushes Off Romneys Poll LeadThirty-nine percent of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters supported Romney, who served as governor of neighboring Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.

Joe Lieberman (I-CT)Republicans just took back control of the House and, at least right now, theyre in a strong position to retake the Senate in two years, according to an analysis of the 2012 Senate field by political scientist Larry Sabato.As Sabato points out, the Democratic caucus currently holds 23 of the 33 Senate seats that will be on the line in 2012, meaning they have much more to lose than the GOP. Democrats will have to play a lot more defense and hope for help in the form of a strong down ticket effect from President Obama.Also worrisome for Democrats, Sabato rates seven of those seats, six of them now in Democratic hands, as toss ups. If those races split four to three in favor of Republicans, and the two parties hold the rest of their seats, Republicans would swing their current 53-47 Senate minority into a 50-50 tie.Read more Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, Updates2012 Senate races, Larry Sabado, Polling, PredictionsRead moreThe Zeitgeist (Economic Data ) for the week of January 5, 2011..January 5, 2011jamesb101No commentsThe Zeitgeist ( Economic Data ) From the Atlantic Magazine for January 5, 2011..THE ZEITGEIST46.0%Obama Average Job Approval49.7%Obama Favorability27.3% / 62.3%Right Direction / Wrong Track11.4%Congressional Approval388,000Initial Weekly Jobless Claims262,339Newly foreclosed properties in October9.8%UnemploymentSourcesShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, Polls, The Economy, UpdatesEconomic Data (Zeitgeist), Polls, The Zeitgeist (Economic Data ) for the week of January 5/ 2011Read moreGood Mid-Term Poll numbers dont get you re-elected President.Nate Silver.January 5, 2011jamesb101No commentsWhile the President does have Gallup Poll numbers at 50%.He also knows thats no guarantee hes gonna have easy time getting to keep his job after 2012Nate Silver over @Fivethirtyeight supplies the numbers for his theory.Barack Obama got some good news to start his new year: hisGallup approval rating ticked up to 50 percent yesterday, against 42 percent disapproval. Thats the first time it has been at the 50 percent threshold since early June.Mr. Obama had some successes to point to in December, like the accomplishments of the lame-duck session of Congress, and somemoderately encouraging economic numbers.Still, itsunclear whether the movement is real or reflects statistical noise; most polls still have Mr. Obama slightly below 50 percent. And it probably isnt worth going through very much effort to find out, provided that our focus is on 2012.Historically, there has been almost no relationship between a Presidents approval rating following the midterms and how he eventually fared at the next presidential election. Ivealluded to this in the past, but the data illustrate the point a little bit more forcefully.Below are the Gallup approval ratings at a comparable point in time  early January just after the midterms  for the 11 prior incumbent presidents who stood for election (notre-election, technically speaking, in cases like Gerald Ford).

The Debate and the GraphsByANDREW GELMANA former Massachusetts congressman is perhaps most famous today for saying all politics is local (or, perhaps, all politics are local; Ive seen it written both ways). Heres the Wikipedia explanation of the saying:The former U.S. Speaker of the House Tip ONeill coined this phrase which encapsulates the principle that a politicians success is directly tied to his ability to understand and influence the issues of his constituents. Politicians must appeal to the simple, mundane and everyday concerns of those who elect them into office. Those personal issues, rather than big and intangible ideas, are often what voters care most about, according to this principle.I never thought much about this  it seemed reasonable enough to suppose that voters care about their everyday concerns  until I ran acrossthe following observation from Newsweek commentator Mickey Kaus:There are elections where [O'Neill's principle] doesnt necessarily apply  one thinks of 1980, 1994 and 2008 as elections in which national issues and themes mostly predominated over local issues.  1998 (impeachment) and 2002 (terrorism) and 2006 (Iraq War)  In other words, every midterm for the last two decades has been inexorably nationalized. Including this one [2010].  You would hope that by the next midterm ONeills aphorism will be so obviously wrong that even highly paid political analysts wont trot him out, even to disagree.I think Kaus is right, and Id go one step further and say that, sure, all politics are local  if youre Tip ONeill and represent a ironclad Democratic seat in Congress. Its easy to be smug about your political skills if youre in a safe seat and have enough pull in state politics to avoid your district getting gerrymandered. Then you can sit there and sagely attribute your success to your continuing mastery of local politics rather than to whatever it took to get the seat in the first place..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Other Things, Politics, Polls, The Economy, UpdatesAll politics is local, Communications media, Daniel @ PoliticalDog Nov 2nd Projections for this week, Nationa House Election factor, National Elections, Tip O'NeilRead morePresident Obama wins Cooperation points over the GOP from the Public..DSDJanuary 3, 2011jamesb101No commentsSee pollingreport.com athttp://www.pollingreport.com/obama.htmHarts and McInturffs poll for the Wall Street Journal consistently shows about 10% more respondents view the President strongly or somewhat favorably than view him somewhat or strongly unfavorably.The job approval ratings overall seem about even, although if you look at the Gallup daily tracking, its now at 50-42.See also the chart on pollingreport.coms front page and the numbers that back it at:http://www.pollingreport.com/obama_ad.htmIn your view, is Barack Obama doing enough to cooperate with the Republicans in Congress, or not?[N=502 (Form A), MoE  4.5]59% Enough37% Not EnoughIn your view, are the Republicans in Congress doing enough to cooperate with Barack Obama, or not?28% Enough68% Not EnoughShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesBi-Partisanship after the 2010 elections in the House, Cooperation in Government, DSD@Political101, Obama vs Republican's, PollsRead morePage 1 of 118123...118Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
