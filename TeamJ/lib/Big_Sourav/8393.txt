My Granny What A Large Gun You Have    Craig :  CO :  USA|Jan 07, 2011By Robert Weller        22 0     Views: 1,294      Once upon a time, not long ago at all, a really big black bear was settling down for a long winter's nap in a den in northwestern Colorado.Then it saw a creature, wearing an orange vest and carrying a long thing. "My what a big stick you have," the bear said.All the better to shoot you with, said the "hunter." And he did _ killing the 703-pound bear with one shot from a .45-70 caliber lever-action rifle, according to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel.For Richard Kendall, 55, of Craig, it meant he had finally bested his hunter father. But the story doesn't end there.Some villagers, both near and far, were unhappy. They didn't think Kendall was a hero at all.There were so many complaints the Colorado Wildlife Commission has told its staff to write a regulation that would bar hunting bears in their dens. In hunter's lingo going into a den and shooting a bear as winter approaches is not considered "fair chase."Now, of course no one can say for sure that the bear was preparing to hibernate when the hunter crawled into his den in November. Kendall, before he stopped talking to the media, said the bear had pinned its ears back. He says he had been told that meant it was about to charge. You can confirm that on Google.And he has insisted no one respects bears, and other wildlife, more than he. Brings to mind what Abraham LincolnAbraham Lincoln once said: "I feel like the man who was tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail. To the man who asked him how he liked it, he said: 'If it wasn't for the honor of the thing, I'd rather walk."Kendall, before he stopped talking, told interviewers people in his home town congratulated him enthusiastically. Letter and blog writers not so much.The vast majority of comments have been like this one from grandjctnative in the Daily Sentinel: "Somebody ought to crawl into bed with this guy and stick a gun up his behind and call it 'hunting.' Maybe that would wipe the smile off his face. These actions are disgraceful and one step from poaching or night hunting."        1 of 2              But at least Yogi wasn't sleeping.

I live in Colorado and that large of a Bear is not all that common, so for someone to basicly go into it's "home" and murder it, In my opinion is animal cruelty and he should be hauled into court!

I tend to deplore it especially if it is trophy hunting            Reply  Posted By     mrspleats|2 daysagoI love this take on the childhood story,cute,great job you did .I wish there were some big bad wolf with grandma wolf's big teeth to eat this hunter's butt up.This guy was just egotistical I agree winter approaches not fair game at all.This is not hunting seems very dick cheeneyesque to me.(lol)Rated up.Have a wonderful winter evening!!            Reply  Reply By     Robert Weller|2 daysagoThank you. Let me emphasize that this act has been overwhelmingly rejected in a state in which hunting rules are strictly enforced. State voters chose to end the spring season because too many cubs were left starving when their parents were killed. Many comments have been along the lines of how the commenter would like to crawl in this guy's bed and stick a large rifle up his behind and wipe the smile off his face.            Reply  Reply By     mrspleats|2 daysagoROLMAO,this is really a great way to describe what to do with that "son of a gun" (pun intended)Love this I am still laughing. Will share this reply with honey it is too funny the last sentence that is.            Reply  Posted By     Nathaniel Hines|2 daysagoI knew this friend of mine who got arrested by park rangers in Dana Point, Ca. There was a mix up and the guy stayed in the county jail for about 3-4 days before his release. His buddy picked him up - as he was in a depressed state - and tried to cheer him up with plans to go to Vegas. The jailee guy wanted nothing to do with fun and just wanted to sulk. Finally, the friend said...even Yogi and Bobo could get away from a Park Ranger. If you are to be sad, then it should be that you got arrested by a couple of boobs. Robert, again you make me laugh.            Reply  Posted By     Ljubica Vujadinovic|2 daysago"For Richard Kendall, 55, of Craig, it meant he had finally bested his hunter father." What a lovely education! So he was thought that shooting an animal is a thing to be proud of. I am totally disgusted by hunting. Especially when they dare calling animal killing a sport. Awful! Though, I think I could find some pleasure in hunting the hunters.            Reply  Posted By     Dava Castillo|2 daysagoBears of North America should not be killed. If they encroach, then they should be re-located. And going into a den is just wrong. The bear could have cubs with her.            Reply  Reply By     Robert Weller|2 daysagoDava: although I don't know that we can believe anything this guy says, if there had been cubs he would have seen their tracks.            Reply  Posted By     RaulDeSouza|2 daysagoRobert I am awed by the way you described such a tragic reality. All kinds of hunting must stop.            Reply  Posted By     Gino C. Matibag|2 daysagoI am not for hunting. Here in my country there is a disgusting Website that caters to welcoming foreigners for hunting. That's terrible. Thanks, Robert. Rated up!            Reply  Posted By     Punditty|2 daysagoSarah Palin, are you listening?            Reply  Posted By     catspirit|2 daysagoI love a good bedtime story. Now for the outrage over the shooting of the bear - I agree. But,I still like a story with my news. Great job            Reply  Posted By     fifileigh|2 daysagowell, of course, the bear would be angry. he is just trying to protect his home and land, like the many civilians in foreign countries that are being occupied by some zionist crap. it is the same thing, whether wild animal or humans, each fighting to protect their home and land from invasion, further destruction, and confiscation.            Reply  Reply By     Robert Weller|2 daysagowell if you are going to go there it should also be noted the bears are definitely outgunned            Reply  Posted By     Brigid Primrose|1 dayagoIs Richard Kendall's father alive to see what a wonderful child he has? Shame on them both for hunting in the first place. Rated up            Reply  Posted By     looniestlove|1 dayagoWhat Richard Kendall did was bad...not only did he killed a bear, he killed a bear that is not doing something to him...he was hibernating, and the bear did not not even attacked him... I hope that he learned the mistake that he did...I really do not like hunting, for animals are also living creatures, just like us, the only diffrence is that we can think rationally...he should be jailed for what he did...shame on him...thank you Robert for shsring this news with us...rated up!!!
