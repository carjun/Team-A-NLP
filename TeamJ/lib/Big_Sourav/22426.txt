Bouazizi Mohamed, a young traveling salesman, had set himself on fire in front of the Prefecture of Sidi Bouzid, in the center of the country in mid-December. He made this gesture to protest against the seizure by police of fruits and vegetables he sold. The 26 year old university graduate could not find stable work and selling products to the streets to earn some money for his family. Union sources have said that municipal officials had abused Mohamed Bouazizi and had prevented him from filing complaints. For their part, the authorities claim that the young man had no business license. His desperate gesture has since resulted in significant social protests in the region. The events were then extended across the country, resulting in violence between protesters and police. Over 5000 people attended the funeral of Mohammed Bouazizi, Wednesday afternoon, as the unionist Kamel Laabidi. According to this source, the police stopped the funeral procession to march to the headquarters of the prefecture in Sidi Bouzid, Bouazizi where Mohamed had attempted to commit suicide.        1 of 4         Tunisia's Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi speaks during The African Economic Conference in Tunis      karasiwo is based in Karchi, Sind, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (48.1%) Czech Republic (9.0%) Denmark (6.8%) Pakistan (5.3%) 19 other countries (24.8%)           READ MORE: Tunisian, set himself, on fir, dies, injuries, world, google, CNN, bbc, FOX, UK, USA, fire, Bouazizi Mohamed, disasters-news, Tunisia, Tunis, Sidi Bou Zid, social issues, human interest, Mohammed Bouazizi, Mohamed Bouazizi   More News From: Tunis :  Tunisia     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 1            Reply  Posted By     vauldine|3 daysagoUnfortunate.
