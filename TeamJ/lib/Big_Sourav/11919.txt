Chairman Francis Tolentino presented the idea during the Transport and Traffic Summit held last week at the Philippine Social Science Center in Quezon City. In addition to the appropriate safety attire, Tolentino said the use of good quality helmets which conform to international standards should also be strictly enforced among riders, as well as the prohibition of a third passenger. There is an existing policy on this by the Land Transportation Office (LTO), as well as other similar city ordinances in effect. But unfortunately, there is laxity in the enforcement of these rules. I believe it is best to turn this policy into law for it to have more teeth, Tolentino said. LTO Administrative Order Number AHS-2008-015 prescribes rules and regulations on the use and operation of motorcycles on highways. Under the policy, failure of the driver and/or the passenger or back rider to wear the standard helmet would have him fined P1,500. Drivers must also not wear flip flops, sandals or slippers or drive bare-footed or be fined of P500, P700 and P1,000 and revocation of drivers license for the first, second and third offenses, respectively. In line with this, Tolentino ordered the agencys traffic enforcers to strictly implement the no helmet, no travel policy on major thoroughfares and secondary roads. The MMDA chief stressed that this is for the protection of the riders and warned that violators will be apprehended and meted the corresponding penalties. Im appealing to the local government units to likewise be strict on this matter and introduce other measures that will promote the safety of the riders, Tolentino said. As an additional safety feature, Tolentino also wants motorcycles to have a system where the headlights automatically switch on during engine ignition. Tolentino explained the motorcycle headlights should be on even during daytime to allow maximum visibility in the roads. I understand that several manufacturing firms have been putting this feature on their motorcycles. We hope that this will become a standard regulation among companies manufacturing and selling motorcycles, he said.     jpatrick7308 is based in Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (64.3%) Philippines (14.3%) India (7.1%) France (7.1%) Sweden (7.1%)           READ MORE: MMDA, safety attire, appropriate safety, motorcycles riders, wear appropriate, your-story, Philippines, MOT test, manila, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Motorcycling, motorcycle, Francis Tolentino, Disaster Accident   More News From: Manila :  Philippines     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Single Ticketing System Proposed for Traffic Violators By: jpatrick7308      The Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) welcomed Friday suggestions from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to simplify the processing of traffic violation tickets in the metropolis.MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino has been batting for the use of a single ...  about 1 month ago          Loading News Contributions...
