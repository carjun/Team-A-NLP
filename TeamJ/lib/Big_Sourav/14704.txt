Though not the first time, this stuff is getting an inordinate amount of airplay.Look for the media hype to get worse. Thanks to cell phones, internet, and a generally interconnected, 24/7 world.All these events  and more  earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoesthe list goes on..occurred in the past, of course. But if they occurred in uninhabited areas, or those with no communication like weve had only in the past 100 years, well, no else one would about it.Unfortunately the populace, i.e. the scientific ignorati, is easily confused, and interprets this as MORE earthquakes, hurricanes, whale beachings and the like, then stupidly uses this as proof the world is being destroyed.There ARE things that will eventually need to be reversed (we cant pump greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere forever, nor can parts of the planet sustain China-style pollution).but when people say we are having MORE earthquakes and volcanoes, for example.I just shake my head and try to walk away.Recent mass deaths include birds, fish, and even, over a few days, several manatees. Some have been linked to cold weather.http://sciencedude.ocregister.com/2011/01/06/mass-animal-death-map-on-google/118... groups:News tags:Fish,and More,Recent mass deaths include birds |25 comments// Mass animal-death map on Google - we'll never get the full story from the media or gov't?hide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

Now that it has extended from mass gang killing to massive death occurances of animal species, can I expect a red moon or the last seal to be broken or a trip to Disney Land before the paranoia sets in?? 1 day agoflag  reply0gepma44Do we honestly think the govt will tell us what is going on....no they hope we sit around watching BET ,Snooki and jerry springer.....while the world collapses around us....sometimes fear will not allow the brain to accept reality.... 1 day agoflag  reply0Joseph_TkachIt's not the BP oil spill. If it where it wouldn't effect all of the same species over and over again. Aside from that toxins would have show up in any postmortem necrology report. Continuing on there is a news article on NBC or CBS or ABC... something, that states the average number of reported mass animal deaths is 163 a year. Now if you do that math you divide that by 12 you get 13.33_ so 13-14 a month, right? In the past 2-3 weeks there have been over 30 reported cases. So two months worth of the average in 2ish weeks. Now, that ranges from all sorts of random reasoning. Disease and weather being the most common. Almost half of these bird cases where due to blunt trauma or high altitudes.There really is no good solution yet, and the mainstream media is pushing under the rug while tiny news outlets are claiming all kinds of insane conspiracy theory's. All I know is something weird is happening and there really is nothing as of yet to attribute it to. 1 day agoflag  reply-2FishaHouse777Those spots are only in well urbanated areas, that most likely celebrated new years and/or christmas or a related holiday with fireworks, parties, and mass gatherings of people.............those are the facts you figure out the rest. 1 day agoflag  reply+1ImConcerned  FishaHouse777:so where were the dead animals last year? or the year before? or... have you EVER heard of a flock of birds falling out of the sky due to fireworks, in history, before this year? so... why now are fireworks all over the world bringing down entire flocks all over the world every day since new years... on this year only? 1 day agoflag  reply0FishaHouse777  ImConcerned:Actually yes I HAVE, but since your posts are full of contempt and ahtred I won't do you the honor of a link.

Along with all the other poisons they pump into the environment. 1 day agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  jubal:i agree... most of them follow the mississippi river area and ocean currents. this is a real viable answer to this question and it should be explored more openly. 1 day agoflag  reply0indecisivehThe truth is centuries of environmental degradation in the name of cheap profits and mass expansion.  The more that is destroyed, the less room there is left for any of the smaller animals to survive.  You'll find that all of these species died from a range of environmentally explainable situations, even some can be described as natural and unavoidable.  Most however are due to pollution, deforestation, oil spills...etcEnvironmental degradation is the #1 issue of our time whether we choose to acknowledge that or not. 1 day agoflag  reply-1danitassinBP oil dispersents.

Maybe it was proven that it is not a manmade phenom, but it is an absolute fact that the ocean and arctic areas are warmer now in general than they have been in our history. Im not saying this because Im a fruitcake either. Its absolutely fact that there is MUCH less arctic ice every year for the last 5-10 yrs. The permafrost in Siberia is even starting to thaw and release methane gas. Things are changing whether we like it or not or whether its our fault or not. Who knows, we may just adapt to different weather patterns and move to higher elevations when the sea level rises. Hopefully, that is the worst case scenario. 2 days agoflag  replymore fromNews:Online USA News: "Bob's Burgers" serves up bad first course Fernanda Vasconcellos with her shoes Online USA News: Packers find the way to stop Michael Vick Latest News Wyatt Earp most populartop rankednew & rising1Remember When Beck Ridiculed Pelosi For Speaking Out Agains... 2Obama lays blow to closing Guantanamo 3Obama Created More Jobs in One Year Than Bush Created in Eight 4Corporations or politicians hurting America? 5The system suited everybody until the crisis hit  Ron Paul 6Congress to Reduce Free Speech? 7LIFE'S GOOD, SHUT UP ! 8A Real Hero....
