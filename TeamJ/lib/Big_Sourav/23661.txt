Depending on what actually happens in his third world experience, and if someone spends enough time there... it is pretty inevitable that something will happen, literally kissing the ground when getting back through U.S. customs is not an abnormal experience.                    01-07-2011, 11:05 AM          nowitsshowtime  Senior Member            Join Date: Jan 2009 Location: Union City, NJ 357 posts, read 248,227 times Reputation: 182          I'm with you on some points.

I dreamed of United States for about 15 years now and still do. Now, a university graduate who is working, I see myself facing the same wall as I did 15 years ago.                           Earlier I applied for a job in Texas and wrote another 2 page  email  to the HR explaining why Canada will not give me half of  opportunities America readily offers everyone. I even threw in the bit that Plattsburgh, NY is 60 miles away from me  and I drive there just to see how things (relating to my job) are done  differently there. I am not sure what to do anymore. I considered stealing someone's identity, looking on ebay if anyone would want to trade me, or pay money for someone's identity? I know it's wrong but I'm thinking of all options. Regardless, I will probably do master's in US. My main point with  all of this is. Millions of people all over the world want to live in America, but I bet only a few thousand Americans ever leave.    Interesting tidbit: Did you know that even during this "recession and mortgage crisis" the per capita unemployment rate of United states is lower, and has been lower for 25 years than Canada. Think about that for a bit. And before you throw social programs at me, I'd much rather be "working and in debt" like an American than "unemployed and have fun" like a Canadian..                    01-07-2011, 11:19 AM          grapico  Senior Member            Join Date: Oct 2007 Location: Chicago 6,344 posts, read 3,491,960 times Reputation: 2043           Quote:    Originally Posted by architext   Regardless, I will probably do master's in US.

This is because US has weak immigration laws and other countries have tight immigration laws. For example if I wanted to immigrate to say UK at my age and income I'd also need a PhD to immigrate there in some kind of math/science field because it is on a points system.I would immigrate to France/Belgium/Germany/Switzerland/UK/Ireland if given an opportunity to, no questions asked.                    01-07-2011, 11:20 AM          Cronous  Member            Join Date: Dec 2010 Location: Arlington, VA 28 posts, read 3,890 times Reputation: 24          Frankly OP sounds petulant and angry that liberalism does not predominate the US.  The founding fathers vision of freedom was not some kind of anarchistic I can do what I want when I want. "you can't really do anything without a permit and multiple forms of ID" Umm where can do you drive without an ID?  Afghanistan?  Permits and licenses are often needed for community safety (unless you want the habitual drunk driver driving on your street).  Besides many things we do with our permits (like drive on the highway) is not a right but a privilege. "pot is still illegal" Why stop there?  Let us legalize cocaine, having sex with 8 year olds (hey its consensual isn't it?), etc.   "the media, while technically free, is dominated by  the mainstream media to the point that the influence of the alternative  media is permitted only because it is not influential in comparison" LOL, so what are you saying that because the vast majority of Americans prefer CNN or Fox News to Air America, we are not free?  You have the freedom to choose, not dictate to others what they should watch. "we  have more people in jail than any country in the world because we  believe in revenge and not in rehabilitation and treatment" Frankly what does this have to do with the concepts of the founders?  The founders never articulated that we should more to help convicts vs. protect the community from said criminals.   America has shifted to prison as means to protect to society from one of rehabilitation because rehab is seen to be largely a failure with an extremely high recividism rate. "it costs a  fortune to rent, to the point that poor people can't even live in some  states." So the founding fathers version of freedom entailed socialism now?  Frankly the cost of living (including rent and food) is far below Europe.  Japan is even worse,  with Tokyo being one of the most expensive cities in the world. "Most  Americans have no idea that western Europe and much of Asia is far more  modern in infrastructure than most of the States are" European cities look very elegant while American cities are more utalitarian.  However Europeans tend to live much smaller homes, food is far more expensive, and the average European makes significantly less money. "and ignore the  fact that places like New Orleans are practically third world" If you go to muslim dominated places in Northern England, the Banilues in France, or Immigrant sections of Italy, Spain, Greece,they are not practically third world they are third world. "and even  though we don't chop off people's hands like a few Middle Eastern  countries do, we do still use the death penalty even though countries  like Turkey have even gotten rid of it and put people in jail for  decades for relatively minor crimes such as drug offenses" Huh?  Japan still has the death penalty.  And narco-trafficiking (esp. things like heroin, cocaine) is not a minor offense, it affects many lives negatively.   "Everything is about individual rights even though the  average American loves to complain about how irresponsible people unlike  themselves are." You have the right to do alot of things that are immature (e.g. smoke, drink excessively), that does not mean i cannot say that you are immature.   "Americans would rather let people with cancer just die than have  universal healthcare." Look Ma, we don't have socialized medicine therefore we are REALLY REALLY BAD PEOPLE. "Hard work is valued infinitely over having a good  time; that's why most Americans only get 3 weeks off their job the WHOLE  FREAKING YEAR." LOL, DO NOT interfere with my right to do nothing and get paid for it.  "Stop kidding yourselves guys - we are not the light of the world. Not anymore at least." We are not the light of the world for Karl Marx that is.                    01-07-2011, 11:23 AM          AJNEOA  Senior Member            Join Date: Aug 2007 671 posts, read 354,680 times Reputation: 237           Quote:    Originally Posted by iPwn   First of all, I'm an American.

The older I get (I'm only 21 btw), the more and more I realize most of what we consider great about America is either not true at all or isn't true in this day and age. The reality is, America is not all that free compared to a lot of countries, you can't really do anything without a permit and multiple forms of ID, pot is still illegal, the media, while technically free, is dominated by the mainstream media to the point that the influence of the alternative media is permitted only because it is not influential in comparison, we have more people in jail than any country in the world because we believe in revenge and not in rehabilitation and treatment, it costs a fortune to rent, to the point that poor people can't even live in some states. Americans are basically raised to believe the outside world is still living in the 1800s at the latest and the stone age in many places. Most Americans have no idea that western Europe and much of Asia is far more modern in infrastructure than most of the States are, and ignore the fact that places like New Orleans are practically third world and even though we don't chop off people's hands like a few Middle Eastern countries do, we do still use the death penalty even though countries like Turkey have even gotten rid of it and put people in jail for decades for relatively minor crimes such as drug offenses. Not to mention a very large percentage of Americans probably believe the world is 6,000 years old and that evolution is a myth. American idealism is a strange brew of Christianity, materialism, and individualism. Religion without spirituality, Christ without the compassion. Everything is about individual rights even though the average American loves to complain about how irresponsible people unlike themselves are. Americans are the most submissive to authority people ever. Americans demand swift and cold justice to all evil-doers, unless they wear a suit, then they deserve our scorn but otherwise deserve to get off scott-free. Americans believe being in the Army automatically makes you a hero, even if you kill innocent people in other countries for fun. We constantly re-elect the same types of people into office even though they never do us any good, because we believe that strongly in the good of the status quo. Americans would rather let people with cancer just die than have universal healthcare. Hard work is valued infinitely over having a good time; that's why most Americans only get 3 weeks off their job the WHOLE FREAKING YEAR.  I thought only a certain type of American (ie, a redneck) was super-patriotic and jingoistic, but I've come to discover a vast majority of my people basically think we're superior to everyone else. Stop kidding yourselves guys - we are not the light of the world. Not anymore at least.    Interesting post.  I think a lot of people are starting to feel like you do.  I think there's a lot of truth to what you said, but I also understand what others are saying.  There is a lot of bad everywhere in the world, and the US is still a great place to live.  Genocide, civil war, military states, etc. are sprinkled across the globe. I think America's biggest downfall is that it thinks it's living according to the genius of 1776 in the current day and age.  American politics and media consistently lie and manipulate, and many people follow like sheep.  I feel we're headed down a darker path, but still feel that America has a lot of great potential.   If you feel stuck in a rut, you should consider traveling a bit or living somewhere else.  Don't confuse this suggestion with an "if you don't like it, leave" attitude, but you should consider getting some exposure to the other places that appear to be great (and probably are in some areas).  You may like it better, or you'll get an enlightening experience.                    01-07-2011, 11:25 AM          James420  Still Learning         Status: "I still don't get it"        (set 5 days ago)       Join Date: Feb 2010 Location: Wilmington, Delaware 676 posts, read 152,397 times Reputation: 209          While the United States may not appeal to everyone and thats fine, as an American I believe we saved the World in WW1 and WW2. I remember the feeling after 9/11 and I loved it. Not what happened to the 3000+ people, but the feeling of what it means to be an American, not democrat or republican. I loved driving down my street and seeing our flag raised high and it showed everywhere that we can still come together as one, which is how I see the U.S, not 50 states but one country. I like how the Declaration of Independence is our two week notice to England to get the $*!# out. There's no place I'd rather be.                    01-07-2011, 11:28 AM          grapico  Senior Member            Join Date: Oct 2007 Location: Chicago 6,344 posts, read 3,491,960 times Reputation: 2043          Also, I see you are moving to Portland in February, where are you now?
