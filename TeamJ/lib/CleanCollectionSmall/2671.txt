There are two slots that look like they would be it but it turns out to just be holes. Anything inserted would just grip to the plastic case and be pretty ineffective. Evidently these slots are pretty major foreshadowing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogles Twitter accounts celebrate Google Maps entry to iOS  by  nmpraveenin  apple[+]tidu 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]tidu 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours agoAs far as I know the "offline mode" is basically everything that your phone has cached. So it's likely the area you live in will be cached but not some random part of the world unless you zoom there with service and cache the tiles.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat single picture would you show to someone explaining your life's dream?  by  EirStegalkinin  AskReddit[+]tidu 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]tidu 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoNot that kind of dream!permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]tidu 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]tidu 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoPrivate property owners now sell their own parking passes, and then pay towing companies to scout their lots for cars without them.Yep. Last year I lived across the street from an empty, fenced lot. It was on a corner so two sides of the lot were for parking, with two spots-worth of "tow zone" in front of the gated and locked entrance to the empty lot. There was signage but you had to look for it. Every night at midnight, like clockwork, the tow truck would come by and pick up the latest sucker.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]tidu 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]tidu 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoYou better learn to use it, because you're not going to find any store that would buy back a pile of unbound papers!permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle Maps for iPhone was just released, and it's even BETTER than Android's version.

Once the news broke that they decided to go back to... older bag technology, if you will, I ran to the store to see if I could get a listen before they were all sold. The was one big bag left and it was covered in wrinkles as if hundreds of customers manhandled it before deciding not to buy it. I rested my fingers on the place where hundreds of fingers had been before and rustled the jimmies out of that bag. And damn it was loud.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is a MUST SEE movie that is highly overlooked?  by  day-makerin  AskReddit[+]tidu 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]tidu 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoOr just see the movie and judge for yourself.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo a friend of a friend made this for his parrot  by  Elquesoin  videos[+]tidu 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]tidu 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoSounds like background music from Spongebob.permalinksavecontextfull commentsit's a TRAP  by  moreBackupin  AdviceAnimals[+]tidu 293 points294 points295 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]tidu 293 points294 points295 points 7 days agoThen who was seed?permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm stranded 26 miles northeast of Philly...could somebody please help me?  by  Takasheenin  philadelphia[+]tidu 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]tidu 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoIt's hard walking on those potholespermalinksavecontextfull commentsNew to driving a manual...some questions which I can't figure out  by  drummerman345in  Autos[+]tidu 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]tidu 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoYour questions have been answered but I just wanted to say that it doesn't take long before you're comfortable. I bought a stick at the end of August barely knowing how to drive it. It just takes practice. After a few weeks I was fairly comfortable, and by now I'm very comfortable but still refining some things. I've got about 5k miles on it. I'm sure you're aware but you will stall while you're learning. It becomes very infrequent though. I'm at that stage where if I do stall (I absent-mindedly did it in a Burger King drive-through last week) it's very discouraging and I get really self conscious... but it's whatever. Good luck!permalinksavecontextfull commentsApple CEO Tim Cook announces plans to manufacture Mac computers in USA starting in 2013  by  arontxin  technology[+]tidu 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]tidu 1 point2 points3 points 8 days agoSteve was talking about managing the line.
