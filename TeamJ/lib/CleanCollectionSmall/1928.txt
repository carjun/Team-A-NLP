I like your site though, just thought I would mention the above.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo i am new to access and am having trouble getting this dialogue box to say what i want!  by  sayrisin  MSAccess[+]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI am assuming you have this all wrapped up by now, but whatev:  WHERE tblOrder.[order number]=[Yo Dawg Enter an Order Number]permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuery Question  by  blackfusein  MSAccess[+]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoIf you are going with this, I would use the Month and Year functions to get at least a bit of grouping.permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuery Question  by  blackfusein  MSAccess[+]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI am looking at your pictures...I see three possible solutions:1-Initial query which uses OrderTbl as the source, using a nested IIF to build a Quarter field.  Then a query will use this query as the source and let you total by quarters.  2-You can build four seperate queries referencing the four distinct quarter date periods then join them together.3-Forgot, a coworker started talking to me and I lost it.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsPistol class?  by  rocktopusin  blackops2[+]gaen 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoDo you ruin the Tac 45s solid 2 hit kill range by running the suppressor?permalinksavecontextfull commentsPistol class?  by  rocktopusin  blackops2[+]gaen -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoYup, I run FMJ with Ext Mags on either Tac 45 or BR23.  I don't think FMJ helps much but I figure it may just clinch a kill from time to time.I will say that occasionally I do much better on my pistol class, and I attribute that to play style, when I engage with a pistol I am attempting to do it on my terms.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNuketown Logic  by  whosDerekkin  blackops2[+]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI run Danger Close on Nuketown...permalinksavecontextfull commentsTip for those who use SCAR-H  by  BananaSplit2in  blackops2[+]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoThe SCAR-L/H has been my gun of choice, I am not sure I like its look in BO2.I think it is just me, but Treyarch guns always seem to look less authentic/real then IW.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone else feel the death machine is a tad under-powered?  by  xiDemisein  blackops2[+]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoTo me, it is good as long as you don't need to move much ie. guarding flags or a bomb.  If you have to move constantly, Hardpoint, ctf etc.. you get clipped a lot during travel, or I feel like I do.  Overall, I think it is fun.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThere have been a lot of complaints that the shotguns in Bo2 are overpowered. I personally feel that for the first time in COD they are exactly where they need to be. Does anyone else feel this way?  by  ShodyLokoin  blackops2[+]gaen 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gaen 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoOr when you start heading down a corridor and and an enemy peeks around it, your toast.
