Also we have a thing called the 2nd amendment. permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50  comment score below threshold (7 children)[]KKN50 -8 points-7 points-6 points 54 minutes agoFuck the 2nd amendment.  It's killing us.permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 4 points5 points6 points 52 minutes ago (4 children)[]dieselgeek 4 points5 points6 points 52 minutes agoHa, toss out the 1st amendment while we're at it.   I mean really just strip us of our rights, we don't deserve them. _So many factors in this nation put us where we're at.  The 2nd is not one of them. permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50  comment score below threshold (3 children)[]KKN50 -7 points-6 points-5 points 46 minutes agoI think the second amendment has everything to do with our gun violence problem.  The right to own guns is what has allowed us to develop our ridiculous gun culture.  If we never had that right in the Constitution, we could have strict gun laws today.permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 38 minutes ago (2 children)[]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 38 minutes agoHow is it so ridiculous?  This event today is tragic and makes me want to vomit, but it's really pretty rare. Tons of countries have violence and strict gun laws on the book.  Really if they were proven to stop violence, and stop people from hurting others, than I'd be all for it. Simple fact is they don't really impact crime.    I mean look in prisons, NO weapons are allowed , yet they are made with the simplest of supplies they find, and the knowledge that is shared. permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 31 minutes ago (1 child)[]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 31 minutes agoThe US leads the world in school shootings.  Sure they're rare, but not as rare as they should be.  Not rare enough that we shouldn't be doing something about the problem instead of sitting on our asses and saying "oh but the 2nd amendment!"permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes agoLike what?   What would you do , that would cut down on mass murders? permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (1 child)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoJust like outlawing cocaine totally stopped drug deaths, good pointpermalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 -1 points0 points1 point 4 minutes ago (0 children)[]KKN50 -1 points0 points1 point 4 minutes agoWith drugs, making them legal seems to be what keeps deaths down the best.  But making guns perfectly legal doesn't seem to do any good.  Guns started being regulated for a reason.  If they weren't effective tools in the commission of crimes, they wouldn't have started being regulated in the first place.permalinksaveparent[+]Apparatii -5 points-4 points-3 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)[]Apparatii -5 points-4 points-3 points 56 minutes agoWe used to have a thing called the 18th amendment too.
