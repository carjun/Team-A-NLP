Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]charmonkie 1 point2 points3 points 48 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 1 point2 points3 points 48 minutes agoI'm also pro-mental health testing for gun ownership.  They do have the tiniest bit of that, you can't have been committed to a mental institution to have your concealed carry license (at least in my state).I'm not saying that since I have the opinion that 'I don't think it would do much' we should run with that.  I'm open to people talking about it, and trying to work out if it would.  That's just my no-resources stancepermalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Except not really because no one plans days in advance to go on a drunk driving spree (I think).  Regulation would be like saying all cars should have breathalyzer-starters (even though there are work-arounds and would be for gun likely) (although I'm pro regulation)As long as you're blindly labeling gun advocates you're going to sound uneducatedpermalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I'm pretty sure people who own guns easily and legally wake up and decide to kill people.  It's the kind of think they've thought about, thinking takes time, and time plus a desire to kill means you're willing to go out of your way to do so.  I'm not at all a psychiatrist, but that's my thinking....I do think ownership should be tracked, and you should have background checks to buy/own/carry permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]charmonkie 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoWhere I'm from you do have to complete a class, pretty aggressive background check, and show at least some ability to carry in public.  You also have to pass a background check to buy a gun.  That said there isn't any ownership tracking after it's bought which I would think is a good ideapermalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
