If all receivers were to become free agents, and there was a draft to be held, who would be the top receivers to be drafted?  by  I_did_not_rape_herin  nfl[+]jeremy203 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (0 children)[]jeremy203 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoI like the list, except I would have Larry Fitzgerald lower because of his age. I would probably take AJ Green #1 simply because he's already a stud and you're building for the future at the same time. It's hard to say who I would take without knowing the situation of my team. If I were the Broncos I would take Calvin Johnson because I want to win a Superbowl within 2-3 years within the Peyton Manning window, if I was the Colts I would take AJ Green firstpermalinksavecontextfull commentsShould we be focusing more on the offensive systems that are being used rather than the rookie quarterbacks in them?  by  Midway_Monstersin  nfl[+]jeremy203 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]jeremy203 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours agoThe biggest problem with RG3 for me is the reason he's such a threat in my eyes is because he's so quick he will burn you on the feet as well as the air, but if he gets injured to much on runs he's going to end up being solely a pocket passer and who knows if he can do thatpermalinksavecontextfull commentsDo our enemies have to be human? Could you enjoy fighting the computer in multiplayer games?  by  db_mewin  truegaming[+]jeremy203 -1 points0 points1 point 9 hours ago (0 children)[]jeremy203 -1 points0 points1 point 9 hours agoThere's just something that bugs me that when you're playing a bot, even if it feels human like at the end of the day it's still being human like because it's got a script saying that it can only react so fast because a human couldn't react so fast. If you could have a girlfriend that was in fact a robot that was so lifelike you couldn't tell the difference would you still want it? I could enjoy playing against bots, but if the aim is to make them as human like as possible why not just play against humanspermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy does USA's lack of functioning mental health care take a back seat to gun regulation whenever there's a public shooting?  by  stickykeysmcgeein  AskReddit[+]jeremy203 3 points4 points5 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]jeremy203 3 points4 points5 points 11 hours agoI just don't understand the USA.

Doing it all by hand is kind of pointless if you're drawing from a picture because at the end of the day you're trying to get it as close to being 'traced' as possible anywaypermalinksavecontextfull commentsGUESS WHO?!?!  by  ox_raiderin  nba[+]jeremy203 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]jeremy203 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoWhite guy is Steve Nash, black guy is Amare Stoudemire, they used to be team mates when they were in the Phoenix Suns together.
