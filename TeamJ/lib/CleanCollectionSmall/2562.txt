(x-post via /r/googlecensorship)  by  skepticofskepticsin  conspiracy[+]NSojac 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoHere's why I think this is a bad thing:Sometimes there is no such thing as expert consensus. In many areas even the very idea of any type of meaningful consensus is laughable, like political commentary for instance. Depending on how these experts are vetted, this can introduce (un)intended bias into the results. Expert consensus isn't evaluated by experts themselves. Take a look here at the qualifications. Basically you need to not be brain-dead and be a US citizen. The internet is not a primarily academic instrument. For those wanting factual rigor in their internet experience, there are many ways to get it, and they aren't exactly hidden. Incorrect, misleading, or against-the-mainstream ideas and opinions can still be valuable, both intellectually and for entertainment purposes. They can broaden one's horizons, introduce you to new modes of thinking, or simply be a catalyst for prompting you to learn more. Following closely from (3), differing opinions and mutually exclusive claims fosters the development of good critical thinking skills. In school and in mass media, expert opinion is taken as gospel and critical thinking is reduced to a mere theoretical exercise. On the internet the ability to analyze and contextualize sources is a practical necessity, and that is only true because of the ubiquity of conflicting and at times unreliable information.  The internet is valuable because it is democratic. Outside of standing on a soapbox on mainstreet, the internet is the only domain I can think of where people can express themselves without being vetted and reviewed by experts or other gatekeepers. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle manual proves suspicions that Google downranks content that doesn't fit the consensus of experts. (x-post via /r/googlecensorship)  by  skepticofskepticsin  conspiracy[+]NSojac 6 points7 points8 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 6 points7 points8 points 5 days agoThe obvious problem is how google determines which sources are disreputable and by what criteria and by what experts. Does this only apply to sites about the hard sciences whose factuality is easily verified? News as well? Blogs? This policy immediately creates an incentive to not deviate from Established Consensus if one wants a high page rank. I think there's a danger of inhibiting informational diversity on the web--developing an internet experience of directed media similar to print and cable news.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsFDA quietly increases allowed radiation doses of meats for human consumption  by  Jubei07in  conspiracy[+]NSojac 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoAnd I quote:Food Safety ConcernsIn addition to the proposed weakening of the labeling requirements for irradiated food, FDAs rule would also severely limit them by requiring companies to label irradiated food only when the radiation treatment causes a material change to the product. Examples include changes to the taste, texture, smell or shelf life of a food. Published research on irradiated foods reveals that irradiation does change, and can actually ruin, the flavor, odor, appearance, and texture of food. Such research repeatedly finds that irradiated foods smell rotten, metallic, bloody, burnt, grassy, and generally off. The taste has been described as like sulfur, singed hair, burnt feathers, burnt oil, and rancid fat.  Beyond the obvious yuck factor, serious questions remain as to whether irradiated foods are safe to eat.Irradiation Destroys the Vitamin Content of FoodsIrradiated foods can lose from 2-95% of their vitamins. For example, irradiation can destroy up to 80% of the vitamin A in eggs, up to 95% of the vitamin A and lutein in green beans, up to 50% of the vitamin A and lutein in broccoli, and 40% of the beta-carotene in orange juice. Irradiation also doubles the amount of trans fats in beef.Additionally, it "Masks the Unsanitary Condition of Factory Farms" and "Contributes to Consolidation of the Agriculture Industry and the Globalization of Food"Which I can understand. Poor diet and post-hoc problem solving together will probably kill more people and do more to accelerate the fall of civilization than any other threat that could be described as "imminent" or "notorious". While we will eventually come to understand that these are "problems" that society "must face", it'll be slow, low-density, and affect mainly poor people so in common parlance "no big deal" and certainly not "dangerous". Though I don't know why anyone who wasn't interested only in base fear-mongering would single out food irradiation outside the scope of those larger problems. Fuck naturalnews basically. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFDA quietly increases allowed radiation doses of meats for human consumption  by  Jubei07in  conspiracy[+]NSojac 5 points6 points7 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 5 points6 points7 points 5 days agoIt can't be compared, because its not the person in this case that's receiving radiation, but the meat. Simply irradiating something does not make the target in any way radioactive. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFDA quietly increases allowed radiation doses of meats for human consumption  by  Jubei07in  conspiracy[+]NSojac 5 points6 points7 points 5 days ago*(0 children)[]NSojac 5 points6 points7 points 5 days ago*The title makes it sound like they increased the allowed level of radiation in meat. They actually just increased the level of radiation (as in, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays and gamma rays) that could be applied to meat, for the purposes of killing pathogens. Irradiating things in this way does not make the target itself radioactive, and of course the meat, already being dead, suffers no discomfort either. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs there a lot of hate for "Catcher in the Rye"?  by  MaxxtheWolfin  literature[+]NSojac 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoIt's possible that Holden has just become so potent a trope in our culture that by the time an adolescent approaches Catcher in school they've already been inoculated against that type of character. Everyone knows that teens are angsty, therefore no teen would be caught dead acting like or sympathizing with such an obvious angsty teen. Maybe something along the lines Rabbit Run might be more appropriate for today's coming-of-age students? permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy Obama's tax plan would not really touch the incomes of many wealthy Americans  by  IslandEconin  Economics[+]NSojac 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoWhy shouldn't they?

But for real I thought his "loopholes" were just tax deductions that supposedly only the very rich take advantage of. Those aren't loopholes, you're supposed to use them. But if the rich (top 5%) already pay 40% of the tax income, when are they paying their fair share?The top 5% may pay 40% of the taxes but they also hold over 60% of the net wealth. Compare to the lowest 20% which are in the red. Not to mention the non-monetary political and social clout that comes with being super-rich.

In any case, violence or murder is certainly not a central tenant of communism. Take the USSR, by the time the regime was committing its most heinous crimes, the revolutionary era had come and gone by decades--what is the marxist justification for political purges? Forced famine? Gulags? permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy do statists get so offended when we call them statists?  by  spatchcockin  Anarcho_Capitalism[+]NSojac 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agobut do not identify the abstract causes that underlie them.Really, I was about to reply to another post saying the same thing about anarcho-capitalists: that they correctly identify the state as a point of threat but do not explore where or how the state gets its power. Many anarchists have indeed done this and their answer is the accumulation of capital, specifically private property. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf anyone ever needs to be reminded that communism is fucking insane take a look at this, the rules and guidelines of /r/communism.  by  WeaselSpankin  Anarcho_Capitalism[+]NSojac 6 points7 points8 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 6 points7 points8 points 12 days agoI would hope that a self-proclaimed anarchist would be a little more sensitive to fallacies such as these--the left-authoritarian regimes are no more an indictment of communist philosophy than the slave trade is of market economies. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf anyone ever needs to be reminded that communism is fucking insane take a look at this, the rules and guidelines of /r/communism.  by  WeaselSpankin  Anarcho_Capitalism[+]NSojac 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]NSojac 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agoI guess it is really anecdotal. I for one have had the exact opposite experience, most attempting to change social norms through education rather than with hamfisted government actions. It's also probably not a coincidence that the vast majority of people are statists--and so any subgroup of people that aren't explicitly anti-statist are likely to be composed of mostly statists. permalinksavecontextfull comments100 years ago, these same fields, these prairies, were home to 300 species of plants, 60 mammals, 300 birds, hundreds and hundreds of insects.
