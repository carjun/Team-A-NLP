Most gun crime is gang related. Mass shootings account for about  50 murders per year in the US, out of 12,000 murders. So mass shootings account for 0.4% of murders.Addressing 0.4% of gun crime makes no real sense. What we should address is reason for the majority of gun crime that no one talks about. No one talks about it when black people kill other black people by the thousands in cities like Chicago.Murders are at the lowest rate they've been in American history. We just have a much better way to hear about them fast in the past 20 years.Anyways, if you want to have a conversation about gun laws, I'm all ears.permalinksaveparent[+]Oatybar 21 points22 points23 points 1 hour ago (5 children)[]Oatybar 21 points22 points23 points 1 hour agoI'm amazed that the talk after these events is always about guns and rarely about mental illness. permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 21 points22 points23 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 21 points22 points23 points 1 hour agoI have a feeling that America's health care system is more at blame than America's gun culture.If we had a different culture, one that was more caring, and took care of people's health, and didn't make fun of people with mental illnesses, didn't ostracize them, I think we'd be in a much better place.So many people are afraid of seeking mental health care because they don't want to be labeled as "crazy". It sucks.permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 4 points5 points6 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)[]Cylinsier 4 points5 points6 points 59 minutes agoThe sooner people start to recognize and accept this, the sooner we will start to actually solve the problem.  Shootings like this are just one branch on the tree of consequences of mental health stigmatization in our society.  The culture around it needs to change.  It's still difficult for a lot of people to get insurance that will cover mental health, even through employers, for example.  That's just unacceptable.  permalinksaveparent[+]Yossarian33 -1 points0 points1 point 44 minutes ago (0 children)[]Yossarian33 -1 points0 points1 point 44 minutes agoBut providing health care to everyone doesn't seem to be very popular among gun enthusiasts who are often right-leaning. Personal liberty logic leads to believing that these people deserve to be ill and deserve to take care of it themselves, and that good people who aren't ill shouldn't be forced to pay taxes to help the mentally ill.Even in Canada, mental health is just brushed off to the side.permalinksaveparent[+]soline 0 points1 point2 points 43 minutes ago (0 children)[]soline 0 points1 point2 points 43 minutes agoSometimes they are not mentally ill.

No one reports it.Edit: just to give some stats, the FBI says that there were 14,000 murders in 2011.1800 were stabbed to death. No one talks about the "knife culture" in the US.800 people were killed with fists last year, no one talks about "fisting culture" wait a minute. Anyways. http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-713,000 people were stabbed in the UK last year, why doesn't anyone talk about the UKs horrible crime rate. Maybe its their knifing culture.permalinksaveparent[+]Tokukachi 7 points8 points9 points 54 minutes ago (6 children)[]Tokukachi 7 points8 points9 points 54 minutes ago13,000 people were stabbed in the UK last year, why doesn't anyone talk about the UKs horrible crime rate. Maybe its their knifing culture.NHS data suggests there were 4,490 people admitted to English hospitals in 2011/12 due to assault by a sharp object.No need to make stuff up. Also we've had one school shooting/rampage in the UK, ever and the guy should never have been allowed handguns in the first place as he should have failed the background check.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 48 minutes ago (5 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 48 minutes agoI was going from this: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/14000-knife-victims-a-year-860857.htmlWasn't making things up.permalinksaveparent[+]Tokukachi 1 point2 points3 points 45 minutes ago (4 children)[]Tokukachi 1 point2 points3 points 45 minutes agoAhh ok, Well you did say last year, hence why I was calling BS, but for 2007/08 you are correct :)permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 44 minutes ago (3 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 44 minutes agoThat's great news. Looks like the UK, and the US are both having good drops in violent crime.permalinksaveparent[+]Tokukachi 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes ago (2 children)[]Tokukachi 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes agoIndeed. Interestingly since that article we've changed the law so you have to be 18 to buy knives (from 16) and need ID. I can't tell you if thats the reason for the drop though.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 38 minutes ago (1 child)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 38 minutes agoInteresting. Why wouldn't they just take a kitchen knife or something, though?permalinksaveparent[+]Tokukachi 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes ago (0 children)[]Tokukachi 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes agoWell I guess that probably accounts for the majority of under 18's who stab someone, but your also far less likely to carry a kitchen knife around if your not going out with intent than some kind of folder.permalinksaveparent[+]RogerShakenbak 26 points27 points28 points 1 hour ago (7 children)[]RogerShakenbak 26 points27 points28 points 1 hour agoWe should ban assault knives.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 14 points15 points16 points 1 hour ago (5 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 14 points15 points16 points 1 hour agoBan knives with a pistol grip and an adjustable stock?http://i.imgur.com/e38rF.jpgpermalinksaveparent[+]RogerShakenbak 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]RogerShakenbak 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoI don't want to share a sidewalk with someone that has a loaded knife. permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]dieselgeek 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoIs that the shoulder thing that goes up? permalinksaveparent[+]Secretary_Not_Sure 0 points1 point2 points 34 minutes ago (0 children)[]Secretary_Not_Sure 0 points1 point2 points 34 minutes agoit's a heat seaking incindiary barrel shroudpermalinksaveparent[+]LeftyNS 0 points1 point2 points 47 minutes ago (1 child)[]LeftyNS 0 points1 point2 points 47 minutes agoWait, what's the trigger for?permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 43 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 43 minutes agoLaunching the knife.permalinksaveparent[+]boogerboy72 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]boogerboy72 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agowith shoulder things that go up.permalinksaveparent[+]tatch 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (4 children)[]tatch 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoThere were less than 300 people stabbed to death in the UK last year, a lower rate than the US, despite the famed "knife culture"permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist -1 points0 points1 point 59 minutes ago (3 children)[]Butthole_Scientist -1 points0 points1 point 59 minutes agoActually, the UK has slightly more or about the same stabbing deaths, given that the US has  5 times the population of the UK..

I'd much rather be shot in the chest with a 9mm than stabbed in the chest with a chef's knife.Knives are more concealable than guns, they're quieter, and they're very deadly.The best defense against guns and knives is to run as fast as you can. permalinksaveparent[+]beatyatoit 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]beatyatoit 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agocan't calm down.  I have a two yr old son and this shit is incomprehensible.  Yes knives are deadly but to insinuate that they are as deadly as guns in terms of the number of people you can kill quickly and indiscriminately is ludicrous.  btw the kid and adults who died as a result of this shooters random firing don't give a damn about the fact that 70% of shooting victims survive   permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]Butthole_Scientist 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoGuns are obviously easier to kill people with than knifes, no argument from me there.permalinksaveparent[+]Arnold_Horshack 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Arnold_Horshack 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoAlso guns distance the shooter from the violence, it is just a trigger pull, as opposed to actually stabbing somebody...permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoYou can get killed so fast with a knife.  Knives are pretty scary, it does not take much to understand how to use one.

If, as I suspect, guns are significantly more effective at killing and severely wounding people than knives, then it would make sense to focus more on the more dangerous weapon type.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes agoThe survival rate for people shot with handguns is about 70%.I'm not sure what it is for stabbings.permalinksaveparent[+]xChrisk 1 point2 points3 points 55 minutes ago (1 child)[]xChrisk 1 point2 points3 points 55 minutes agoI'm not interested in arguing with you about something that neither of us has the ability to fix. However, I think it should be pointed out that you stated in the parent comment that there are "about 12,000" murders annually. This is not accurate.You've also linked to a table that supposedly supports your claim of an abundance of knife murders in this country. However, the table actually shows 67.7% of murders involve firearms and only 13.4% of murders involve knives. Moreover, that's not what the term "Gun Culture" even refers to.Perhaps I'm just missing your sarcasm.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes agoAh, sorry.

It's just a whole lot easier to kill more people.  All some people want is reasonable laws to regulate them. No one needs an assault rifle to shoot a fucking deer, and your hand gun isn't going to protect you against a government with tanks and F15s.Oh, and in the U.K. there were 39 gun deaths last year.  39 - do you really fucking believe if they had more guns there would be fewer deaths?permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 58 seconds ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 58 seconds agoNo one has been killed with a legally owned assault rifle, ever.permalinksaveparent[+]coolhand83 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]coolhand83 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoBecause it's not as bad as you make it sound? 13,000 GBH and ABH offences involving a sharp object which would include bottles, glasses, keys, syringes etc... and of that there were 214 homicides.  The homicide rate by Knives or cutting instruments in the USA for 2000-2008 was 13%, For the same period in the UK it was less than 7%   (Page 69)The homicide rate in the USA is nearly 4 times what it is in the UK, and the rate for gun related deaths is 9 (per 100,000) for the USA and for the UK it's 0.22 per 100,000. Maybe it's their murder culture?

The shooters do not think of themselves as terrorists, but the public reacts to them as if they are. There are gang shootings on the 11pm news every night, and I don't notice much, because I'm not in the "bad" part of town, and I'm not in a gang. There are domestic shootings on the news all the time, and I don't notice much, because my spouse is mentally healthy and we have a good relationship. A shooting in a school or movie theater really rattles us because it seems random, and it makes people afraid to just be out and about. You are of course correct about the statistics, but I think the idea of anyone becoming a victim in the "safe" part of town while doing normal things and without apparent motive is really harming the emotional state of our country.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoYep.

People who intend on killing are going to kill regardless. Sometimes guns do make it easier and increase the amount of damage a single person could have done otherwise however. I don't think people should lose their guns but more security would be nice. At the very least people shouldn't own automatic weapons or if they do they should have extensive background testing and mental health evaluations. permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 57 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 57 minutes agopeople shouldn't own automatic weapons or if they do they should have extensive background testingThat has been the standard in the US since 1934... Machine guns were restricted heavily after that period, and effectively banned in 1986. (Hughes amendment) Also, no legally purchased machine gun or automatic weapon has been used in any murders in over 20 years, with a total of 2 murders with legally purchased automatic weapons since 1934.Americans can still buy automatic weapons that were created before 1986, but a tax of $200 must be paid, and 9-14 months waiting period for extensive background checking, and the guns themselves cost $10,000 or more.permalinksaveparent[+]xole 1 point2 points3 points 57 minutes ago (1 child)[]xole 1 point2 points3 points 57 minutes agoGang violence is mostly against other gang members.
