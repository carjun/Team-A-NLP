Our rule with books that have become movies is that she can see the movie but she has to read the book first - not the other way around. What's your opinion on this? Have movies ruined books for you?  by  andpartwaybackin  books[+]x7leafcloverx -1 points0 points1 point 28 days ago (0 children)[]x7leafcloverx -1 points0 points1 point 28 days agoThat's a fantastic rule, upvote  for being a great parent. Reading is essential to cultivate a smart, imaginative, intuitive child among other things, so to help them understand and appreciate literature without being mindless plopped in front of a screen that generally  bares no cognitive substance, is key. A great author I grew up LOVING is Brian Jacques and his "Redwall" series. I still collect these books whenever he releases a new one and I hope to someday be able to pass then  onto my child.permalinksavecontextfull commentsfriend under a street lamp. [composition][everything]  by  OneLegAtATimein  photocritique[+]x7leafcloverx 0 points1 point2 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]x7leafcloverx 0 points1 point2 points 28 days agoI'm going to agree with the others. I love the contrast but its a little close to  the edge. I think with specific application like you're using it for the desktop is good but by itself its weak. This might work well in a diptic or triptic, otherwise try shifting it so it sits about a third of the way into the frame, it will feel less crowded and applying the "rule of thirds" is naturally more pleasing to the eye.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey r/LucidDreaming, Here is a Comic I made about a reoccurring LD I have.
