Although it would be surprising if Finland had as many shootings as the USA. I accept that the USA has the worst problem with this stuff, but it's hardly a black-and-white issue where one culture is sick and the other is well.permalinksaveparent[+]Delheru 3 points4 points5 points 22 minutes ago (1 child)[]Delheru 3 points4 points5 points 22 minutes agoAs a Finn, I'm fairly certain we have more of these than you do adjusted for population. Finland has really rather good health care services, though perhaps the cultural attitude towards mental illness is not always healthy (huge levels of anger can be considered good, in a 'sisu' type of way... dark side is fine as long as you channel it to productivity, if you will).Few points:1. US has roughly 60x Finlands population.2. Finland had a school shooting in 2008 at Kauhajoki3. Finland had a school shooting in 2007 at Jokela      So in the last 5 years, Finland has had 2 shootings. Adjusted to population the US should have had 120 school shooting in the past 5 years, or 2 school shootings every month.I dunno if you picked Finland at random, but it was a very bad choice of example of a place that has it better in this regard than the US.permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 19 minutes agoWith all due respect, you merely misunderstood my point. My point was that Finland was smaller than the USA, so it makes sense that they have fewer absolute shootings -- it would be truly bizarre if a country the size of Finland had more shooting that the USA. And I chose Finland not at random, but for exactly the reasons you say and the numbers you cite. In absolute numbers the USA is far worse, but in a relative sense, according to its population, it's shockingly similar. This highlights the fact that, while the USA has the worst problem with this stuff, it's also a larger country and that is a small part of what leads to more incidents as an absolute number.permalinksaveparent[+]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (2 children)[]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoAmerican culture isn't sick, but the gun laws are ridiculous over there.People will say "Oh but if guns were illegal criminals still would have gotten them". True, but if you make guns so easy to get a hold of, insane people who otherwise wouldn't have made the effort will do disgusting shit like this.permalinksaveparent[+]smacbeats 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (1 child)[]smacbeats 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoThey're also incredibly easy to get a hold of on the black market. I could probably get an AK-47 in my hands by the time the day is over. I could also construct a working bomb powerful enough to kill a dozen people using freely available information on the internet and materials you can buy at a store.permalinksaveparent[+]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes agoI don't know what to about this problem, but I just don't get how people could be in favour of guns being legal. How many people have to die before something actually changes?permalinksaveparent[+]NSojac 15 points16 points17 points 45 minutes ago*(3 children)[]NSojac 15 points16 points17 points 45 minutes ago*Seems like the US has one of these every six months or so. Even taking Europe as a whole, does it happen as often as it does here? permalinksaveparent[+]Delheru 2 points3 points4 points 26 minutes ago (0 children)[]Delheru 2 points3 points4 points 26 minutes agoI think it does. Finland alone has had a few in the past decade, which puts it at a significantly faster pace than the USA is on (when adjusted for population).permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 5 points6 points7 points 36 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto 5 points6 points7 points 36 minutes agoI didn't comment on frequency, did I?Yes, it happens far, far, far more often in the USA -- and that's something Americans need to accept. However, acting like other cultures don't have the same sickness to some degree indicates someone who's making more of a nationalistic (or, in this case, anti-nationalistic -- being against the USA and China) rather than a substantive/interesting one. This madness exists in all cultures, the USA has variables that put them high on the continuum of this particular problemIt makes sense to accept it as a broadly human problem which the USA struggles with the most at the current time, rather than a strictly American/Chinese culture problem, which it plainly isn't.permalinksaveparent[+]linkybaa 4 points5 points6 points 38 minutes ago (0 children)[]linkybaa 4 points5 points6 points 38 minutes agoNo. permalinksaveparent[+]bonkosaurus 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes ago (1 child)[]bonkosaurus 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes agoWhen did Sweden have a school shooting...?I honestly can't recall one.permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 28 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 28 minutes agoIt had one, but going back I misremembered the circumstances surrounding that shooting (Bromma, 2001). While it was a shooting a school, it was more of a personal incident rather than what I think most people consider to be a "school shooting". Although if you're going to take that off, a lot of the American school shootings would also be taken off, as they are more personal issues where one person shoots one other person, rather than the broader and more random horror of what we've seen today.permalinksaveparent[+]davidmcw -2 points-1 points0 points 26 minutes ago (2 children)[]davidmcw -2 points-1 points0 points 26 minutes agoAfter the Dunblane shooting there was no more public ownership of guns, plain and fucking simple....permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 1 point2 points3 points 23 minutes ago*(0 children)[]alphafemto 1 point2 points3 points 23 minutes ago*We have this Constitution, you see...so it's not so simple. 2/3rds of both houses of Congress, and then 3/4ths (!) of all state legislatures would have to be for getting rid of public ownership of guns, in a process that will span years. We can't make quick pivots on this policy at all based on certain events, it's literally not possible. So, it's a catastrophic situation, but we're kind of stuck since 99% of (non-gang related) American gun owners are law-abiding and want to keep their guns, and we have a shitty, broken, decimated system for figuring out who the 1% might be. I'd say the latter is the bigger problem, and weirdly the more solveable right now.permalinksaveparent[+]Lepple 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]Lepple 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes agoCompletely untrue.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
