I knew a bunch of kids from my high school for whom it was the same thing. And frankly, at the end of the day, they're both in DC and have access to the same opportunities in this city.

It's not like they are torturing them with endless questions. It's a relatively quick interview so the rest of the nation can get an understanding of what they went through.Is one quick interview going to really scar them for life?

Put it this way: more guns or fewer guns, a sociopath will find any means necessary to bring about violent harm.It's about the treatment and de-stigmatization of mental illness.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
