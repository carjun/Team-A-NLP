I can tell the difference between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean when it's written in their respective characters, but when it's written in phonetic latin alphabet, or when it's being spoken?  It's all the same.I can distinguish Mandarin sometimes due to the tonal nature of the language, but all the others are a mystery to me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]JayTS 12 points13 points14 points 32 minutes ago (0 children)[]JayTS 12 points13 points14 points 32 minutes agoSame.  I read so much fucked up shit online, I thought I lost the capacity to feel when these things happen beyond, "Dammit, there go more freedoms in the name of safety," or feeling sick by the media making a spectacle of the victims' grief.But this is making me sad and sick on a level I thought I had become desensitized to.  I'm awed and disgusted by some people's capacity for pure evil.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWatashi wa truck desu  by  Former_Mancin  funny[+]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes ago (0 children)[]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes agoMaybe if you know what Japanese sounds like.  All asian dialects sound the same to me, and I speak 3 languages.  Obviously none of them asian.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNYU student's documenting of US drone strikes reveals harrowing trend  by  dominicuin  news[+]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 49 minutes ago (0 children)[]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 49 minutes agoYou need to talk to more average German citizens.  They get plenty of undeserved blame still from the more historically ignorant people of the world.I have family that still lives in Germany.  I had relatives fight on both sides of World War II. None that were Nazi's, just standard German army.  I visited them this last May, it was really eye opening.  I saw the graves of great great uncles of mine who died in World War I and World War II.  Even talking about the Nazi's is taboo, at least as an American.  Most Germans seemed like they would love to just forget it ever happened, but also know how important it is to never forget so it doesn't get repeated.I just think that with how brazenly we claim to be a free and democratic country, that our grandkids will be perplexed how we could consistently vote back into power these crazy warmongering assholes who are killing thousands of innocent civilians to eliminate high profile terror suspects that practically no American has even heard of or is aware of.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBoth towns, mine and the team we played, are located on the Mississippi River in southeast Minnesota. Tonight was the first annual river city battle. The winner gets this bath rope to keep at their rink until the next season, both economies are based off the river.  by  cammel44in  sports[+]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWhat?  What do economies, the Mississippi River, and rope have to do with hockey?  Or are you in some sort of tug-of-war club that wears and sells hockey jerseys on the Mississippi?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWatashi wa truck desu  by  Former_Mancin  funny[+]JayTS 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago*(0 children)[]JayTS 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago*I'm impressed how many people knew the title was in Japanese.  I thought it was a really weird phonetic spelling of some English phrase that I wasn't understanding.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow is this NOT bigger news?  by  funsizek80in  WTF[+]JayTS 17 points18 points19 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]JayTS 17 points18 points19 points 2 hours agoI don't even know what the OP is about.

He recently found out where she worked and walked in homeless and on probation asking her for help. Convicted for beating his ex wife. I am losing my best friend of 10 years!!

If not, what do you suggest?  by  snail_boyin  malehairadvice[+]JayTS 3 points4 points5 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]JayTS 3 points4 points5 points 14 hours agoYeah, it looks much better from that side.  I think you still have some options other than buzzing.  Unfortunately I'm not a hairstylist, so I can't offer much inspiration, but hopefully someone else here can.  Either way, talking to a professional stylist can never hurt, they deal with hair for a living.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs it time to buzz it? If not, what do you suggest?  by  snail_boyin  malehairadvice[+]JayTS 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]JayTS 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours agoHow does it look from the other side? Your pictures is from the side of your part, so it looks extreme from that angle. I have a high hairline and when I part my hair like yours it looks like I'm receding, but almost every other angle it looks fine. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIWTL How to smile better  by  geekwalrusin  IWantToLearn[+]JayTS 3 points4 points5 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]JayTS 3 points4 points5 points 14 hours agoThe biggest thing that improved my picture smile was realizing when I smile naturally my top teeth don't touch the bottom, my mouth is slightly open.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBig East could disband as early as Friday.  by  TheBrohemianin  CFB[+]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoHahaha, I love that movie.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNYU student's documenting of US drone strikes reveals harrowing trend  by  dominicuin  news[+]JayTS 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]JayTS 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoAnd we're going to have to explain to our grandchildren one day how we could possibly let our "leaders" do all this evil shit in the name of "freedom".What a joke.  A really, really, fucked up, not even close to funny joke.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo, we'll fire up the fog machine and then we'll all run out of the fog onto the field.

I don't really listen to the radio, I just know that there's a really bad hip hop/r&b station near 97 here, and it's Big Boi and they were talking about the Falcons, so I assumed it was that one here.  Good call.permalinksavecontextfull comments30 for 30 about Bo Jackson re-airing tonight at 8 p.m. EST on ESPN2 - awesome documentary  by  mattjeastin  sports[+]JayTS 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]JayTS 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI never said I thought ratings equal quality. I said this was the highest rated documentary on ESPN. I also said I thought it was great and I highly recommend it. Just because one is fact and the other is my opinion does not mean I believe that one makes the other. permalinksavecontextfull comments30 for 30 about Bo Jackson re-airing tonight at 8 p.m. EST on ESPN2 - awesome documentary  by  mattjeastin  sports[+]JayTS 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]JayTS 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoTelevision ratings are determined by number of viewers, not your subjective enjoyment of the documentary.That being said, I thought it was a great documentary, but I'm also very biased as an Auburn alum.  I've been spending my whole life telling people how great of an athlete Bo was, and this documentary finally did it justice.  Everyone who didn't witness it thought I was grossly exaggerating his exploits.permalinksavecontextfull comments"Bitch, I voted for Gary Johnson" - Big Boi  by  Themothershipin  Libertarian[+]JayTS 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]JayTS 11 points12 points13 points 1 day agoConsidering this is Hot 97 in Atlanta, that actually is a decently high bar.Source:  I'm from Atlanta.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThank you Dr Tyson. :)  by  IStoleTheHiggsBosonin  funny[+]JayTS -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]JayTS -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day agoYep.  My dad's birthday is today.  He was born in '56, and today he turns 56, on 12/12/12.  It sounds cool, but there's nothing statistically or mathematically remarkable about that other than the repeating numbers.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAsheville, NC officer resigns after beating his child  by  puskunkin  Bad_Cop_No_Donut[+]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]JayTS 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI think it's really sad and telling about the state of our society when my first reaction on reading this was admiration for the officer for having the decency/shame to actually step down when his despicable behavior was revealed.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
