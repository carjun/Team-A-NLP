Victims: Lively Youngsters, Devoted AdultsBy By MATT SEDENSKY Associated PressDecember 16, 2012 (AP)This 2012 photo provided by the family shows Emilie Alice Parker, who was killed on Dec. 14, 2012, when a gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Conn., killing 26 children and adults at the school.  (Courtesy of the Parker Family/AP Photo)Most died at the very start of their young lives, tiny victims taken in a way not fit for anyone regardless of age. Others found their life's work in sheltering little ones, teaching them, caring for them, treating them as their own. After the gunfire ended Friday at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the trail of loss was more than many could bear: 20 students and six adults at the school, the gunman's mother at home, and the gunman himself.A glimpse of some of those who died:CHARLOTTE BACON, 6They were supposed to be for the holidays, but finally on Friday, after hearing much begging, Charlotte Bacon's mother relented and let her wear the new pink dress and boots to school.It was the last outfit the outgoing redhead would ever pick out. Charlotte's older brother, Guy, was also in the school but was not shot.Her parents, JoAnn and Joel, had lived in Newtown for four or five years, JoAnn's brother John Hagen, of Nisswa, Minn., told Newsday."She was going to go some places in this world," Hagen told the newspaper. "This little girl could light up the room for anyone."OLIVIA ENGEL, 6The images of Olivia Engel will live far beyond her short lifetime. There she is, visiting with Santa Claus, or feasting on a slice of birthday cake. There's the one of her swinging a pink baseball bat, and another posing on a boat. In some, she models a pretty white dress; in others, she makes a silly face.Courtesy of the Parker Family/AP PhotoThis 2012 photo provided by the family shows...

"She had perfect manners, perfect table manners. She was the teacher's pet, the line leader."On Friday, Merton said, she was simply excited to go to school and then return home and make a gingerbread house."Her only crime," he said, "is being a wiggly, smiley 6-year-old."DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, 47, principalDawn Hochsprung's pride in Sandy Hook Elementary was clear. She regularly tweeted photos from her time as principal there, giving indelible glimpses of life at a place now known for tragedy. Just this week, it was an image of fourth-graders rehearsing for their winter concert; days before that, the tiny hands of kindergartners exchanging play money at their makeshift grocery store.She viewed her school as a model, telling The Newtown Bee in 2010 that "I don't think you could find a more positive place to bring students to every day." She had worked to make Sandy Hook a place of safety, too, and in October, the 47-year-old Hochsprung shared a picture of the school's evacuation drill with the message "safety first." When the unthinkable came, she was ready to defend.Officials said she died while lunging at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him."She had an extremely likable style about her," said Gerald Stomski, first selectman of Woodbury, where Hochsprung lived and had taught. "She was an extremely charismatic principal while she was here."MADELEINE HSU, 6Dr. Matthew Velsmid was at Madeleine's house on Saturday, tending to her stricken family. He said the family did not want to comment.Velsmid said that after hearing of the shooting, he went to the triage area to provide medical assistance but there were no injuries to treat.1|2|3|4Next PageFollow @abcon Twitter, become a fan on FacebookComment & ContributeDo you have more information about this topic?
