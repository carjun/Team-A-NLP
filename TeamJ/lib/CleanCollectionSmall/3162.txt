The Twitter interface is now fixed and performance is improved. However, I still would like to see The Hill use the iOS Twitter interface than rolling their own.Some of the ads are slow in coming up, but I think that is a server issue and not one of the app. If The Hill is going to use add support for this app, then you need to improve the backend performance.A continuing issue: The right sidebar and the main page list is redundant. I would rather have the scrolling main page without the sidebar. Having more screen real estate would be a good idea. The right sidebar is fine on the internal content pages.I still love reading The Hill. The new improvements allows me to up its rating. I hope they will continue to improve!Customers Also BoughtNew York PostNewsView In iTunesThe Times of LondonNewsView In iTunesNewsweek PLNewsView In iTunesBuilder Magazine ReaderNewsView In iTunesWKSU for iPadNewsView In iTunesView In iTunesFreeCategory: NewsUpdated: May 11, 2012Version: 1.3.2Size: 1.7 MBLanguage: EnglishSeller: The Hill Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.Rated 4+Requirements: Compatible with iPad.
