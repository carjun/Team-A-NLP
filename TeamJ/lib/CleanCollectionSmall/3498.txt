He must have been a quiet kid, coming in, going out, she said. You get so many students, they come and go. Some speak with you, some are outstanding, some you remember for a long time. Some you barely remember when the semesters over.Lanza fit into that last category, she said.He never talked to me. He came in, sat down and left," she said.

At any rate, it'sprobably safe to say that there areno "sixteen virgins" waiting for this guyin heaven...or hell!areyou solame at 7:48 AM December 17, 2012                Everyone is shouting "gun control" but in this case the guns were legally purchased and registered. Seems that the mother's belief that her son was a safe gun owner is what allowed Adam to have access to them in the home (versus being locked up with a combo only the mother knew).My concern here is not with guns because with any killing device, people who want to get their hands on one, will. Legally or not.The issue is mental health care. If this kid was so off-balance for so many years, why didn't the parents get him the help that he needed?If they didn't notice he needed help, what about the other people in his life? Doctor? Teacher? Pastor/Rabbi?Neighbor?People are saying that the mother "did everything she could" to help him grow and progess, but hey--maybe her best wasn't good enough. Was she qualified to diagnose his issue/potential for harm?Probably not, that is why there are trained medical specialists...but people need to have the courage to USE them or they're of no value. What does the kids' regular doctor say? Isn't he partly culpable? Areparents ashamed for their kid to see a psychiatrist?You can tip off the DMV about an elderly person who seems to not be a danger at the wheel. Are thereprograms to tip off the authorities to someone's mental state? About someone potentiallyunsafe to be out and about in public?Orwellian, I know, but necessary?Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
