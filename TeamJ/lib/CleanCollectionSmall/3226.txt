Police say the gunman's mother was killed earlier in the day. The killer, Adam Lanza, 20, was found dead inside the school of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.In Colorado, Friday's shooting was a painful reminder for families still grieving from the Aurora movie theater killings less than six months ago."Until we get our acts together and stop making these ... weapons available, this is going to keep happening," said an angry Tom Teves, whose son Alex was killed in the theater shooting last July in Aurora.Teves was choked up as he answered a reporter's call Friday. One of his work associates lives in Newtown. The connection chilled and angered him.Tom Sullivan, whose son Alex also died in the Aurora theater shooting, welcomed a discussion about gun laws. Sullivan said mental health, not gun control, is a more pressing concern."We all need someone in our lives to care," Sullivan said. "If we see a friend, a colleague, a co-worker and they're having a hard time, we need to reach out."This week, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper generated a storm of debate after declaring it was time to start talking about gun control measures.After Friday's school shooting, Hickenlooper told reporters there's no use waiting until news coverage fades."We can't postpone the discussion on a national level every time there's a shooting. They're too often," he said.A visibly emotional President Obama seemed willing to renew debate, calling for "meaningful action" to prevent similar shootings.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an advocate of greater limits on guns, responded directly to the president's remarks: "Calling for 'meaningful action' is not enough. We need immediate action. We have heard all the rhetoric before."Also in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for a "crackdown" on firearms, calling the shooting "yet another senseless and horrific act of violence involving guns."Cuomo, a Democrat, said he hopes the shooting in Newtown spurs action.While the Connecticut massacre is prompting some to call for stricter gun laws to prevent shootings, one state is aiming to loosen its laws in the hopes of reducing violence.Less than 24 hours before the Newtown shooting, Michigan lawmakers passed legislation that allows those with concealed pistol licenses to carry guns into schools and other once-forbidden places.Proponents said if the bill is signed into law, it would give people the opportunity to respond to crimes and possibly stop a similar situation."This kind of tragedy is hard to process, but if one person ?? a faculty member or a parent ?? could legally carry, at least it could have limited some of the mayhem," said Rob Harris, media director for Michigan Open Carry Inc., on Friday. "This legislation has to be passed to at least have a fighting chance against the evil in this world."Senate Bill 59 tweaks the concealed weapons law by allowing gun owners who receive eight additional hours of training to carry their weapons in formerly gun-free areas, such as day care centers, schools, hospitals, churches, stadiums and bars.The bill states that schools, including public universities, and privately owned buildings could choose to prohibit guns if desired.Michigan Education Association officials said the tragedy reinforces a need for discussion on school safety and Senate Bill 59 is not the answer."Those who think that students and teachers will be safer with more guns in our schools are just plain wrong," said MEA President Steve Cook in a written statement. "Thinking that teachers should carry weapons and fire on threats is a recipe for even more death ?? not safety."It is unclear if Gov. Rick Snyder will sign the bill into law."The governor said that this bill was going to be already going through a careful review and analysis," said Snyder's spokeswoman, Sara Wurfel.Snyder conveyed deep condolences, thoughts and prayers to the victims, families and all those in Connecticut, Wurfel said.Mark Kelly, the astronaut husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head during an attack that killed six people in Tucson, Ariz., last year, weighed in on the Connecticut shooting, saying it should "sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right.""This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence," Kelly said on his Facebook page, calling for "a meaningful discussion about our gun laws and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America."Sean Graves, who as a student was wounded in Colorado's Columbine massacre in 1999, said he was "disgusted" by the shootings, but he didn't believe laws can prevent such violence.If people "want to find a way to harm people, they're going to find a way to do it," Graves said.Some shoppers interviewed at Oregon's Clackamas Town Center, where a gunman killed two people Tuesday before killing himself, expressed the need to pay attention to warning signs."We need to pay more attention to the people close to us, because I think there's a lot of signs prior to things," said shopper Sierra Delgado of Happy Valley, Ore.Mental health screenings alone aren't enough, other Colorado shooting survivors said.Tom Mauser, who became a gun control advocate after his son Daniel was killed at Columbine, urged officials to stop "playing defense" on gun control."Let's not say once again, 'Oh, this is not the right time to talk about it.' It is the right time to talk about it."We are better than a nation that has people killing children and has people cowardly shooting people in shopping malls and schools and nursing homes. We're better than this."Such emotional appeals didn't come only from gun control supporters. Friday's responses from both sides foretold a heart-wrenching debate."They're going to use the bodies of dead children to push their agenda," predicted Dudley Brown of the Denver group Rocky Mountain Gun Owners.Contributing to this report were Melanie Scott Dorsey, Detroit Free Press; Jon Campbell, Gannett; and Associated Press writers Brian Skoloff in Phoenix; Terrence Petty in Portland, Ore.; and P.
