I just thought it was weird how this wasn't inspired by him.Speaking of Gordon, I don't like him on his shows like Hells Kitchen or the like, I like him in his kitchen and other 'cooking' shows. He really does treat all of his workers like shit because apparently to be a good chef you need to be berated and stressed until you become the person doing all the yelling.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDry-aged, cast iron-seared, butter-basted prime porterhouse steak.
