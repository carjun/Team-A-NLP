CNN had previously identified the mother as Nancy Lanza, a teacher at the Sandy Hook Elementary, according to law enforcement sources.The source also told CNN there was no body found in the house searched by authorities in Hoboken, New Jersey. Two law enforcement sources say a man was taken away from questioning from that house. He is believed to be the brother of the shooter, according to the sources.The first law enforcement source says the school shooter was dressed in "black battle fatigues and a military vest."The Bushmaster .223 found at the scene is a semi automatic weapon, the source says. Two other weapons found were handguns, a Sig-Sauer and a Glock.permalinksave[+]reddixiecup 8 points9 points10 points 21 hours ago (6 children)[]reddixiecup 8 points9 points10 points 21 hours agoSo now it's back to she WASN'T in the school, again?permalinksaveparent[+]jhenryf626 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago (2 children)[]jhenryf626 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours agoI am just as confused as you are, however, I am just copying and pasting from press releases.

We haven't heard anything else about the father/brother/girlfriend in a while. I really wish the news wouldn't jump the gun and flip flop on all "breaking information" between clips of crying children being asked what happened.permalinksaveparent[+]FlimtotheFlam 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]FlimtotheFlam 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoI know the parents are divorced.

This is some shitty reporting.permalinksaveparent[+]jhenryf626 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours ago*(0 children)[]jhenryf626 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours ago*No she is listed as a teacher at the school. Personally what I am thinking (completely speculation) is that something engaged him enough this morning to kill his mother AT HOME, and then he was still so full of rage that he went and took it out on her class at school. TOTAL GUESS on my part. Guess we will see as new info comes out.Edit: But she defiantly is a teacher at the school.permalinksaveparent[+]StormShadow13 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (7 children)[]StormShadow13 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoIf his mother wasn't there why would they even let him in?  News reports say that you have to be buzzed into the school.permalinksaveparent[+]tekkou 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours ago (1 child)[]tekkou 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours agoCNN reported a little while ago that before 0930, anyone can come and go from the school.  After 0930 is when the buzz-in happens.permalinksaveparent[+]StormShadow13 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]StormShadow13 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoThat part I never heard, thanks for letting me know.permalinksaveparent[+]HatboxFleck 6 points7 points8 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]HatboxFleck 6 points7 points8 points 20 hours agonews reports have been wrong all day.permalinksaveparent[+]jhenryf626 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (3 children)[]jhenryf626 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoWould you say no to a man with 3 guns pointed at your face? Also consider that he simply walked/climbed in without the use of a vehicle.permalinksaveparent[+]StormShadow13 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (1 child)[]StormShadow13 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoMe reading that you have to be buzzed into the school takes it as they have a camera that they can see people at the door and they push a button to unlock it.  permalinksaveparent[+]jhenryf626 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]jhenryf626 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoAt a public school where hundreds if not thousands of people enter and leave each week? Extremely unlikely.Edit: As a current high school student, the most security entry procedure that I have ever seen/heard of is a sign that says, "All visitors must report and sign into the front office". It's an elementary school. They have hundreds of parents that walk through those doors every single day. No way in earth that someone has to look at every single one through a camera to be admitted.permalinksaveparent[+]jonconley 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]jonconley 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoIf the no stopped/delayed him from entering an elementary school, the choice should be obvious.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
