Dianne Feinstein said Sunday she will introduce a bill to reinstate the federal ban on assault weapons on the first day of the new Congress next year, as gun-control advocates ramp up pressure on President Obama to tackle the issue in the wake of the shootings in Newtown, Conn., on Friday.The shooting deaths of 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary school, including 20 young children, now could force Mr. Obama to tackle an issue that was largely on the sidelines during his first term in office as he dealt with an anemic economy, perpetual overseas tumult and a bruising battle to push his health care overhaul through Congress.It will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession, not retroactively, but prospectively, Mrs. Feinstein, California Democrat, said on NBCs Meet the Press. We exempt over 900 specific weapons that will not fall under the bill. But the purpose of this bill is to get  weapons of war off the streets.I think America is ready, she said, adding that she believes Mr. Obama will speak out on the bill.The president, who was scheduled to speak in Newtown on Sunday evening, said in his weekly address Saturday that we have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this. Regardless of the politics.Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, New York Democrat, said there is only so much the president can do individually  but he can use the heft of his position to lean on Congress, as President Clinton did with the assault weapons ban of 1994.The heavy lifting is going to have to come from Congress, and it will, but if hes willing to use the bully pulpit, he can actually help us, Mrs. McCarthy said on CNNs State of the Union. President Clinton did that. It was a tough struggle, but he got it through, and for some reason  and I personally feel because there were so many children involved  the attitudes of the American people are a little bit different than they were before Friday.Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman, Connecticut independent, and Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, both said on Fox News Sunday they supported reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons, which took effect in 1994 and lapsed in 2004. Other Democratic Connecticut politicians, such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen.-elect Chris Murphy, said that action must be taken soon, but they were focused on the victims families in the immediate future.Gun-control advocacy groups are now pushing Mr. Obama  hard  to pursue specific policy in the wake of the shootings.After todays horror, Americans must demand immediate action by our President and Congress to reform our gun laws, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence said in a statement after the event. We expect President Obama  as a man who has seen first-hand the devastation that gun violence inflicts on families and communities during his time as a volunteer in Chicago  to be a leader in this process and to speak out boldly and directly.Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group co-chaired by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has launched an online petition to demand a plan from Mr. Obama and Congress to end gun violence.Mr. Bloomberg said on NBCs Meet the Press the issue should be Mr. Obamas number-one agenda.Hes the president of the United States, and if he does nothing during his second term, something like 48,000 Americans will be killed with illegal guns, Mr. Bloomberg said. That is roughly the number of Americans killed in the whole Vietnam War.A petition on the White House website to immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress already has gotten more than 120,000 signatures since Friday. The White House must respond to petitions that get at least 25,000 signatures in 30 days.Gun-rights advocates, meanwhile, say that if people in the school had been armed, the violence might have been mitigated.Story Continues View Entire Story previous12next  Copyright 2012 The Washington Times, LLC.
