Different situations and different levels of threats.permalinksaveparent[+]cavehobbit 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (7 children)[]cavehobbit 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoInteresting. I worked jobs in retail and delivery, some in very shady places, and also went partying in NYC in some questionable areas, all over the course of 20-25 years during the 80's and 90's, and never was threatened by someone with a gun. Even during a robbery at a store, and a threatened muggingSome of us just attract more trouble than otherspermalinksaveparent[+]filmfiend999 -1 points0 points1 point 59 minutes ago (6 children)[]filmfiend999 -1 points0 points1 point 59 minutes agoI don't know what you're implying, since you have absolutely no idea who I am or what situations they were...permalinksaveparent[+]cavehobbit 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes ago (5 children)[]cavehobbit 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes agoNot implying anything. I am just surprised when I hear someone say they have been threatened by guns that often, when my experience says it doesn't happen often at all. As I said, some of us just attract it maybe. Maybe you work in a particularly dangerous place. I do not know.permalinksaveparent[+]filmfiend999 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes ago (4 children)[]filmfiend999 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes agoSorry... sensitive subject, cavehobbit.  I work in politics, and sometimes I have to canvass.  Knock on doors, so there's four times right there.  One jealous ex-boyfriend that wouldn't leave my SO at the time alone.  One home invasion, two people, each armed.permalinksaveparent[+]cavehobbit -1 points0 points1 point 27 minutes ago (3 children)[]cavehobbit -1 points0 points1 point 27 minutes agoAH, got ya. I've done a little canvassing, but in suburbia where people are not so aggressive. Though in some areas I can understand that happening.permalinksaveparent[+]filmfiend999 0 points1 point2 points 24 minutes ago (2 children)[]filmfiend999 0 points1 point2 points 24 minutes agoIt only happened in suburbia, aside from once in Clearwater, FL.  Three times in NY, once upstate, twice in Long Island.permalinksaveparent[+]cavehobbit -1 points0 points1 point 20 minutes ago (1 child)[]cavehobbit -1 points0 points1 point 20 minutes agoUpstate NY is the kind of area I would think it might happen in, and FL, well....Bu L.I.? that is a little surprising, unless you mean near LIC, which has some bad areas.I did mine in suburban NJ. The most you get is cursed out.permalinksaveparent[+]filmfiend999 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]filmfiend999 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes agoMaybe it's because I would tower over a cavehobbit....;)permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
