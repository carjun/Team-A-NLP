He was a big guy, but SUPER athletic and could jump out of the gym.  He always played with a group of his boys who would just basically throw the ball up for him to dunk.  He was a grade-A asshole though, and he called b*tch fouls.Lennox Lewis didn't play, but shot around once.  This was before he was really big, but he was a super nice guy.Cris Carter is pretty f*cking good at basketball.  Super fast, and has some hops.Most of the NBA guys didn't try to dunk except on breakaways, but don't stand near the basket if Brent Barry is on the other team.  That mofo can JUMP and will put you on a poster.Of note: none of the NBA guys really called any fouls.  If you called one for them, they'd take it, but for the most part if you hacked at one, they'd eat the foul.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsHas anyone ever scored on a future NBA player?  by  musical_stampedein  nba[+]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoThis was 95-99...during the time Tim Hardaway Sr. played for the Heat.  I'm not surprised Tim Jr. plays there.  His high school is right down the street from UM's campus.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHas anyone ever scored on a future NBA player?  by  musical_stampedein  nba[+]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago*A lot of pro athletes used to come to my college gym (U.Miami) to play pick up, or shoot around.  I've personally scored against 2: Tim Hardaway and Bob Sura.  I had the misfortune of guarding Tim in a pickup game.  Holy sh*t man, all I can say is 1) he was ungodly fast 2) he was STRONG and solid for such a little guy, and 3) his handles were out of this world...like the ball was on a rope.  He got to the hole anytime he wanted, and scored even with 2 or 3 guys hanging onto him, but luckily for me he was mostly content to either dish the ball to someone else, or jack up a long 3.  He nailed a 3 with my hand in his face.  As I dribbled back down the court he backed off and gave me a little room, and I just raised up and nailed a top of the key 3.  He said "Nice shot", then proceeded to dribble the entire way down the court past me and the other 4 defenders for an easy layup.Plenty of other guys came through the U when I was there.  If you went to summer school, there was a regular afternoon game with our NCAA guys and NBA-ers who happened to be in town.  I watched more than I participated, but I can share some random thoughts about a few guys if anyone cares.Jordan and Pippen have come together, but they always shut the gym down when those 2 showed up :(permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho is one player you'll never hate, no matter what team they play for?  by  thedouglerrin  soccer[+]thedeacon -2 points-1 points0 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]thedeacon -2 points-1 points0 points 14 days agoNigel de JongNaniKakapermalinksavecontextfull commentsOdd question about homes in Miami/Kendall area  by  jettnoirin  Miami[+]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 14 days agoSabal Chase in Kendall has gas stoves.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBest song in any FIFA ever?  by  xanderdagr8in  EA_FIFA[+]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoMost catchy = Buraka Som Sistema - Kalemba (Wegue Wegue) I had WEGUE WEGUE WEGUE stuck in my head all through Fifa10 :(permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan Miami become the hub for Latin American startups  by  1amongthefencein  Miami[+]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoHere's the problem: all the other 'tech hubs' (Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, New York City and Boston) either already have talent, or have top notch schools churning out talent.I love Miami and I'm a UM grad, but our pool of technology professionals is lacking compared to those other cities.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow much do software developers make in South Florida?  by  double_snapin  Miami[+]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago*(0 children)[]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago*There's a smaller tech market here than in DC, but there are still decent paying jobs in S FL if you know the right technologies.  Finding a decent paying company is one thing.There is also a smaller pool of qualified talent here, so if you have general experience in C# or enterprise Java, you should be able to find a contract for around $50/hr, or a FT job around $85k+.  Senior/architect level experience will push you above $100k.I know in my area (enterprise java), the usual suspects for FT jobs are: Interval Int'l, Assurant, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Tracfone Wireless, Avocent, Bayview Financial, Florida Blue, World Fuel, Univ of Miami. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI have a fellow redditor in my neighborhood!  by  live_in_personin  Miami[+]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]thedeacon 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoReally?
