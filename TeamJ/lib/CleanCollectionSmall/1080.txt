Paul Vance says that staff and students at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown are among the victims of a school shooting. Vance also says the shooter was dead in the school. (Dec. 14)By Michael Muskal, Tina Susman and Richard A. SerranoDecember 14, 2012, 3:47 p.m.NEWTOWN, Conn. -- A gunman wearing a bullet-proof vest and toting several weapons stormed through two rooms of a suburban Connecticut elementary school on Friday, firing at staffers and pupils and killing at least 20 children before apparently turning a gun on himself.Law enforcement officials spent the day trying to sort through the deadly trail left by the gunman, tentatively identified as Adam Lanza, 20.The investigation included a secondary crime scene in Connecticut and searches in New Jersey where Lanza and his relatives had lived. Lanza's brother, Ryan, who had originally been identified as the gunman, was being questioned by police. Officials later said Ryan Lanza was not believed to be involved in the shootings.AlsoPhotos:Massacre at elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Who they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsFULL COVERAGE: Connecticut school shootingBy late in the day, Connecticut State Police spokesman Paul Vance said at a televised news conference that the number of deaths overall stood at 28. One person was injured.The victims included 18 children and six adults pronounced dead at the school and two pupils pronounced dead at hospitals. The gunman, who was found dead at the school, and another person dead at the secondary crime scene brought the number of bodies to 28, the deadliest school attack since the 2007 rampage at Virginia Tech.But unlike the Virginia Tech rampage, during which 33 people including the gunman died, the Connecticut shootings were at an elementary school where pupils ranged from kindergarten to fourth grade.The youth of the victims tugged at the nation, which was led in mourning by President Obama.We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years, and each time I hear the news, I react not as a president but as everybody else would, as a parent, Obama said, wiping tears from his eyes during a televised appearance at the White House. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do.Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost, he told the nation. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early and there is no way to ease their pain.Until the terror began unfolding, it had been a typical Friday in this picturesque, bucolic town of rambling Victorian-style homes. Newtown, about 60 miles from New York City, is part of Fairfield County in western Connecticut. There's a giant tree decked out in holiday blue lights at the entrance to the town and many homes are displaying wreaths and festive lights."Evil visited this community today," Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said at an evening news conference. "It's too early to speak of recovery."A fifth-grade teacher who gave her name only as Dina, said earlier, Newtown is "such a tight-knit community. Everybody knows everybody and it's such a shock. This is the hardest day of my career."About 9:30 a.m, the gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School, where sources said he had a confrontation with a school official. Then the gunman opened fire in just one section of the school, two rooms, police spokesman Vance said at one of his news conferences later in the day.A third-grader named Alexis told CNN she looked out the window, spotted police officers and heard footsteps on the school roof. Some of the students were so upset, she said, they got a stomachache.A fourth-grade boy was in the gym when he heard pops and bangs. We thought it was the custodian knocking stuff down, he told CNN. We heard screaming  and then the police came in and said, Is he in here?The children were herded into a gym closet, the fourth-grader said, and huddled there until police told them it was safe to leave.The first calls went out to police by 9:40 a.m. and hundreds of officers from the town police, state police and others responded, authorities said. They began a painstaking search through the building, room by room.Panicked parents were caught on camera racing to the school and filling the parking lot as some children were escorted through the line. Children placed their hands on each other's shoulders, keeping in a tight formation.The earliest reports indicated just a few fatalities, but Danbury Mayor Mark D. Boughton signaled to reporters that the disaster was much worse than that. There had been multiple fatalities, he told television viewers, then declined to give details.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Times12next|  single pageComments96Comments (96)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQfoodguy2 at 9:35 PM December 14, 2012                My condolences to all the families effected by this horrific tragedy.Unfortunately such acts will continue within our nation because are laws are weak and do not address suicidal and homicidal individuals. It should be noted that Connecticut already has strict gun control laws.In California where I reside Welfare and Institute code 5150 allows the government (police) to detain persons of mental illnesses who are an immediate danger to themselves and others (the Community) for ONLY 72 hours for a psychological evaluation and treatment at a hospital. Unfortunately we have many individuals that pose a danger to themselves and others for a longer period of time than 72 hours.Until Californias 5150 w.i.c. law, and such similar laws in other states, are corrected with longer detention periods for medical treatment, of individuals that pose an immediate threats to themselves and others where these individuals can receive the treatment they need these tragedies will continue.Gun control laws alone will not deal with suicidal and homicidal individuals. When these welfare and institution laws are corrected then along with reasonable and fair gun control laws that limit the sale of guns to mentally ill individuals along with extensive background checks will work.Stevie Noho at 8:41 PM December 14, 2012                DO Something to..Protect your Children! Melt all the guns and build cars in Detroit and sell them to help the economy.... OR Use the Military, NRA activists, Veterans, ex Cops, parent groups to arm themselves and patrol the schoolyards, malls, and public areas so that if someone wants to go out in a blaze of Glory in a suicide... they can do it on the OUTSIDE of the building.. But DO something to protect your children DodgerBlue63 at 8:28 PM December 14, 2012                I'm not going to suggest we should repeal the 2nd amendment, I believe responsible adults should have the right to bear arms, but let's be honest: semi-automatic weapons serve no redeeming purpose in our society. Noreasonable person canstate a valid case otherwise. If not ban them outright, then make it much, much more difficult to obtain them. The fact that this sick a-hole was able to get his hands on weapons like that so easily isa problem that needs to be addressed.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
