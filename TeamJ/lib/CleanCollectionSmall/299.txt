Speaking at a press conference earlier, Lt Paul Vance said: Our investigators at the crime scene did produce some very good evidence   in this investigation that our investigators will be able to use in   hopefully painting the complete picture as to how and more importantly why   this occurred.17.45 (12.45) CNN is reporting Lanza had six guns - three more   than previously thought. It is believed he used three at school including a   Bushmaster assault rifle, while police have now found three more rifles at   the second crime scene. 17.25 (12.25) A moving photo of some of the first responders from   Connecticut state police at the scene: 17.10 (12.10) NBC are reporting that there was allegedly an altercation   between Lanza and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School the day before the   shooting. Officials say Lanza was involved in an argument at the school which involved   himself and four other staff members. Of the four, three were murdered in   the shooting spree while the fourth was not at school yesterday and is now   being interviewed by federal and state investigators. Adam Lanza16.50 (11.50) Newtown students heard their principal's murder over the   school intercom, which gave them some time to hide, according to one young   girl talking to ABC. it is not known if the intercom was turned on by headteacher Hochsprung to   alert others in the school or whether it was turned on for morning   announcement. Either way, it caught the initial moments of the gunman's attack and gave   teachers and others life saving moments to lock their doors and try to hide   their children. Third grader Tori Chop said that she could hear her principal's final moments   as Lanza barged in with his weapons. "Yeah, yeah, she was crying. I thought she was screaming," Chop told "Good   Morning America." "That's what we heard over the loudspeaker. We   heard kids crying. "We kept hearing gun noises and 'put your hands up'we kept hearing that,"   said Chop. Victim Ana Marquez-Greene, 6 (Left) and principal Dawn Hochsprung (Right)16.16 (11.16) Lanza tried to purchase a rifle earlier this week at a   store in Danbury, Connecticut, according to NBC News. 16.12 (11.12) One 17 year-old boy called Jesse whose brother went to   school with Adam Lanza has just been interviewed by the BBC He said Lanza was "a social outcast", and "the kind of kid that   wouldn't talk to people about the things that happened to them. "I've heard he's very fidgety. He didn't seem like a kid who had a lot of   friends."He added that it was upsetting to hear that children he had previously babysat   for were killed in the shooting. He said many in the town had taken down Christmas decorations, as now was not   a time for celebration. 15.42 (10.42) We now have a transcript of radio traffic featuring   officers from Newtown police and fire department, and Connecticut state   police immediately after the shooting started. It becomes clear that, as the   police just confirmed, the suspect did force his way in to the school. 0935 Sandy Hook School.

Teacher Kaitlin Roig recounts her ordeal 15.20 (10.20) Lt Paul Vance says the suspect "was not voluntarily   let into the school," but rather made a "forced" entry. They also confirmed that the woman found dead at the second crrime scene was   related to the shooter. 15.14 (10.14) Lieutenant Paul Vance from the Connecticut State Police   department is speaking live now outside the school. He says the victims have   been officially identified, but they have some more work to do before they   release the full list of victims' names and ages. A crisis intervention team has been established in the town and their services   will be available to victims' families. He says they are still working on forensics at the school, which will take at   least one to two days. 15.00 (10.00) USA Today said they   had interviewed a very trauamatised school nurse from Sandy Hook, who   described how the gunman walked into her office and looked her straight in   the eye. She then was said to have ducked under the desk before he then   inexplicably turning around and walking out. She also said she knew the suspect's mother, Nancy, describing her as an "absolutely   loving, caring kindergarten teacher."There are mixed reports as to whether Nancy Lanza worked at the school or not,   but this is the first person to talk about her being a teacher at Sandy   Hook. 14.50 (09.50) As America starts to wake up, people have begun to lay   flowers near the school. 14.30 (09.30) Mary-Anne Jacob, the school librarian, has just told Sky   News of how she barrackaded 18 children into a cupboard to avoid the   shooter. When asked about Nancy Lanza, the suspected killer's mother, she   said she didn't know anyone called Nancy Lanza who works at the school. 14.00 (09.00) We are still waiting for the press conference (which was   supposed to begin at 1pm or 8am EST) with Connecticut Police Lieutenant Paul   Vance, as is much of the world's media... 13.43 (08.43) Meanwhile, the tabloids went for: 13.38 (08.38) The front page of the New York Times has come in,   featuring the very emotional headline: "Who Would Do This to Our Poor Little Babies."13.30 (08.30) The superintendent of Newtown schools has just told the   Today Show in America that Nancy Lanza did not work at Sandy Hook Elementary   and she was not in their database. it is now unclear what her connection to   the school was. 13.15 (08.13) As mentioned earlier, first-grade teacher Kaitlin Roig   managed to keep the killer out of her classroom by blockading the door. Here she recounts her ordeal and tells how she kept her class safe. 12.46 (07.46) A third young victim has been named as six year-old Jesse   Lewis. His father Neil Heslin told The   New York Post that Jesse had been looking forward to making gingerbread   houses in school yesterday. I dropped him off at school at 9 am. He went happily. That was the last I saw   of him," Mr Heslin, 50, said. He was just a happy boy. Everybody knew Jesse.He was going to go places in   life. He did well in school. He was in Ms. [Victoria] Sotos class. We were supposed to make gingerbread   houses today at 2:30 in his class."Dad Neil Heslin with son Jesse12.42 (07.42) We will have a live feed of the conference outside the   school in 15 minutes. 12.30 (07.30) In his weekly internet address, President Obama has   called for "meaningful action, regardless of politics."12.15 (07.15) A new, more recent picture has emerged of Adam Lanza. The   undated photo has been confirmed to be the suspected gunman by government   officials,   according to NBC.12.07 (07.07) According to Jo Ling Kent at NBC News on the scene all   bodies have been identified, but it is not known if any still remain inside. 11.45 (06:45) It is thought police will hold a conference this morning   at 8am EST in which it will name all the victims. 11.30 (06.30) The Ottawa Citizen has   published this photo purporting to show one of the victims, six year-old   Ana Marquez-Greene, with her family. Her father, Jimmy Greene, is a jazz saxophinist. Friends and fellow musicians   posted messages of condolence on their Facebooks walls last night, including   pianist Christian Sands. @christiansands1 My prayers   and heart go out to my brother, Mr. Jimmy Greene. Your loss cannot be   compared. I'm praying for you and your family @jimmygreene It is believed Mr Greene wrote this song for his daughter Ana four years ago: 11.15 (06.15) The school's principal Dawn Hochsprung had   a Twitter profile she regularly updated with news of how   students were doing. She had recently put up a picture of Sandy Hook Elementary practising an   evacuation drill. 11:00 (06:00) "There's been a shooting at your daughter's school"   - a   very moving piece in the New York Times by a mother after hearing   the news of the shooting. Fortunately, her nine year-old daughter Lenie was   unharmed. 10:55 (05:55) Here is a video from a little earlier of Connecticut   Governor Dan Malloy addressing the media as a local church holds an   emotional vigil. 10:47 (05.47) Mark Kelly, the husband of Gabrielle Giffords, who was   shot during a public meeting held in a supermarket parking lot, has urged   immediate action on gun control. Writing on his Facebook page, he said: This time our response must consist of   more than regret, sorrow and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook   Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have   the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws    and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and   death in America. This can no longer wait.10:35 (05:35) With the tragic massacre of young children in Connecticut   being given prominent coverage in newspapers and on news broadcasts parents   face the task of attempting to explain the events to their own kids. Psychologists at the Childrens Medical Centre in the US yesterday issued   a set of guidelines to help parents, which includes limiting the   amount of coverage your child is watching and to maintain normal routines. They say there is nothing to be gained from letting a child watch news   coverage of the aftermath of the shootings. Adults must model a sense of   calm and reassurance for children, monitoring their own reaction, anxiety   and outrage about the shooting. 10:10 (05:10) Three teachers murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School   all died heroes as they attempted to save their young pupils from a gunman   they recognised as the son of one of the schools kindergarten teachers. Authorities have identified principal Dawn Hochsprung, 47, school psychologist   Mary Sherlach, 56, and 27-year-old Victoria Soto, a young first grade   teacher, as three of the eight adults found dead at the school on Friday.

According to Suarez, Hochsprung is a married mother of two daughters and four   grandchildren. 09:25 (04:25) A second victim has been named, another six year-old girl   called Grace McDonnell, according   to the MailOnline.She has been described as "utterly adorable" and "full of life",   with eyes that were so blue and hair that was so blonde that friends thought   she looked like a "little doll". Her mother Lynn McDonnell, 45, a housewife, and Christopher, 49, a business   executive, live just one street away from where alleged shooter Adam Lanza   lived. Neighbor Dorothy Werden, 49, said: "I just choke up when I think about   it. Grace was like a little doll. She was utterly adorable. "I used to see her waiting for the school bus over the road from our   house every day. "She had blonde hair and blue eyes - she was like a little Barbie doll."09:15 (04:15) A picture of one of the first young victims has   been published by the Toronto Sun.Ana Marquez-Greene, 6, has been named as one of the 20 children killed. She had just started at the school with her brother Isaiah, reportedly in   grade 3, this year after moving from Winnipeg in Canada. Isaiah made it out   unharmed. The children's father is American jazz saxophonist Jimmy Greene. According to   his online biography, Greene and his family spent the past three years in   Winnipeg while he worked as a faculty member with the University of   Manitoba's school of music. Their mother Nelba, is a therapist who worked at the University of Winnipeg's   Aurora Family Therapy Centre. Ana Marquez-Greene, 609:00 (04:00) It is believed the guns used in the shooting belonged to   his mother, Nancy, who bought them legally. Two 9mm handguns were found at the scene of the Connecticut shooting,   according to NBC News. Lanza also reportedly brought two semi-automatic   pistols and an automatic rifle to school. All three of those guns were   legally owned by Nancy Lanza. Connecticut residents must be 21 or older to purchase or carry a handgun,   while Lanza was only 20. Photograph reportedly showing Lanza taken in 200508:55 (03:55) A reporter from the local paper, the   Stamford Advocate, first broke the news to Lanza's father,   Peter, a vice president of taxes for GE Energy Financial Services who   separated from his mother in 2009. "I told him I was a reporter for the Stamford Advocate, and I was   surprised that no click of recognition flash across his face," writes   Maggie Gordon. "So I continued, explaining that I'd been told someone   at his address had been linked to the shootings in Newtown. "His expression twisted from patient, to surprise to horror."Peter Lanza on his LinkedIn page08:35 (03:35) As more details come out, more stories of heroism emerge. Sandy Hook Elementary first grade teacher Kaitlin Roig was worried that she   and her students would not survive the gunfire. Ms Roig told ABC News that she quickly ushered her first grade students into   the class bathroom and held the door shut with a storage unit. "They asked, 'Can we go see if anyone is out there I just want   Christmas I don't want to die, I just want to have Christmas,"   she said. She told them she loved them as she feared it would be the last thing they   would ever hear. 08:30 (03:30) Throughout the afternoon, Adam Lanza's older brother   Ryan, 24, a former student at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, was   named by some news outlets as the killer. Ryans identification had been found on the body of his underage brother,   leading to the mistaken reports. The Killer's older brother Ryan Lanza, 24, led away by police for   questioning. Police say he has been fully cooperativeRyan Lanza's Facebook page08:25 (03:25) Catherine Urso, who was attending a vigil last night in   Newtown, said her college-age son knew the killer and remembered him for his   alternative style. "He just said he was very thin, very remote and was one of the goths,"   she said. Lanza's parents filed for divorce in 2008, according to court records. His   father, Peter Lanza, lives in Stamford, Connecticut, according to public   records, and he reportedly works as a tax director for General Electric. 08:15 (03:15) The New York Times has done a profile on the killer,   named as Adam Lanza, describing him as an intelligent but shy person, who left   few footprints in life.He did all he could to avoid attention, it seemed. Lanza did not even appear in his high school yearbook, that of the class of   2010. His spot on the page said, Camera shy. Others who graduated that   year said they did not believe he had finished school. Remembering him from school, one of his old classmates, Olivia DeVivo, said   she and her friends "werent surprised at that news. She said. They said he always seemed like he was someone who was capable of   that because he just didnt really connect with our high school, and didnt   really connect with our town.A child reacts to police and fireman staged nearby Sandy Hook 08.10 (03:10) Overnight Richard Blackden, our reporter in   Connecticut, attended vigils across Newtown to remember the victims of the   massacre.
