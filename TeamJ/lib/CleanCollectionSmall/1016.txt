But if you post it in /r/politics, then I'd say you should fully expect that you will find a lot of people who do not buy into Austrian economic theory, or AnCap/minarchist ideologies.If you post intelligent, thoughtful topics - you will get some well-considered points from people with ideologies other than your own (and you will get crap as well - hey, it's teh internets after all).  However, if by "authentic" you mean conversations where people are all agreeing with you and simply discussing the libertarian differences between ancap, minarchist, rothbard, mises, etc. then yeah - you probably won't find the outside world to be all that "authentic".Let the downvotes begin...permalinksave[+]kelmanza[S] 3 points4 points5 points 3 years ago*(1 child)[]kelmanza[S] 3 points4 points5 points 3 years ago*sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThe problem is that, looking at /r/politics, it mostly resembles a left-wing blog; and not a particularly thoughtful one.  I have never seen a conservative post (and only on a blue moon a libertarian post); the only remotely conservative issues that get play are occasional pro-[war on terror] stuff that is probably just being upvoted by  the ultra-anti-religious folks who see muslim--bad and upvote.   the reason I wish /r/ libertarian (and /r/ conspiracy for that matter) were incorporated into /r/ politics is because the debate in /r/politics, for the most part and increasingly as of late, just follows MSM meme's about the war on FOX news, gay marriage, abortion, etc. etc. these issues are trotted out to distract us while the owners of this country have their hands in our pockets.  The media should not be choosing the issues for us to care about, and the more that this has been happening, the more I have lost faith in social media as a force combating against it. I am also pissed because 1/20 stories is great on /r/politics and is something the media misses.  Seeing these stories surrounded by crap about Glenn Beck being a douche and Obama being unfairly attacked is saddening.permalinksaveparent[+]TheyCallMeRINO 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago (0 children)[]TheyCallMeRINO 0 points1 point2 points 3 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI dunno - right now, the top item on /r/politics, is getting some interesting discussions.

Democrats are getting a lot of play bc we have a president and congressional majority so there is much 'democratic' to talk about. If you are referring to getting downvoted, well, stop being such arrogant douchebags and use your silly derogatory names for democrats or Obama.

Fair enough, but consider that mercantilism and communism have failed before, and Keynesian economic theory has a shaky history, at best.  Globalization and high technology (both of which have the capacity to replace unskilled or semi-skilled workers) are the bane of organized labor.  And both are only going to increase over time.  Further, as competition creates more alternatives to the tax-heavy regions of the world, many skilled individuals and even companies will take flight from them- draining the coffers that keep socialist states afloat.  Oh, sure, said societies could always crack down, or become more protectionist; but doing so will inevitably leave them in the proverbial dust when it comes to cheaper and more advanced products- to say nothing of the inevitable backlash politically.permalinksaveparent[+]kelmanza[S] 5 points6 points7 points 3 years ago (1 child)[]kelmanza[S] 5 points6 points7 points 3 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onYour missing my point..
