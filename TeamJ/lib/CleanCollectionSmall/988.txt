Do you believe that humans have a right to slaughter animals for food, use their skin or coat as clothing, own them as a pet or contain the against their will in any way? Because if you do, you are denying them the same rights that we as humans possess. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThoughts on rescuing animals or children from a hot car in the summer.

Are you violating the owner's property rights?  by  eaglebluebloodin  Anarcho_Capitalism[+]eagleblueblood[S] 8 points9 points10 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]eagleblueblood[S] 8 points9 points10 points 4 months agoThis was my response to the argument:"Let us not obfuscate the issue by lumping animals and children into the same group. One is property the other is not. The libertarian case for violating someone else property rights can be easily made when there is a clear and immediate threat to another persons life. The owner of that property effectively forfeits their right to that property when, through either commission or omission, they threaten the life of another human.It is much more difficult to objectively validate such aggression when dealing with animals. I am not saying you should be cruel to animals or that I think it is OK. Although animals are property, you have taken the responsibility of caring for their well being on yourself. I think the way a true libertarian society would deal with this is much the same way they would deal with patronizing a restaurant that participates in racial discrimination. Such activities are shunned by society and as such that person or business will suffer the consequences of being an outcast.I am not saying that if I saw an animal suffering in a car that I would just walk away. I would probably take my chances to try and help the animal and accept the consequences. However, when you begin to try and justify laws based on societal norms such as, "It is wrong to be cruel to animals", you start down a very slippery slope."permalinksavecontextfull comments168910Thoughts on rescuing animals or children from a hot car in the summer.
