How do news organizations benefit from being biased?  by  enigmaticparadoxicalin  explainlikeimfive[+]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 7 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 7 hours agoPretty much this.In the past, news outlets were forced by regulations to be impartial.Those regulations got taken away so the news went back to the old model before they had rules.The rules need to be brought back.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you don't care about the recent elementary school shooting, you aren't being overly intelligent, you're being apathetic and emotionless.  by  life_managerin  offmychest[+]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 7 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 7 hours agoOh you're such a victim aren't you?People die daily and tragic as this was, crying doesn't fix the problems.This is normal news if you read international news. It's just not sensationalized like this story.How can you say the shooter was depressed and emotionless in the same sentence? Being depressed is often a highly emotional, vulnerable state and it's sort of unfair that you overlook the emotional factors leading to him doing such a horrible thing.permalinksavecontextfull comments911 Subliminal Messages in new Call of Duty Black Ops 2  by  spawnmowerin  911truth[+]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours agoShould post in r/conspiracy and r/mediapermalinksavecontextfull commentsSkaters of Reddit, I need your opinion...  by  Roger-The-Alienin  skateboarding[+]Abe_Vigoda 5 points6 points7 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda 5 points6 points7 points 10 hours agoIs it worth getting back and trying again?Absolutely.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf penis size doesn't matter then why are dildos always so big?  by  briroberin  AskReddit[+]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours agoYeah, i'm a big advocate against media that exploits women's body image but modern feminism doesn't feel the need to reciprocate which is a pretty nasty double standard.

There's 100's of outlets and when this stuff happens, they all push the story.When something bad happens, like a drone kills 18 kids, no one gives a shit because we've been trained for years to not be empathic towards certain groups, and the news headlines downplay the story.The news loves when this stuff happens. It makes them money. they have no interest in trying to really fix things. they'll just blather on about gun control and avoid the white elephant like real mental health issues.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf penis size doesn't matter then why are dildos always so big?  by  briroberin  AskReddit[+]Abe_Vigoda 16 points17 points18 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda 16 points17 points18 points 15 hours agoTrue, I was trying not to make generalizations but fucked up there.

Feminism was needed to give women a voice but we heard it and men need their voice back too.I wouldn't need men's rights if people respected individual rights whether your male, female, trans, whatever.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMarilyn Manson's commentary for Rolling Stone after Columbine is just as relevant for today's shooting in Connecticut  by  3magdnimin  Music[+]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 16 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 16 hours agoHe had me until he blamed religion or the NRA.I don't like god or guns really but the US has lost a lot of it's cultural morality just because TV rewards stupid or obnoxious people and it makes people dumber just by watching it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf penis size doesn't matter then why are dildos always so big?  by  briroberin  AskReddit[+]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 16 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 16 hours agoEw, yup.

You don't want someone in an emotional state shooting off their... mouths about gun control. But with an approximately 30 gun related murders daily in the US, when will it ever be the right time to talk about the issue? - Jon Stewart  by  Troybatroyin  occupywallstreet[+]Abe_Vigoda 15 points16 points17 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda 15 points16 points17 points 17 hours agoCanadian here. Both of our countries tend to really underestimate the usefulness of proper mental health access.At least with us, we have our health care system which will find seriously distressed people help, but there's a lot of people who fall through the cracks.In the US, you guys have very minimal services for proper mental rehab and it's primarily based on just dosing the patient with expensive meds.There's also the racial factors that are overlooked. Everyone sees this story and goes on about how much the US needs gun control but overlooks the amount of black on black violence that is caused by the US alienating people as classes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf penis size doesn't matter then why are dildos always so big?  by  briroberin  AskReddit[+]Abe_Vigoda 226 points227 points228 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda 226 points227 points228 points 17 hours agoThe US is built on pointing a stick at guy's junk and laughing at us until we buy something stupid to compensate.There's a huge amount of psychological exploits used in media and advertising to make us feel concerned that we suck in bed or somehow 'less of men'.It's fake.The giant dildos are just a demasculating method to make us feel like we should buy a new car or big truck or tighter pants or something.Even the whole black guy giant dick thing is just a media reinforced stereotype meant to exploit white people (and black people).They used to scare people way back in the day. 'Vote for this guy or darkie will come and knock up your white daughters'.Or, 'Vote for this guy because the other guy is racist'.Unless you're like way below average, don't worry about it.If you're too big, girls don't like to let you do anal. It's pretty overated anyways personally and porn totally lies about how nasty anal really is.Staying power is probably more important. Knowing how to get someone off is definately more important. Learn to use your fingers and tounge is wicked helpful because foreplay saves you a huge amount of work and it's better for lots of girls.There's also lots of toys out there too that are pretty freaking crazy. My gf works in a sex store and they sell tons of stuff. Those big dildos are usually more for show and most women prefer something that's a little more sane.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShould people with mental illness be forced medicated and tracked.  by  Clownpounder2442in  AskReddit[+]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 17 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda -1 points0 points1 point 17 hours agoCongratulations. You've just discovered Eugenic theory.Unfortunately you're overlooking the fact that people have civil rights and that it's a serious encroachment on people's personal liberties.What's next?Go back to sterilizing retards?No. How about the US stops trying to regulate people while prescribing anti-depressants in lieu of real psychological and social services?You want to fix people, you do it by approaching the root problems instead of even suggesting such ridiculously narrow solutions.http://youtu.be/csas5rAa0J0permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny love for Skate Punk? One Nine Nine Four!!!!  by  GuhLakTusin  punk[+]Abe_Vigoda 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours agoUg. I hate this movie. This movie should be called 'A bunch of guys who sold out justify why they sold out'.For me, Bad Religion's Suffer was one of the most influencial albums ever released.I got into skating about 86 and my friend's older brother was going to gigs and gave us a bunch of music to listen to. Stuff like DK, 7 seconds, MDC, etc.Thrasher was like the bible. Every month we'd get a new copy and they'd always feature new skaters and new music. Pus Head had a segment where he'd review new skate rock bands. he eventually did a ton of work for Metallica.He was also the singer for Septic Death.Thrasher would always release these skate rock comps#Skate_Rock_series) and there was a lot of skate rock bands out there like Beyond Possession, Suicidal Tendencies, Gang Green, Boneless Ones, and tons more.Skateboarding and punk rock fit well. Both groups get fucked with by cops, jocks, and rednecks.Skate videos like Santa Cruz's Streets of Fire were sold in skate shops everywhere.Then hardcore started turning metal.Hardcore just started getting harder, and Slayer came out and they were awesome, and bands just started shifting towards the punk metal crossover phase where bands like Suicidal Tendencies and DRI started playing metal, and shows started drawing bangers and bikers and guys who made shows suck because they don't understand that the pit wasn't a violent place and they'd always get drunk and hurt people.There was still a lot of punk bands though that weren't going all metal, but more melodic.And then Nirvana went mainstream.And everyone turned grunge, and shows got filled with people who hated you months before that.And then Green day came out and pop punk became trendy and Epitaph and Fat Wreck got big.Don't forget the X games or Tony Hawks game.This movie overlooks one thing, and that's the distribution range the major labels have over indie labels.Bad Religion wasn't radio friendly because they weren't part of the major label's distribution until Epitaph signed with a major label.MTV & the radio stations are corporate owned, as well as the newspapers and any other major media outlets, and if you don't play their game, they bury you.This is a better movie.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama Caught Fake Crying  by  RedskullSSin  conspiracy[+]Abe_Vigoda 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Abe_Vigoda 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoFuck off Alex.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn light of the very tragic Connecticut Elementary School shootings, everyone is now bringing up gun control again.

Then I saw this movie and it made me start questioning some of the textbook history I was taught.Not that the holocaust was faked, but that there was a bit of...creative liberties taken with some of the claims.When the US toppled the statue of Saddam, the press lied and distorted the story and didn't show how they had staged the incident.The movie I linked to makes the same kind of claims.Some people take that stuff really seriously and it sounds like your Dad's co worker drank all the kool aid.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
