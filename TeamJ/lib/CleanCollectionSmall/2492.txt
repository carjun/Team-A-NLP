You get people who don't always agree, groups are marginalized, anger seethes, and some are willing to resort to extremism for whatever purpose they rationalize. Right now, the most urgent conversation is the immediate either or demonization of us versus them, splitting sides. This happens no matter what and death, anger, destruction is used to push whoever's agenda best. My country is devolving into a state where there's no right or wrong anymore, just how many people you can get to agree.If anything I think these incidents are indicators of an overall trend of the general unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Happy people don't do these things. But you can't guarantee everyone's happiness forever at every moment, only try to provide for an environment for anyone to pursue happiness. We live in USA, an experiment from 200 years ago that through the generations have been built through trials and errors, blood and sweat. These are the costs and collateral damage of freedom. There are some that strive to keep the bar high but there are also people willing to kick the bar lower each day.If you are angered by any of this the very most important you can do now is do everything you can to keep raising the bar and help everyone else be there too. The rest is is just noise to scare you, to control you, to distract you.permalinksaveparent[+]brandonw00 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]brandonw00 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI don't see what having "freedom" has to do with a shooting. There are many countries that have the same freedoms that Americans have, yet they don't have this kind of violence in their country. I do agree with your statement about these incidents are indicators that people are not happy. It is too bad though, because life is a beautiful thing, and everyone alive has the opportunity to experience it! Every day is a new adventure, every day you get to see the sun rise, the world come alive, the wildlife move about, you get to interact with other individuals. It is too bad people don't value life more. It is the greatest thing ever, and we need to value every day we have on earth, because once it is gone, its gone. permalinksaveparent[+]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago*(0 children)[]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago*Pro gun wants to elevate the conversation to be about freedom. Anti gun wants to elevate the conversation about public freedom. Either way it's an ongoing struggle for Americans of this current generation to define what freedom means, because quite frankly, after my service in the Marine Corps, after more than a decade of war, I don't believe anyone truly understand what freedom really means.As for the beauty of life, having socialized and hanging with the broken, misfits, the traumatized, and the suicidal the past few years... the one thing I learned is that just because you're not wrong doesn't necessarily make you right either. permalinksaveparent[+]Dcoil1 0 points1 point2 points 55 minutes ago (0 children)[]Dcoil1 0 points1 point2 points 55 minutes agoThis is probably the most rational, sane comment I've read that came after a mass shooting.
