Young black men kill each other every day. The problem is particularly acute in cities like Chicago, President Barack Obamas  hometown. Yet, I havent seen the president or the mainstream media shed a tear over the fact more than 50 percent of Americas murder victims  are black and nearly all of those blacks killed - 85 percent-  are young men.Nor do we see media or presidential outrage or calls for more rigid gun control laws when young black kids are heinously murdered like we do when the victims are mostly white.Neither words nor God can explain the horrific mass slayings that occurred at Sandy Brook Elementary, Columbine, Virginia Tech  University, Aurora and those to come in our future. But why dont we  hear the same pain or calls for tougher gun laws from the mainstream press when Trayvon Martin was killed? Instead, the media immediately turned it into a  racially motivated killing of a black boy by a white man. Yet there is often little horror over the alarming rate of young black men who are both perpetrators and victims  of these homicides. For years the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention has reported that the homicide  rate among blacks is beyond epidemic proportions. The CDC found as of 2007, black males age  15-34 were at the greatest risk of death by homicide.  Wheres the societal outrage over the reality that 55 percent of all federal prisoners are black though blacks only account for 12 percent of  the population, as Shelby Steele noted here?. The double standard the mainstream media shows toward its coverage of black vs. white  homicides is beyond irresponsible and dishonest. When black Kansas City Chiefs football player Javon Belcher shot his wife Kassandra Perkins and then killed  himself with the same gun, I dont remember the news media calling for tougher gun laws. Why? Is it okay for blacks to kill?At the Sandy Hook prayer vigil, President Obama declared the nation isnt doing  enough to combat tragedies like Adam Lanzas killing of 20 children and seven  adults. He added We cant tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end.  These words rang hollow for a number of reasons: First, America has never  tolerated madmen or any man or woman killing innocent people.  Secondly and  equally as important, why havent we heard President Obama give a prayer vigil  in cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Baton Rouge where blacks are  killing each other with guns? In 2010,  black males age 15-29 accounted for 3 percent  of New York Citys population but 33 percent of  the citys  murder victims. When 7-year-old Heaven  Sutton was killed June 27, 2012 by gang gunfire in Chicago, Mayor Rahm  Emanuel pledged to do something about the citys high murder rate. Ive never  heard Obama describe these killings of blacks as an endless series of deadly  shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them  children . . .their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time,  as he describe the poor souls of Sandy Hook.What the media and the president seem to be saying is when black kids die, its not a gun control thing but a national disgrace weve come to accept as normal but when mostly white people are killed is  reprehensible. Both are reprehensible and ending the cycle of violence has  nothing to do with more gun laws. Homicides committed by young black men and  white men like Adam Lanza have everything to do with a lack of parenting,  personal responsibility and/or societys mishandling of mental illness.More young black men are becoming murderers because more young black men are increasingly being  born into fatherless homes. According to the  Brookings Institute, 73 percent of all black babies in America are born to single  mothers compared to 30 percent of  white babies, 50 percent  of Hispanics and 40 percent of all kids overall.Brookings found  more than 36 percent of the unmarried fathers had a prison record, five times the  share of married fathers who ever spent time in prison. The study  also found that boys born to unwed mothers experience more behavioral problems,  such as engaging in crime, than girls.When you dont  have a mom and dad caring for you, asking you if you did your homework or  teaching you right from wrong, is it any wonder, so many young black men are becoming murderers?  And it appears that  a lack of attentive parenting also may have been to blame for Adam Lanzas  killing rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School and others like Columbine and  Virgina Tech. News reports  havent been able to confirm whether Adam Lanzas mother and father ever sought  treatment for his sons Aspergers Syndrome. Nancy Lanza told  babysitters never to leave Adam alone. But Lanzas mother may have been an irresponsible gun owner.  Although it is unclear how Lanza got his hands on his mothers guns, if she kept the weapons unsecured in her home, easily accessible to her developmentally disabled son,  that would be utterly negligent.We didnt see these kinds of horrific shootings 40 years ago nor did we have the high rate of  black men murdering each other. I think thats because we had stronger families,  lower divorce rates and virtually no outsourcing of parenting to video games and  the Internet. The rise in  young male murderers isnt about a need for more gun laws. Connecticut has some of the strictest gun laws  in the nation, which didnt stop Adam Lanza. Parents need to parent. Society  needs to bring back shame in our culture and tell teenagers its not cool to  have a baby. America also needs to do a better job of treating mental illness  like a disease not a stigma. We can have a conversation about gun laws but Sandy  Hook is about the skeletons in our culture we refuse to talk  about.
