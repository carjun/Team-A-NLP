Still shooting people in the back and get no hit markers, then getting turned on and killed with two bullets. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPlease explain to me why I preordered the game for a map that I can't play save for special events... not cool Activision.  by  CrazyPenguin08in  blackops2[+]eyeamej 9 points10 points11 points 25 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej 9 points10 points11 points 25 days agoThey don't care about the players. They used the Nuketown pre order to push more copies and now we can't even fucking play it?? But they get to swim in the $500 million the game made in 24 hours. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI love black ops 2, but the lag compensation..  by  muchmore_in  blackops2[+]eyeamej 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej 0 points1 point2 points 27 days agoUnless I can find a sale.

They don't care about the player. If they did they would have but more money into servers and beta testing. But why spend money on that when they know we'll all buy it. I'm not going to sell the game because I hope it gets fixed soon but we'll see.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsI love black ops 2, but the lag compensation..  by  muchmore_in  blackops2[+]eyeamej 4 points5 points6 points 27 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej 4 points5 points6 points 27 days agoEveryone on this subreddit is a bunch of fanboys. People have legit complaints about the game and everyone down votes the shit out of them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI love black ops 2, but the lag compensation..  by  muchmore_in  blackops2[+]eyeamej 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej 0 points1 point2 points 27 days agoIt's not a game it's a beta. A beta I had to shell out $60 for because I believed that Treyarch had something good here. They don't care about the player. They just care about that 500 million they made in 24 hours and the millions they will make in the coming weeks. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI love black ops 2, but the lag compensation..  by  muchmore_in  blackops2[+]eyeamej -5 points-4 points-3 points 27 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej -5 points-4 points-3 points 27 days agoI never said I wouldn't buy another COD game. I clearly said I wasn't going to buy another beta. Meaning I won't be buying anymore COD games on release day. I'll wait a month or two. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI love black ops 2, but the lag compensation..  by  muchmore_in  blackops2[+]eyeamej -3 points-2 points-1 points 27 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej -3 points-2 points-1 points 27 days agoThat's what we get for paying $60 for a beta.

By that time they've turned around and shoot me twice and killed me. I'm guessing it's the servers or lag comp. permalinksavecontextfull comments17000The game sucks.

(Why do haters not like this game?)  by  JosephDenman1in  blackops2[+]eyeamej 2 points3 points4 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej 2 points3 points4 points 28 days agoIt's not like we're talking about some kind of indie game. It made 500 million in 24 hours. Invest that money in some better servers. How can you justify what they're doing is right. "Hey give us $60 for this game now and we'll make sure it's working in 2 weeks." I don't see why they can't do beta testing. COD4 and WAW both had a beta and we didn't have any problems that I can remember at launch. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy stand on how Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is GREAT!!! (Why do haters not like this game?)  by  JosephDenman1in  blackops2[+]eyeamej -2 points-1 points0 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej -2 points-1 points0 points 28 days agoI've had every COD since COD4 and this is by far the worse experience I've had with COD at launch. I'm not a "Hater", I defend the game every time people say it's just the same game every year and the $60 map pack shit. As of right now the game is broken and I hope it get's fixed so i can enjoy it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWow the BLOPS2 forums are a giant circle jerk of hate right now......  by  Newpockyin  blackops2[+]eyeamej -2 points-1 points0 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej -2 points-1 points0 points 28 days agoComplain about the circle jerk of haters while everyone in this post is a circle jerk of fanboys.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWow the BLOPS2 forums are a giant circle jerk of hate right now......  by  Newpockyin  blackops2[+]eyeamej -4 points-3 points-2 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej -4 points-3 points-2 points 28 days agoI'm trying so hard to not get into the circle jerk of people hating the game but It's getting harder and harder not to.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHoly S**t  by  EdAndTheGangin  blackops2[+]eyeamej 1 point2 points3 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]eyeamej 1 point2 points3 points 28 days agoSame thing happens to me.
