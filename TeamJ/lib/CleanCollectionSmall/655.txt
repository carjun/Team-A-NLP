In 1993, following the the 101 California St. shooting in San Francisco, Feinstein introduced an assault weapons ban in the Senate. The decade long ban was signed into law by president Clinton in 1994. It outlawed a number of semi-automatic weapons based on cosmetic features and other attributes such as flash suppressors and telescoping stocks. The law also banned high capacity magazines or feeding devices.Despite claims by Democrats, studies found that theFederal Assault Weapons Ban did not reduce or prevent violence. The United States Department of Justice National Institute of Justice said that a renewed gun ban would have virtually no impact on gun violence because so-called assault weapons are rarely used in gun crimes. Moreover, according to a study performed by the Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania, there is no statistically significant evidence that either the assault weapons ban or the ban on magazines holding more than 10 bullets had reduced murders attributed to firearms.Since the law expired in 2004, the anti-Second Amendment crowd has unsuccessfully attempted to pass a number of bills outlawing firearms. Feinstein and fellow gun-grabber Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York, have remained at the forefront of the effort to disarm the American people. McCarthy has introduced legislation to ban so-called assault weapons on numerous occasions. Fortunately for the Second Amendment, all of her efforts have failed.Democrats are determined to enact an assault weapons ban and make it permanent. Following the 2008 election, the website of president-elect Obama stated a position that included making the expired federal Assault Weapons Ban permanent. The statement later appeared on the administrations website, WhiteHouse.gov, with the above wording intact.In 2009, Obamas newly sworn in attorney general, Eric Holder, said the administration planned to reinstate the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Holders statement came in response to a question concerning the Fast and Furious operation designed to arm drug cartels in Mexico. Holder said there are just a fewgun-related changesthat we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons.Democrats are ready to exploit the Sandy Hook killings and introduce a new assault weapons ban when the 113th Congress convenes in January. Anti-Second Amendment activists explain that an assault weapons ban, however, is only part of the plan to disarm Americans.The assault weapons ban is a piece of the puzzle,Benjamin Van Houten, managing attorney of the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun violence, told Capitol Confidential. Its not the whole thing but its an important piece for moving forward on this issue.Outlawing semi-automatic weapons, however, will be an uphill battle for Democrats. Republicans control the House and there are key Democrats in the Senate opposed to further draconian gun control legislation. Moreover, the Democrat majority lacks the 60 votes required to end a filibuster Republicans would undoubtedly use to defeat any such legislation.It looks like any effort by the gun-grabbers and anti-Second Amendment advocates to exploit last weeks mass murder will likely fizzle out.Everyones frustrated and I understand why people use this terrible tragedy for a good purpose, trying to get a discussion going on gun control, saidLarry Sabato, director of the University of Virginias Center for Politics. But the House probably wouldnt even bring any of it up for a vote.Odds against a new assault weapons ban will not stop anti-gun Democrats and their fellow travelers  for instance,Sen. Joseph Lieberman. On Sunday, the Independent Connecticut senator echoed Feinstein and Chuck Schumer and called for legislation outlawing assault weapons. Lieberman also called for a national commission aimed at preventing instances of mass violence from happening again, according to the Washington Post.This article is brought to you courtesy of Kurt Nimmoa writer forInfowars.comandPrison Planet.com.Economy, Government, World News Tags: Dianne Feinstein, gun control, gun culture, Kurt NimmoFacebook CommentsCommentsComments (0)Trackbacks (0)Leave a commentTrackbackNo comments yet.No trackbacks yet.Name (required)E-Mail (will not be published) (required)WebsiteSubscribe to comments feedPlease enable Javascript to post comments.
