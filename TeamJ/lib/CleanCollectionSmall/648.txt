LaVictoire on December 16, 2012.English: Dianne Feinstein, U.S. Senator.

(Photo credit: Wikipedia)California Senator Dianne Feinstein has announced plans to introduce a new ban on assault weapons when the new session of Congress begins next year. On NBCs Meet the Press, Feinstein stated Im going to introduce in the Senate, and the same bill will be introduced in the House  a bill to ban assault weapons.The push to ban assault weapons comes after the murder of twenty children and six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newport, Conn. The original ban was signed into law back in 1994 by President Bill Clinton, but lapsed a decade later. Repeated attempts to ban assault weapons again have been stymied by Republicans in Congress.On her website during the last campaign, Feinstein wrote Who needs these military-style assault weapons? Who needs an ammunition feeding device capable of holding 100 rounds? These weapons are not for hunting deer  theyre for hunting people.Earlier this year, a gunman using assault-style weapons murdered twelve and wounded fifty-eight in Aurora, Colorado, and in Tucson, Arizona back in 2011, a gunman used a semi-automatic pistol to kill six and wound thirteen including Representative Gabrielle Giffords. In all cases, the attacks were over before anyone could react.Related PostsPresident Delivers Another DOA Budget To CongressThe 2012 State Of The Union AddressRon Paul Should Stop Claiming Constitutional Stuff Is UnconstitutionalPresident Obamas Jobs Plan Still D.O.A.Yet Another Lawsuit Against Right Wing ProposalsShare This PostTweetOne Response to Dianne Feinstein To Introduce New Assault Weapon Ban Pingback: Feinstein: I will introduce bill to ban assault weapons - Washington Times (blog) | Batyam.co.ilBatyam.co.ilLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
