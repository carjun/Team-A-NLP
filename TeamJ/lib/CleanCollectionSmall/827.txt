Just because something's selling at Hot Topic doesn't make it a bad thing, does it? The store is mostly just pop culture stuff nowadays. It's to the same equivalent as FYE, with fewer movies. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt's that time of year, so what are your favorite snow & winter weather related memories?  by  mattmagicianin  AskReddit[+]mattmagician[S] 2 points3 points4 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]mattmagician[S] 2 points3 points4 points 6 days agoMy personal favorite would probably have to be when I was in 7th or 8th grade. We got a huge snow storm on the day right before Christmas break was about to end, with an ice storm following it. This continued for about a week. In the long run we didn't end up back in school until almost mid February due damages and such to the school parking lot as well as them having trouble getting the snow plows. But here's the kicker. They piled and packed the snow around the lights in the parking lot. The piles were easily between 15 and 20 feet high, possibly higher. So we had huge snow mountains to climb up and play around until roughly middle of April or May. TL;DR: Catholic schoolboy becomes mountain climber for a few months. permalinksavecontextfull comments12456It's that time of year, so what are your favorite snow & winter weather related memories?
