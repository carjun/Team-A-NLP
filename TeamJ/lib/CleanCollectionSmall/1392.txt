(AP) - Authorities are trying to determine whether students who survived the Connecticut elementary school rampage will be able to return to classes.Newtown police Lt. George Sinko said at a news conference Sunday that school officials will determine what happens but that he thinks it will be very difficult for the children to return to Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown.But he says authorities want to keep the children together because the survivors "need to support each other."A gunman shot his way into the school Friday and gunned down 26 people, including 20 children ages 6 and 7, then killed himself.Previous Article At worship, grieving seek answers to massacreNext Article Funeral set for 1 of youngsters killed in rampageMost PopularPres.
