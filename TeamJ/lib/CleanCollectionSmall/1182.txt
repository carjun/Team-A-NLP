Firefighters gathered outside the red-brick church, standing silently alongside the black hearse as mourners filed in.PHOTOS:Mourning after the massacreThis is a part of our extended family, said Lt. Eddie Boles, who works with Daniel's cousins as a firefighter in New York, about 65 miles south of Newtown. After 9/11 the whole country extended its sympathy to New York so we're here to show our support for this community."Daniel, who had a brother and sister, was described by loved ones as the light of his family's life and an active boy who played soccer and swam on the Newtown Torpedoes swim team.Daniel loved spending time with his family, both immediate and extended, riding waves at the beach, playing the drums in a band with his brother James and sister Natalie, foosball, reading, and making s'mores around the bonfire with his cousins at his Papa's house in Smallwood, N.Y., his family wrote in an obituary notice.Later Wednesday, funeral services were also due to be held for students Charlotte Bacon and Caroline Previdi in Newtown, and Sandy Hook Elementary School Principal Dawn Hochsprung in Woodbury, Conn.In a prepared statement, the family of one of the slain children, Dylan Hockley, praised the town and the schools staff for taking the British family to their hearts.Sandy Hook and Newtown have warmly welcomed us since we moved here two years ago from England. We specifically chose Sandy Hook for the community and the elementary school. We do not and shall never regret this choice. Our boys have flourished here and our familys happiness has been limitless, the family said in a statement released via the British Foreign Office.We cannot speak highly enough of Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, exceptional women who knew both our children and who specifically helped us navigate Dylans special education needs. Dylans teacher, Vicki Soto, was warm and funny and Dylan loved her dearly.The trio were among the adults killed in the rampage, trying to protect students. Also among the dead was a teachers aide who tried to save Dylan.We take great comfort in knowing that Dylan was not alone when he died, but was wrapped in the arms of his amazing aide, Anne Marie Murphy. Dylan loved Mrs. Murphy so much and pointed at her picture on our refrigerator every day. Though our hearts break for Dylan, they are also filled with love for these and the other beautiful women who all selflessly died trying to save our children, the family said.In Washington, President Obama was expected to formally announce that Vice President Joe Biden will lead an administration group to develop proposals in response to the shooting.On Sunday, Obama said in Newtown that he would use whatever power this office holds to prevent gun-related tragedies. He gave no specifics, but in recent days aides have said that among the proposals could be a resumption of the ban on assault weapons and possibly on high-capacity ammunition clips.ALSO:FBI stays mostly mum about Sikh temple shooter Wage Page2012 is tragic, but mass shootings not increasing, experts say'No, no, no': Harrowing 911 call, then 4 dead near Longmont, Colo.Bengali reported from Newtown and Chu from London.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles TimesComments1Comments (1)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQFinny1968 at 10:35 AM December 19, 2012                Classy of NYFD to show up to pay tribute.
