That is not to say that it I didn't mourn the loss of other victims of mass shootingsI grieve the unnecessary loss of life of anyone. But yesterday I mourned the death of something more than those kids and the people who teach and protect them. I mourned the loss of the idea that our society was incapable of fostering something so evil.Yet something else really shook me yesterday, too. Perhaps what upset me just as much as the shooting itself was some of the things I saw on Facebook. While there was an outpouring of condolences and grief, within minutes posts were flying around about gun control. People were virtually tearing each other apart over fewer guns, or more guns, or no guns. And it made me absolutely sick to my stomach.You see, yesterday was not a time for fighting with our neighbors. Yesterday was not a time to be a self-righteous zealot and try to prove that your view of gun control is the only way. Yesterday was not about 'crazy liberal' or 'dirty conservative.' And most certainly, yesterday was not about you.Yesterday was about the 27 people whose lives were cut shortand the 20 kids who will never celebrate another birthday, never be tucked into bed by their parents again, never grow into adults who may have done great things. To see how we instinctively politicized a horrible loss of life minutes after it happened was disgusting. I can hardly think of anything more disrespectful to those who died.Yes, some people mourn by calling for change. I understand that. But there is a significant difference between calling for change and calling your neighbor a "gun-slinging a**hole" or exuding a holier-than-thou, I-told-you-so attitude for all to have to bear. Shame on you.But you know what? Today is a new day. While yesterday was a time to mourn with Newtown, Conn., today is a time to reach forward with them in solidarity to figure out how to prevent something like this from happening again.So let's talk about society, shall we? Because guns themselves have very little to do with the reason that yesterday happened. I have a nuanced and strong opinion on guns, and I think that most people have strong opinions too. But lack the comprehension that the issue at hand isn't the guns themselves but the society with its finger on the trigger is shocking.Neither subtracting or adding guns to or from the equation is going to solve the problem. That is why the person who cites Japan's lack of crime and incidental lack of guns is just as blind as the person who claims that allowing teachers to carry firearms at school would have prevented this tragedy.No, the issue at hand is far deeper than the number of guns we haveit stems to the very health of our culture, and I question deeply that health.We live in a society that constantly blames others for wrongdoings instead of turning the magnifying glass on itself and questioning whether its actions are at all to blame. I find it hard to live in a world where we can play video games that encourage us to shoot people (for points, even), watch television where people are shot and killed with no consequence, and then wonder why individuals with less mental stability than ourselves commit such atrocities. There is something fundamentally incorrect about that. We need to take a long look inward before we start blaming outwardly.But we need to do it in a way that is respectful to ourselves, respectful of our neighbors, and most importantly respectful to the victims of yesterday's tragic lossand to the loved ones who are still in shock and will be grieving this for the rest of their lives. Don't be cold. Don't be callous. If you can't be civil for yourself or for the sake of others, be civil for them.In his response yesterday, President Obama quoted part of a psalm from the Bible: "He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds." Religious or not, let's not make the process of healing and wound-binding any more painful than it already will be.Zachary Goldstein is a content specialist and the FSView's food writer.
