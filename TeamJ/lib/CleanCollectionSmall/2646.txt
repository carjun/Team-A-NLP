The Colts have only had 1 game in which they've comfortably won, a 27-10 victory at JAX.  The other win differentials have been 3, 3, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2 and 4 points. Combined, that point total (32) is fewer than the margin of victory from the Pats defeat (35) alone.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEvery NFL team's points per *WIN* differential.  by  TroysRedditAccountin  nfl[+]tergiversation 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agodone :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsEvery NFL team's points per *WIN* differential.  by  TroysRedditAccountin  nfl[+]tergiversation 17 points18 points19 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 17 points18 points19 points 1 day agoWell, they win close games (8-1 in games decided by a TD or less), and they've gotten brutalized in losses (specifically Week 1 in Chicago, Week 5 @ Shonn Greene and Week 10 @ NE).  With this young team, new scheme and brand new coaching staff, it's amazing that they've been able to accomplish 9 wins when most pre-season prognostications had them looking at another Top-5 pick in the 2013 draft.  Luck, in more ways than the obvious, has definitely played a huge role this season.  I can think of specific plays in all of our wins that, had the ball bounced the other direction, the Colts could easily be staring at a 3-10 or 4-9 record.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEvery NFL team's points per *WIN* differential.  by  TroysRedditAccountin  nfl[+]tergiversation 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago...yes?permalinksavecontextfull commentsEvery NFL team's points per loss differential.  by  DaviddddEOin  nfl[+]tergiversation 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoLOL!

Of all the theatres The Hobbit will be released at, only about 1,000 have the ability to display the 48fps so make sure you check before you book.Excellent advice - had not even thought to check.  Thank you!permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt looks like both Andrew Luck and RGIII will most likely be headed to the Pro-Bowl this year. That is ridiculously awesome.  by  ThatChrisDodgein  nfl[+]tergiversation 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoNo I'm not.  You're using only a couple statistical categories to define him. Obviously, he hasn't won games due to INTs and completion percentage; he also hasn't won games because of the Colts running game or defense. Yet the Colts are 9-4....why? Because he's won games by absolutely delivering in the 2nd half of games, and the in-game adjustments he makes are a marvel for a rookie.  Down 21-3 against the Packers at halftime - no problem.  Down 21-7 against the Titans at halftime - no problem.  Down by 12 with 4 minutes to go against the Lions - no problem.  The Colts offense is a vertical one, meaning most of Luck's throws are high-risk.  That's the way the offense is designed: for the big play.  And not a short slant or bubble screen that turns into a big play - airing it out over the middle to get chunks of yardage at a time is how the Colts move up and down the field.  Luck probably has the Colts longest running play of the season also because, up until last week when Ballard ran for 94 yards, we hadn't had an 90+ yard rusher all season (let alone a 100 yard rusher...as a Colts fan, I don't even remember what those look like).permalinksavecontextfull commentsPics from The Hobbit Royal Premiere in London last night  by  RaconBangin  movies[+]tergiversation 60 points61 points62 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 60 points61 points62 points 1 day agoThanks!Regarding the 48fps, I'm very anxious to see what the fuss is all about, and I wonder if it's more or less noticeable in 3D as opposed to the traditional format. From what I've read, it seems to be a difficult visual experience to describe. Some reviews have praised it, others hated it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo. This is why Donte Stallworth is on IR now.  by  advilliousin  nfl[+]tergiversation 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoLooks like a high ankle sprain-type injury, though impossible to tell the extent of ligament damage from a picture alone.  The timing of the injury could be why he was placed on season-ending IR b/c high ankle sprains tend to take about 4-5 weeks - sometimes longer - to heal.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsPics from The Hobbit Royal Premiere in London last night  by  RaconBangin  movies[+]tergiversation 109 points110 points111 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 109 points110 points111 points 1 day agoSo...how was it?I've read a few underwhelming reviews so far.  The Hobbit was one of the first books I ever read cover-to-cover (that wasn't a school assignment), and I always thought that it was a better story than LOTR. I just hope it translates to the big screen as well as I imagined it whilst reading the book.  Just picked it up again last week and powered through it to refresh my mind before seeing it in theaters, and I couldn't be more excited. From reading the negative reviews, it sounds as if those critics didn't read the book, because they complained of the pace of the film - but when you're introducing 14 characters (and 13 dwarves) right off the bat, you need to devote a fair amount of time to character development to ensure the entirety of the movie flows well. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt looks like both Andrew Luck and RGIII will most likely be headed to the Pro-Bowl this year. That is ridiculously awesome.  by  ThatChrisDodgein  nfl[+]tergiversation 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tergiversation 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoAndrew Luck isn't a pedestrian qb.  To say so implies you're a moron.  If that's what you think, I'm forced to assume you're a moron.  So, if you're a moron, the following might be hard to comprehend.  He has the highest rookie drive success rate, the most game winning drives/comeback wins, fewest 3-and-outs, highest 3rd down completion percentage and 3rd down conversion percentage, and has his team all but on the playoffs. And those are just just advanced statistics.  He runs a Colts offense that was 31st last year to 5th this year.  He's going to break, or he's already broken, most of Peyton Mannings rookie records.  Just because he doesn't own a higher completion percentage or fewer INTs doesn't equate to his being pedestrian, or your "double standard" charge.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt looks like both Andrew Luck and RGIII will most likely be headed to the Pro-Bowl this year.

He's also better at Vick than running the football.Vick is considered by most a running QB, so, if RG3 is better at running than a running QB....Look, you and the rest of your Skins fans can mash the downvote button all you want, but turn on the TV, watch some NBC Sports/CBS Sports/ESPN and you'll hear the same thing: RG3 runs too much for his own good, and it's already knocked him out of games this season.  The theme is the same throughout: if Griffin wants a long career, he needs to stay in the pocket.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs RG3 the type of player who will be highly injury prone for the duration of his career, similar to Michale Vick?  by  TheRealSamBellin  nfl[+]tergiversation -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)[]tergiversation -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoWait, wait, wait./checksteamflairRedskins fan.
