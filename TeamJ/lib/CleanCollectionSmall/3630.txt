Grade SchoolHome> U.S.Official: 27 Dead in Conn. School ShootingBy By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN Associated PressNEWTOWN, Conn. December 14, 2012 (AP)(ABCNEWS.com)A shooting at a Connecticut elementary school Friday left 27 people dead, including 18 children, an official said.The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way. Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason, said the gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown was killed and apparently had two guns.A law enforcement official in Washington said the attacker was a 20-year-old man with ties to the school and that one of the guns was a .223-caliber rifle. The official also said that New Jersey State Police were searching a location in that state in connection with the shootings. That official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the source was not authorized to speak on the record about the developing criminal investigation.Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was fine."It's alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America," he said.The superintendent's office said the district had locked down schools in Newtown, about 60 miles northeast of New York City.

Andrea Rynn, a spokeswoman at the hospital, said it had three patients from the school but she did not have information on the extent or nature of their injuries.State police said Newtown police called them around 9:40 a.m. A SWAT team was among the throngs of police to respond.A photo posted by The Newtown Bee newspaper showed a group of young students  some crying, others looking visibly frightened  being escorted by adults through a parking lot in a line, hands on each other's shoulders.Mergim Bajraliu, 17, heard the gunshots echo from his home and raced to check on his 9-year-old sister at the school. He said his sister, who was fine, heard a scream come over the intercom at one point. He said teachers were shaking and crying as they came out of the building."Everyone was just traumatized," he said.Richard Wilford's 7-year-old son, Richie, is in the second grade at the school. His son told him that he heard a noise that "sounded like what he described as cans falling."The boy told him a teacher went out to check on the noise, came back in, locked the door and had the kids huddle up in the corner until police arrived."There's no words," Wilford said. "It's sheer terror, a sense of imminent danger, to get to your child and be there to protect him."The White House said Barack Obama was notified of the shooting and his spokesman Jay Carney said the president had "enormous sympathy for families that are affected."Associated Press writers Jim Fitzgerald in Newtown, Pete Yost in Washington, D.C., and Michael Melia in Hartford contributed to this report.Follow @abcon Twitter, become a fan on FacebookComment & ContributeDo you have more information about this topic?
