These patent laws were put in place to ensure that the big pharma companies have an incentive to continue researching and developing new drugs. If they shortened the patent life, then a company that was heavily involved in R&D might decide to just screw it and only make generics since they would be more profitable doing so. The companies selling the drugs at a high cost aren't necessarily the problem, it's not a black and white issue at all. There's health insurance providers, generic manufacturers, and these big pharma companies that all have to exist at a certain balance for all of them to become profitable.One thing you might find interesting is that the government sometimes subsidizes pharmaceutical companies to research and produce "orphan" drugs for conditions that something like less than 2,000 of Americans have. Otherwise if you had a rare disease you would be absolutely 100% SOL because there would be no economic incentive for any company to develop a drug for you. The front page of the NY Times had an article about a week ago about a case being heard to shorten the patent life from 20 years but I'm on my phone, may post a link later if I can find itpermalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]LCDDFA 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]LCDDFA 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoWhat sucks is that the news media knows this. They KNOW they're being fucked up interviewing the kids like this and they know revealing all the information about the shooters is fucked and out of line but people (unfortunately I can't say I won't read it myself) are going to read it no matter how fucked up it is. I have faith that a lot of good people will come together and try and make the best of this unspeakable tragedy but it's beyond fucked no matter what happens nowpermalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Not everything he tried on it worked like he wanted it to but it showed how much potential he had with songs like TV on the radio and beautiful bliss. Plus Gucci killed it on pretty girls!! I can't hate him for taking that Rick Ross money though, dude was on his grind for agespermalinksavecontextfull commentsI hate when rappers talk shit in a verse and then try to take it back in that same verse.

The pastel colored shorts and sperrys with Oxford shirts wearing white kids eat his shit up so much... Not knocking that scene (but actually, I am because it's lame as fuck and played out) but I can't get behind Macklemore when he has kids I know going "see look hip hop can be deep, Wings is the truth!"permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some rappers you used to fuck with but now absolutely never listen to?  by  downtothegwoundin  hiphopheads[+]LCDDFA 7 points8 points9 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]LCDDFA 7 points8 points9 points 2 days agoWiz..

Pancreatic cancer especially needs to be treated as early and aggressively as possible, but even with relatively early detection it's a particularly fucked up cancer. It has something like a 4-5% survival rate over the long-term. My main point was that nobody likes the guy that tries to take away from a 3-time cancer survivor like that lolpermalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that George Karl has fought and won against prostate, neck and throat cancer.  by  Ishoin  nba[+]LCDDFA 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]LCDDFA 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoYeah man, you're right... people with money never die from cancer. Remember Steve Jobs? I don't see how you can find a negative in this; I hope you never have to experience seeing any of your friends/family members battle cancer (statistically you will, though) but this is pretty inspiring and it's cool to hear about shit like this. Don't be that guy.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrinidad James - Popped a Molly I'm Sweating For 6 minutes  by  kailmanin  hiphopheads[+]LCDDFA 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]LCDDFA 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoYou've been saying this on a lot of threads and idk why you aren't getting more up votes...

A lot of people will fuck with Molly but not touch blow because that shit can be cut with anything... Very interesting point about the economic aspect lol I don't know how much of an extent that could be affecting the trend but it'd be dumb to write that off completelypermalinksavecontextfull commentsTrinidad James - Popped a Molly I'm Sweating For 6 minutes  by  kailmanin  hiphopheads[+]LCDDFA 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]LCDDFA 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoDepends on where you're from.. The shit is by far the most popular drug (obviously discounting that loud) around the NJ area as far as I can see lately, even Oxys and blues have fallen off in terms of being the cool thing to do (might attribute that to OxyContin changing their formulation but probably just Molly blew up with edm and shit) but they're still gonna always be huge because of how addicting opiates can be. But yea Molly is fucking huge now because of edm concerts and festivals and even people rolling at house parties all the time these days but there is no better place to roll than at Trinidad jame$ concerts id imaginepermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are your 10 unpopular hiphop opinions?  by  frankeoceanin  hiphopheads[+]LCDDFA 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]LCDDFA 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoHaha yeah if anyone else had spit Jay's verse on monster he would've scrapped that shit real quick. But Hov killed it as usual on watch the throne and Ye had some of his laziest verses so in the end it's probably best to just let Jay do his thingpermalinksavecontextfull commentsAdele- Rolling in the Deep (Jamie xx Remix) Ft.

Im thirteen and so are you. Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadnt met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. Thats you. And were still at camp as long as were on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. Were still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I dont know if you do or dont more-than-like me."the fuck are the downvotes for? you guys get behind this lolpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat websites does everyone go to for new hip hop?

Walkin on the moon with the-dream and American boy also both came out right around 808s I believe.
