At 2/3 of Sony's fee they did a phenomenal job. I can't speak for their iPhone work, but I would assume great things.One more thing, It's amazing how they manage with the 24 hours turn-around when the shop was stacked to the ceiling with broken PS3 and 360. permalinksavecontextfull commentsKnife-wielding man slashes 22 children in China  by  FlaviaTitusin  news[+]that_mn_kid 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]that_mn_kid 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours agoProbably not. More likely, in the cases of untrained gunmen, the victim will die from blood loss or survive with crippling injuries because they missed vitals. permalinksavecontextfull commentsKnife-wielding man slashes 22 children in China  by  FlaviaTitusin  news[+]that_mn_kid 14 points15 points16 points 22 hours ago*(0 children)[]that_mn_kid 14 points15 points16 points 22 hours ago*the rifle was found in his car (likely that he did not use it). EDIT: 2 handguns were recovered on scene (on the shooter's body). The rifle was involved; it is unknown whether or not it was fired. With an ongoing incident like this, the logistics (what guns he had? which were fired) will be hazy. Right now, they're not even sure of the shooter's identity, Adam or his brother, Ryan. EDIT: According to CBS live coverage, the shooter is now identified as Adam Lanza, 20 not 24.permalinksavecontextfull comments5012Will I meet Sazh in ff13-2 without buy the DLC?

I assumed it was going to be a tacked-on Horde copy-paste paving the way for a half-assed singleplayer, DLC price gouge.I was pleasantly surprised. The shooting felt good, the talents fit in nicely; with a verbally-active squad (of biotics), matches made for a lot of fun.The Free DLC's were very nice on Bioware's part (part of me still thing they are free to salvage the community's good will, and they would have been paid if the PR shitstorm didn't hit)It's not perfect though; the unlock process was, and still is, a pain in the ass. I still only have one Krogan, playing on-an-off since March.(my N7 ranking is about 2000) The connectivity between the multiplayer and singleplayer was annoying. (but save editors fixed that)Overall, no where near as bad as I expected, but not as good as I hoped.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are those moments in games that made you yell "Aw, bullshit!"  by  MojoLesterin  Games[+]that_mn_kid 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]that_mn_kid 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoI cheated my way through that:Instead of triggering the tanks, by capturing the base, right away (like my first time), I moved everyone into position beforehand.

I did not know this was in the making. It seems like Relic is dropping it as an MMO, and more in line with Space Marine (singleplayer with more "traditional" multiplayer).EDIT: the dev is Vigil (Darksiders), not Relic.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some sequels you have been waiting for that are probably never happening?  by  tommyvodkain  Games[+]that_mn_kid 18 points19 points20 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]that_mn_kid 18 points19 points20 points 5 days agoI don't think/rember Relic said/saying anything about Space Marine being a one-off title.

Within the movies, there are great scenes and terrible scenes placed back-to-back:In Pulp Fiction, the scenes with Vincent and Jules (burger, marvin, restaurant) were great, but the rest of the movie just feel like fillers.Same with Inglourious Basterds, but there are a lot more good scenes just because Hans Landa scared the living shit out of me.The only part of Reservor Dogs is the restaurant. Then, it's all filler.Never saw Kill Bill, so I'll withhold judgment.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you had to assign your ex a warning label, what would it be?  by  Whore_Bagin  AskReddit[+]that_mn_kid 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]that_mn_kid 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoNecrophilia is illegal in all 50 states of the US.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
