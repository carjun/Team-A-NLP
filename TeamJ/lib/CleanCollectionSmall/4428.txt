J. Yochum emerged from the evening prayer service teary-eyed.Somebody in our church lost a child today, she said as she walked away from the white clapboard parish into the frigid air.The tragedy is overwhelming, she said, adding that the child was a kindergarten student. The family had not attended the service.Though she works as a counselor, she could find no way to make sense of the killings. You cant, she said.Many people in the community seemed to know someone touched by the tragedy.ReutersPeople stand with candles outside the overflow area of a vigil at the Saint Rose of Lima church in Newtown.Mike Binck, from nearby Monroe, Conn., said he is friends with a bus driver who transport children to the elementary school. Its a sobering thing and hes troubled, he said.Outside the church, Mr. Binck was questioned by a TV reporter who said she was from a United Kingdom station. Would the tragedy cause something to finally be done about gun control in America? she asked.I think something will be done, he replied. This is horrific.Hundreds of people gathered outside of the red brick facade of St. Rose of Lima Church after a prayer service ended, some carrying candles.Gov.

Its going to be a long healing process, Ms. Hepburn said.Keith Goldstein, an 18-year-old music student who attends Western Connecticut State University, was on his way to one of the memorials to be with a friend whose six-year-old daughter died in the shooting.More In Newtown shootingDetails Emerge About Family of Suspected GunmanBloomberg Calls on Obama to Act Against Gun ViolenceNewtown School Therapist: Principal 'Didn't Think Twice' About HelpingTeacher Describes Shooting at Newtown SchoolThe way that he looked at her, she meant the world to him. I just want to find some reason as to why this happened. She was adorable, Mr. Goldstein said.The shooting left Newtown residents like Tamara Dougherty, 42, shaken.To have something like this happen, I dont even know where to start with this.

I saw young kids tonight at a restaurant and tried  but failed, to imagine Kindergarteners murdered  in America.  I struggled.  As to a serious discussion, what Ive read thus far falls seriously short.  1. Will this discussion include finally admitting our country is negligent in caring for the mentally ill, and too politically correct to recognize some  many  should be locked up?  Is someone willing to tell the ACLU these alternate universe folks really should NEVER have any civil rights? Its time to reopen sensitive and humane looney bins.2. Are we  the entire American society  ready to seriously and honestly talk about rap music that denigrates and humiliates women, discuss violent TV shows and movies, and ready to challenge previously protected free speech?  Because if we arent ready to admit this irresponsibility desensitizes American youth, then we are not ready to have an serious discussion.3. Are American parents ready to admit that our educators are largely  VERY LARGELY  left leaning or dues paying members of left leaning unions?  Hate to bring it up but some leftists sensibilities include not allowing ARMED School Resource Officers (SRO) on campus.  These SROs are cops.  They are the good guys, but not armed?  Many schools denigrate, punish or ridicule teachers that are lawfully okay to carry  and competent  to carry  but they have to park off school grounds if their firearm is in their car?  Unions that think GUN FREE ZONE actually carries meaning?4.  Will the Left finally admit there are truly MILLIONS of Americans that safely, responsibly and legally use, train with and yes  ENJOY  firearms every day? There are an incredible amount of law abiding firearms owning citizens that are ready, willing and WANTING to be used to teach others.  But these same folks would really prefer not to be ridiculed by their fellow citizens, the media and their government  Will that ever happen? Doubtful. Serious discussion?  Not holding my breath for a fair discussion.About MetropolisRSSA blog of reporting and news from New York City, Metropolis is produced by Aaron Rutkoff and Carrie Melago, with contributions from the Wall StreetJournal staff.
