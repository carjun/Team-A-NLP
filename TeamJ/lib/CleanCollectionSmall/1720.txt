Two first-class passengers offered their seats, not knowing he was a vet. They did it regardless, likely out of compassion. They probably wanted to make sure he was comfortable during the flight. And Delta should be being attacked for this. How hard is it to allow a willing passenger to move to the back of the plane in order for another passenger to be more comfortable, vet or not? That should be standard procedure, if the airline gave two shits about customer care. So you lose one goddamned minute of flight time, so you bend a rule. Who the fuck is going to report you for that? Sorry you're getting downvoted, because I agree with you absolutely 100%.Edit: confused on so many levels as to why this concept is so hard to grasp for seemingly almost all of you. I don't mind the downvotes, really. But could someone at least explain why they disagree? permalinksavecontextfull commentsdriving skills  by  klemensbaumin  WTF[+]dih_key 8 points9 points10 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]dih_key 8 points9 points10 points 12 hours agoNo source, sorry.

And I don't like the fact that you're practically begging for attention because of your friend. Also, again, not to sound insensitive, but she made the choice to kill herself. Had she simply moved, I seriously doubt people would recognize her from the picture. She did have other options, despite "people like me" harassing her. Again, if your story is true, I am truly sorry for your loss and the fact that people drove her to commit suicide. I know it's a very real problem and I do not condone it whatsoever. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

He was a really great dog and always aware of his size around small children. Never showed aggression unless being protective of house, owner, etc. One day, we are at a family friend's and he came along. One of their kids took the rib bone he was chewing on to try and play fetch. My dog bit him in the face, and it pierced his lip and eyelid. Luckily, no stitches were required and the family friend was a lifelong friend and really understanding. The kid then approached my dog on his own terms, us not knowing, and we found him cuddled up with my dog. Don't know why my dog attacked, but despite the amends, we put him down later that day. There isn't really room when it comes to this. A dog may be a member of the family, but when things like sight or safety is threatened by a pet, it's better to put them down than to take the risk of it happening again with possibly worse outcomes.
