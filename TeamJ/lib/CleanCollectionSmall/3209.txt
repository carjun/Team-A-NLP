Most of those who died were just young children with their whole lives ahead of them. And every parent in America has a heart heavy with hurt."President Obama talked about those killed in the weekly address. "Among the fallen were also teachers  men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. We grieve for the families of those we lost. And we keep in our prayers the parents of those who survived. Because as blessed as they are to have their children home, they know that their childs innocence has been torn away far too early."President Obama listed the tragedies that occurred recently. "As a nation, we have endured far too many of these tragedies in the last few years. An elementary school in Newtown. A shopping mall in Oregon. A house of worship in Wisconsin. A movie theater in Colorado. Countless street corners in places like Chicago and Philadelphia."President Obama also urged action. "Any of these neighborhoods could be our own. So we have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this. Regardless of the politics.
