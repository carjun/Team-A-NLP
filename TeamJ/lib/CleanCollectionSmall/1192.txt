Most strained to remember him as his name emerged as the suspected shooter in one of the most horrific mass shootings in U.S. history. Some thought he dropped out of Newtown High School, or moved away.But Mr. Lanza was in town all along. He was described by the few with vivid memories of him in terms that have become achingly familiar in the aftermath of mass shootings: an emotionally off-kilter loner, sometimes dressed in black, who moved on the margins of his community.Newtown, Conn., yearbook 2008Adam Lanza in 2008, seen in a yearbook photo as a high-school sophomore in Newtown, Conn.                Jeannie Pasacreta, whose son and his friends were classmates of Mr. Lanza, 20 years old, said they described him as "very withdrawn. He would dress in military gear or black." Ms. Pasacreta, a psychologist and nurse practitioner, said her son, Nicholas, gathered with some of his friends the night of the shooting and talked about Mr. Lanza.Marsha Moskowitz, a retired school-bus driver, said Mr. Lanza stood out in her mind as the lonely boy who never smiled. "I remembered him because he was so quiet," she said. "He was shy, reserved, pretty much a lonerhe didn't really smile or say 'hi' to anyone on the bus."Police say that alleged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, appears to have broken into Sandy Hook elementary School to gain access to the building. Photo: Associated Press. Mr. Lanza was living with his 52-year-old mother, Nancy. He shot and killed his mother at home on Friday, then allegedly went to Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 26 more people, including 20 children, before he took his own life. The state's chief medical examiner determined Ms. Lanza was killed by multiple gunshot wounds to her head; Mr. Lanza took his life with a single bullet to his head.From the outside, Mr. Lanza's life appeared to be one of comfort: He and his mother lived in a nicely kept home in an upscale neighborhood called Bennett's Farm. Mr. Lanza's 24-year-old brother, Ryan, briefly misidentified by a law-enforcement official as the shooter Friday, attended college at nearby Quinnipiac University before moving to Hoboken, N.J., to work for Ernst & Young. Ms. Lanza was a gun collector and avid shooter, friends said. She showed one of "her beautiful rifles, an old collectible she was very proud of" to Dan Holmes, a local landscaper who worked on her property and who would see her from time to time at a bar in town called My Place, where bands played.Mr. Holmes said she and her sons "would go target shooting as a family."Jim Leff, a local writer and musician who says he knew Ms. Lanza, wrote on his blog after the shooting that she was a "big, big gun fan."It isn't clear where Ms. Lanza used her guns. Dean Price, director of the Wooster Mountain Shooting Range in nearby Danbury, said he spent several hours with federal firearms agents late Friday night going through the last two months of his sign-in sheets. They didn't find the Lanzas. Enlarge ImageCloseMichael AqiusNancy Lanza, mother of alleged shooter Adam LanzaBut some neighbors noted that the Paugussett State Forest, a few blocks from Ms. Lanza's home, was frequented by hunters during hunting season and appeared occasionally to be used for target practice.Ms. Lanza "seemed to really enjoy gardening and landscaping," said Newtown resident Rhonda Cullens, who said she and Ms. Lanza were part of a group of neighborhood women who used to gather once a month to play bunco, a parlor game with dice.                Mary Ann Lanza, who was married to Adam's now-deceased grandfather, said the Lanzas "were a lovely family," who were close with cousins, aunts and uncles who lived across New England. But there were family strains. Adam's parents divorced in 2009, after a long separation, said Mary Ann Lanza. While Adam's father Peter Lanza, a tax director and vice president for GE Energy Financial Services, was outgoing, Nancy could be "unsociable," Mary Ann Lanza said.Some neighbors said Ms. Lanza wasn't particularly social, while others in town described her as warm, open and gregariousa favorite at a local bar who sometimes gave Red Sox tickets to friends there.Ms. Lanza ate at My Place, the local bar, as much as three days a week and enjoyed a craft beer or two with her meal, said bartender Michael Agius, 26. "She was just a part of the bar family over there," Mr. Agius said. "She was such a friendly person."Ms. Lanza grew up in Kingston, N.H., and lived there near her extended family until moving to Newtown in 1998. The family is well-known in the small New Hampshire town, where Ms. Lanza's mother was a school nurse and her brother, James Champion, works in law enforcement. Mr. Champion had planned to speak Saturday evening but was too distraught, officials said. Kingston Police Chief Donald Briggs Jr. called Ms. Lanza a "very, very kind, considerate, loving young lady.""She was very involved in the community, very well respected," Mr. Briggs said. Adam Lanza seemed to pull away from his family in recent months, according to Mr. Holmes, the local landscaper, and others. When Nancy took his older brother Ryan to see a concert in New Orleans, Adam didn't join them. "He prefers to be alone," Mr. Holmes said Nancy told him when he asked why Adam wasn't going. "It got to the point where she did not have a close relationship with her son."Adam's father is believed to have remarried last year. A friend's online holiday card shows a photo of Shelley Cudiner and Peter Lanza at their marriage celebration on New Year's Day 2011. Ms. Cudiner didn't answer her office phone on Friday afternoon. Peter Lanza didn't respond to requests for comment.Outside Peter Lanza's home in Stamford, Conn., police tape blocked a stretch of road in the hilly, wooded neighborhood of sprawling upscale homes late Friday night. Police officers and agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation walked in and out of the home; unmarked moving-van like trucks were parked outside.                 Jim McDade, 59, who lives a few houses away from Nancy Lanza, said that his daughter Maura, 21, and son James Patrick, 24, would take the school bus on the corner with Adam and Ryan when they were children. Mr. McDade said he remembers that Adam was quiet. "He preferred his own company," he said.James Patrick went to the Lanzas' house a couple of times as a child to watch cartoons with Ryan. He remembers little of Adam but agreed with his father that he was "generally quiet." He said Ms. Lanza "seemed like a nice lady." But, he said, the family wasn't "the most social members of the community." He remembers the house being "nice, clean. It seemed like a good place to live."                 Gina McDade, Mr. McDade's wife, saw Nancy from time to time at the local grocery store. She remembers her putting up Christmas lights outside the house and as a member of the ladies' night club."I feel so bad for Nancy and the tarnishing of her family," Mrs. McDade said. "She was a stay-at-home mom who loved her kids.She was like anybody else, she would decorate the house [on Christmas], the house was always pristine. She was like any other housewife." Mr. Leff, the local writer and musician who says he knew Ms. Lanza, described her on his blog as a generous person though "a little high-strung." On his blog, Mr. Leff relayed an instance when Ms. Lanza, overhearing him speak with a mutual friend in need of a loan, decided to write a check to help."Now that I've been filled in by friends about how difficult her troubled son (the shooter) was making things for her, I understand that it wasn't that Nancy was overwrought about the trivialities of everyday life, but that she was handling a very difficult situation with uncommon grace," Mr. Leff wrote on the blog. "Plus, she was a big fan of my trombone playing. My next jazz solo's for you, Nancy."Rachel Cromidas, Josh Dawsey, Erica E.
