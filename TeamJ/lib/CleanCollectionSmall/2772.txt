Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]t0nkys 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]t0nkys 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI was going to essentially say that, but I thought it might be flippant of me to do so. Because there is that element of a "kill count" of sorts. It is one of the ways as a school shooter that you don't fade into complete obscurity. On the gun law side of things, I don't live in the US so I don't really have much grounding to argue for and against, because it is a different culture. I can't claim to know what is right or wrong. But if you really want to hurt someone, you can do so whatever country you are in with whatever tools. You are just less likely to see spree killings in countries where guns are not freely available.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]t0nkys -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (0 children)[]t0nkys -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoAll I can say is whatever the age group involved, this is shit. There are ramifications to the whole community. Maybe they need to look at the school system or the mental health system, maybe it is entirely unrelated. I have researched a lot about Columbine and there is never one answer; there are a lot of twisting paths, some of them obscured or less defined than others. I expect that there will be no real clarity in this situation too.I also expect there will be a fruitless debate about gun laws. The main argument I see is, "people kill people!" but it is a lot easier and impersonal to shoot someone. Impersonal in the sense that you pull a trigger and that is that, whereas stabbing someone for example involves a lot more activity. I don't mean to sound callous, but I'd be interested to see if it was two shooters. It is a rare scenario for school shootings. Interesting dynamics. permalinksavecontextfull comments[Request] Homeless single parent father and 7 year old daughter living in a shelter.

There's a tv room (but I don't go in it because of the men being creepy). Also most the people I've met in here have a tv. I'm actually in the minority...

AMA!  by  [deleted]in  IAmA[+]t0nkys 43 points44 points45 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]t0nkys 43 points44 points45 points 4 days agoI think the issue charlie888 was describing is that often if you don't have a diagnosis, you don't get into a service. For example, my mental health problems are known but I don't currently receive treatment for those problems because I haven't been diagnosed. What you are suggesting makes absolute logical sense - however, the system doesn't work that way. I say that, but I am actually diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome and despite this I don't receive any help because no service exists for it. So I suppose it can go both ways...permalinksavecontextfull commentsRow, row, row your boat...

They were supposed to have our names on. My name is a very common name, whilst my sisters name is unusually spelt. My sister got her named keyring fine. I got a keyring saying 'They Didn't Have Your Name.'There was also the time when for my birthday I got a freebie from a magazine from my parents. It was some shitty make-up. I don't even wear make-up...EDIT: Nearly forgot to include this one: the time my 'friends' (that's a whole other story) gave me a McDonald's toy for my birthday, between them. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAs requested, I Am A 911 Public Safety Dispatcher.

They played the recording and you could hear the wife dragging him onto the floor, and her panicked voice telling him not to leave her. He originally had no pulse but the actions of the dispatcher and wife saved his life.I thought I'd point out one of the positive things that have happened in the series.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlright we've discovered what all Men of Reddit do, now Women of Reddit what are some things you are sure all women do or have done?

I've tried emailing her and I have tried bloody hard to work with her but nothing good has come out of it. She's very tangential. I told her we weren't working together well, and she somehow got into saying that people won't like me if I'm how I am - honest. Which was a real blow because it was the only part of me I was okay with. Thank you for the sentiment.
