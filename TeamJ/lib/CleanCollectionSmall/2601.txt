Banks refuse to do business with state-legal dispensaries causing them to become cash-only businesses. They have no access to loans or business checking accounts, and can't accept credit cards. This causes their operating expenses to be higher and limits their growth and sustainability. This also makes it harder to pay the taxes they're required to, since you can't send the state an envelope full of money.All this is because at a Federal level marijuana is still illegal and there's a lot of uncertainty as to what would happen is the Feds were to raid that dispensary. Until a lot of the back-end financial regulation either gets a specific waiver or it is somehow made clear that the banks have no liability then these dispensaries will continue under this financial hardship.Link to podcastpermalinksavecontextfull commentsObama Wont Go After State Marijuana Legalization: We Have Bigger Fish To Fry  by  wang-bangerin  politics[+]coooolbeans 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes ago (0 children)[]coooolbeans 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes agoYup, it's pretty much impossible to find a bank to do business with even a legal MMJ dispensary, causing them to become a cash-only business. This causes a lot of headaches such as lack of loans, business checking accounts, and credit card acceptance.Check out this episode of NPR's Planet Money for more info on the banking side of it.Linkpermalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
