We should stop looking at pie-in-the-sky solutions to this problem that will run afoul of the 2nd amendment (hence them being pie-in-the-sky as a practical matter), and start fixing whatever underlying issues we can. And this should be bipartisan.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 19 minutes agoWith all due respect, you merely misunderstood my point. My point was that Finland was smaller than the USA, so it makes sense that they have fewer absolute shootings -- it would be truly bizarre if a country the size of Finland had more shooting that the USA. And I chose Finland not at random, but for exactly the reasons you say and the numbers you cite. In absolute numbers the USA is far worse, but in a relative sense, according to its population, it's shockingly similar. This highlights the fact that, while the USA has the worst problem with this stuff, it's also a larger country and that is a small part of what leads to more incidents as an absolute number.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

We can't make quick pivots on this policy at all based on certain events, it's literally not possible. So, it's a catastrophic situation, but we're kind of stuck since 99% of (non-gang related) American gun owners are law-abiding and want to keep their guns, and we have a shitty, broken, decimated system for figuring out who the 1% might be. I'd say the latter is the bigger problem, and weirdly the more solveable right now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

While it was a shooting a school, it was more of a personal incident rather than what I think most people consider to be a "school shooting". Although if you're going to take that off, a lot of the American school shootings would also be taken off, as they are more personal issues where one person shoots one other person, rather than the broader and more random horror of what we've seen today.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 31 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 31 minutes agoI'd say the law is fine as is.... Our mental health system could use a ton of work. Especially on cost.I agree that there are various solutions, and this is a big one. A problem as it currently stands, as a practical matter, is that the same party that's for guns is also against increased mental health and social work related spending that might mitigate the fallout of having so many guns in circulation (not in every case, of course, but in many cases). I hope that such spending can come to be seen as a bipartisan issue.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]alphafemto 5 points6 points7 points 36 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto 5 points6 points7 points 36 minutes agoI didn't comment on frequency, did I?Yes, it happens far, far, far more often in the USA -- and that's something Americans need to accept. However, acting like other cultures don't have the same sickness to some degree indicates someone who's making more of a nationalistic (or, in this case, anti-nationalistic -- being against the USA and China) rather than a substantive/interesting one. This madness exists in all cultures, the USA has variables that put them high on the continuum of this particular problemIt makes sense to accept it as a broadly human problem which the USA struggles with the most at the current time, rather than a strictly American/Chinese culture problem, which it plainly isn't.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Although it would be surprising if Finland had as many shootings as the USA. I accept that the USA has the worst problem with this stuff, but it's hardly a black-and-white issue where one culture is sick and the other is well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]alphafemto 18 points19 points20 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]alphafemto 18 points19 points20 points 1 hour agoI see this argument a lot, and I'm not sure if you think you're being clever or if you really don't understand. You're avoiding the reality of what the gun laws would be. They would not be laws that would add on a small amount of time for using guns in a crime such as murder -- I agree these laws are mostly useless in the US, and they don't make a whole lot of sense in any case.The new guns laws would be systemic in nature -- regulating the sale of guns far more tightly, regulating the type of guns it is legal to sell/possess, etc. -- i.e. they would be supply-side not demand-side (to borrow the term), and act to decrease the number of guns in circulation, not act as a personal deterrent against using guns.permalinksavecontextfull commentsYSK that if you want to sign up for a "free trial" but need to provide a credit card you can try using one of these test numbers -- they will look legit to the system so you can sign up, but when they try to charge you after the trial period, it will fail.  by  boingerin  YouShouldKnow[+]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (0 children)[]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoBut in this case it could easily be tied to the person by Visa, and wreck their credit if the company decides it wants to get its money.

And, if the Soviets had taken Western Europe, I think it's silly to imagine that this would be a "win" for Western Europe in World War II, when either they'd continue to hold it weakly or World War III would immediately start with the US invading Europe to kick them out (the US being necessary to any situation in which Western Europe is liberated from outside control, i.e. a "win", which is my whole point).permalinksavecontextfull comments10-part TV series, The Untold History of the United States.

Or the Soviets would have been the liberators of all of Europe, and not just the Eastern half, and given their track record they would've been loathe to give up control.

To cut funding for money to improve the lives of the mentally disabled? I'm all for implementing better checks and more thorough analysis of individual situations -- but that costs more money, too. Those people checking up on the realities of beneficiaries' situations need salaries, too. I feel like such stories are merely serving as touchstones for those seeking slash-and-burn socio-economic policies, and not the actual call to action that they are: we need a more robust social work function within our government's budget. Social workers are vital to our economy, we ought to employ more of them and pay them more.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
