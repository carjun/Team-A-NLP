The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way.It wasn't clear how many people were injured at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.A dispatcher at the Newtown Volunteer Ambulance Corps said a teacher had been shot in the foot and taken to Danbury Hospital. Andrea Rynn, a spokeswoman at the hospital, said it had three patients from the school but she did not have information on the extent or nature of their injuries.Brenda Lebinski, whose 8-year-old daughter attends the school, was among the parents who raced to check on their children."I saw her and it was the happiest moment of my life," she said.Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was not harmed."It's alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America," he said.Lisa Terifay, who was holding her two children outside the school, said she was stunned."I still can't believe it's happened in my town," she said.The superintendent's office said the district had locked down schools in Newtown, about 60 miles northeast of New York City. Schools in neighboring towns also were locked down as a precaution.State police said Newtown police called them around 9:40 a.m. A SWAT team was among the throngs of police to respond.Photos from the scene showed young students  some crying, others looking visibly frightened  being escorted by adults through a parking lot in a line, hands on each other's shoulders.Connecticut's governor was on the scene in Newtown.

This was a deliberate strategy by the US right wing to scare gun lovers to the polls with  phony issues about Dems wanting to take away their guns.  It cost Kerry the Presidential election.  As with their other false-flag issues trumped up to scare voters to the polls the blowback is fully upon us.  The US right wing has literally de-civilized us to where we rank at the bottom of every quality of life standard amongst the modern nations, and are not even considered a modern nation any longer.gregrocker: We need to stop referring to some amorphous "gun culture."http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/gregrocker/sandy-hook-elementary-school-shooting_n_2300831_213595807.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.
