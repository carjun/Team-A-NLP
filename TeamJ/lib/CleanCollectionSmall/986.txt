They refuse to work with my husband. They never told him he was even ever able to see them. The case worker just told me that is why this all started. He has tried before and it's part of the reason he has not seen them is he was pretty much told up front he's a scum and will never see his kids. He was not aware that was just commentary from the case worker. How do we move forward when they refuse to work with him? The whole court house is like that. They loose his paperwork, never get back to him, refuse to tell him things about the case, refuse to send him a copy of his file. In the last week I got all that done no problem. They are like this with other fathers too we know. I am very lost on how to get past that. It shut many doors because of an office full of hateful women. That is the main reason I was handling most of the work. I talk to the lawyers. I organize all his paperwork and make sure I understand it so he knows what he is signing. Yes he is capable of doing that but I work part time and he works full time and own his own small business. Please don't tell me if he loved his kids he would find time. We are in no position to be taking time off. We will have more money later but were hoping to get it all started I assume this all takes awhile to get going. I didn't mean to get mad but it is so hard and disgusting to me that everyone assumes he's the bad father. She uses those kids and laughs in his face about it. I am the one that has been here for him through all the tears and hard times. I get that there is dead beat dads. But assuming they are all like that is wrong and it was a bit personally offensive. It's hard to keep your emotions in check all the time. I do apologize. I am looking for honest help. permalinksavecontextfull commentsStarting the search  by  mrsminigigin  Adoption[+]mrsminigig[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours agothanks I think I might. It's nice to tell my friends and family about this stuff but they always seem to glaze over just a little bit like they don't really understand. How can they I guess. Glad to chat with others that do. =)permalinksavecontextfull commentsAdvice about requesting Parent Time  by  mrsminigigin  legaladvice[+]mrsminigig[S] -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig[S] -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours agoThere is more to the story but do not dare think it is because of my husband. A father that does not want to hurt his children will not rip them from their mother. That is not how we want this done. That is not how my husband was ever going to do it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAdvice about requesting Parent Time  by  mrsminigigin  legaladvice[+]mrsminigig[S] -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig[S] -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours agoI am not sure what it was. It was a release form. But I am able to talk to the case worker make changes or ask questions and request info. We are in MN. The kids are in MN. As far as we know they still have his last name. But she has said her husband is going to adopt them and she has forged things in the past. But if they weren't his kids any more we wouldn't still be paying child support still. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAdvice about requesting Parent Time  by  mrsminigigin  legaladvice[+]mrsminigig[S] -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig[S] -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours agoWell I do not think you read it all right. I was wondering if CPS would want to look in to us not her. He has tried for years to see them. All child support is paid. She has does horrible things to my husband and her own kids. She uses them to. He has tried to give them so much. He has sent gifts for every occasion. We have helped the mother with finances so she can finish college. It was all an attempt to keep things civil but obviously that isn't working. Her husband is abusive to her. We have seen the bruses and cuts. She is morman so leaving him is not an option in her mind because of her faith. She also has 6 other kids. My husband also never signed anything. He has never been to court. 6 weeks after his daughter was born child support started coming out of his pay at work. We are positive she signed his name on a lit of paper work. She use to do it to his bank accounts. We do every thing we are asked to. We pay what we are told to. All he wants is to be able to see his kids. Can she legally tell him he can't? permalinksavecontextfull commentsAdvice about requesting Parent Time  by  mrsminigigin  legaladvice[+]mrsminigig[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 20 hours agoWe signed paperwork that gives me the ability to speak on his behalf.  I have to most of the time because he works yet still needs some stuff with the county handled. My husband is also very afraid to move forward. There is a very bad stigma around absent fathers and he is not able to get anyone to help him but they are very willing to talk with me. Is there anyway I can get things set up so he can move forward with things? Can I get things in line, put in paperwork, set court dates, make plans so he can do this? What is the first step? If we had to go to court what is expected? Is there anything like CPS checks we need to be ready for? What things would shut this down? What can we do to have the best chance possible? permalinksavecontextfull comments7012Advice about requesting Parent Time (self.legaladvice)submitted 21 hours ago by mrsminigig to legaladvice10 commentssharecancelloading...8234Starting the search (self.Adoption)submitted 22 hours ago by mrsminigig to Adoption3 commentssharecancelloading...TIL that 50 Cent has set a goal of feeding 1 billion people in Africa by 2016.  by  spedmunkiin  todayilearned[+]mrsminigig 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoThanks to Aziz Ansari, every time I think of 50 Cent I think about him not knowing what a grapefruit is. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

That guy use to protest right downtown, just a block away from my school, Harbor City International School. He called me and all my girlfriends sluts and wished us painful rapping because we chose to have larger boobs and cut our hair. He was also with a church group that has a van with a dead baby on it. They protest at the center for women everyday. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIve had it, 2X.

I don't know why. I know hair grows to keep you clean but I have been shaving for about 8 years and I got so use to it I guess. My husband happens to enjoy going down and as a courtesy I like to keep extra clean and shaven. He manscapes as well, a habbit more men should pick up imo. Not that they have to shave, but just trim the hedges guys! permalinksavecontextfull commentsX-ray of My 17 month old daughter after she swallowed an ornament hook. Story in comments  by  the-d-manin  WTF[+]mrsminigig 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig 1 point2 points3 points 10 days agoI am kinda glad I saw this post. It made me feel better. I am a new parent and I almost gave my baby tequila today. Thats fucking right. My husband put a tequila cranberry drink in the Welch's Cherry Blast jug. I even let her lick some that dripped on my hand, she fucking loved it. Then I got a whiff of it. It didn't smell like cherry blast. I felt like a terrible parent. It's kinda nice to know shit just happens sometimes. And you get through it. Thanks for posting. Hope she feels better. Kids have the best resilient rating. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis is what happens when birds eat holly berries. - Imgur  by  jpop287in  WTF[+]mrsminigig 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoTis the season. permalinksavecontextfull commentsA father's appeal to those who drink and drive.  by  ZereldaJamesin  videos[+]mrsminigig 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoHe'll do it because he wants to, too. permalinksavecontextfull commentsA father's appeal to those who drink and drive.  by  ZereldaJamesin  videos[+]mrsminigig 56 points57 points58 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]mrsminigig 56 points57 points58 points 10 days agoThat is the face a a father that wants to kill the man that hurt his daughter. permalinksavecontextfull comments19012Anyone in the Twin Cities, Minnesota area?
