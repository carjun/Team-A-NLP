If your area is not available, see the menu in the app for information on how to get it added.Explanation of why various permissions are needed:The "Phone Calls / Read Phone State" permission is needed by the app so that it can detect when you're placing a phone call (or when one is being received) so that it can automatically stop the streaming of the audio to prevent it from interfering with the call.The "Fine (GPS) Location" and "Coarse Location" permissions are required so that the app can determine what scanners are located in your area when you click on "Near Me".  When you click on "Near Me" the app first attempts to determine your location via the network, if that fails the app then tries to determine your location via GPS.The "Automatically Start at Boot" permission is required so that a small portion of the app can be started when your phone boots if (and only if) you turn on the notifications feature of the app (that feature is turned off by default).If the audio repeats or the app stays connected for only a short time, try returning to a directory screen in the app, then select "Settings" from the menu, then "Player settings", and then try changing the "Streaming method" setting.Follow "Scanner Radio" on Facebook or ScannerRadio on Twitter to be notified about tips, service interruptions, new beta versions, etc.Keywords: police scanner, radio scanner, air traffic -        i    ?  !,   .5 501034 i161723 i57192 i15091 2748i 4,476251  i    ?  !,   .5 501034 i161723 i57192 i15091 2748i 4,476251 , i   .    :Added support for alpha tags (channel information) for feeds that have them.The play/stop button in the top-right corner of the directory screens now takes the user to the player screen and starts or stops streaming if Scanner Radio Pro is not installed.Added the ability to specify which widgets and shortcuts should not be shown in Android's widgets chooser (select Settings from the menu in the app and then "Widgets and Shortcut Settings" to configure).     :   (  GPS  )       GPS   i , ,   i i Wi-Fi.     i   i     i . i   ,    i ,     i.
