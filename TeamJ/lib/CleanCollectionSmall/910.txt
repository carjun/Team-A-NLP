Oh Reddit, can you call them?  by  fightforthefuturein  politics[+]i2unswithskunk 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (0 children)[]i2unswithskunk 0 points1 point2 points 11 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onAlso from Oklahoma here sent off e-mails to Inhofe, Cole, and Coburn. Have only received one back from Inhofe. Thank you for contacting me regarding the Preventing Real Online Threat to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP). As your voice in Washington D.C., I appreciate being made aware of your views. As you are aware, the Internet has become a central part of the American economy. The Internet allows us, as American citizens to use the free flow of information. However, the free flow of information has created problems with copyright and trademark infringements. It is estimated that the unauthorized sale of copyrighted and counterfeit goods costs the U.S. billions of dollars per year, and results in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. In an effort to combat online piracy, S. 968, the PROTECT IP Act was introduced on May 12, 2011. The Senate is scheduled to vote on a procedural motion to begin consideration of the bill on January 24, 2012. The act seeks to protect the investments American companies make in developing brands and creating new content, while protecting those jobs associated with it.  The Act will also protect American consumers guaranteeing that goods purchased online are the exact type and quality they expect.  Lastly, this act restricts access to foreign sites promoting infringement or the sale of counterfeit providers located in the United States. Numerous concerns have been raised regarding provision of the Protect IP Act. First, some lawmakers are concerned with the broad definition of the "Internet" in the bill. They feel as if the broadness of the definition could infringe our freedom of speech, by giving government the ability to regulate, and in some instances block access to, the Internet. Secondly, concerns have been raised that suggest the bill may affect the integrity of the Internet, affecting the internet's reliability, security, and performance. Lastly, some lawmakers are concerned that content owners will use private rights of actions to stifle Internet innovation and protect outdated business models, disrupting the traditional business model for reasons having nothing to do with infringement. I am glad you took the time to let me know just how important this issue is to you and to explain your thoughts and concerns. As your Senator, I seek to ensure that Oklahoma's values and needs are priorities here in Washington. I will continue to monitor this legislation, and again, thank you for sharing your concerns.  Sincerely, James M. Inhofe United States Senator<permalinksavecontextfull commentsCool hair bro.  by  monstereoin  pics[+]i2unswithskunk 6 points7 points8 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]i2unswithskunk 6 points7 points8 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted ondamn get off my grits! permalinksavecontextfull commentsCool hair bro.  by  monstereoin  pics[+]i2unswithskunk 9 points10 points11 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]i2unswithskunk 9 points10 points11 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI just hope this hairstyle doesn't turnip everywherepermalinksavecontextfull commentsBest Projector for College  by  dawumysterin  gadgets[+]i2unswithskunk 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]i2unswithskunk 0 points1 point2 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onWell don't most projectors have a button to keystone the image to make it squared up?permalinksavecontextfull commentsLearn the Differences [Beer Edition]  by  andru365in  pics[+]i2unswithskunk 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]i2unswithskunk 0 points1 point2 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThe Belgium looks oh so tasty...permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe reason I turn off Adult Swim  by  wojokhanin  pics[+]i2unswithskunk 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]i2unswithskunk 1 point2 points3 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onWhen I can pry myself off of Reddit to catch an episode of this its a great night..I'm sure it helps being from the south, but having to live among this type of peoples its always nice to be able to relate on teh funnies permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe pinnacle of cinematic excellence [GIF]  by  druceyin  funny[+]i2unswithskunk 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]i2unswithskunk 0 points1 point2 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onWhat is this from?permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy IT guy left his magic "Unlock everything" USB stick at my desk.
