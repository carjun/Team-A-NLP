One couple in the audience held one another and cried, while dozens held lit candles in the air. At several moments, the crowd sang "We Shall Overcome," a protest song important to the civil rights movement.[PHOTOS: Madman Massacres Kindergarten Class]Pelosi's words were echoed by Pastor Michael McBride of the California nonprofit Berkeley Organizing Congregations for Action."Please lay out a plan of action," McBride said through a megaphone, in an address directed at President Barack Obama. "It's not just in our inner city schools- it's everywhere."Not everyone in attendance was an advocate or had experiences with gun violence."I have a four-year-old son," said Ken Archer, who lives in Washington, D.C. "I'd like to see massacre control. Whatever we need to do to accomplish that is what I want."[RELATED: Congress Reacts to Shooting]Though many people held candles, Nancy Robinson, with advocacy group Citizens for Safety, emphasized that the protest was not a vigil, but a call for action. "The president came out saying now is not the time, and we're saying now is the time," she said.Earlier Friday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said a gun control policy discussion would happen, "but today's not that day."In an emotional press conference, Obama said that the country needed to "take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this," but did not specify what that action would be.Sign at the candlelight vigil outside the White House twitter.com/thinkprogress/ ThinkProgress (@thinkprogress) December 14, 2012Bigger crowd now twitter.com/daveweigel/sta daveweigel (@daveweigel) December 14, 2012More News:Wrong Ryan Lanza ID-ed AsSchoolGunman?Fed President:CentralBankOverstepping Its BoundsBoehner: Obama's Cliff Plan Will Hurt KidsElizabeth Flock is a staff writer forU.S. News & World Report.You canfollow her on TwitterorFacebookor reach her at eflock@usnews.com.Tags:school shootings,gun control and gun rightsYou might be interested in...First Lady Michelle ObamaFirst Dog Bo Obama       Previous Post      Reader Comments          ()About this blogWashington Whispers has been featured in U.S. News & World Report  since 1933, offering a fun, insider's view of Washington.RSSadvertisement          Recent Posts          ArchivesJohn Boehner Says Obama's Fiscal Cliff Plan Will Hurt Little KidsSTUDY: A Lobbyist's Connection To A Lawmaker Worth $177,000Homeland Security Named Worst Big Place to Work of Federal AgenciesIsraeli Ambassador: Bibi Didn't Meddle in U.S. ElectionSen.
