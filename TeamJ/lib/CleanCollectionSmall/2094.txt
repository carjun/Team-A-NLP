These acts are not committed by sane, well-adjusted people, they are committed by people with unrecognized and untreated mental illnesses who have fallen through the cracks because they can't afford basic bloody treatment or worse are deterred from seeking it due to rampant discrimination against the mentally ill. I don't know what exactly has happened to make this environment where we have a few mass shootings per year, but you can be damned sure the rate would reduce if we just fucking cared about these people when they need it most.permalinksave[+]FlyingRock 28 points29 points30 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]FlyingRock 28 points29 points30 points 23 hours agoMoney, I already said it here but in America we cannot afford to be sick, mental illness is scary because it doesnt heal on its own.. I believe we'd be much more open to mental illness treatment if we didnt worry about affording the medical bills.permalinksaveparent[+]thenewplatypus 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]thenewplatypus 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoI think the stigma associated with mental illness in this country is a much larger factor than the money. Hell, they closed down a lot of public mental health hospitals and just sent those people to already over-populated prisons. permalinksaveparent[+]lankira 14 points15 points16 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]lankira 14 points15 points16 points 22 hours agoI commented earlier, in response to someone I know now is a troll, in 100% agreement:This situation is horrendous, and I cannot even fathom how someone could wake up in the morning thinking "today I'm going to shoot up an elementary school".However, the mental health care system in this country is lacking. Insurance is only required to cover mental health care "equally" as it does the rest. What this often means is that the psychologists and psychiatrists who would be of the most assistance are treated as "specialists", requiring a copay of 2-3x that of a general practitioner, despite having to see psychiatrists and psychologists at least once a month, on average, for any semblance of quality care. While they are required to cover the care, they are also not required to have any caregivers in-network. They are also not required to treat psychiatric prescriptions in the same way that they treat non-psychiatric meds. Often, this places the psych meds in the "premium" or "non-preferred" category.What does all of this mean, really? It means that I, a gainfully employed, 24 year old woman with bipolar disorder cannot afford the help I need, even with the addition of insurance and my husband's income. Copay for a visit to my primary care physician is $25, no matter how frequently I visit. Copay to see a psychologist or psychiatrist is $60. And that's if there's an in-network doctor. There isn't, through my insurance, a single in-network mental health care provider that isn't part of a hospital. Psychologists and psychiatrists at most of these hospitals are there for consultation or to deal with the mental ward, not to take on patients of their own.All told, in order for me to get the care I need to be "normal", I need to spend, in-network, $300 per month on doctors (psychologist, for therapy, once a week; psychiatrist, for meds, once a month), and another 50% of the $500/month that my meds cost (because, well, they're non-preferred medications). Out of network? I'm looking at $100 per visit (minimum), with the meds still at $250.I'm lucky. I have insurance. Those who are uninsured are even less likely to be able to get the help they need. Let alone those who are homeless.We need to fix the mental health care system. I think it would help everyone, not just those like me. I think it would help us see less violence in our society.permalinksaveparent[+]EA_Forum_Moderator 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]EA_Forum_Moderator 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours agoIt's even worst that having mental problems is looked down upon as a weakness instead of a health condition like high blood pressure. People are afraid to seek help for psych issues, people get up in arms about seeing a shrink, it's embarrassing, you're supposed to just fix it yourself, you don't really need help, mental conditions are all in the mind/up to you to change it, etc.Most people with mental health issues don't go on a mass shooting, yet every time there's a mass shootings people say the shooter had problems. Last I checked not every mentally ill person killed someone, and not every killer was mentally insane. It's just another divisive mechanism in society like racism, sexism, fattism, homophobia, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]DerpMatt 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]DerpMatt 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoThey already are. Hell, the bodies arent even cold yet, some are still laying in their own blood. But CNN and the others are already politicizing it. permalinksaveparent[+]SAOSEC 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]SAOSEC 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours agoI work in a prison and ironically just went through about 8 hours of class about this very topic today.I work for a Department of Corrections, but we're not given the tools or resources to correct mental illnesses. We're talking a single psychiatrist for thousands of mentally ill offenders, most of which will never see the Dr. or get any help at all.The public doesn't care about these people until it's too late, then they just want them dead or locked up. No one wants to help us help them or help them before they get to us. This is a problem.permalinksaveparent[+]Elsumo 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (2 children)[]Elsumo 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoA mentally ill canadian could kill as much people , but it'd take him much more efforts to get the guns or figure a way to kill a mass .. so it is less likely to happen. permalinksaveparent[+]chairitable 5 points6 points7 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]chairitable 5 points6 points7 points 21 hours agothe mentally ill canadian has access to free mental health services, and are oftentimes referred to such services.If he wants to go on a knife murdering spree he still will. The fact of the matter is this person, somehow, composed themselves enough to commit this murder, without stopping and thinking that it might be wrong. It seems pretty clear that he was not mentally fit. permalinksaveparent[+]paleonerdz 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]paleonerdz 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours agoGun control in CT and NJ is more strict than Canadapermalinksaveparent[+]selinakyle11 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago*(0 children)[]selinakyle11 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago*I wrote this in response to another post, it's relevant here:Not to discredit the mental health of the individuals who perpetrate crimes like these, but gun control is the bigger issue here. Since Columbine, 31 school shootings have occurred in the US. 14 have occurred in every other country combined.Today a man also attacked school children in China - but with a knife. 22 Children were slashed, so far none are reported dead. In Connecticut at least 27 are dead.You want to reduce deaths? Gun control will get you there. Mental health treatment and awareness is good and will no doubt contribute, but the biggest effect will be gun control - make no mistake.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
