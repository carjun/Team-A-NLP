This will actually give you a reason to strike up a conversation.  Make it something "cool" or interesting like music or art, something that you can keep talking about for more than 2 seconds. You could also ask something like "I smell something really good, what perfume are you wearing?" Be careful about coming off creepy though! Good luck!permalinksavecontextfull comments8012Positive question time! Who is living their dream and what is it?

He also has sensitive skin, so I use a flea shampoo with oatmeal in the formula to sooth his puggy wrinkles. As for the wrinkles, I just use the soap and warm water. Pug ears are actually more of a concern. I have tried every ear cleaner out there, but his ears are still messy! If you can recommend any type of ear cleaner please do! permalinksavecontextfull commentsIAMA Pug owner AMA!  by  kc185in  IAmA[+]kc185[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]kc185[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoI do have a cat.

AMA-about school, music, whatever!  by  kc185in  IAmA[+]kc185[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]kc185[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoI have a ton of marching band stories (who doesn't) and I also have summer ensemble camp (something my college does which brings local students together to create 4 ensembles based on skills levels). My favorite band camp probably has to be one involving hash-brownies. One of my flutes was acting rather strange. She had cause problems before, just being disruptive and rebellious. This time though, she was just bazaar.  She was unable to stay still during holds and when we were at rest she kept laying down.  I kept calling on her to get back into formation (I was not the director, so I didn't like to punish without his ok). We decided to work on moving lines together so we had lines of marchers march across the field. Well, she got to the end and just kept going. I kept yelling at her, her director yelled at her, and others yelled at her, but she kept going. She finally hit the fence. I went over after she fell over to see WTF was going on. She looked up at me and said "Your hair looks like delicious yellow spaghetti.  I then went over to go through her things, because I knew. There were brownie. And there was not a lot left. She ended up getting expelled and I don't think she ever returned to that school. The comments that flew out of her mouth as we were walking her away were beautiful. She asked if we could throw her high in the air and show her what it was to fly, but if we didn't catch her she would throw up on us. That is just one lovely story. I've had guest conductors who were "little people", catching students having sex on the band bus, band babies, acid trips on band trips-you name it, I have probably seen it. Not to mention all the screwed up band directors I have seen. Lovely stories about those too! permalinksavecontextfull commentsIAmA Music Education student who goes to a private college, already runs her own flute studio, and am fluent in all woodwinds.

I do know how to play the basic flute family, but I really like to focus on lower pitched (unlike most who also play pic). I play alto and bass flute regularly for my flute ensemble. I have only played a contra a few times, which was AWESOME!

AMA.  by  MissAlkaliin  IAmA[+]kc185 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]kc185 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoI will have to read some more! (I'm about to teach a lesson so I don't have a lot of time). I am very young but I'm pretty sure I will never want to give birth. Adoption maybe-but there are too many medical conditions in my family. Also-careful if you decide to adopt. Some agencies are trying to basically give away children and do not report everything they have been through. I have a friend who I work with who adopted a child. He child  ended up murdering their dog and tried to attack friend's husband. Apparently he had tried that a couple of times before and the agency never told my friend!  permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am a musician who has just finished a masters degree in conducting.

AMA.  by  MissAlkaliin  IAmA[+]kc185 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]kc185 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoI have to tell you-a while back I was one of those who thought abortion was horrible. That it should only be done if the baby is going to kill the mother, but that was still horrible. Then I did some research, some soul searching, and I found out the facts.  I appreciate your decision to write about this.  Would I ever get an abortion? Depends on the circumstances, which is something I had to learn! QUESTION TIME! Did you family react? (I haven't read a lot on here so IDK if this already was asked :p). Also, when are you able to get your tunes tied, or whatever they do now a days to make babies a no no? permalinksavecontextfull commentsIAmA Music Education student who goes to a private college, already runs her own flute studio, and am fluent in all woodwinds.

Also- you are right, I will become a teacher- Thus Music EDUCATION. I want to teach. And when did income become a scale if importance? Kardashians? Millions and nothing. Also, Im going to make comfy living doing what I love to do. I'll top out around 70000 a year. Not filthy rich, but good enough for me.

I said I'm happy doing what I do. And earlier when I said my major gets down played by the uneducated, you are a great example. I am not just a musician, but a music educator, This means I have to learn all the instruments well enough to teach and play them. I also have to take all those education courses that math or english Ed have to take. As for people in Africa, sorry for them. Donated a few times, went overseas to learn African drum music, and I think they would agree that my line of work is important.
