I asked the owner when was the last time time they cleaned behind the equipment, he said over 10 years. WTF!??  by  randothehumanhunterin  WTF[+]Anglewings 4 points5 points6 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Anglewings 4 points5 points6 points 10 hours agoBut well that solve the problem? No. Obviously if whomever is in charge hasn't cared for the last 10 years, they sure won't care once OP isn't there. Really, I know it's easier said then done but OP has a duty here, and he has to man up and take responsibility. He may have bills to pay and in desperate need of a job but this is just disgusting. They may not even get shut down, and OP can remain anonymous when/if he complains.permalinksavecontextfull commentsApparantly my GF is not interested in dressing up for The Hobbit tonight  by  JBEHAR11in  funny[+]Anglewings -2 points-1 points0 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]Anglewings -2 points-1 points0 points 11 hours agofor some reason I thought it was; "you had me at...".

It would be worse if they said "From the producer of the twilight series" or "A Peter Jackson/Quentin Terrentino film" even if they arn't directing or have little to do with it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

When I say the majority of reddit agrees, I kind of refer to the votes.

Even if this article only has 51% of reddits approval, that is still the majority. If it's more than half it's a majority. Gawd.permalinksavecontextfull comments[F]irst time. I lost a bunch of weight, but my boobs lost weight too. So after a year of consideration, I had implants. Are they okay? Are they too much? Are they aggressive? Are they pretty? I got them for me, and I like them, but I'm still not sure how I'll be perceived.  by  textual_satisfactionin  gonewild[+]Anglewings 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]Anglewings 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agoWell since everyone in this thread is being white knight nice. Now I may be thonly one, but |I find fake tits extremely unattractive. They look fake, they feel fake and I just don't find them naturally beautiful. I would take tiny tits over a bag of gel any day. Frankly I thought breast implants have become rather taboo in the last 10-20 years. Again, this is just my opinion, but you used to be a real girl with small tits, and now you're plastic. You see, I have a small dick. Now I don't bulge my pants with socks, nor do I buy a dick extension. I understand that my dick is small, and there is a good majority of woman who don't want to get near it, but when I find someone who accepts it, it doesn't matter. TLDR: Is there anyone here who would like to date a guy with a small dick?permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom. At least 27 dead, 14 children.  by  EthicalReasoningin  politics[+]Anglewings 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago*(0 children)[]Anglewings 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago*When I say Reddit, I of course, speak of the majority. When something gets upvoted to the front page, it was the majority of Reddit who put it there, though I assumed it was safe to say "Reddit put it there". Do I think 100% of reddit thinks one thought? Of course not. Do I think the majority agrees's with this video? Well it's not 50/50 or the story would have 1 upvote. At this point there are 2392 more upvotes than downvotes, safe to say that reddit, as a majority, agrees with this video.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

Wow, I laugh at how ridiculous you sound, Har!. Why don't you take that dick out of your mouth and think for a second? Do you know what a majority is? Do you understand how a story reaches the front page? Well, I well let you try and piece it together, though I doubt you well because you're thick as a brick with repressed anger on top of that. Oh, and I did answer ProperLogic, sorry it took so long, I had to go to work. Work? Well, that means I have a job. Job? Ya, that word your mom keeps using while banging on your mildewed soaked door. You well probably delete you're post, and that's fine. As long as you realize how completely retarded you are, you may do as you wish, but just remember; you well never accomplish anything, and when you kill yourself, don't take any others with you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
