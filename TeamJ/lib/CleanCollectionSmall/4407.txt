I took a walk down Michigan Avenue and reminded myself to breathe deeply. A counselor years ago told me this would happen: the racing heart, the shakiness.Ten, 20, 30 years from now, she told me prophetically, you will learn of another school shooting and it will bring you right back to that day in Colorado. Deep breath.I was among the first reporters on the scene of the Columbine High School massacre nearly 14 years ago.Then a young Denver Post projects reporter, I was about to meet with the assistant managing editor that day to discuss my next investigation when the urgent words "GUNS" and "SCHOOL" broke the predictable rhythm of the chatter on the newsroom police scanner. I grabbed a map and a newsroom cellphone  most of us didn't have mobiles of our own back then  and headed to Littleton.Covering breaking news changed me that day. I'm guessing that a lot of reporters have moments like that  where the usual detachment of the fact gatherer melts away and you find yourself knee-deep in horror and grief. In those early hours after the shooting began at Columbine, we didn't know how many people had been killed or injured. The students didn't know, the parents didn't know, the teachers didn't know. Even the police didn't know.I spent that day interviewing kids evacuated from the school. The first waves of students described how the normal routine of school  free cookie day in the cafeteria  was interrupted by shots that sounded like firecrackers. The next waves told of brave teachers ushering them to safety, one of whom was shot to death saving others. The final waves witnessed the violence, students who had  to step over lifeless bodies. They were in the room when someone wrote on a dry-erase board, "1BLEEDING TO DEATH" and propped it in a window for rescuers to see.The survivors who weren't physically injured boarded yellow school buses that took them to a nearby elementary school, where they were reunited with their parents. I can still remember the parents standing on rails of a wooden fence desperate to spot their children on those buses."With each bus, there were ecstatic cries and tearful reunions," I wrote in the Denver Post. "And as the last student got off each bus, some parents had panic in their eyes. Others stood in a daze. For them, there still was no reunion."After phoning in my last dispatch that night, I went home and vomited.I spent the next year traveling to other towns around the country that had experienced school shootings. The goal was to learn from them and share those lessons with readers. I had a lot of earnest questions about healing and "seeking closure." I was pretty naive.Families who lost children in school shootings in Jonesboro, Ark., and Paducah, Ky., welcomed me into their homes, eager to share their stories with readers touched by Columbine. I learned that for families who lose children, there is no such thing as closure.I came away with a different kind of lesson, an uncomfortable one I wasn't expecting: Communities that initially band together to support the victims later can become deeply divided as those who get on with life clash with those who can't.In Jonesboro, an old-fashioned pencil drawing became a symbol of that split. An artist drew a portrait of the five victims: four middle-school girls and a teacher shot to death in March 1998 by two students not old enough to drive.When the new school year began the following fall, some parents got very upset seeing this portrait hanging in a school hallway, an unwelcome reminder of loss. They had worked hard to move on. The school year was supposed to be a fresh start. So school officials put the portrait in a supply closet.When I visited Jonesboro in the summer of 1999, Suzann Wilson, whose daughter Britthney Varner-Wilson was among the victims, told me she felt like the community was stuffing her grief into that closet.I quoted Wilson in a Denver Post story that July: "It makes you feel an amount of guilt, like you're the one holding them back when their town could return to normal if it wasn't for the fact that you lost your child and you won't give it up. And you feel victimized. How could they know what it's like to go home at night and expect that child to run out the door, and she doesn't, to try to sleep at night when the ghosts visit? So much of you was shot that day. When those kids go to school and kill other kids, it does more than just hurt 15 kids. It kills the whole community."I didn't have kids of my own back then. Now my husband and I do.Helen is a kindergartner, around the same age as some of the children killed in Newtown, Conn. Jimmy and Benny, our 3-year-old twins, are in preschool.Several weeks ago, Helen came home from kindergarten and told me that her school, Mary Seat of Wisdom in Park Ridge, had a "lockdown drill."Very matter of factly, she described how she and her classmates practiced hiding behind their teacher's desk. She told me that if a bad person entered the school when she was in the bathroom, she was supposed to lock the door to a stall and stand on the toilet seat so that he wouldn't see her."It's kind of like hide and seek," she said, "only it's scary."I hugged her. She told me that some boys in her class were gently scolded for giggling when they were supposed to be silent. "It's serious, Mama," she said."Yes, sweetheart, it's very serious," I said, still hugging her. "I'm glad you practiced that and hope that you never, ever have to do that."I didn't tell her about Columbine. She's too young for that. Instead, I kissed her on the head, and we gathered up Jimmy and Benny."We're going for a walk," I said.As we traced our familiar path through the neighborhood, picking up the best sticks and leaves as we always do, I made sure they didn't notice that I was taking deep breaths.Patricia Callahan shared a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news reporting with colleagues at the Denver Post for coverage of the Columbine High School massacre.
