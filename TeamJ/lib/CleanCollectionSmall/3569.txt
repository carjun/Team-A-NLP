Sheriff's Department busts one of its own. What took so long?By Sandra HernandezThe Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department deserves praise for an investigation that led to the arrest of a deputy assigned to the jails for allegedly beating two inmates and filing false reports about the incidents. The arrest, however, also raises some troubling questions. For example, why did it take the department so long to investigate alleged beatings that took place in 2009 and 2010? A spokesman for the department said its internal criminal investigation bureau first launched a probe earlier this year into reports that Deputy Jermaine Jackson beat inmates. I understand that the Sheriffs Department must be very busy and reports of abuse arent always credible or easily verified, but that doesnt seem to be the case here. At least one of the alleged beatings was caught on tape, according to the department. And Derek Griscavage, an inmate at the Twin Towers jail, complained about the abuse, even contacting the ACLU and providing a sworn statement...More...2012 election: Reasons to celebrate, reasons to cryBy Dan TurnerThe 2012 election was one of the most anticlimactic races of modern times. As donors shattered records on political contributions, an Internet-dominated political media environment seized on every candidate misstatement as a top news story and a massively polarized electorate squabbled throughout, one could have been forgiven for thinking major changes would be afoot after November. But then, almost inexplicably given the country's dissatisfaction with the state of the economy and a gridlocked Congress that seemed incapable of doing anything about it, voters largely opted to keep the status quo. Barack Obama will serve another term as president, the Senate remains in Democratic hands and the House is still controlled by Republicans, an outcome that pretty much guarantees more of the same. That doesn't mean nothing good happened on Nov. 6, nor that there weren't any bad outcomes. Voters across the political spectrum could find something to celebrate or decry, especially those of us here...More...Newtown's grief should be a rallying cry as wellBy Karin KleinDo we know whether the gunman who killed 20 elementary school children and six adults obtained his weapons through legitimate means? Not yet. Would gun registration have made a difference? Unclear so far. Is it a coincidence that Newtown, Conn., the town where the shooting took place -- a small, picturesque and usually ultra-safe place -- is also the home of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which describes itself as the "trade association for the firearms industry"? Probably. So is it too early to talk about the need for better gun regulation? Not to me. Up to now, gun enthusiasts have said the problem isn't that some bad people are walking around with guns; it's that too few good guys are equally armed. If guns aren't allowed at colleges, there will be more campus shootings, they contend. A few armed patrons at the Aurora, Colo., shootings during a showing of the newest Batman movie would have been a better solution to violence than tighter rules over who can buy guns and how...More...Let's get politics out of our gun lawsBy Joseph SernaIt seems to happen so often now that everyone knows whats to come. The shooting, followed by identifying the victims, identifying the shooter or shooters, then asking why. The media coverage lasts days or weeks but rarely, if ever, months. Thats because the hardest questions take the longest to answer, and time after time, politicians are afraid to ask them. What could have been done to stop this? Or what could be done to prevent these things from happenning again? PHOTOS: Connecticut school shooting Perhaps nothing. Maybe the shooter was an upstanding citizen, sane by medical standards and legally permitted to own the weapons he used to kill 28 people, including 20 children, in Connecticut. Perhaps its a situation like the Virginia Tech shootings, where Seung-Hui Cho was mentally disturbed and managed to get guns to slay 32 people. But asking lawmakers at the state and federal levels to look at their laws -- asking if theres anything that can or should be...More...Not another gun control diatribeBy Dan TurnerIf there's been another tragic mass shooting, there must be pundits all over the mediasphere ranting for or against tighter controls on guns. The arguments follow a predictable course: Advocates point out that gun violence in the United States, presumably because of its laws granting easy access to firearms, is far more common than in more restrictive countries, particularly in Europe. Opponents fire back that criminals will break the law to obtain guns if they want them -- after all, they're criminals, who feel no apparent remorse about mass slaughter. And anyway, if more people carried guns, they could take out the shooters before the body count rose.The latter argument is a little hard to make with a straight face in the case of Friday's shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.; I doubt even National Rifle Assn. chief Wayne LaPierre would claim that arming 6-year-olds or their teachers is a good idea. Regardless, the liberal blogosphere will scream for action, politicians...More...Connecticut shooting: Reader outrage over gun violenceBy Paul ThorntonSince news broke of the mass shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school Friday morning, The Times' has received more than two dozen readers letters; nearly all of them express outrage over the political third rail that gun control has become. So far, one letter writer has warned against calling for gun prohibition. The following are a selection of those responses. Of course, it wasn't immediately clear how the shooter got his guns or whether stricter firearms laws would have prevented him from obtaining them. But these letters provide a snapshot of reader opinion in the wake of a tragedy that took the lives of at least 24 people, many of them children. Here are the responses, edited for clarity, style and grammar: Congratulations to the National Rifle Assn. The NRA is right: Guns don't kill people; people kill people. It is the NRA's responsibility to ensure that when people decide to kill people, they kill the maximum number in the shortest period of time -- that they kill...More...Susan Rice's troubled steps toward secretary of StateBy Michael McGoughFour thoughts about Susan Rices decision to withdraw as a possible nominee for secretary of State: 1)Rice should not have been disqualified because of her now-notorious talk-show comments about the attack in Benghazi, Libya,that killed four Americans. As The Times observed in an editorial, her comments faithfully tracked talking points that were assembled by intelligence officials and only slightly edited by the White House and State Department. The excision of references to a possible Al Qaeda connection were apparently made by intelligence officials, not the White House, and while Rice has been criticized for saying in one interview that Al Qaeda had been decimated, she also said: Whether they were Al Qaeda affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or Al Qaeda itself, I thinkis one of the things we'll have to determine." Rices remarks on Benghazi were a bogus issue, and she paid a price with Republicans for Mitt Romney&...More...Let's hear it for the wunderteens of 2012By Alexandra Le Tellier This year we saw teenagers around the country challenging convention, going head to head with adults and rising above bullies. They showed courage and initiative. And their willingness to push for what they believe in for the sake of the greater good was a reminder that youre never too young to have a voice and make a difference.   In Michigan, Whitney Kropp, 16, participated in her high schools homecoming court, even though her nomination had been a cruel prank by her peers. Outfitted in a bold red dress and a gold-and-white sash, Kropp not only captured national attention and praise, she also became a role model, showing victims how to gracefully and powerfully stand up to their bullies. "I can just prove all these kids wrong.... I'm not the joke everyone thinks I am," Kropp told CNN. &bull; In Maine, Julia Bluhm, 14, petitioned Seventeen magazine to show realistic images of girls in its pages in the hopes of changing the standard of beauty for teens. ...More...Hugh Hefner will like the CALM Act. Other boomers? Maybe not.By Paul WhitefieldThats one small step for Congress, one giant leap for  people who watch TV. Or not. In case you havent, uh, heard, the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act, better known as the CALM Act, went into effect Thursday. Whats that, you say? Or should it be: Whats that you say? You know, in case someone is reading this to you while the television blares in the background. (And isnt English-language punctuation a wonderful and mysterious thing?) But I digress. The CALM Act is a new federal law aimed at lowering the volume of TV commercials. Meaning youll no longer need to have the remote at the ready, finger poised over the mute button, every time a commercial comes on. Which is good news, right? Well, yes, but  First of all, even the acts supporters (the CALMERS?) are quite, well, yes, calm about their baby: "This is clearly not the biggest thing happening in Washington. But it is one less nuisance," Sen. Sheldon...More...Corrections in 2012: Best, worst and everything in betweenBy Joseph SernaTheres not many things that can ruin a reporters day like having to write a correction. If its a misspelling, misplaced punctuation that changes the meaning of a sentence, or even a simple typo, your error is put on display for all to see. Its a humbling and necessary process that keeps us honest. Though we loathe writing them, we love reading them. The funniest or most relatable ones will usually end up on an email chain passed around among friends. Thanks to Poynter, a collection of some of 2012s best and worst are all included in one place. Among the highlights on Poynters list was a correction by the New York Times that went viral in January. The story ran just before the New Year. An article on Mondayabout Jack Robison and Kirsten Lindsmith, two college students with Asperger syndrome who are navigating the perils of an intimate relationship, misidentified the character from the animated childrens TV show My Little...More...For Scalia, no gay people, just gay sex?By Michael McGoughIs there anything more to be said about Justice Antonin Scalias sulphurous comments about homosexuality, which prompted a gutsy student at Princeton University to confront the voluble jurist this week about his rhetoric? One thing at least: Scalias discomfort with the idea that there is such a thing as a gay or lesbian person. The quotations from Scalia opinions that so dismayed Princeton freshman Duncan Hosie all referred to homosexual conduct. For example, in a 1996 case the majority of the court held that voters in Colorado had exhibited animus toward gays by making it impossible for the state or municipalities to pass laws protecting them from discrimination. Scalia responded: I had thought that one could consider certain conduct reprehensible  murder, for example, or polygamy, or cruelty to animals  and could exhibit even 'animus' toward such conduct." In his dissent Scalia did refer to homosexuals (he assiduously...More...1 | 2  | 3 | 4  | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12Older Entries AdvertisementConnectRecommended on FacebookFollow @latimesOpinion L.A.
