I think Churchill even went as far as saying he would give them "what they want most" in exchange for assistance. Basically implying they would get Northern Ireland.But the Irish policy was largely based off, my enemy's enemy is my friend.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL every year, Norway gives a giant christmas tree to the people of London in gratitude for Englands help during WW2  by  LjStrongein  todayilearned[+]TrolleyPower 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]TrolleyPower 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoReally?

The bastard could have just as easily gone on a stabbing spree. Just like the man in China did yesterday. Except in China there were 20 injuries not 20 fatalities.  Ever notice how many of these cowards target "gun free" zones instead of the local shooting range? I say let the teachers get ccw permits and carry in school.That is a crazy idea.
