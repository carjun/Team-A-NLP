Liberals -- and an increasing number people in the middle -- have called for increased gun control, while conservatives have pointed their fingers at video games, pop culture and rap music. This polarization was starkly evident on Tuesday night television. MSNBC's Lawrence ODonnell went on an eight-minute tirade about the National Rifle Assn. and its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre. ODonnell described LaPierre as a blood-drenched professional liar and said that there are no words that can wash the blood from his hands. Even to many of the NRAs critics, it was extreme rhetoric. Meanwhile, Bill OReilly devoted a segment on his show to Quentin Tarantinos Django Unchainedand the influence of violent movies on mass shooters like...More...'The Voice' recap: Cassadee Pope wins Season 3By Amy ReiterIt could have been any of them, but in the end it was Cassadee Pope who emerged the Season 3 winner of "The Voice." The 23-year-old pop-rock singer who'd stepped away from her band, Hey Monday, to see if she could make it on her own proved, once and for all, she could. After Rihanna, the Killers, Kelly Clarkson, Bruno Mars, Smokey Robinson, Peter Frampton and Avril Lavigne, as well as many previously eliminated finalists, had performed and the season's results were revealed, Pope was the last contestant standing. How did she feel? "I don't know," she said, honest till the end. "Amazing."Pope had begun the competition a little fluttery and unsure, and then grew increasingly confident, connecting with viewers emotionally on songs like "Over You" -- by her coach, Blake Shelton, and his wife, Miranda Lambert - and, on Monday night, Faith Hill's "Cry." Her success on the show had already brought her a personal victory  a reconnection with the father who'd abandoned her family...More...Wednesday's TV Highlights: 'Happily Divorced' on TV LandBy Ed Stockly   Click here to download TV listings for the week Dec. 16 - 22 in PDF format    This week's TV Movies    SERIESThe X Factor: The finalists perform (8 p.m. Fox).Toddlers & Tiaras: The unscripted child-beauty-pageant series resumes with "Carolina Queens Pageant" (9 p.m. TLC).40 Greatest Hip Hop Songs of the '90s: This mini-series countdown premieres with two new episodes (9 and 10 p.m. VH1).Chicago Fire: The holiday is hardly dull for the firefighters in this new episode where following a kitchen blaze in a swanky home an expensive necklace is missing and the rescuers are suspect.

The government knows it, the police know it and even so-called zombie preppers, the subject of Discovery Channels new special Zombie Apocalypse, premiering Tuesday night, know it. But that doesnt mean they arent all taking steps to prepare for the onslaught anyway. Something is coming down the road, says Shawn Beatty, a Missouri high school teacher and zombie prepper who appears in the special, stockpiling supplies and weapons. I dont think the Earth is supposed to have 12 billion people on it. Preparing for the zombie apocalypse is really preparing for almost everything. Earthquake. Flood. Zombie apocalypse. The current population is actually around 7 billion, but Beattys precautions would seem justified based on a glance at the media. In pop culture terms, zombies are having their moment in the sun.

The actress, who was there to promote the new musical Les Miserables, nevertheless had to field questions about the upcoming biopic Lovelace, in which she plays Deep Throat star Linda Lovelace. Im just curious, how do you portray a porn star without the film being incredibly explicit? OBrien asked. With a gentle note of sarcasm in her voice, Seyfried replied, Well, you dont actually have sex on film. This is not the way I could have gone, but Im not directing, OBrien quipped. Seyfried helpfully explained how popsicles were a big help while filming because they made her lips wet and inflamed. Perhaps sensing shed taken things a little too far, she added, I cant believe I went that far just...More...David Chase of 'The Sopranos' on effects of film, TV violenceBy Greg BraxtonDavid Chase, creator of the acclaimed drama "The Sopranos", is back on the publicity trail to promote his first post-"Sopranos" project "Not Fade Away," a film about an aspiring rock band in the 1960s.   But the discussion of the film on "CBS This Morning" was momentarily sidetracked when anchor Charlie Rose asked Chase about the role of violence in popular culture, and its influence on audiences.   "People always ask, well, do these depictions of violence -- do these movies and TV shows make the world a worse place somehow," replied Chase. "The other day I thought to myself, well, does Mary Poppins make the world a better place? Where's the data on that? And if you show me the data on that, then we could talk about the other."   He added, "You expect that the majority of human beings can tell the difference between reality and -- and wherever they are. And I think we have to make things for the majority, not run away from it because of some deranged individuals."

The network released the following statement early Tuesday morning: After being kidnapped and held for five days inside Syria by an unknown group, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel and his production crew members have been freed unharmed. We are pleased to report they are safely out of the country. Via satellite from Turkey, Engel, Balkiz and Kooistra discussed their ordeal on Tuesday mornings Today. The men looked a little tired and unkempt, but otherwise seemed in good spirits despite what sounded like a harrowing five days. It is good to be here, Engel began. Im very happy that were able to do this live shot this morning. From there, he explained that they were traveling with a band of Syrian...More...'The Voice' recap: The final three compete for the crownBy Amy ReiterFrom its first moments to its last, "The Voice" struck a perfectly pitched emotional chord in this season's final performance Monday night, highlighting music's power to access pain and sorrow, tohealand to uplift. Friday's heartbreaking tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, never far from our thoughts in the intervening days, was directly addressed in the show's initial moments. The coaches, contestants and hosts gathered onstage amongst flickering candles to sing a tribute  Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" -- to those killed. They held small placards with the names and ages of the victims. So many 6s and 7s. As much as we've read about and tried to absorb the incomprehensible loss  or avoided the news and tried to process its essence without its details  the solemn song, and those simple signs, brought it home. And it brought the rest of the evening into sharp relief. After a quick look back at the journeys of the three remaining singers, Nicholas David, Terry...More...Tuesday's TV Highlights: 'NCIS' on CBSBy Ed Stockly   Click here to download TV listings for the week Dec. 16 - 22 in PDF format    This week's TV Movies    SERIES The Voice: The season finale features performances from Rihanna, Kelly Clarkson, Bruno Mars and the Killers before Carson Daly announces the winner (9 p.m. NBC).Mankind The Story of All of Us: The season finale takes viewers to the end of the Civil War (9 p.m. History).Doomsday Preppers: In this timely new episode, a woman prepares for a hurricane in New York City (9 p.m. National Geographic).SPECIALSRamsay's Cookalong: Christmas: The British chef shares his favorite holiday recipes (7 and 10 p.m. BBC America).First Freedom: The Fight for Religious Liberty: This new special examines how the Founding Fathers dealt with freedom of religion (8 p.m. KOCE).The Iranian Americans: This new special looks at the hundreds of thousands of Iranians who live in the U.S. (9:30 p.m. KOCE).My Three Wives:This new special chronicles life with the Darger family, who inspired the HBO...More...Tuesday's TV Talk: Billy Crystal; Hugh Jackman; Quentin TarantinoCompiled by Ed Stockly   Click here to download TV listings for the week Dec. 16 - 22 in PDF format    This week's TV Movies    CBS This Morning Kayak co-founders Paul English and Steve Hafner.
