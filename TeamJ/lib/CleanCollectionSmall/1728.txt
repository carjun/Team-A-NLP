Obviously there will be guns that the law breakers get their hands on, just that there will be much less of them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]reddixiecup 3 points4 points5 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 3 points4 points5 points 14 hours agoThat's what I mean, sort of. To be a serial killer, a murderer has to do certain things, react certain ways, think certain things. That's why there's a difference between the Beltway Snipers and Ted Bundy, for example. It really is an overwhelmingly white male thing to do, and I don't think there's ever really been an explanation found as to why. It's not exclusively a white male thing obviously, but look at a list of serial killers and you'll find it to be predominantly men, and of the men you'll find it to be predominantly white men.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Half the interviews I've seen with the kids you could tell they didn't fully understand the gravity of the situation. I understand interviewing the children to read their quotes on the air, but I really don't think rerunning sound bites by 8 year olds who were just shot at is every ethical.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]reddixiecup 6 points7 points8 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 6 points7 points8 points 15 hours agoHere's a lengthy article on some at TruTV's Crime Library (which is a great site for looking into infamous crime of all kinds).The majority of mass murderers are males though, by far, just like serial killers. It's generally a white male phenomenon too, although that is basically because of the definition created for serial killers. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]reddixiecup 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoI agree with you on the mental health care part. I've been in this thread all day talking about it.However, I think you'll see people using the "Guns don't kill people, People kill people" shit just want their guns, while the people who want to blame video games are just uneducated on video games and youth culture as a whole. I'd guess the majority of reddit are young, so the majority of the site is just going to be divided guns vs no guns, while overwhelmingly pro-video games didn't cause anything.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]reddixiecup 7 points8 points9 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 7 points8 points9 points 15 hours agoThe constitution was authored when the idea of effortlessly killing 30 people, by a single person, within a few minutes was inconceivable.Never mind that the Constitution was written with an organized civilian militia to protect from a tyrant government in mind. Guns for personal use was not the idea behind the 2nd Amendment. "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."I still don't understand how the wording can be argued against this. It's like people forget the first half of the sentence.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]reddixiecup 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours agoI believe it was Anderson Cooper who was the one who originally said he wasn't going to refer to the Dark Knight shooter by name so as not to glamorize the killer. That's a start, but I absolutely agree with you. The 24-hour news cycle that essentially started with the OJ Simpson case feeds off these type of stories and turns them into sensationalized fluff instead of really looking at what the real causes are and seek change from the people (the government) who can achieve it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
