Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.) held a news conference on July 24, 2012, in Washington to criticize the sale to the public of high-capacity magazines for assault rifles, in the wake of the Colorado theater shootings.

Scott Applewhite / Associated Press)WASHINGTON -- U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.) renewed his call for new laws to combat gun violence following today's school shooting in Newtown, Conn. "This is a day of great sadness in America, and our hearts go out to the victims and their families.  This latest shooting tragedy is an unthinkable act of violence carried out against young children and innocent people.  Americans are sick and tired of these attacks on our children and neighbors and they are sick and tired of nothing being done in Washington to stop the bloodshed," Lautenberg said in a statement. "If we do not take action to address gun violence, shooting tragedies like this will continue.  As President Obama said, we must act now 'regardless of the politics.'"Lautenberg has often been a lonely voice on gun control, an issue that gets little traction in Washington but that he has steadily pushed. After the summer shooting at a movie theater in Colorado Lautenberg pushed his bill to ban the sale of high-capacity gun magazines.U.S. Rep. Allyson Schwartz (D., Pa.) also broached the topic, though in a less direct way."While nothing can relieve the pain of this tragedy, we can work to prevent these situations from happening again by engaging in a serious conversation about the issue of gun violence in our country," Schwartz said in a statement. "Today is a day for mourning the loss of the victims and for coming together as Americans to provide support for the community."Several other local lawmakers, including Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa) and U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R., Pa.) have sent out messages of sadness and condolences, though without making any remarks on gun laws.Jonathan Tamari @ 4:09 PMPermalink |  8 comments8commentsTweetemailPrevious Story:Homeland Security: no delay in arrest of Menendez internComments (8)0  like this / 0 don't    Posted 7:18 AM, 12/15/2012What action? bannedrepublicanSign in to report abuse Post your response Sign in to report abuseSelect a username to report abuseConfirm your registration to report abuse0  like this / 0 don't    Posted 7:54 AM, 12/15/2012How many more innocent people must die before we have stiffer gun control laws?  You can't go hunting with a hand gun or semi-automatic rifle.  We have laws to protect deer and other wildlife, how about passing legislation to protect six year old children.  What is the cost in NRA lobby dollars for a six year old life?  When is enough going to be enough? lefty27Sign in to report abuse Post your response Sign in to report abuseSelect a username to report abuseConfirm your registration to report abuse0  like this / 0 don't    Posted 11:14 AM, 12/15/2012Can you describe one law that would have stopped this madman from committing this horrendous crime?  You can pass a hundred laws, and all will take immediate effect on the millions of people who obey the law. Not a single one will stop a criminal.  They disregard the law.  Since law-abiding people seldom commit crimes, your wished-for gun laws will do practically nothing to stop these acts of violence.

Many schools are already designated as "Gun free zones".   Most deny people with mental issues the right to posess firearms.  What other laws could have helped?

I support new laws barring mentally-ill from stealing handguns, and I am certain the NRA would agree.  The NRA has already gone on record as opposed to murder.

It is literally why we have an America in the first place. The 2nd amendment provides protection for all our rights and freedoms. No tragedy, no matter how tragic will ever change those facts. That is why the 2nd amendment will ever be changed. Lefty - Lefty27 = agenda agenda agenda...gun control whack job.

Everyone agrees that mentally ill people should not own guns, let alone steal and murder with them.  To twist this into something it is not is truly disgusting.
