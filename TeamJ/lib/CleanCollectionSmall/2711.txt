Some courses can actually be brutal. A lot of STEM students base the discipline on their familiarity with intro-101.Remember that sociology is the marriage between philosophy and probability theory. There's a lot of statistics, and although stats aren't real math by STEM standards, some students are eaten alive by it. Social theory classes can often have 100 pages per week of poorly-translated 100-year-old German, with 20 page essays due each semester. It might not sound hard, but when you get to your senior year and five courses are like this, it can be killer.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThen and now.  by  hellponyin  pics[+]TeaPotCoffee 107 points108 points109 points 5 days ago*(0 children)[]TeaPotCoffee 107 points108 points109 points 5 days ago*My dad said during the 60's there were some race riots, and there was 'white flight' where the middle-class white residents of Detroit left for suburbia and took their purchasing power and intellectual/labor capital with them. It was a slow-going process. Not sure how accurate this is, I'd love to be corrected by someone more knowledgeable.He said he remembered in Windsor during the race riots people set up lawn chairs across the river and watched Detroit burn.Edit: spelling.

Best I can come up with is they ran it by management and security first, picked out that specific chunk in advance of shooting, and agreed all (potential) losses of gold dust would be compensated for through reimbursement. Because Rick Mercer is well-respected and works for the government (CBC), it's easier to get away with this kind of thing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo this beauty came in today.  by  SPUN223in  guns[+]TeaPotCoffee 23 points24 points25 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]TeaPotCoffee 23 points24 points25 points 7 days agoYou wouldn't happen to be a clown that drives an ice cream truck, would you?permalinksavecontextfull commentsHere it is finally after 4 years of hard work, my thousand dollar monitor stand!  by  gadgetsanin  funny[+]TeaPotCoffee 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]TeaPotCoffee 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoOui!
