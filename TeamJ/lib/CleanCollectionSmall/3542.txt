"Anyone perpetrating that information, could, in fact, be subject to arrest and be prosecuted federally."Asked if anyone has been identified or questioned, Vance said: "They're working on that right now."Reporting about the case has been marred by confusion and false leads.Shortly after the story first broke, news reports surfaced referencing a Facebook page attributed to Ryan Lanza, the name initially believed to be that of the gunman, who was later identified as Adam Lanza.It had first been floated after police found an ID bearing that name on the gunman's body. The ID turned out to belong to the 20-year-old's brother.US media said reporters swarmed the home of another Ryan Lanza in New Jersey. A wrong Ryan Lanza also picked up a slew of followers on Twitter.Adam Lanza, who also murdered his mother before heading to the school, killed himself following the slayings.Copyright   2012   AFP.
