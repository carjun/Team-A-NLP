And yes, it is hate towards the gypsies. People generally see the bad, I've traveled in a few places around Europe but Romanian gypsies were there before me and when Romanian gypsies do something they're not referred to as gypsies but as Romanians. So when someone asks you where you're from and you say "Romania" they get this little "ohhh ... " on they're face and in they're eyes. It's not a pleasant feeling. permalinksavecontextfull commentsEuropean Roma descended from Indian 'untouchables', genetic study shows: Roma gypsies in Britain and Europe are descended from "dalits" or low caste "untouchables" who migrated from the Indian sub-continent 1,400 years ago, a genetic study has suggested.  by  davidreiss666in  worldnews[+]useitonce 5 points6 points7 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]useitonce 5 points6 points7 points 11 days agoGo out in the real world .. permalinksavecontextfull commentsEuropean Roma descended from Indian 'untouchables', genetic study shows: Roma gypsies in Britain and Europe are descended from "dalits" or low caste "untouchables" who migrated from the Indian sub-continent 1,400 years ago, a genetic study has suggested.  by  davidreiss666in  worldnews[+]useitonce 9 points10 points11 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]useitonce 9 points10 points11 points 11 days agoOh you .. http://www.topnews.in/files/Angela-Merkel_17.jpgpermalinksavecontextfull commentsEuropean Roma descended from Indian 'untouchables', genetic study shows: Roma gypsies in Britain and Europe are descended from "dalits" or low caste "untouchables" who migrated from the Indian sub-continent 1,400 years ago, a genetic study has suggested.  by  davidreiss666in  worldnews[+]useitonce 4 points5 points6 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]useitonce 4 points5 points6 points 11 days agoBut that's the point, 100% of them adhere to that "stereotype".

I guess people tend to "deny" you opportunities... they did steal it, or stole stuff to buy it ! it's not an assumption, it's a sure thingWhen people say Roma they don't associate skin color, I'll give you an example ( this is what I found on google ): these are roma students http://www.romanialibera.ro/usr/thumbs/thumb_511_x_340/2011/04/12//176441-foto-proiect-1.jpg, no one associates them with Roma when you see them/talk to them ? ... how about now http://churry-burry.ro/images/stories/news/august-2011/rromi-77564323.jpg ... that's the Roma Europe hates.permalinksavecontextfull comments130122nd EU clan application (self.WorldofTanks)submitted 20 days ago by useitonce to WorldofTanks5 commentssharecancelloading...This is my heater.

The service SSP provides is restricted to certain ip's and you have to authenticate against it ( I work in this area of IT ). In this case they were using google's frontend to query the SSP service ! They couldn't have done it without google, I know the exact thing they used and none of the other comparison sites ( GoCompare for example ) have this flaw. It's a 50/50 split blame here.3rd of all - this is not exactly Google: "This is an independent comparison service provided by Google, which is a trading name of BeatThatQuote.com Limited, an appointed representative of Best Value Financial Services Limited, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA)" but it's their responsabiltypermalinksavecontextfull commentsGaping hole in Google service exposes thousands to ID theft  by  ukpdmin  technology[+]useitonce 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]useitonce 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI like how they throw it all at SSP ... it's your bloody front !permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit Meetup X : December 1st @ Mello Mello, 6pm.  by  Beholdin  Liverpool[+]useitonce 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]useitonce 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoYes, we meet again.permalinksavecontextfull commentsA good sum-up of the unemployment situation in Greece  by  Tentacles4ALLin  bestof[+]useitonce 24 points25 points26 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]useitonce 24 points25 points26 points 1 month agopolitical rant, yes, wholly uninteresting, I wouldn't say so. i've been to greece a couple of times 4-5 years ago ( spent about 3 months in Athens )bureaucracy ... dealing with a public servant was your worse nightmareno one spoke about work outside of work, end of work day was end of work day TO THE MINUTE, the office was empty 1 minute afterhard labor work ? please, that's for the albanian, romanian and other migrants - now they want them out : "They're taking out jobs"And the worse thing, this self-entitlement when it came to what the government owes you ... "Oh .. the government must provide, I'm a greek".The greek are a very proud people, I guess they're history gives them that right, but right now they're only hurting themselves. I wish, I so wish they would leave the Euro and left to fend for themselves.

Personally I did 2 transfers, Mata and Sinclair out. You have plenty in your bank, I got Michu and Nasri. Michu is a sure thing for the next 4-5 games, even if he won't have the same number of points I'm certain he'll be on an average 7 points. Nasri was a gamble for me but they're playing Norwich this week so .. I hope he'll pay off the 2 transfers.I kept Torres and benched him for this week, his in very good form and Hazzard looks like he can provide the assists it needs.I kept Cole too, he won't get that many points but he's a guaranteed 4-5 points / game. Just take the hit of Chelsea not playing this week.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
