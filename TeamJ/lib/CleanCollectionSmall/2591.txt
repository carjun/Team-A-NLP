He`s not even the best drummer in The Beatles!"  by  BeowulfShaefferin  todayilearned[+]DecentPizza 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]DecentPizza 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI try to imagine, say, Neil Peart, Keith Moon, or John Bonham in the Beatles, and I think it would significantly detract from what they accomplished. Ringo's drumming on A Day in the Life is PERFECT for that song, and a lot of drummers really respect him (check out Phil Collin's quote in http://web2.airmail.net/gshultz/drumpage.html).In some ways it is like the beatles guitar playing. They don't get a lot of guitar love, but then you try to learn something like "And Your Bird Can Sing" or all of the parts on "The End" and you realize how melodic and skilled they are. A lot of times technically the parts can be simple to learn, but just don't sound RIGHT.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOnly in Miami  by  chaoticdoghousein  WTF[+]DecentPizza 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]DecentPizza 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI'd follow him to his bitchin' party.

People get their panties wadded when you use x-mas, or change it from x-mas to CHRISTMAS, etc. You don't usually see christmas crossed out and replaced with x-mas, because it is such a blatantly retarded action. I know the history of it. With all the the bad things going on in the world, I honestly didn't think anyone would actually care enough to respond multiple times to this.

It is like asking "name the best basketball player/wide receiver of all time." It feels like cheating to say Michael Jordan or Jerry Rice, and you can probably come up with decent arguments for alternatives, but everyone at least admits they belong in the conversation, if not at the top of all-time greatest lists. I think what is most interesting is how EFFORTLESS the album (and his others) sounds. It doesn't FEEL complex, but it revolutionized the use of alternative time signatures in jazz and popular (western) music; it's difficult to tap your toes or dance in 9/8 and 5/4. It is just such a melodic album, compared to a lot of other jazz that follows the round-robin solo format. I know that if I had to pick one jazz album to take to a desert island, it WOULD be Time Out.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDave Brubeck, jazz pianist, dead at age 91  by  thomfountainin  Music[+]DecentPizza 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]DecentPizza 1 point2 points3 points 8 days agoI know, I had the same thought. His playing was so subtle and melodic. He didn't play incredibly fast, but then he whips something like this riff out, and you're just like "It would take 10 years of practice to reproduce that."permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
