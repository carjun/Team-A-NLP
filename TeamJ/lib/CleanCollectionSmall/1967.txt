Adam Lanza is the shooter, though. If so, pretty much his whole family is dead, now. I'm hoping against hope that he had nothing to do with it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

He did not travel to a capitol building to specifically meet with the PM in that outfit. Regardless, you just inferred that he's a moron because of something he wore. Also, they're still together. My little sister follows him like a starving man after a steak. I absorb a lot of info about this dude. And it doesn't help that I find him rather catchy as well. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsPolice foil plot to murder and castrate Justin Bieber with 'bounty set at $2,500 per testicle'  by  theanswermancanin  offbeat[+]touchy610 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]touchy610 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoHow, exactly, does he behave like a moron? Other than wearing clothes you do not approve of and driving shiny cars, of course. Does he do heavy drugs? Drive drunk? Did he drop out of school at 10? Is he physically abusive to people? Do you know him personally, and have experienced these things?Or do you simply have a problem with him being an average, overly-socialized teenager with massive popularity and wealth?permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy fourteen year old cousin just posted this on Facebook of her baby she had at 23 weeks.

If I am out walking for more than 15-20 minutes, it is almost inevitable that some guy will pull up and try to get me in his car.The most disgusting thing is that it happened much more when I was 13 (and lived in a fairly quiet, boring town) than it does now, at 25 and living less than a mile away from one of the largest universities in the US.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAskreddit thread about Scams.

And then there's the fact that they attempt to dip their fingers into the political spectrum, which is something a non-profit based on health and disease should not be doing.I'd much rather contribute my time and money to a smaller and more provably legitimate non-profit over one that has made cancer a commodity.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPolice foil plot to murder and castrate Justin Bieber with 'bounty set at $2,500 per testicle'  by  theanswermancanin  offbeat[+]touchy610 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]touchy610 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoI'm willing to bet you also didn't have a ridiculous amount of money and fame.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKel'Thuzad by Dmitriy Prozorov  by  FenrirIIIin  ImaginaryMonsters[+]touchy610 8 points9 points10 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]touchy610 8 points9 points10 points 2 days agoHe's not like a human skeleton or something, though.

[fb]  by  jazzyfilly04in  funny[+]touchy610 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]touchy610 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoIt's quite odd, because people aren't generally supposed to claim households separately, especially if they're both claiming the same kids. I have to wonder how they're going about it.And I go to Walmart all the time. I'm on foodstamps myself, so I get most of my items like dried goods (rice, flour, beans), canned stuff and snacks from Walmart because they're super cheap, and I can reserve my stamps for the more expensive fresh veggies, fruits and meats that I get from a smaller regional grocery store. :)I just don't understand why a family would need to file separately to get so much when $600 flat would be plenty to feed a moderately-sized family well. I get $350 for my household of four, and we eat quite well. The rest of our finances currently suck, but I've not hurt for healthy meals while on foodstamps.permalinksavecontextfull commentsYou have got to be joking me - r/atheism considers it a victory that 83% of ONLINE USERS would rather be atheists than PEDOPHILES!

WE DID IT REDDIT!!!  by  food_bagin  circlebroke[+]touchy610 36 points37 points38 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]touchy610 36 points37 points38 points 3 days agoWell, I think originally it was meant to be a place just for atheists to talk about atheist-y stuff, which is understandable, especially when you happen to, for example, have a super religious family or live in a predominantly religious small town, and don't have many people to talk to or rant to.It's just become a place to mock and belittle others for their own beliefs and life choices, though. I was rather meh about them until the time I found that they go onto /r/Islam to disrespect others, and for a few days were constantly posting highly disrespectful caricatures of Allah in /r/Islam. Many of them are more ignorant than the religions they belittle. permalinksavecontextfull commentsYou have got to be joking me - r/atheism considers it a victory that 83% of ONLINE USERS would rather be atheists than PEDOPHILES!
