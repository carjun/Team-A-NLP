I think guns are cool and have practical uses, but I always thought that, like many things, existing regulations are not enforced seriously. Maybe this kid purchased all his weapons legitimately and snaped later, maybe there were truancy officers already on scene, maybe no one wanted to be the hero or were taken by suprise?  The investigation has barely even started, it's still to early to be playing  monday morning quaterback and calling for action. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBreaking: Shooting reported at a Connecticut elementary school - a gun-free-zone  by  The_Libertarianin  Libertarian[+]those_draculas 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]those_draculas 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoAnother report says he had body armor and four weaponsI wonder if the school had truancy officers stationed at the school, like many do, though?*now there are reports the shooter killed his parents before going to the school, this has to be one of the worst sprees in US history.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBreaking: Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting: Newtown, Connecticut Teacher Wounded, Reports Say  by  MrsSippyin  conspiracy[+]those_draculas 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]those_draculas 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes agobad economy, bad political climate, bad mental healthcare system(not to mention the stigma), bad enforcement of existing gun control laws... it's the perfect cultural storm for insane assholes to snap in the worst way possible. permalinksavecontextfull commentsLong Awaited Sneak Peak of the Upcoming Conquest Mode  by  Jman5in  mwo[+]those_draculas 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes ago (0 children)[]those_draculas 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes agoohh okay, thanks!permalinksavecontextfull commentsBreaking: Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting: Newtown, Connecticut Teacher Wounded, Reports Say  by  MrsSippyin  conspiracy[+]those_draculas 1 point2 points3 points 43 minutes ago (0 children)[]those_draculas 1 point2 points3 points 43 minutes agothat's actually a very reasonable thing to say for the WH spokesman, I'm quite suprised.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBreaking: Shooting reported at a Connecticut elementary school - a gun-free-zone  by  The_Libertarianin  Libertarian[+]those_draculas -1 points0 points1 point 46 minutes ago (0 children)[]those_draculas -1 points0 points1 point 46 minutes agoAll I'm saying we don't even have all the facts yet to be throwing around accusations, the psycho might've had some sort of miltary grade automatic weapon or grenades for all we knowpermalinksavecontextfull commentsBreaking: Shooting reported at a Connecticut elementary school - a gun-free-zone  by  The_Libertarianin  Libertarian[+]those_draculas 4 points5 points6 points 52 minutes ago (0 children)[]those_draculas 4 points5 points6 points 52 minutes agoIt's a  completely unconcievable evil, most of the victims weren't even born 10 years ago, they have no say in society, there's nothing they could've done to trigger this ... why them?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Each player can have a load out of 2 or 3 'mechs on a dropship, your mech dies but you manage to eject in time, the screen fades to black and you're airdroped in on your second mech. Your cockpit is destroyed or takes critical damage before you eject, you're dead for the round. permalinksavecontextfull commentsRemove a Stain on the Supreme Court by Impeaching Justice Scalia  by  chefrandenin  politics[+]those_draculas 8 points9 points10 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]those_draculas 8 points9 points10 points 3 hours agoall Justices have biases on issues. It comes from their interpretation on constitutional law, it's not a prejudicial statement to say that laws banning homosexuality stem from moral considerations, like he did.

Besides this, the "miracle plant" is still not widely used like wood paper or more modern textiles. The whole premise that hemp would be popular if it wasn't for Hearst(who actually invested heavily in hemp farms, even when buying up timber like crazy) and the DuPonts is bunk. Bigotry against the Irish and Mexicans was a bigger  motivator than corporate interest.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnother US Military "feel-good" propaganda post backfires and implodes when people see through the bullshit.
