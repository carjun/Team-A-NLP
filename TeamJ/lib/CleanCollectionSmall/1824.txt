Don't let this creep scar other kids too. Parents, maybe shut down the TV, radio, and internet for the day.Replace horror with something warm and memorable. Bake cookies together, play some games, maybe open a Christmas present early.permalinksave[+]omegaphora 9 points10 points11 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]omegaphora 9 points10 points11 points 23 hours agoThanks.. I'm going home tonight and baking some bread with my daughter, and having some extra snuggles. I am blessed to be far from CT..permalinksaveparent[+]Quarkity 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Quarkity 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoBaking bread sounds like a lovely distraction. Hug your child close. I am childless, but I want to be a mother someday and this story broke my heart. permalinksaveparent[+]Fishooked 10 points11 points12 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Fishooked 10 points11 points12 points 23 hours agoMy kids are coming home from school any moment - I've switched channels and dont really plan on scaring the shit out of them with this news.permalinksaveparent[+]jenrazzle 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]jenrazzle 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours agoThis is the best idea. My little brother is about to get home from school and he's getting a big hug and a trip to the grocery store to pick out ingredients for whatever his heart desires. Then cooking party. Thanks <3.permalinksaveparent[+]criveros -5 points-4 points-3 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]criveros -5 points-4 points-3 points 22 hours agoNo. Prepare your kids for a situation like this.permalinksaveparent[+]illgresi 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]illgresi 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours agoThis is not the way to "prepare" your kids. And how would you prepare a kid for something like this anyway? Schools already do routine lock-down drills, and educate their students on how to behave during something like this, the best a parent can do is say yes, sometimes bad things happen at school, but you need to stay calm and listen to your teacher. I don't think saying, look at these adults crying and being upset, look at all these police breaking down doors, and this guy in handcuffs, and these kids being led out with their eyes closed and crying, imagine your entire classroom dead, being shot, is the ideal way to "prepare" your kids. It will just panic them and do no future good.permalinksaveparent[+]moonmixer 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]moonmixer 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours agoNo child should be prepared to fight or escape an armed psychopath. Children rely on teachers and administrators and above all POLICE AND GOVERNMENT to deal with these kind of situations for them.The only places where children are prepared to deal with gunmen is in countries where the children are gunmen themselves. I don't think we want to go down that road.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
