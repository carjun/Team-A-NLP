You think about everything that these kids could've been all gone. All the joy they bring is all gone. It's so fucking depressing.

Just like Mancini did here with Young. Third, I thought it was a bit funny an Arsenal fan is bitching about another manager pissin' and moanin' when his own manager does a bit as well. But I'm sure it's all justified, right? And finally fourth and I'll stfu.                                                    He's always whining. All he does is whine.

Martinez did well, Rodgers was great, and I'm really hoping Laudrop continues to improve the club. They are an absolute footballing joy to watch!permalinksavecontextfull commentsEven with the blurred faces, you can tell they're laughing at him.  by  ThrowCarpin  cringepics[+]KingCantona07 56 points57 points58 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]KingCantona07 56 points57 points58 points 9 days agoI don't think he cares, he's about to get a good up skirt shot anywayspermalinksavecontextfull commentsMatch Thread: Manchester United vs CFR Cluj  by  yiyiyiyiin  reddevils[+]KingCantona07 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]KingCantona07 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoWow, that's a cracker of a shot.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
