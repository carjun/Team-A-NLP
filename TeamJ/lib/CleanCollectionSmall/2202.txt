Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Saucy_Taco 30 points31 points32 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco 30 points31 points32 points 1 hour agoSandy Hook is my hometown too, and I just can't believe this.  Never would have expected this, not in Newtown, not in an elementary school, not in a million years.  Thinking about the dead child's parents makes me want to cry, and I'm furious.  Who the hell attacks a place where the age of the students tops out at 10 years old?  It just doesn't seem real.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKey and Peele present two styles of rap  by  blfangin  videos[+]Saucy_Taco 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoI've already gotten off twice.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKey and Peele present two styles of rap  by  blfangin  videos[+]Saucy_Taco -1 points0 points1 point 3 hours ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco -1 points0 points1 point 3 hours agoThat's a bit of an irrational jump and exaggeration about what I said isn't it?  Considering that Twilight is generally accepted as a literary piece of crap (except among easily impressional teenaged girls), and that comparing Key and Peele to Chappelle is only one example.  Here are some examples of new things I think are better than old things; Modern Cars>steel death traps of the past, Smart Phones>flip phones, Skype>AIM, Peter Jackson's LOTR>old animated version, The Black Keys>Nickleback, The new Batman movies>the old, My bone structure>my grandmas osteoarthritis....... I could go on for a very long time really.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKey and Peele present two styles of rap  by  blfangin  videos[+]Saucy_Taco 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours agoI respect your opinion sir and or madam!permalinksavecontextfull commentsKey and Peele present two styles of rap  by  blfangin  videos[+]Saucy_Taco -3 points-2 points-1 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco -3 points-2 points-1 points 10 hours agoYou don't think they are just trying to mimic the Chappelle show?permalinksavecontextfull commentsKey and Peele present two styles of rap  by  blfangin  videos[+]Saucy_Taco 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours agoOh hell no, you did not just say that.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKey and Peele present two styles of rap  by  blfangin  videos[+]Saucy_Taco -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours agoYes they are absolutely terrible.

It's like saying Twilight's character development and story telling is on par with Interview With a Vampire.[edit] nom nom nom your downvotes are delicious.

Sorry.  But it had to be said by someone in this gigantic circle jerk.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNY Times: "It is a dark day for the rule of law.

Pendleton Ward makes a ton of not so subtle drug references in the show.  Some fan pic of Jake smoking some trees is not going to be the kids first exposure to weed, or be what spurs them into becoming a smoker.  They've got their friends, TV shows, movies, parents and heck even the daily news for that.  And lets face it, if they are already on the internet-and reddit at that-then they have most likely been exposed to far worse things already.  It's not our job to be the parents of potential children lurkers, it's their parents job.ps. Everything, even gasp the internet, has the potential to be psychologically addictive.  Everything.  So I don't really see your point in bringing that up. permalinksavecontextfull commentsEverybody Talks (Nigel Thornberry Cover)  by  KlLLADELPHIAin  NigelThornberry[+]Saucy_Taco 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoOh no, I think Nigel got into the schnopps!permalinksavecontextfull commentsScary Monsters and Nice Sprites ( Nigel Thornberry Remix )  by  konow1in  NigelThornberry[+]Saucy_Taco 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoI wasn't going to give any up-votes because of the lack of blarrggghhh's, but then DUGONGS!

They all have this aching need to know all of my personal sexual history.  Then they judge me severely on it, and I end up feeling tremendous pressure to divulge some pretty personal tidbits about my sex life to satisfy their concept of bisexuality!The point is, I shouldn't have to divulge any of my sexual exploits at all for people to accept me as bisexual, it's none of their darn business, and they should understand that I know my own preferences! permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am a bisexual woman, and my lifestyle doesn't need to fit your concept of what bisexuality should look like.  by  Saucy_Tacoin  bisexual[+]Saucy_Taco[S] 3 points4 points5 points 18 days ago (0 children)[]Saucy_Taco[S] 3 points4 points5 points 18 days agoOK! :Dpermalinksavecontextfull comments24151617Sick of people asking me for details about my sexual history as proof of my bisexuality!
