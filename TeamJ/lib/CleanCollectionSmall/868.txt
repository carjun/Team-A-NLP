I've asked my wife to leave the TV off for the day and we'll probably have a local/network news blackout in the family room for a few days (if not the rest of their lives).We won't mention it anytime soon. If asked I will explain that there are some seriously bad, bad, bad people who do terrible things, but they are extremely rare, and there are so many good people that the good guys almost always stop them. I will emphasize that their school is very safe and that there are like a million schools and this only happened at one, and they have nothing to fear. Thank god the older one understands this as we've covered it before (1 in a million, cancer odds, etc). Not sure what to say to the preschooler so I really hope she doesn't get it.permalinksaveparent[+]BRBaraka 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]BRBaraka 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agothank youpermalinksaveparent[+]RefuseBit 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]RefuseBit 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoCome over here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/14urvb/after_the_ct_shooting_im_about_2_seconds_from/permalinksaveparent[+]BRBaraka 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]BRBaraka 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agothank youpermalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
