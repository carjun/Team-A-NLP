We need reporters on the scene, but we need them to be human before being reporters. That's advice that's stuck with me in my young news career so far.permalinksaveparent[+]titticut_warrendale 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]titticut_warrendale 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago...trawling through Reddit looking for a scoop?permalinksaveparent[+]ihatewomen1925 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]ihatewomen1925 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoHe must work for gawker permalinksaveparent[+]Epistalion 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Epistalion 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoThe problem is getting your human aspect, which usually means quotes, while also trying to maintain a level of empathy. It's a really narrow line, and national, breaking stories have to be done extremely quickly. It's very difficult. And in lieu of spreading false rumors, it makes more sense to report based on what the people involved are saying.permalinksaveparent[+]FalconHunter 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]FalconHunter 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoYes, but if you don't get sound and the other guys do, it's your ass in a sling in the next meeting./get out while you still can.permalinksaveparent[+]Taniwha_NZ -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago (1 child)[]Taniwha_NZ -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours agoI don't think we need reporters at the scene of something like this. Why exactly is it so urgent that the public knows about this? How is anything any news organization doing today helping any aspect of it?permalinksaveparent[+]bigjimslade101 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours ago (0 children)[]bigjimslade101 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours agoSurely if nothing else it's prescient information to the local community.  The press can't do much else but sit on the location and ask questions of those who wish to be interviewed and report what the police tell them.  That way, the local community knows what has gone on, what is currently going on and what will happen in the next few days.  It may matter less to the national news viewer, but it's vital information for anyone living in that area.  permalinksaveparent[+]Katie1230 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Katie1230 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoIt's like whenever something really fucked up happens, the media gets this 'tragedy boner'...permalinksaveparent[+]Carbon_Dirt 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Carbon_Dirt 7 points8 points9 points 1 day agoThey could at least back off the victims; the children at the very least. Pry as much as they want out of the cops, but let the sufferers go home.permalinksaveparent[+]mens_libertina 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]mens_libertina 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoThey could stick to adults, as I thought was policy.

The media is meeting demands for information. How much is too much? The line is blurry.  permalinksaveparent[+]gruffalos 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gruffalos 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoExactly this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8rMYyegT5Ypermalinksaveparent[+]sixbux 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]sixbux 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoThere should still be some sense of etiquette, though.permalinksaveparent[+]mehughes124 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]mehughes124 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoYou can decry something when you witness it without being hypocritical or even part of the problem, you know. He's looking for news on an important event, and he sees how it is being done and calling it tasteless. That doesn't make him complicit in the act.permalinksaveparent[+]GenuinelyCrooked 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]GenuinelyCrooked 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoI think constant updates are a good thing, but I don't think getting those updates from the kids is a good thing. Since I can't know where they got their information until after I've read it, how can I avoid it? permalinksaveparent[+]Coryshepard117 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Coryshepard117 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoIt's pretty gross. Fox News is using this as a preaching tool. I'm sorry, I thought you were here to report the news, not exploit tragedy. permalinksaveparent[+]TrolleyPower 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]TrolleyPower 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoBut it's just human nature to follow a story like this. The media have to take the lead when it's known that extensive media coverage of an event like this just inspires other crazies to do the same thing. permalinksaveparent[+]pretentiousRatt 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]pretentiousRatt 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoI know what you are saying. It is partially our fault for demanding constant updates but the reporters should be tactful enough to keep their fucking microphones out of the little kid's faces.Since people INSIST on shooting people up so often, I wish they just happened inside the news networks instead of schools. There would be less fake "journalists" in the world and they would be all set up to broadcast every little minuscule rumor immediately... I'm going to start a petition on change.org to have the next big shooting in the Fox newsroom.  permalinksaveparent[+]GaryDuder 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]GaryDuder 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoDon't got a TV Phallic. I sure do spend some time on this internet box though.permalinksaveparent[+]ThreadBearCo 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]ThreadBearCo 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoYeah, ignore it, it will go away.It's not like that will drive the media to try to be even more invasive and sensationalist in order to boost their falling numbers.permalinksaveparent[+]SubliminalHint -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoThe biggest promise is that this is probably the best way to get live, updated information. For at least the first few hours. Twitter is a good option as well. But live news coverage is still necessary to some extent. After 6 hours though it's too much. And constant interviewing of fucking children, and mental health experts, and ex-swat commanders is a little too much. Another great way to get information, is to listen to the scanner online. Straight from the men and women on the ground without hyped up media bullshit. permalinksaveparent[+]joeanon 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (4 children)[]joeanon 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThat won't stop them. It would only take a small audience to make their advertising worth the hype.permalinksaveparent[+]swested 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (2 children)[]swested 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoTo be honest...I think an event of this depravity and magnitude is hard to "hype".permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThere should be coverage, but how much? permalinksaveparent[+]swested 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]swested 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoAs much as it takes to drive home the message that we have some incredibly fucked up things going on in this country.Frankly, it beats hearing about some bullshit about Lindsey Lohan or endless political posturing on Capitol Hill.permalinksaveparent[+]Dog-Modernist 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Dog-Modernist 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoNah. Turn it off man. Don't give me that shit. I haven't watched CABLE NEWS in fucking ages. Turn it the fuck off and tell anyone and everyone you know to do the same. Don't sell this idea that it "won't stop them."permalinksaveparent[+]Baraka_Flocka_Flame 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Baraka_Flocka_Flame 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoExactly. One could even argue that the media is to blame for such mass shootings and the copy cats that often follow. The shooters in situations like this want one thing: to go down in infamy as the person who caused all that terror. I believe most redditors are familiar with this video that explains it quite well. It's always worth bringing up and watching when a horrendous situation like this occurs:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PezlFNTGWv4&sns=empermalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
