All I can hope is that the justice system comes through and handles this correctly (although the death penalty was repealed not too long ago here so neither this guy nor the Cheshire home invasion guys are going to get it)permalinksavecontextfull commentsI havent seen a single Ohmwrecker yet...  by  Mollendoin  leagueoflegends[+]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWell it builds out of a catalyst, and 9 times out of ten when I build that I'm going for rod of ages because it will be more beneficial.

The GOP isn't what it is today because a bunch of guys got around and said let's create a party fueled by hate, it's more like "hey if we create a party with those messages then people will vote for us" they're merely delegates vying for election who probably aren't racist at all, it's all about the voterspermalinksavecontextfull commentsLie of the Year: the Romney campaign's ad on Jeeps made in China  by  Maxcactusin  politics[+]T0X1CSPIKES -8 points-7 points-6 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES -8 points-7 points-6 points 2 days agoExactly, which is why I wouldn't call all Democrats racist just because at one point in history they were. The GOP will most likely change in the near future and what we are experiencing is merely a phase, since it is an ever-changing body of individuals don't judge them based on the crappy members they have in right now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLie of the Year: the Romney campaign's ad on Jeeps made in China  by  Maxcactusin  politics[+]T0X1CSPIKES -25 points-24 points-23 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES -25 points-24 points-23 points 2 days ago*Yeah the GOP is so racist, it's not like that was the led the way for equality and the abolition of slavery. The GOP may be a lot of things but racist isn't one of them.   Edit: Wow this subreddit is just as bad as they say, first time I've ever tried to bring something up here and I was completely on topic yet I get downvoted because people don't agree with me, this is a sad sad subreddit and everything people say about it really is the truth, not even exaggerated in he slightestpermalinksavecontextfull commentsThe impact reddit.com/r/cringe has on people.  by  RowanOin  cringe[+]T0X1CSPIKES 8 points9 points10 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 8 points9 points10 points 2 days agoNow all we need is an /r/cringejerk and we'll have come full circle.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTricking your...  by  rebeckalouisein  funny[+]T0X1CSPIKES 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoAnd if it's been on reddit, it's probably also been on 4chan for a while and will soon end up on both 9gag and facebook.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNever gonna happen  by  minorwinin  atheism[+]T0X1CSPIKES -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoThis doesn't really make any sense, I wouldn't expect a science classroom to invest equal time teaching new earth creationism so why would I expect a church to spend equal time teaching evolution theory?permalinksavecontextfull commentsGenetically engineered white blood cells score 100% percent success rate in combating leukaemia in human trials.  by  SolomonGrundlein  science[+]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoIsn't this basically how I Am Legend started?permalinksavecontextfull commentsCurse.EU is being released  by  Kickass_Cajunin  leagueoflegends[+]T0X1CSPIKES -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoMan just release the NA team, at least Curse EU looks promisingpermalinksavecontextfull commentsGood guy Scotland  by  ggpurehopein  atheism[+]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoAnd now they're out of business, gee I wonder why.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow it feels to be the only sober one in a party.  by  Ohguaoin  funny[+]T0X1CSPIKES -3 points-2 points-1 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES -3 points-2 points-1 points 4 days agoDamn it even managed to make it onto /r/atheism ... twice.

The conservative grassroots are where the best conservative ideas are hatched and having a narrow cabal of proclaimed conservatives eliminate all users and all thoughts that are not strictly deeply within the established fox/murdoch storyline... EMBARASSES our party, and dooms it to forever be run by a smaller and smaller group of 40,50s, and 60 y/o white males. That's right, the moderators of /r/conservative and effectively excluded the vibrant thought factory that is Reddit!Conservatives are in the mist of reasserting their right to challenge the status quo and come up with fresh invigorating ideas. The shameful, elitist, universally offensive moderators on r/conservative shame the conservative movement. These moderators need to step aside, and state and national Republican (and Libertarian) party authorities need to immediately help these moderators step aside. These and other obstinate barriers to free thought must be put aside, for the good of conservatives and for Republicans like myself. We are better than this!!Because obviously politicians and the public in general take anything reddit says or does seriously. Do people actually think reddit has any influence on the world at all? "That's right, the moderators of /r/conservative have effectively excluded the vibrant thought factory that is Reddit!" Obviously the GOP is now doomed because a couple of people who run a conservative subreddit switched over to private. Also, "vibrant thought factory"; it's stuff like that that almost makes me question whether or not this dude is just the most ignorant person ever or he is the most effective troll to ever come out of /r/circlejerkpermalinksavecontextfull commentsLoLKing Guides are RUINED...  by  Darkchargerin  leagueoflegends[+]T0X1CSPIKES 9 points10 points11 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 9 points10 points11 points 4 days agoThat's an awful idea as well, Hyfe has the top Nasus guide on solomid.net right now along with one of the top guides on solomid of all time and he's only like 1300 elo.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone else getting tired of this borderless window bug?  by  akkiokamiin  leagueoflegends[+]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoI almost feel like there is no bug and people just want to show off their cool backgroundspermalinksavecontextfull commentsLet's talk Tristana  by  tinkerzin  leagueoflegends[+]T0X1CSPIKES 3 points4 points5 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 3 points4 points5 points 6 days agoTrist isn't too weak, other adc's are just better suited for the current meta, they can't make her early-mid better without breaking her, so as it is she is a late game carry with a halfway decent early and horrible mid game. There was a time when ezreal was never picked and there was a time when ashe was first pick first ban status, but that has all changed as well. Just give it time and we might see her used more.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI loved when this happened as a kid...  by  caffeinefreedomin  gaming[+]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoYeah that was always a double edged sword though, cause the guys my friends wanted to transform into were always the ones that got cut by that option -_-permalinksavecontextfull commentsI loved when this happened as a kid...  by  caffeinefreedomin  gaming[+]T0X1CSPIKES -1 points0 points1 point 6 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES -1 points0 points1 point 6 days agoUgh, I hated Shang Tsung, on the ps1 version of Mortal Kombat that I had every time he transformed into a character and back the game paused for like 30 seconds to load up the different character models, it got to the point where I would just tell my friends if they were gonna keep transforming like that then they couldn't play. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCrumbzz definitely going to jungle for Dignitas  by  Wervelwindin  leagueoflegends[+]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoOH GOD YESpermalinksavecontextfull commentsLocodoco interview at IPL5 by Hot Bid from Team Liquid  by  woot_toowin  leagueoflegends[+]T0X1CSPIKES 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]T0X1CSPIKES 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoNo wonder CLG didn't win ipl5, Loco's hair was in his eyes the whole time so he couldn't play well XDpermalinksavecontextfull comments25234Barack Obama to the House Republicans, "Do you even lift?"
