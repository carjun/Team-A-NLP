"Right now, it's just shock and disbelief. We're totally devastated. It's affecting all of us," said Rhonda Cullens, a neighbor of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter's dead mother, Nancy Lanza.Nancy Lanza was reportedly shot to death by her son, Adam, in their custom home on Yogananda Street in an upscale sub-division near the school, which remained sealed off as a crime scene by yellow police tape and was surrounded by scores of investigator vehicles Saturday morning."This is a very nice, quiet neighborhood and the only crime we have to worry about is kids smashing a mailbox," said Cullens, who lived a block away and was a casual acquaintance of Nancy Lanza. "We're a very close-knit, welcoming and warm neighborhood. A lot of people moved here because the school system is so good. It's shocking that anything like this would happen in our community."Cullens, a stay-at-home mom of two college-aged sons, recalled playing the drinking and dice game Bunco with Lanza and other neighborhood women on a monthly ladies' night out several years ago. They were the wives of executives who commuted to white-collar jobs in New York City or suburban corporate parks at GE, IBM and other large corporations."She was very nice and friendly," Cullens said of Lanza. "We had some conversations during the Bunco games. She seemed like the rest of us." Cullens never saw the shooter or Lanza's other son, Ryan, who reportedly lives in New Jersey and was interviewed by authorities shortly after the mass killing at the school.Cullens never met Lanza's former husband, reportedly a GE executive, and she did not know that the couple had divorced until long after the split in a neighborhood where the 4,000-square-foot homes are often set on large, heavily-treed, secluded lots that create a zone of privacy that neighbors are reluctant to cross. Cullens has lived there since 1993 and she said the Lanza home was built around 1998.Cullens was still shaken by the horrific, frightening scene that unfolded Friday morning in the small, tight-knit community just moments after Adam Lanza's shooting rampage that killed his mother and 20 young students and six adults dead at the elementary school.Cullens is an amateur photographer who was taking down a photo exhibit of the local photo club at the Municipal Center Friday morning when the scene turned tragic. News began filtering in that there had been a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Police and troopers began arriving and the building, which houses the Board of Education and Board of First Selectmen, went into lockdown mode. A big-screen TV was tuned to the unfolding tragedy. Some people cried. Others hugged. Everyone searched for answers amid the chaos and a gripping fear that their might be more shooters loose and bent on violence."Rhonda, where are your kids?" a friend asked Cullens. She said they had just finished finals week at college and were at the family home."Are you sure?" the friend asked. A bolt of fright shot through Cullens.That's when the Municipal Center was locked down, police secured the Board of Education offices and the situation grew even more tense.Cullens tried to remain calm and she told others around her: "Start praying. There's been a shooting at Sandy Hook."She described a scene of panic and devastation. "You could see the shock on everyone's face," she said. "A lot of people were crying."Cullens' two sons had attended Sandy Hook Elementary School, she was a volunteer there and knows most of the teachers and staff. When she saw her sons' beloved kindergarten teacher on TV, safe and uninjured, she wept tears of joy."It was a sense of overwhelming relief," Cullens said. "And then I just kept watching for other people I knew from the school, to see if they were OK."The Municipal Center was whipsawed by emotions of dread and fear Friday morning. "All sorts of rumors about maybe another shooter on the loose were floating around. When we heard police were searching our neighborhood, I heard a guy call his wife and say, 'Lock the doors.' "That's when Cullen called her house and told her two college-aged sons to lock their doors and be alert for any sign of an intruder."It was scary, very scary," Cullens said. "We didn't know what was going on. We were terrified there could be more shootings."Cullens said the people at the Municipal Center all had direct connections to teachers, staff, parents and students at the school and they waited grimly to get word if they were alive."When I saw a picture of one of the secretaries I dearly loved, I just broke down and hugged other people there," Cullens said. She learned that the secretary, whose name she did not want to disclose, was sick and had not reported to work at the school Friday."Otherwise, she probably would have been sitting in the office and might not have....," she said, as her voice trailed off.Cullens continued to say silent prayers and was relieved each time she saw a TV image of someone she knew at the school who had survived."Thank God they're OK," she repeated to herself. "The whole thing was just heart-wrenching."
