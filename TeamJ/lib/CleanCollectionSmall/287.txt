The gunman who fatally shot 20 children and six adults in a rampage Friday inside an elementary school here had forced his way into the building and was not allowed in by school staff, police said at a briefing this morning.Authorities did not describe exactly how the heavily armed shooter, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, got into the building and have not yet offered a possible motive for the killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Another murder victim, Lanzas mother Nancy, was found at her nearby home. Lanza apparently killed himself after the massacre.Victims have been identified by the state medical examiner, and authorities are expected to release their names later today.Throughout Newtown this morning, messages of condolence, written on homemade signs and banners, were posted in storefronts, at churches, and at homes.Outside the firehouse on the road leading to the school, where the parents of dead children gathered late into the night Friday, a dozen white balloons could be seen today tied to a sign that reads: Sandy Hook School Visitors Welcome.A sign outside the St. Rose of Lima Catholic Parish says the church will be open 24 hours.  Families with young children visited the church this morning, some stopping at candles set up outside. Mourners added a soccer ball, a doll, and flowers.Around town, the expressions on most faces were grim. Some cried quietly, others seemed to struggle not to. Stricken with grief and overwhelmed by the immense media presence, some declined to talk to reporters and shied away from cameras. Several people appeared upset as they told the members of the press to leave them and their community alone.At the Reed Intermediate School, counseling is being offered to friends, family, and others shaken by the tragedy. Media members were kept across the street from the school. Dozens of cars were in the parking lot.More details on the horrific scene inside the school continued to trickle out this morning.Mary Ann Jacob, who was teaching a class in the school library at about 9:30 a.m. Friday, told reporters gathered at this mornings press briefing that she first knew something was amiss when the school intercom clicked on and she heard some sort of scuffling and noises.It wasnt loud enough to interrupt her class, she said, and occasionally the intercom is turned on accidentally, so she called the office to let them know. The secretary picked up the phone and said there was a shooter in the building.Jacob and another teacher locked the library door, following emergency protocol, but they didnt know whether that would be enough to keep a gunman out. So they herded the children into a storage closet in the back.We thought we were safe, but then we were like, what if he tries to come in and starts to shoot? Jacob recalled. We just thought it would protect the kids better.Jacob handed out packs of crayons and paper in the closet and instructed the children to color.We told them it was a drill, Jacob recalled. But, she said, we knew.Mark Arsenault can be reached at marsenault@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @bostonglobemark.
