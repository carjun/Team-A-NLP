If you were to remove the starter, you can take it into autozone and have them test it for free (I love autozone). If that's not it, what was said earlier about the battery could be the culprit. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the biggest scandal that happened while you were in school?  by  Salty23in  AskReddit[+]GIBSON_854321 1 point2 points3 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]GIBSON_854321 1 point2 points3 points 29 days agoI don't think those qualifies as a scandal but ill post it anyways, even if it gets buried..... when I was in junior high, one student ended up accidentally killing his brother when he asked to see his dad's gun. I guess the dad forgot to clear the chamber when he handed it to the younger son. the younger one pretended to shoot his brother in the head, but it was loaded. The most fucked up thing about it is- when he finally went back to school, a kid walked up to him during one of his classes and yelled, "BOOM, HEADSHOT!". felt bad for the kid... permalinksavecontextfull comments[GEAR] 1956 Gibson J-45  by  tomtomglovein  Guitar[+]GIBSON_854321 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]GIBSON_854321 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoYou have my dream guitar...............permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe most horrible thing ever made as cake  by  somedelightfulmoronin  videos[+]GIBSON_854321 -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]GIBSON_854321 -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 month agoCAKE, SMASH!!!!!permalinksavecontextfull commentsI thought I would explain some things about the Hulk through pictures (spoilers)  by  JefeRochain  movies[+]GIBSON_854321 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]GIBSON_854321 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoTell me, what's Natalie Portman like?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's in your gig bag and why?  by  Iainfixiein  DJs[+]GIBSON_854321 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]GIBSON_854321 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoI have almost identical items in my gig bag except I keep a spare water bottle, Tylenol, granola bars and breath mints in there. because, after a set/gig (I'm also in a band) I get sweaty and hungry. I don't want to leave the venue to get some food. so, it helps if I hydrate and grub right there. The mints are for when I network after a gig. I don't want to smell like alcohol/bad breath when speaking to future clients. oh, I do mostly corporate events. so, maybe some of this stuff isn't necessary for all djs.oh yeah, and painkillers are for when I sprain something *or hurt myself during a set, or for headaches. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
