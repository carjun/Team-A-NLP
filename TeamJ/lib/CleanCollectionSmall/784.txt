I'm not saying that there aren't unethical journalists who only care about a "scoop" but most of the interviews with children/parents i saw were pretty composed and well articulated. both my parents are journalists (my dad's a camera man, mom's a producer) and jesus they aren't soulless beasts who want to make childrens lives miserable. they want the public to know whats happening. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
