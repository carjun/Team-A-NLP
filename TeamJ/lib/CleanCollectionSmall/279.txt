Officials have identified all 27 bodies, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, and their identities will be disclosed soon, Lieutenant Paul Vance of the state police said today at a news briefing. Teams of detectives are still working at the crime scene, he said. The dead have been taken to the medical examiners office, his office said in a statement.  Detectives did produce some very good evidence in this investigation that our investigators will be able to use in hopefully painting the complete picture as to how, and more importantly, why this occurred, said Vance.  Slideshow: Mass Shooting at Connecticut School, Dozens KilledThe killer -- identified as Adam Lanza by two law- enforcement officials briefed on the matter -- was a reserved and intelligent 20-year-old who suffered from a mental disability, police and people who knew him said. His mother, Nancy, was found dead at their home, according to the officials, who asked for anonymity because the investigation is continuing.  Broken Hearts  The shooting brought chaos and worldwide attention to the town of 28,000 about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of New York City. Students recounted cowering in the corners of the school of 700, while parents told of rushing to discover whether their children were among the dead.  Our hearts are broken today, President Barack Obama said today in his weekly address. We grieve for the families of those we lost.  It was the worst U.S. massacre since the 2007 rampage at Virginia Tech university, and the latest in a deadly year. There were at least seven mass murders in the U.S. -- killings of at least four -- that claimed at least 65 lives this year.  Just four days ago, three died after a gunman opened fire inside a mall in suburban Portland, Oregon. In August, a shooter took six lives at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. In July, a masked gunman opened fire at a midnight movie in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 and injuring 58.  Any of these neighborhoods could be our own, Obama said.  Yesterday, the neighborhood was in Newtown.  Emergency Call  Shortly after 9:30 a.m., police received a call from the school, where students from kindergarten through fourth grade attend, after the gunman forced his way inside, Vance said. He wore combat gear, CNN reported, and had argued with four staff members at the school the day prior, NBC News said. He shot through glass to enter the building and then shot the principal, Dawn Hochsprung, when she confronted him, said Maryann Jacob, an assistant librarian.  C.J. Hoekenga, a Sandy Hook fourth-grader, was in music class watching The Nutcracker when he heard bangs, heavy breathing and then shots. His teacher told them to get into a closet, the youngster said.  He and classmates said prayers until a police officer arrived. They then exited single-file and ran to a nearby fire station, he said.  Elise Beier, 10, also a fourth-grader, said she could hear the gunfire and shouting over the public address system, which remained on throughout the incident.  When police arrived, occupants in one room were so afraid that they opened the doors only after an officer showed his badge through the window, said Jacob, who had 18 children in the library at the time of the shooting.  Automatic telephone calls alerted parents. Janet Ziperstein, 39, raced to the school to find her fourth- and second-grader unharmed.  Cold Chaos  It was an eerie, odd, cold chaos, she said.  Authorities collected two 9 mm handguns at the school, one Glock and one Sig Sauer, said a federal law-enforcement official who requested anonymity because the investigation was continuing. A .223-caliber rifle was also found, AP reported.  The New York Times reported that state records apparently show that Nancy Lanza owned guns of the same make and model.  Nancy J. Lanza and Peter J. Lanza were divorced in 2009, court records show.  Louise Tambascio, 70, a friend of Nancys and owner of My Place, a restaurant where the suspects brother used to work, said Adam Lanza had Aspergers syndrome. He had a personality disorder, AP reported, citing a law-enforcement official briefed on the investigation.  Developmental Disabilities  Autism disorders like Aspergers are developmental disabilities that can pose social, communication and behavioral challenges, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with Aspergers have difficulties with social, emotional and communication skills, and might have trouble understanding other peoples feelings or talking about their own feelings.  Lanza was intelligent, quiet and awkward, Tambascio said.  Mark Tambascio, her 45-year-old son, said Lanza was introverted.  He couldnt deal with regular people, Mark Tambascio said. He was kind of a sociopath.  Pervasive Fear  Catherine Urso, a Newtown resident and piano teacher, said her son, Nicholas, went to Newtown High School with Adam Lanza. She said she used to see Adam dressed in Gothic garb.  In Newtown, Nick Germak lives about two blocks from the Lanzas in a hillside neighborhood. Many residents come to the area to take corporate jobs before moving to follow the next one, he said.  At least one neighborhood child, a boy in kindergarten or first grade with blond hair, was killed, Germak said.  We moved to this remote town in New England and never expected this to happen, Germak said. How do we put our kids on a school bus again and believe theyll be safe?  The deadliest shooting in the U.S. in recent years is the Virginia Tech campus rampage of 2007, in which Seung-Hui Cho took 33 lives, including his own. In 1999, two students shot 12 classmates and a teacher in Columbine High School in suburban Denver before killing themselves.  Most of the victims in Newtown were younger, between the ages of 5 and 10.  Last night, businesses in Sandy Hooks town square shut their doors early. Fun Kuts, a barber shop, hung a sign that read, Our thoughts and prayers are with the Sandy Hook community. A few hundred residents attended a vigil at St. Rose of Lima Church, crowding into the aisles and listening at open windows because there wasnt space inside.  Karen Banks, 67, went to the church today.  You pray that you dont hear someone you know, but you probably will, because everybody knows everybody, said Banks, who has lived in Newtown for 35 years.
