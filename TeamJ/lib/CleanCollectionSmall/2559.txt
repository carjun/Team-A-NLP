Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]TerraAustralis 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]TerraAustralis 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoPeople saying this isn't to do with gun control are wrong. It would be very difficult but things need to change. I think Australia is a good example (I know it's and island so it's easier to control guns). Since the Port Arthur massacre in Australia gun control was tightened. There have not been any mass shootings (that I can find) since then. Since the Columbine shootings in America there have been 31 mass shootings. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
