It is an active crime scene, with policecoming and going past a line of 26 Christmas trees that visitorshave decorated with ornaments, stuffed animals and balloons inthe school colors of green and white as a memorial to thevictims.The massacre - one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S.history - shocked Americans, prompting some lawmakers to callfor tighter restrictions on guns and causing schooladministrators around the country to assess their safetyprotocols.Newtown police plan to have officers at the six schoolsscheduled to reopen on Tuesday, trying to offer a sense ofsecurity to the students and faculty, many of whom spent theweekend in mourning. Newtown Police Lieutenant George Sinkoacknowledged it may be difficult to ease the worries of theroughly 4,700 returning students and their families."Obviously, there's going to be a lot of apprehension. Wejust had a horrific tragedy. We had babies sent to school thatshould be safe and they weren't," Sinko said. "You can't helpbut think ... if this could happen again."DAY FOR 'HEALING'Newtown High School Principal Charles Dumais, in an e-mailto parents, said schools in the district would open two hourslater than usual, with counselors available to students andtheir families."This is a day to start healing," Dumais said.While school officials have not yet decided when Sandy Hookstudents will resume their studies, the building that they willmove into - the unused Chalk Hill School in the nearby town ofMonroe - already showed signs of preparation.On a fence opposite the building, a green sign with whitelettering proclaimed "Welcome Sandy Hook Elementary!"In Washington, the massacre prompted U.S. President BarackObama on Monday to call a White House meeting with advisors todiscuss ways to respond, a first step toward fulfilling thepledge he made a day earlier in Newtown. Th e administration'splans to curb violence include but are not limited togun-control measures, a spokesman said.Police have warned it could take months for them to finishtheir investigation into the attack, which started when AdamLanza killed his mother, Nancy, at home, before driving to theschool armed with a Bushmaster AR 15 rifle and two handguns.After shooting 26 people at the school, he turned his gun onhimself when he heard police approaching.In total, 28 people died in the incident.Many of the students and faculty of Sandy Hook and itsneighbors will still have funerals to attend.The first two victims, Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto, both 6,were buried on Monday, with the boys' bodies laid out in whitecoffins. Jack was dressed in a New York Giants jersey with hisfavorite player's number, while mourners left a teddy bearoutside Noah's service.More funerals were expected on Tuesday, for victimsincluding James Mattioli and Jessica Rekos. Each was 6 yearsold."It's still not real that my little girl, who was so full oflife and who wants a horse so badly and who's going to getcowgirl boots for Christmas isn't coming home," Krista Rekos,Jessica's mother, told ABC News on Monday.StocksMarketsTweet thisLink thisShare thisDigg thisEmailReprintsWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data.
