Ryan Lanza is not believed to have any involvement and is not under arrest or in custody, but investigators were still searching his computers and phone records, said the second official.Ryan Lanza told law enforcement that his brother was believed to suffer from a personality disorder and be "somewhat autistic" and lived with the mother in Connecticut, the second official added.Earlier, a law enforcement official mistakenly transposed the brothers' first names.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they official were not authorized to speak publicly about the developing investigation.The first official said Adam Lanza is dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.According to the first official, the suspect drove to the scene of the shootings in his mother's car. Three guns were found at the scene  a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols  and a .223-caliber rifle. The rifle was recovered from the back of a car at the school. The two pistols were recovered from inside the school.Meanwhile, former Jersey Journal staff writer Brett Wilshe said he has spoken with Ryan Lanza of Hoboken, who told Wilshe the shooter may have had Ryan Lanza's identification.Ryan Lanza has a Facebook page that posted updates Friday afternoon that read that "it wasn't me" and "I was at work."One of the officials said earlier Friday that a girlfriend of one of the Lanza brothers and another friend were missing in New Jersey. Subsequently, the third official said police had talked with the girlfriend. One of the friends had to be reached in California, so it took some time.___Associated Press writers Adam Goldman in Washington and Samantha Henry in Newark, N.J., contributed to this report.ShareTweetShare on TumblrTagsGovernment and politics, North America, United States, United States government, General news, Crime, Law and order, School violence, Criminal investigations, Violent crime, Education, Social affairs, Education issues, Social issues, Violence, School safety, Connecticut, Law enforcement agenciesCommentsView the discussion thread.
