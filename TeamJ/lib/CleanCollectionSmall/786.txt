They are also going to experience the loss of teachers and children their own age. The younger children especially, are going to be forced to mature a lot quicker than they should. At age 5, most children still don't fully understand the concept of death and it is a very strange situation for them to be in when someone their own age passes away. permalinksaveparent[+]JoelBlackout 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]JoelBlackout 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoI can tell you that even at 24, watching someone die will profoundly affect you and how you look at life.Source: Me.permalinksaveparentload more comments(1 reply)[+]fkausername 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]fkausername 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoYou are most certainly correct about having to mature much quicker from dealing with this. Reality hits you at a young age. You lose that innocence you once had. I lost my parents at 8 years old and life was never the same. As much as I wanted it to be normal, there was always that thing in the back of your head haunting you.permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago<3 When I was 9 years old, in the fourth grade, a first grader who I would play with in aftercare was killed in a drunk driving accident while we were on Christmas break. I wasn't there to experience her death, obviously but the aftermath was awful. I can't imagine what these kids will go through, especially being there and seeing their friends die. I can only hope that they have a strong and loving support system for life. permalinksaveparentload more comments(1 reply)load more comments(9 replies)load more comments(13 replies)[+]Aleriya 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Aleriya 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoKids are more resilient than you'd think.

Lots of examples of that particular tactlessness over the years, it's a big reason why I don't watch live TV news anymore. Edit - maybe this is a good time to start a writing campaign to all the news stations asking them to rein in their reporters from asking these types of questions.  The incident that did it for me was the Waco massacre.  A reporter was with David Koresh's mom and they were watching their compound burning on the news.  The fucking reporter asked "what are you feeling right now as you watch this?"  DK's mom just looked at her like she was insane and said "Those are my grandchildren..."  I turned it off at that point, don't know if the reporter got booted out or not.  I think crap like this is why so many people cheer at the reporter getting punched in the die hard movies. permalinksaveparent[+]cadex 190 points191 points192 points 1 day ago (14 children)[]cadex 190 points191 points192 points 1 day agoOver here in the uk a 7 year old girl went missing.

Last year my school went through a series of bomb threats to the point where the local news show up. One day I was walking down the street and a reporter wanted to interview me. They asked some pretty biased questions like "Are you more angry or upset with how the situation is being handled." I thought the school was doing everything they could and had no problem with them. The only thing I was pissed about was the asshole making the threats. Clearly they didn't want my actual opinion of what was going on. All they wanted was for me to say something bad about the school so they could make it look like it was their fault. permalinksaveparent[+]KarmaAndLies 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]KarmaAndLies 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoAre you more angry or upset with how the situation is being handled?    Yes, I think the media has handled this situation terribly. Fearmongering and hyping up the story for the sake of their ratings.

It's a shitty, underpaid and unappreciated job on the best of days. Take my advice and do something else  get an IT degree or become a teacher or something. You'll be happier.If you do decide to go on with your degree, then harden up. You'll be asked to do a lot of things you don't want to do, that seem cruel or classless, but remember that your job is to be completely dispassionate and harden up. Your job in a situation like this is to tell the stories of the dead and the survivors, to capture the fear and anger, to get the facts out there, to find a way to give the story meaning, to ensure that people are still talking about it a week from now, and, if possible, to leverage the work you do to create some sort of positive change in the world. As a reporter, you hold up the mirror to society, which won't always like what it sees reflected back. If you hold the mirror right, people won't even notice who's doing the holding, all they'll care about is fixing what's wrong with that picture.permalinksaveparent[+]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours agoJournalist here as well.

If not, why?permalinksaveparent[+]Arctorius 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Arctorius 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoCan't we just be thinking about how disgusting the situation is first? permalinksaveparent[+]maldio 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]maldio 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI remember an old timer talking about what it was like being a cub reporter, and how the absolute worst part of the job was when they would  send him out for reaction questions, like asking some father or mother how they feel about the death of their child.  permalinksaveparent[+]jiveturkeykilla 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]jiveturkeykilla 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI think it's more disgusting yours is the top comment and actual information is buried underneath.permalinksaveparent[+]bearwithchainsaw 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]bearwithchainsaw 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago"How did that make you FEEL when you saw your friends getting shot up?"permalinksaveparent[+]SunriseSurprise 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]SunriseSurprise 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoWhat the hell is it about rhetorical questions in reporting anyways? It's bad enough they're asking the kids questions, but questions that everyone watching would already know the answer to? It's 100% sensationalism and it's fucking ridiculous.permalinksaveparent[+]californian10 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]californian10 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoA lot of people probably agree with your sentiments, but I don't. It's not a journalist's job to make people feel okay; it's their job to get the story, usually via probing questions. The fact of the matter is the story is with those people and the best time to get it is right now, not in two weeks after counseling, once memories have faded and well-thought-out conclusions have been reached.Could the question have been phrased in a better way? Sure. But should the journalist have avoided the topic of gunshots? No. permalinksaveparent[+]vespo 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]vespo 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoAs a journalist I have to say, that is EXTREMELY unethical, sometimes I'm ashamed of being in the same bag as these sensationalistic sons of bitches. permalinksaveparent[+]Hessmix 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Hessmix 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoShould also be blaming the parents of those children as well though, media can't talk to them without permission, iirc.permalinksaveparent[+]Sugreev2001 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Sugreev2001 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoPeople asking those questions are Fucking Vultures ! permalinksaveparent[+]johnz0n 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]johnz0n 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agosome reporters and producers had probably jizz in their pants as soon as they first heard "shooting at elementary school"disgustingpermalinksaveparent[+]DeamonKnight 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]DeamonKnight 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoits this that enticespermalinksaveparent[+]LLv2 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]LLv2 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoI feel lucky that we haven't seen a journalist get the name of a dead child, go to the unaware parent's home, and tell the parent on camera that their child was dead.permalinksaveparent[+]STEADy_TOKErX 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]STEADy_TOKErX 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoI don't get it, don't the reporters need permission from the parents before filming the children?permalinksaveparent[+]Goldreaver 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Goldreaver 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoThose questions are always there:'What would you do if you would be in a room alone with the guy who raped your sister and killed your father'permalinksaveparent[+]ForTheBacon 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago*(0 children)[]ForTheBacon 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago*You gotta find something to be enraged at, I guess, and the press is an easy target, but I doubt it matters in comparison to the fact that these children heard gunshots and probably know kids who died.  They're not going to be telling their counselors in 20 years that some bad man asked them what gunshots sound like.permalinksaveparent[+]narcisslol 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]narcisslol 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoTHOSE PARENTS allowed their children to talk to reporters.permalinksaveparent[+]LDH_3 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]LDH_3 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoIt's sickening.....permalinksaveparent[+]analalf 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]analalf 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoWhat's annoying is how their parents let them be paraded in front of cameras and reporters. permalinksaveparent[+]xKronkx 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]xKronkx 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoA producer of one of the CT News Stations has responded : http://imgur.com/E1yXwpermalinksaveparent[+]ilovefacebook 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]ilovefacebook 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours agoI just want to throw out there, that the parents gave reporters permission to talk to their children.  permalinksaveparent[+]druss117 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]druss117 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoI always wonder do they feel bad while they are doing it because "they have to" or they really don't give a damn !permalinksaveparentload more comments(16 replies)aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
