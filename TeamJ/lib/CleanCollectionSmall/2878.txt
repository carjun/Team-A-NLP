blog.reddit -- what's new on reddit: Now is the Time... to Invest in Goldskip to main  |      skip to sidebarThursday, November 08, 2012Now is the Time... to Invest in GoldPosted byYishanat10:15|Labels:goldmember,reddit gold,your gold dollars at workOver the last couple years, reddit traffic and usage have continued to grow by leaps and bounds  in October 2012 alone we were up to over 3.8B pageviews and more than 46 million unique visitors. Our server costs also continue to grow, so we have a choice to make: we can start running a bunch more ads, or we can give you, the community, more reasons to support the site with your own money through reddit gold. Advertising will probably always be a part of our revenue, but we want to be ultimately beholden to you, the users.  reddit gold was started a couple years ago to great initial success. While many people have continued to purchase gold, gift reddit gold to each other, or send in postcards, weve never really promoted the program, so a lot of active redditors dont even know about it. Today we want to announce a recommitment to reddit gold, a program wed like to expand and promote. So what are we doing to make reddit gold better?First, for those whove never heard of reddit gold, here are some existing benefits: Highlight unread comments since the last time you visited a threadSee up to 100 subreddits on your frontpageView your karma per subredditTurn off the display of adsAccess to a special members-only lounge that may or may not exist... and more!Were also launching some new things:An oft-requested feature: comment saving and filtering saves by subredditAbility to give gold to other peoples' comments you really like (we call it gilding)Some upgrades and fun stuff in the members-only lounge that may or may not existWe might add a remote-controlled office robot you can drive.Under construction.We dont always intend to make these features gold-only  in cases where it would be beneficial for everyone to have them, well eventually migrate the features to the whole community.But for reddit gold members, you get first peek.We also want to make reddit gold a membership that confers real benefits that are worth what you pay for it, so were talking to some reddit-friendly companies to provide special perks or access to stuff for gold members.Stay tuned for more.And, were looking to hire a generalist engineer to help build out these features faster. If you think youre the one, take a look at the job description and join us to help make reddit better, more golden. Finally, we would like to thank all our current reddit gold members. You're the ones who first made reddit gold possible and allowed us to run a site backed by its community rather than catering primarily to advertisers. We hope you enjoy the new stuff!"The desire of gold is not for gold.  It is for the means of freedom and benefit."  - Ralph Waldo Emersondiscuss this post on redditNewer PostOlder PostHomethe reddit blogKeep up with the latest development updates, community announcements, and general reddit tomfoolery.Blog Archive2012(30)          December(1)November(1)Now is the Time... to Invest in Gold          October(1)          September(3)          August(3)          July(1)          June(4)          May(2)          March(4)          February(2)          January(8)          2011(59)          December(5)          November(2)          October(2)          September(8)          August(5)          July(8)          June(6)          May(3)          April(3)          March(9)          February(6)          January(2)          2010(72)          December(3)          November(8)          October(7)          September(3)          August(8)          July(9)          June(4)          May(5)          April(5)          March(3)          February(4)          January(13)          2009(178)          December(7)          November(12)          October(14)          September(14)          August(8)          July(14)          June(16)          May(16)          April(19)          March(15)          February(25)          January(18)          2008(74)          December(16)          November(6)          October(7)          September(5)          August(6)          July(5)          June(5)          May(4)          April(8)          March(4)          February(4)          January(4)          2007(46)          December(3)          November(3)          October(8)          September(3)          August(7)          July(3)          June(3)          May(3)          April(3)          March(7)          January(3)          2006(37)          December(2)          August(1)          July(2)          June(2)          May(6)          April(1)          March(6)          February(8)          January(9)          2005(20)          December(8)          November(8)          October(4)
