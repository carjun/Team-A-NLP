For example, you can search for:* Posts about cars, boats, and trains: cars AND boats AND trains* Posts by "chromakode" in the "blog" subreddit: reddit:blog author:chromakode* Posts by either spladug or chromakode: author:spladug OR author:chromakode* You can use parentheses to ensure the right portions of the search query are OR'ed: reddit (author:spladug OR author:chromakode)Moderate stemmingA limited number of English terms may be "stemmed" - for example, a search for "dogs" may return results with the word "dog" in them.All search terms are requiredIf you search for "who let the dogs out yesterday", posts that have the phrase "who let the dogs out" will not match, as they lack the term "yesterday"Questions / Comments / DiscussionPlease direct any questions about search to the Help subreddit.
