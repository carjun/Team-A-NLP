Hundreds more have died in shootings during the five years that have passed since that devastating marker. There is no official definition of a "mass shooting," but FBI classifications describe the term as any incident in which a perpetrator kills four or more people, not including him or herself. Under that definition, 19 mass shootings have taken place since April 16, 2007, the date of the Virginia Tech massacre. That's a rate of more than one every four months -- only considering these most brutal examples. Other devastating shootings go largely unnoticed on the national stage.When mass shootings prompt a presidential response -- and they often don't -- the White House tends to focus on investigating the shooter's motives and encouraging people to pray or mourn for the victims. The question of how easy it is for certain individuals to buy guns is often left off the table entirely. The tendency to approach the issue with an abundance of caution was on display on Friday, when White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave the administration's first official comments on the incident, saying that it wasn't the day to discuss gun control policy.It would appear that it never is.President Barack Obama unsurprisingly left politics and policy out of his brief address on the matter Friday. He did make a promising plea for "meaningful action." Time will tell whether he can -- or will even attempt to -- translate these words into specific policy change.Below, a list of the 19 mass shootings over the past 5-plus years, alongside the political responses, if any, to the incidents:Loading SlideshowDecember 14, 2012 -- Newtown, Conn. -- 27 dead (including gunman)The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary on Friday was the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, leaving 27 dead -- including 20 young children. President Obama <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/14/obama-newtown-school-shooting_n_2301823.html">gave an emotional address</a>, calling for "meaningful action": <blockquote>As a country we have been through this too many times. Whether it is an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago -- these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. We're going to have to come together to meaningful action on this, regardless of the politics.</blockquote>September 27, 2012 -- Minneapolis, Minn. -- 7 dead (including gunman), 2 injuredAndrew John Engeldinger, a recently laid off employee of Accent Signage Systems, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/12/eric-rivers-dies-accent-signage-systems-shooting_n_1960914.html">entered the office building and opened fire</a>.(No public comments from the president.)August 5, 2012 -- Oak Creek, Wis. -- 7 dead (including gunman), 4 injuredWhite supremacist Wade Michael Page entered a Sikh Temple, opening fire on congregants. He later shot and injured a police officer responding to the scene.<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/05/obama-wisconsin-shooting-_n_1744692.html">Presidential reaction</a>: <blockquote>Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin. At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded.<br>My Administration will provide whatever support is necessary to the officials who are responding to this tragic shooting and moving forward with an investigation. As we mourn this loss which took place at a house of worship, we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family.</blockquote>May 31, 2012 -- Seattle, Wash. -- 6 dead (including gunman)A man opened fire in a cafe, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/01/seattle-shootings-2012_n_1561944.html">fatally wounding four people</a>, then killed another in a carjacking before killing himself.(No public comments from the president.)July 20, 2012 -- Aurora, Colo. -- 12 dead, 59 injured During a midnight screening of "The Dark Knight Rises," a gunman <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/aurora-shooting-movie-theater-batman_n_1688547.html">opened fire on the suburban Denver movie theater</a>, killing 12 and injuring dozens of others. Two days later, Obama <a href="http://www.kunc.org/post/transcript-video-president-obamas-speech-after-aurora-hospital-visit">delivered a ten-minute speech</a> from the University of Colorado that made no mention of gun control:<blockquote>God bless all who helped to respond to this tragedy.  And I hope that over the next several days, next several weeks, and next several months, we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence that ends up marring this country, but also reflect on all the wonderful people who make this the greatest country on Earth.</blockquote>February 22, 2012 -- Norcross, Ga. -- 5 dead (including gunman) A man <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203960804577238850391163984.html">shot and killed two of his sisters and their husbands and then himself </a>in a Korean health spa.

(No public comments from the president.)January 8, 2011 -- Tucson, Ariz. -- 6 dead, 14 injured Jared Lee Loughner, 22, opened fire in a Safeway parking lot, killing six people and injuring others including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/08/gabrielle-giffords-shot-c_n_806211.html">shot in the head at point-blank range</a>.Two months later, Obama addressed gun control issues <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/13/obama-gun-control-arizona-shooting_n_835103.html">in an op-ed for the <em>Arizona Daily Star</em></a>:<blockquote>I know that every time we try to talk about guns, it can reinforce stark divides. People shout at one another, which makes it impossible to listen. We mire ourselves in stalemate, which makes it impossible to get to where we need to go as a country. However, I believe that if common sense prevails, we can get beyond wedge issues and stale political debates to find a sensible, intelligent way to make the United States of America a safer, stronger place.</blockquote>August 3, 2010 -- Manchester, Conn. -- 9 dead (including gunman), 2 injuredA driver for Hartford Distributors <a href="http://articles.courant.com/2010-08-03/news/hc-omar-thornton-workplace-shooting-020100803_1_workplace-shooting-east-hartford-shooting-victims">killed eight people and then himself </a>in this workplace shooting.

Obama <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/11/06/obamas-response-fort-hood-shooting-scrutiny/#ixzz2F3yWYFVg">said at a press conference</a>:<blockquote>This morning I met with FBI Director Mueller and the relevant agencies to discuss their ongoing investigation into what caused one individual to turn his gun on fellow servicemen and women. We don't know all of the answers yet, and I would caution against jumping to conclusions until we have all of the facts.</blockquote>April 3, 2009 -- Binghamton, N.Y. -- 14 dead (including gunman), 4 injured Jiverly Wong, a naturalized immigrant from Vietnam,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/nyregion/05suspect.html"> gunned down students and employees at the American Civic Association</a>, where he had been taking English lessons.President Obama said in a statement:<blockquote>Michelle and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn about the act of senseless violence in Binghamton, N.Y. today.

Bush had been visiting Omaha for a fundraiser but left the city just an hour before the shooting took place. "Having just visited with so many members of the community in Omaha today, the president is confident that they will pull together to comfort one another as they deal with this terrible tragedy," the White House <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/05/AR2007120501868.html">said in a statement.</a>October 7, 2007 -- Crandon, Wis. -- 7 dead (including gunman), 1 injuredTyler Peterson, 20, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/09/wisconsin.shooting/index.html" target="_hplink">killed six people</a>, including his ex-girlfriend, at a post-homecoming party.(No public comments from the president.)February 14, 2008 -- DeKalb, Ill. -- 6 dead (including gunman, 21 injured)A former Northern Illinois University student, 27-year-old Steven Phillip Kazmierczak, opened fire on the campus, killing five people then himself.

And the Canadians have the sane amount of fire arms per capita. There are some Americans who believe that more loaded fire arms will make us safer.

The best way to insure a question goes unanswered is to never have a meaningful conversation about it.Picachu: You can't get answers when the right wing media echohttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Picachu/mass-shootings-reactions_n_2302971_213875447.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

"Still no answers'?  Nonsense.  Gun control, more mental health intervention, etc.  That would be a winning start.  The politicians, including moderate and Blue Dog dems are as much the problem as the right.

As they did with the shooter in the tower in Austin back in the 60's which was one of the first mass shootings.whos_youredaddy: Since the movies started to explode with violence, morbid plots,andhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/whos_youredaddy/mass-shootings-reactions_n_2302971_213867467.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itHUFFPOST PUNDITomobobleft coast, usa2894 Fans4 hours ago ( 1:20 PM)Sorry but Canadians, Japanese and Brits are watching the same violent films and have but a handful of murders by frire arms.The fault lies not in the stars, dear Brutus but within ourselves. faved. cheersomobob: Sorry but Canadians, Japanese and Brits are watching the samehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/omobob/mass-shootings-reactions_n_2302971_213878083.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

There are examples from all over the world on how to reduce gun violence. Unfortunately a minority monied interest holds sway over the lives of millions. The first act is to stand up to them, ignore their threats, and then do the right thing.ajax2: Yes there are real answers.

However, the issue here is about how to make it more difficult for mentally-ill people to access guns.  That means being proactive and discussing measures that would effectively do that and it must include laws that somehow limit or track gun purchases so that when a doctor handles someone showing signs of mental illness then they must inquire if anyone close to that person owns a gun.  If so then laws should require that gun owner to make sure that gun cannot be accessed by that person.  Institutions in society are equipped to see these warning signs, educators and health professionals often deal with troublesome people on a daily basis.  Each gun owner should be logged into a national database that doctors can access and match with any patients that may be related to their patient.  Of course if someone is determined enough then they will access weapons and commit these heinous acts, however, if we just avoid at least one incident from happening then any measure we take would have been worth it and dozens of lives could be saved.Dougal30388967: We can never expect to completely stop incidents of masshttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Dougal30388967/mass-shootings-reactions_n_2302971_213882027.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.
