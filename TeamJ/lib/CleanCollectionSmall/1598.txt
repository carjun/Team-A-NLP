He said the Federal Bureau of Investigation is supporting state law enforcement in the investigation.Mr. Obama has called for action on the countrys gun control laws in the aftermath of other shootings. He said after the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., in July that the U.S. needs to discuss tougher gun laws. He has not offered any specific follow up.He said at the time that taking assault weapons off the streets was one of several common sense measures that shouldnt be controversial.

Thats a discussion no one seems to want to touch, but jumping on a kid who reportedly has serious mental health issues and using to for his gun-control agend without more details is? Clearly, it was a heinous act, but politicizing it at the expense of ignoring the far larger discussion is wrong. Then again, Obama played he has little interest in doing whats right in previous shootings having jumped into the Trayvon Martin incident before waiting for facts and allowing the Ft. Hood massacre to be classified as a workplace violence incident when it was clearly anything but.         2:01 pm December 15, 2012  Tucano Fulano wrote            :  Mr Crocodile Tears does not often miss co-opting disasters, and its certain he will not let this tragedy go to waste.When school employees are armed with concealed weapons carried on their persons at all times when on campus AND KILL TERRORISTS the attacks will shift to other, softer targets.         11:30 am December 15, 2012  Horse Feathers wrote            :  I agree with Obamas vow to press for meaningful action.   It may take a while, but it should start with a meaningful reversal of the asinine progressive policies which began with Teddy Roosevelt; and havent let up since.         11:28 am December 15, 2012  DDS wrote            :  Obama exploited a terrible tragedy to further his political agenda, but that is what the left does, the State is their God and the ends always justify the means. When you consider Obamas call for gun laws, dont forget that the Obama administration is guilty of passing guns to illegally to Mexican drug gangs, resulting in more deaths than we will ever know.
