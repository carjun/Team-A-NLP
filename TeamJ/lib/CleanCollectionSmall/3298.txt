Every season we have yet another load of tat foisted upon us and all of it described as "new" "brilliant" "must have" and yet it is nothing of the sort. It is ALL recycled one way or another and the people "designing" these clothes should be ashamed of themselves, a) for having the gall to say it is "new" and b) charging sums of money that beggar belief.If we add in the complete fallacy that is women's make up with the ludicrous claims made there (85% of 121 women agree this "muck" works) as well as the fact that if most creams etc were to do as they suggest the bacteria and viruses that would use these creams as a vector to by pass the skins defences would cause havoc in the human body. But still women believe it will wipe twenty years of them (yeah and I am Father Christmas) and still spend stupid sums of money on what is in essence water. Aqua as used on the packaging what a load of crock. Any chance people will wake up to these frauds?v1/comments/context/63f00a99-a472-3db9-a293-12ee3fcdd239/comment/1355615368408-48b07e45-3194-4b5d-8b87-fbf9b8273473Jaqueline21 hours agoOnly a very few people can get away with wearing loud prints, and then not all prints. For the rest of us, we would scare the donkeys.v1/comments/context/63f00a99-a472-3db9-a293-12ee3fcdd239/comment/1355508134932-0f805c52-f45c-447a-afaa-731156f28f46Ali B2 days 2 hours agoThe dress sense is as bad as their decor ad sense!!!

I buy my stuff cheaply in charity shops or ebay because I'm broke.  If it fits and is in good condition then its mine if its cheap and doesn't cost too much.  I don't spend more than 5.00 on an item if I can help it.  People who talk about tightening the belt still seem to spend 400 on a pair of shoes.. ha ha who are they addressing these articles to.  I haven't bought shoe's in a very long while.  My main concern at the moment is thermals, underwear (new) what I look like doesn't enter into the equation.  I have just bought an M&S cardigan with no sleeves and its the best purchase ever cost 4.00 and well worth the money.  It is keeping me toasty and I can layer under it and if my arms are cold I have a fab second hand thick cardigan by New Look to wear over it.  I can't afford heating so this is the cheaper option.  Really ridiculous in the current times but I guess there must be people out there who can afford to be fashionable and good luck to you.. spend your money as freely as you can and help the economy, I'm not jealous of anyone just wish it wasn't rubbed in my face 24/7 on what to buy if you have money from cosmetics, clothes, toys, gadgets, DVD's... luckily I have a record facility and I can forward the ads.  I can't afford magazines but a lady my future mother in law knows gives here loads of magazines, about 30/40 a time so I get to see loads of stuff.  I'd like more articles but all the ads on this and that.  Easy Living which I thought would be affordable clothing detailed an outfit which the cheapest item was 99 for a scarf... ha ha There are some that have and the rest of us are on the poverty line.v1/comments/context/63f00a99-a472-3db9-a293-12ee3fcdd239/comment/1355512890353-8cba1a3b-35d9-4892-adf6-7588010dbc11Mark2 days 1 hour agoGreat all you need is a print dress ad 3 make-up artists every time you go out !v1/comments/context/63f00a99-a472-3db9-a293-12ee3fcdd239/comment/1355506282272-0b66d0aa-e2a1-4558-a482-17d80ebc33efMICHAEL2 days 3 hours agoNo wonder Yahoo is losing audience, your advertising and talking to the wrong people? 60% of the population are over 35, and yahoo are  using child journalists to talk and advertize to other children, when in fact hardly anybody under 24  is watching and even if they where, they havent got any money, its the oldies that have the money, talk about incompetance at the board level,.  They wouldnt get on my board. get a gripv1/comments/context/63f00a99-a472-3db9-a293-12ee3fcdd239/comment/1355591244002-6dae06c4-2512-4e0c-942e-aa310410da6dJoyous1 day 3 hours agoDont think the model was very inspired!v1/comments/context/63f00a99-a472-3db9-a293-12ee3fcdd239/comment/1355505105808-8d8a068a-4a24-4896-bb0c-85b9046f81b0Atefeh2 days 3 hours agoslmPost a commentYOU ON YAHOO!
