Where's the outrage?  by  Iriestxin  Libertarian[+]NiHaody 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]NiHaody 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoMaybe we could also consider the number of children killed by terrorists in that same time span? Not really comparable...but hey you're Reddit, so you'd probably prefer that terrorists go around blowing up each other in the middle east.Out of sight and out of mind, no antiAmerican angle. There's virtually no reason to cover that kind of news.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIts Easier For Americans To Access Guns Than Mental Health Services  by  Corporate_Hoin  politics[+]NiHaody 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]NiHaody 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoProbably true for Canadians too.

This kind of thing pisses me off about Reddit.

Why arent we talking about raising the top tax rates not by the mere 2-3% but by 4%, 5%, 10%, and so on? Why arent we talking about ending corporate subsidies and Pentagon corruption that practically bury our economy?  by  allliein  politics[+]NiHaody 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]NiHaody 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoBecause despite what the US Conservative party would have you believe, the dems are not actually socialists. In fact, I'd venture to say, most liberal Americans aren't either. You can like some aspects of socialism without going full on French or Canadian. permalinksavecontextfull comments"In all there are now 17 Amercian warships off the Syrian coast."  by  edwardianoin  worldnews[+]NiHaody 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]NiHaody 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoYeah while the Chinese are a so called Ally of NK, they certainly don't like them. It's a totally one sided alliance. NK gives China nothing in exchange for China's alleged military support. China was so pissed when NK tested its missiles. permalinksavecontextfull commentsStarbucks agree to pay 10m tax in UK after customer revolt at their not paying tax at all for two years and very little for past 14 years...  by  wirplitin  worldnews[+]NiHaody -1 points0 points1 point 8 days ago (0 children)[]NiHaody -1 points0 points1 point 8 days agoCase in point.

They constantly insisting British cultural or intellectual superiority over other countries.Yes, Americans often call themselves the greatest country in the world, but they don't usually do so by directly insulting other countries.British are always on about their rich history but never so keen to explain the details. Gassing kurds, starting wars to sell opium to China, starting the slave trade, keeping slavery longer than most other countries (Yes abolished domestically before the US but not in the colonies - aka the only place they were being used by the empire.)permalinksavecontextfull commentsI broke my smartphone the other day, decided to replace it with pre-smartphone technology  by  roryokin  pics[+]NiHaody -3 points-2 points-1 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]NiHaody -3 points-2 points-1 points 8 days agoBritish people are hilarious.

Euromedia loves to make the US look like a bunch of flag-waving ultra-conservatives. In the time I've spent living and studying in the US, this couldn't be any further from reality.It's the Brits who are crazy. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that Stalin screened "The Grapes of Wrath" in the Soviet Union to showcase the depredations of life under capitalism.

They took him to a grocery store somewhere in VA and he didn't believe it was real. He thought it was like what the Soviet Gov't would show visiting foreign dignitaries.

I don't think the old notion of the American Dream applies anymore. Reddit, what are your thoughts? What is the NEW American Dream?  by  Magus5311in  AskReddit[+]NiHaody 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]NiHaody 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoDebt isn't necessarily a bad thing. A mortgage can be perfectly okay if you have a decent job, potential, so on.  The alternative of renting a place while saving up to buy one flat out is horribly uneconomic.The problem is banks have been giving out mortgages to people who shouldn't have one - at least not in the amount they want - or to people who aren't responsible. And credit makes sure you're historically responsible in paying back borrowed money. I'm all for mortgages. Cars I prefer to buy straight out. If you need to take out a loan you're buying a car you cannot afford. permalinksavecontextfull comments25012Really, /r/worldnews?
