I'm ashamed of that side of Israel. Your new life in the US sounds very hopeful and I want to wish you good luck on finals. At my university there is an SPHR organization and they are terrible people, I hope you run yours better- here they honestly just ruin any event that is associated with Jews or Israelis and then claim that the protest or whatever they do wasn't organized by their club.It is a real shame that your life in Israel was a terrible experience because the country would have benefited from people like you that stand for human rights. I feel like sharing this story with you because while I really hate your view of Israel- I think you are a good person.I only ever met one Indian family when I lived in Israel, my father (IDF officer-they are mostly good people but the situation doesn't really help them) was treating their new born child for some disorder and they were really sweet people. They lived in a tiny house by my school and sometimes when my dad picked me up from school we would drop by and say hi. They were really poor and the last time I saw them was 11 years ago when we went one night and we gave them Hanukkah/Holiday (they weren't jewish but still...) presents. With that, its late here on the east coast and my laptop is at 4% so I'm gonna get some zzz, nobody is gonna solve this mess for a long time so lets all just get along. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIsraeli soldiers assault two Reuters cameramen  by  Gen371in  worldnews[+]rnofechm 3 points4 points5 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 3 points4 points5 points 12 hours agoI'm Israeli and I live in the US.I grew up near Tel-Aviv and I live in Canada. I am pro-human rights and believe there is a great injustice for Palestinians but as an Israeli I do not criticize the army that protected me while I enjoyed an amazing childhood in Israel. You sound very angry and hateful towards all of Israel, I'm wondering- what is your connection to Israel exactly?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the probability that everyone on earth blinks at the same exact time, effectively ensuring that nobody witnessed that moment in history?  by  Elvisisdeadin  AskReddit[+]rnofechm 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoFrom a non-mathimatical point of view, this scenario requires everyone to be awake to be blinking. Because of the time zones, somewhere on Earth there is always a kindergarten class enjoying precious nap time at any given moment. Therefore, you basically just need to  cancel nap time, or else the probability is zero.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIsrael halts Palestinian tax transfer over UN bid | DAWN.COM  by  Destatorin  worldnews[+]rnofechm -1 points0 points1 point 12 days ago (0 children)[]rnofechm -1 points0 points1 point 12 days agoYour response is well put but it is somewhat one-sided. Let me tell you a great story my friend because I think you will find it interesting as the world media refused to cover this story in detail despite it's tremendous consequences.Before the disengagement, the Israeli settler population in the Gaza Strip region lived off agriculture, we can agree on this. Upon the decision to disengage from Gaza, it was decided to leave the greenhouses so that they could be used by the same Palestinian workers that used to work there under the Israelis pre-disengagement. Yet, as soon as Israel pulled out, Hamas quickly rushed in and destroyed the greenhouses. Immediately leaving tens of thousands of young palestinian males without a job and highly recruitable by Hamas and other militant groups. It amazes me that people did not report this in detail... permalinksavecontextfull commentsIsrael halts Palestinian tax transfer over UN bid | DAWN.COM  by  Destatorin  worldnews[+]rnofechm 20 points21 points22 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 20 points21 points22 points 12 days agoHoly fuck, I am so sick of everyone fighting over this. Firstly, I don't give a fuck about this meaningless tax freeze, I'm still thinking about the Syria video from last week and how NOBODY gives a shit about it. Secondly, fuck the person who decided it would be a good idea to freeze this money... just a huge turd, this doesn't do anything to help either sides.Thirdly, pro-palestinians- understand that the other side terrified by radical Islam and will generalize all supporters of Palestinians with it- maybe it is time to think about denouncing Hamas a little (I am well aware this sanction is against the PA...) ; Pro-israelis- open your eyes and your heart, innocent people are starving, homeless, and are dying- and you only make it worse on them.A pissed of Israeli who left 10 years ago because I rather live my life than fight until the day I and my family die over it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIsrael halts Palestinian tax transfer over UN bid | DAWN.COM  by  Destatorin  worldnews[+]rnofechm -5 points-4 points-3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]rnofechm -5 points-4 points-3 points 12 days agoHmmm... this is simply not true.

A bus was blown up recently in Tel Aviv, and it wasn't blown up by a Jew. I don't think segregation is the correct solution but I do think that if I was to ride that bus I would be more comfortable not sitting next to Palestinian, not because I don't like him- because I would be scared. However, here in Canada, I don't care, and wouldn't even realize if I was the only Jew boy on a bus full of Palestinians. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat does your body do that scares you?  by  MaggotFacein  AskReddit[+]rnofechm 1 point2 points3 points 21 days ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 1 point2 points3 points 21 days agoOnce in the middle of my cell biology class, in which we were discussing the cell-cell adhesion molecules, I had a full on panic attack that my cells aren't attached strongly enough and that my entire body was about to 'melt'/'turn into a pile of cells'. This was not only ridiculous, it was almost embarrassing to explain to the people who saw me run out of class breathing like an ape. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIsrael and Palestinians Agree to a Truce  by  Ze_Cariocain  worldnews[+]rnofechm 3 points4 points5 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 3 points4 points5 points 22 days agoDammit.

I'm gonna be as concise as possible.Why should you care about Israel vs Palestine? If you care about world issues such as the war in Syria or hunger in Africa, you probably have a sense of social responsibility. As the grandson of a holocaust survivor, I believe our world is collectively responsible to stop evil and to stand up for what is right, hell, if we did this 70 years ago, my grandmother's entire family would have lived happily ever after. So who is right? pick the group, that you believe, will rule this region better.It is my opinion, Israelis and Palestinians both have a strong claim on the land. Jews have been there for thousands of years and palestinians have lived there after that, it doesn't matter who was there first (even though it is the jews- does not fucking matter). Right now, ignoring the conflict with Gaza, Israel is not a perfect country. While Israelis rave abut the progressive society they live in (gay rights etc...), many areas dominated by ultra orthodox populations discriminate against women, gays, and foreigners. When it comes to the military, Israel is under constant threat of an Arab invasion but in the last 30 years, it is also fighting a more dangerous enemy terrorism. The difficulty with terrorism is rooted in the motto of the leaders of Hamas and hezbollah, in the word of the head of hezbollah "we will win because you celebrate life but we celebrate death". It is almost impossible to defeat an enemy that doesn't care for innocent people to die, including their own. The leaders of Hamas don't even care about their own people, they are corrupt, they spend foreign aid money on weapons instead of providing better social services to Gaza's needy population, and this results in a conflict that simply doesn't benefit Palestinians. It is so easy for you, as an outsider to be a supporter of Hamas. Everyone loves the underdog and because they media loves showing pictures of dead palestinian children, it is very easy for you to say, 'fuck israel, they are bullies and violators of human rights etc...' But, if you had to live in this region, you wouldn't want to live under Hamas rule. I'm not saying Israel is the best country to support but they do show a sense of social responsibility world wide. If you can't get over the killing of civilians on the Palestinian side, because you think that it doesn't matter that people are used as human shields, family homes are used as bomb factories, and school yards and hospitals are used as launch sites, THAT IS 100% OK- I agree with you that air striking those places is a terrible idea. But that doesn't mean I support Hamas. Look at fatah, the group ruling the west bank. They are much more moderate and there is much less violence there. Fatah was actually killed off (literally) by hamas after the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. I gotta get back to running my immunostaining project in my awesome, safe, and multicultural university lab in beautiful Ontario, Canada so I hope you see what I'm saying here....You don't have to care. You don't have to choose. But the world would be a better place if people stood up for what is right.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy best friend has Cystic Fibrosis and just survived a double lung transplant... this is his battle scar!  by  curtistallsin  pics[+]rnofechm 6 points7 points8 points 25 days ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 6 points7 points8 points 25 days agoCF is an autosomal recessive multi-systemic progressive disease. This means it affects more than just the lungs (CF patients used to be diagnosed by extra salty sweat- defect in Cl- reabsorption), Cystic Fibrosis is actually named after the cysts and fibrosis that occurs in the pancreas of CF patients. This disease sucks but there is no better treatment than a lung transplant, this treatment adds on years for CF patients and OP's friends is very lucky to get this. Eventually, CF will come back and the hyperinflammation and chronic infection in the lung will have to be battle with again.

It's a hard thing for an Israeli to differentiate between those who want to kill him (they have their reasons- revenge etc) and those who want peace, often classifying Arab Israelis in the first category (Arab Israelis have assisted in suicide bombings countless time, still this is not reflective of the majority!). It is my opinion that the muslims in israel would much prefer living in Israel than in an Arab/Palestinian country because they still enjoy much more freedom and rights. That being said, while I don't think muslims in Israel suffer from an apartheid system, they are 100% discriminated against in the workplace, schools, etc. Yet, I can tell you that when I lived in Israel and my parents worked as doctors, I guarantee they never discriminated against any muslim coworker or patient. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGaza cease-fire collapses, Egypt PM backs Palestinians as Israel drafts 16,000 reservists  by  twolf1in  worldnews[+]rnofechm 71 points72 points73 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 71 points72 points73 points 28 days agoIsrael has over a million Muslims living within its borders (Not including West bank or Gaza, I mean within Israel- Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa...). Many of which are Israeli citizens and enjoy all the rights of Israelis who are Jewish but do not have to serve in the Army for 3 years at 18-21.Israel/Palestine was full of Arab villages and Jewish settlements prior to 1948 (Israel declares independence, backed by UN). When Israel declared independence the was a massive war, (About 1% of the Israeli population died fighting off the surrounding Arab countries). HERE COMES THE TRICKY PART- in 1948, the arabs living in the villages- some left by choice- as any smart person would do if they want to save their family from war, some stayed, and some (I have no idea if or how many this actually happened to...) claim forced off their land by Israeli fighters.Today, 98% of Israelis don't live in the 'settlements'. The settlements are small towns that are built on land that is historically palestinians- these settlers aren't forcefully kicking anyone out but they are taking land that is not theirs!Egypt will never annex Gaza because they don't want to care for millions of Palestinian refugees. It may seem in the media that palestine is loved by the Muslim world (Iran especially) but in fact they don't care for the innocent people living Gaza, they are only using them and their desperation to push their religious agendas and to intensify jihad.Finally, I am a 21 year old Canadian that was born in Israel and lived there till I was 10. My parents decided the whole thing was fucking stupid and thats why we moved. I still have many relatives which I visit yearly but now my December vacation is looking to be in jeopardy. BTW, from what it sounds like, Israel is gearing up for a war of 6 weeks. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGaza cease-fire collapses, Egypt PM backs Palestinians as Israel drafts 16,000 reservists  by  twolf1in  worldnews[+]rnofechm 208 points209 points210 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 208 points209 points210 points 28 days agoRockets are being fired into Jerusalem right now...Shit-->Fanpermalinksavecontextfull commentsNew HIV Vaccine Passes Stage 1 of Human Testing  by  shady89in  science[+]rnofechm 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]rnofechm 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoAs a current student at University of Western Ontario who choose to spend 20 hours a week in a research lab on top of classes, seeing this at the front page gets me going. permalinksavecontextfull commentsaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
