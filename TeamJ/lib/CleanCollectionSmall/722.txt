Think having each of them lined up one by one and shot in the back of the head (example).Edit: I should specify this is in terms of the actual killings taking place, rather than the motive or planning of the shooter.permalinksaveparent[+]Sn1pe 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Sn1pe 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoIsn't that like what the Norway shooter did?permalinksaveparent[+]Tokkay 7 points8 points9 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Tokkay 7 points8 points9 points 21 hours agoNo, maybe some of them got executed. Otherwise he just walked around on a very small island for an hour and a half or something. So sure, during that time it probably happened, but that wasnt the method he used.permalinksaveparent[+]deadundead 8 points9 points10 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]deadundead 8 points9 points10 points 22 hours agoProbably stood up against a wall, lined up all next to each other...  :(permalinksaveparent[+]PecanSoup 15 points16 points17 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]PecanSoup 15 points16 points17 points 22 hours agoLined up, probably on knees, with their head being the main target, close range.

Oh my god, this is just getting worse and worse, I just called my nephew to talk to him after hearing about the news today (I don't live in the States and just heard about it). I am constantly scared that something is going to happen to him, I don't know what I would do or how I would live if anyone hurt him intentionally like this. Who the fuck does such a thing? I just don't get it.permalinksaveparent[+]Chicken_McNigger 26 points27 points28 points 22 hours ago*(7 children)[]Chicken_McNigger 26 points27 points28 points 22 hours ago*Guess where this guy came from? http://i.imgur.com/l9ru5.jpg [NSFW]permalinksaveparent[+]swicken 14 points15 points16 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]swicken 14 points15 points16 points 22 hours agoCreepy.

CBS says they were killed execution-style. 2nd suspect in custody, not clear yet if he was involved."EDIT: Note that they said "CBS says" when they posted that, so they don't get all the hate if it is false.permalinksaveparent[+]Gyella 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Gyella 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoThis would make sense b/c if the guy was just spraying bullets, there would have been much higher injuries, not fatalities. The fact that they're reporting he was only in 2 classrooms and killed this many kids leads me to believe that it must have been execution style. There better be a special level of hell just for this guy. Absolutely disgusting, cowardly, etc...etc.. Words cannot describe the type of tragedy this is.
