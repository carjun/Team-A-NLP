I'm in no way looking for a tattoo. I just always found the different procedures for removing them and the cost that goes along with it kind of interesting.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTattoo removal.  by  jeteryin  WTF[+]Pumpkin_Escobar7 3 points4 points5 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]Pumpkin_Escobar7 3 points4 points5 points 6 days agoI thankfully don't have any tattoos. I was just curious since I always see this as another option for tattoo removal, but have never known the cost of the procedure. There are tattoo removal places that only charge around 25-50 bucks per session where I live. Assuming 20 sessions on a worst case scenario and you're only looking at 500-1000. However, it does take around 6 weeks in between sessions though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTattoo removal.  by  jeteryin  WTF[+]Pumpkin_Escobar7 3 points4 points5 points 6 days ago*(0 children)[]Pumpkin_Escobar7 3 points4 points5 points 6 days ago*Understandable.
