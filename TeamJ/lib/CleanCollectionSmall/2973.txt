(AP) - Connecticut State Police say a gunman who massacred 26 children and adults at an elementary school before committing suicide forced his way into the building. Officials are expected to address the media early Saturday afternoon and provide more details. Lt. Paul Vance said Saturday morning that the suspect was not voluntarily let into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton. Authorities say 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot his mother on Friday, drove her car to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, and shot 20 children, six adults and himself. Vance says the medical examiner is still working on identifying the victims.Copyright 2012 The Associated Press.
