These items would cost (for nuclear bombs) Billions of dollars. Chemical weapons would be absurdly expensive as well. They simply wouldn't be available to the general public.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Just because there aren't as many murders doesn't mean the UK is any safer. Besides, Brazil, Russia, and mexico are all gun controlled and have worse murder rates than the u.s. In reality, murder rates follow more closely with diversity.As you can see, murder rates correlate nicely with diversity. Also, just for funzies I like throwing in these stats.Also, about 70 % of murders occur in 3% of U.S. counties. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Then continued to say that if he didn't have access to a gun, they would both be alive. Which is absurd. That is dancing in the blood and promoting a political agenda. permalinksavecontextfull commentsState House passes bill allowing concealed weapons in schools, day care centers, stadiums, churches -Detroit Free Press  by  atchemeyin  politics[+]treedick2011 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes ago (0 children)[]treedick2011 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes ago..... google suicide bomber. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]treedick2011 4 points5 points6 points 53 minutes ago (0 children)[]treedick2011 4 points5 points6 points 53 minutes agoI'm all for a debate about safety. However, blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd. I am glad to talk about how it was allowed to happen, and what steps can be taken to prevent it. First off, we MUST recognize that "gun free zones" are simply the target of choice for these people. What can be done about this?Either we do away with gun free zones, or we start stationing police at every soft target such as elementary schools, movie theaters, and any where people can congregate. Next is the WHY are they doing this? Gun laws haven't changed dramatically in the past 10 years, but these shootings are on the rise? There are a myriad of reasons, and it always revolve around mental illness. I am glad to discuss means of deterrence and prevention, but gun control will be as effective as the drug war. So please, let us have a discussion.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]treedick2011 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]treedick2011 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoGun control won't stop this. Gun violence has increased 83 % in England after the hand gun ban. There should be a talk about prevention in other areas. Such as stationing police at such soft targets as these. Why are places like this targeted? Why are so many gun free zones shot up? What motivated them to shoot these places up. Looking at the inanimate object in his hand and blaming it is equivalent to saying penises are the cause of rape. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Why wouldn't you want RG3 being a good role model? You want him to act more black? like what? you want him to be a nigger? Shit, those types of role models are the reason for the state of african culture. You should be praising this man for being articulate mild mannered and an all around stand up guy. Rob is a fucking idiot, and should be banned from any form of mass human contact. permalinksavecontextfull commentsState House passes bill allowing concealed weapons in schools, day care centers, stadiums, churches -Detroit Free Press  by  atchemeyin  politics[+]treedick2011 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (0 children)[]treedick2011 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoIt was literally like shooting fish in a barrel. All he did was blind fire towards the exits. He had no visibility advantage, especially in a gas mask. Hence why he only killed 12 and wounded 40. If he is firing specifically at you, that is wasted ammo and precious time for others. That lets your wife, your girlfriend, your family get out the door. If you fire on him, he seeks cover. He gets wounded. Lest you forget even with body armor getting shot hurts. He gets the wind knocked out of him. His attention is drawn away from others and focuses on self preservation. Just think, how different it would have been if people were given a 5 second head start. You may get shot, and you may die, but you saved lives. In the end that is all that matters. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGang members/former gang members of reddit, what did you do for gang initiation?  by  BellyButtonLindtin  AskReddit[+]treedick2011 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]treedick2011 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoI think the proper term is clique for women. permalinksavecontextfull commentsState House passes bill allowing concealed weapons in schools, day care centers, stadiums, churches -Detroit Free Press  by  atchemeyin  politics[+]treedick2011 -1 points0 points1 point 4 hours ago (0 children)[]treedick2011 -1 points0 points1 point 4 hours agoIt is a prime example of how denying ones right to self defense is usually a bad thing. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs /r/Pyongyang a joke subreddit, or is it actually some kinda PR thing from North Korea?  by  kikikzain  AskReddit[+]treedick2011 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]treedick2011 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours agoPeople say its a very dedicated troll. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDo I stand a chance this week?
