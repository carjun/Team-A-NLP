Complete liberal here but am pro gun. I think they need to make access to mental health care much more accessible and access to guns much harder, but people need to.be able to defend themselves.Last year my parents house was shot at. It was 1030pm. My father ran to the phone and called the police an hour later no one had shown up. So he called back and said are you Even coming? 12am they show up. If who ever shot wanted to come in the police would have arrived two+ hours later to find us dead. The police are not always there to protect you.On another note a lot of people ask, "how do you know what you would do if a man had a gun pointed at you, how do you know you would be able to shoot?" If I had a gun on hand and my life, my families life, or my friends life, hell even someone I didn't know was about to be killed I'd fucking pull the trigger. Im not saying I'd run into harms way to save people, I don't know if I would (I'd hope I'd be brave enough to do that) but if I had to I would hands down.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

Or plenty of other sources on this subject? The way the media makes these shooters infamous makes an environment where more shooters can appear.Yes it can be coincidence, it also might have been spurred by past shootings. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

However, banning guns like some people called for won't help. Banning the sale and purchase of drugs only got us a drug war. People still get illegal things and the guys who end up with illegal guns pull shit like this. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]briangiles 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]briangiles 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoHi-JackingFirst of all this is terrible. Second point, did everyone hear of that mall shooting by a 20 somthing year old wearing a bullet proof vest? I saw Screen shots he posted on 4chan the day before doing it. These two stories sound very similar and are only two or three days apart.Granted this could be a very strange copy cat, but for those of you that go on 4chan have you seen anything about this before it happened? If there is some connection, even just a chance law enforcement should know about it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsUnited States to send troops and Patriot missiles to Turkey  by  milzzin  worldnews[+]briangiles 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]briangiles 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agonot to mention you cant take over Syria with 8,400 men and some planes.

Make sure you don't entice the reader then never answer their questions.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Critique] Population: Zero  by  VicariousDin  writing[+]briangiles -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (0 children)[]briangiles -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoThis coming from someone named Ozymandias.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI think I like my antagonist more than my protagonist  by  briangilesin  writing[+]briangiles[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]briangiles[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThanks for the supporting words, I'll go over my character sheets and review them great ideapermalinksavecontextfull commentsBest laptop for writing?  by  maxevans60in  writing[+]briangiles 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]briangiles 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThe nexus is nice too.

That's great if he wants to tweet about all the drone strikes, but by saying hes tweeting all of this because apple didn't like his app, like the title says makes this whole thing sound like a jab at at apple. That is what we are talking about. Who cares if apple didn't like his app. So then we ask if he is butt hurt, like the title makes it sound why didn't he just make an android app.TL;DR: Adding "after apple rejected his iPhone App" adds nothing to him tweeting about drone strikes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAn NYU grad student is tweeting every drone strike by the US since 2002 after Apple rejected his iPhone App  by  gabdouniin  worldnews[+]briangiles 180 points181 points182 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]briangiles 180 points181 points182 points 2 days agoYea, I don't get the correlation.
