(58.26 %)127 votesThe government will ignore the ruling, under various pretexts, as Egyptian governments have done for decades.

(9.17 %)20 votesEgyptian expats, supported by many inside the country, are lobbying to win the right to vote in Egypt's first post-revolution elections. What is your position?Egyptians living abroad should be granted the right to vote in presidential elections, but not in constituency-based parliamentary elections.                                         (10.71 %)44 votesEgyptians living abroad are full citizens and should have the full rights and privileges due to a citizen. Tunisian expats took part in their parliamentary elections and so should Egyptians.                                        (72.99 %)300 votesEgyptians living abroad are subject to various influences in their countries of residence and therefore should be allowed to vote only if they return to the country.                                         (5.11 %)21 votesThe logistics of millions of Egyptians voting abroad are impossible to deal with in the current circumstances, so expat voting should be postponed until such a time as these challenges can be efficiently met.                                         (7.3 %)30 votesI don't know.

What is your position?I agree to the law as it has been issued by SCAF; it would be unconstitutional to make the list system account for 100 of seats as the political parties demand.                                        (13.64 %)30 votesI wholly reject the current electoral law, which is tailored for the defunct ruling party remnants. I agree to a 100% list system as demanded by the parties.                                        (56.82 %)125 votesIt would be sufficient to adjust the ratio, making the list system account for 70 or 80% of seats, while avoiding unconstitutionality.                                         (10.91 %)24 votesI dont know.                                        (18.64 %)41 votesThe September 9th protest before the Israeli embassy has triggered a fierce debate within Egypt. What is your position?The protest at the Israeli embassy was totally misguided; it took away focus from the original demands of the Friday of Correcting the Path, deteriorated into violence and lawlessness and undermined Egypts international image.                                        (54.89 %)802 votesI support the protesters bringing down the concrete wall before the embassy, which was an ugly reminder of Israels notorious Separation Wall, but I reject the storming of the Israeli embassy facility, which is flagrant violation of the law.                                         (17.25 %)252 votesI fully support both the bringing down of the wall and the storming of the embassy facility. Only Egyptian protesters were hurt in the events, while Israels killing of six Egyptian soldiers has yet to generate even a proper apology.                                         (22.45 %)328 votesI dont know.                                         (5.41 %)79 votesWith the fall of Gaddafis brutal regime the promise of a fully-fledged Arab spring seems one step closer to fulfillment. What are your expectations?Democratic revolutions are bound to sweep the Arab world. Syria and Yemen will follow, opening the door for a new age of freedom and democracy in the Arab world.                                          (17.11 %)154 votesFundamentalist Islamists, backed by oil rich Saudi Arabia, will hijack the Arab revolutions and create regressive, religion-based autocracies.                                         (25.78 %)232 votesThere will be no uniform Arab pattern. Democracy will succeed in some places, fail in some, and make limited headway in others.                                         (51.44 %)463 votesI dont know.                                         (5.67 %)51 votesThe Israeli killing of 5 Egyptian soldiers in Egyptian territory has enraged the Egyptian public, while the government tried to contain the crisis. What is your view?Egypt should immediately downgrade diplomatic relations with Israel, throw out the Israeli ambassador and recall the Egyptian ambassador from Tel Aviv, demand restitution for the victims, halt gas exports to Israel and open the Rafah border with Gaza                                        (34.58 %)452 votesIsraels expression of sorrow is sufficient, especially when accompanied by a joint investigation into the incident. We should maintain good ties with Israel.                                        (17.52 %)229 votesIsrael was pursuing terrorists in accordance with the right of hot pursuit, and the killing of the Egyptian soldiers was an unintentional error. Egypt should cooperate with Israel in hunting down terrorists.                                        (29.07 %)380 votesIsraels criminal killing of Egyptian soldiers should not go unpunished. It absolves Egypt of the peace treaty, which Egypt should unilaterally declare null and void.                                         (10.64 %)139 votesI dont have a position on the matter.                                         (8.19 %)107 votesIt took enormous and sustained popular pressure to bring Mubarak to public trial. What are your feelings on where the trial might be heading?Its all theater; the officers are bowing and saluting the prisoners, the prosecution has deliberately bungled the case, and Mubarak will be acquitted.                                         (25.95 %)178 votesIt is a historic trial, the first time in modern Arab history that people bring their ruler to account for his crimes. Mubarak is bound to be convicted.                                         (30.76 %)211 votesMubarak has done great things for Egypt; it is a great shame that he and his sons should be humiliated in this fashion. This trial should be disbanded with due apologies to the Mubaraks.                                        (13.41 %)92 votesThere are many loopholes in the case; the security bodies are for the defendants, but Mubarak, his sons and cronies will be convicted for their crimes.                                        (18.95 %)130 votesI don't know.                                        (10.93 %)75 votesThe ruling Military Council and Prime Minister Essam Sharaf have made substantial concessions to the demands of the second wave of the Egyptian revolution. What is your position?The administration has done more than enough to meet the demands of the revolution. Sit-ins and protest actions should end and the new government given a chance to move on with the transition.                                        (21.04 %)150 votesImportant concessions have been made, but they are insufficient. Sit-ins and protest action should go on until all basic demands are met, and to ensure promises are fulfilled.                                         (27.63 %)197 votesIt is all window-dressing; the Egyptian revolution has been betrayed, and protest action should continue until the military council is removed from power.                                         (44.32 %)316 votesI have no position on the matter.                                         (7.01 %)50 votesAn open-ended sit-in in Cairos Tahrir Square and other Egyptian cities began on Friday July 8. The protesters say the sit-in will go on until a number of basic demands of the revolution are met. Where do you stand?I fully support the continuation of the sit-in until the revolutionary demands are met.                                        (64.95 %)680 votesEnough is enough! These sit-ins are wreaking havoc with the countrys stability and economy. They should be disbanded immediately.                                        (11.17 %)117 votesI support the demands but disagree with the sit-ins, which undermine the return to normalcy and economic revival.                                        (19.68 %)206 votesI don't know.                                        (4.2 %)44 votesA nation-wide protest has been called for 8 July to press for the speedy prosecution of Mubarak and his cronies, as well as of all police officers involved in the torture and killing of citizens. Where do you stand?Enough protests! We want stability and security. Prosecuting police officers would bring even more harm to the precarious security situation.                                        (22.25 %)162 votesI fully support the protest call and will take part in the demonstrations.                                         (35.99 %)262 votesI fully support the protest call, but will not join the demonstrations.                                        (22.39 %)163 votesI sympathise with the demands put forward by the movements and parties, but disagree with the call for demonstrations.                                         (14.15 %)103 votesI have no position on the matter.

Where do you stand?Parliamentary elections should be held first, and on schedule.                                        (14.25 %)64 votesThe Constitution should be drawn by a constituent assembly reflecting the aspirations of all sections of the nation.  I choose Constitution First.

What is your opinion?The attacks are instigated and executed by local counter-revolutionary forces, including Muslim fanatics, Mubarak regime diehards and rogue security forces, and are backed and funded by regressive Gulf States.                                        (33.03 %)143 votesThe attacks are the expression of deep-seated sectarian tensions, and their greater frequency is a result of the security vacuum created by the revolution, and have nothing to do with counter-revolutionary conspiracies.
