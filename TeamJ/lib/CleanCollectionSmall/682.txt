They have bested the Royals record in the Central Division practically every year, and making playoff appearances in the majority of the last several years. Unlike the Royals who have said good bye to several players who have gone on to post successful careers in the majors, the Tigers have always had the ability to keep the stars they have as long as bring in new ones. The one thing the Royals do have on the Tigers is that their last World Series victory was in 1985, and the Tigers was in 1984. This offseason, however, things changed. Out of nowhere, the Royals finally went out and spent some money to acquire James Shields and Wade Davis from the Tampa Bay Rays. The move did not come without a substantial cost, however, as the Royals had to give up their top-four minor league prospects.As a result of what the Royals did, the Tigers knew that they had to start securing some deals as soon as possible. Anibal Sanchez, one of their pitchers from last year, had an expired contract. He was supposedly receiving offers from several teams, with the Chicago Cubs supposedly being the team with the greatest level of interest. Sanchez will be returning to the Tigers as he was re-signed on a 5-year, $80-million contract.Sanchez is one of those guys who have never posted legendary numbers, but he certainly proved he was a worthwhile acquisition after being traded to the Tigers from the Florida Marlins during July of 2012. He finished with a very mediocre record of 4-6 with an ERA of over 3.70, but this does not tell the whole story. Two of those six losses came during the playoffs, but the Tigers could not crack the .160 batting-average mark. His ERA was below 1.80 during 20 1/3 innings pitched during the playoffs, which is spectacular.Sanchez will turn 29 just before the start of the 2013 campaign, so he still has plenty of years under his belt. He has a career record of 48-51, but he still has some learning to do in what will be just his seventh year in the big leagues. The Tigers also added Torii Hunter to their squad last week, so hopefully he will be able to help Sanchez in the run support category.
