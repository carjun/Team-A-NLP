Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*I don't own any semi-automatic weapons -- well except for a .22. The mass lethality of a weapon goes massively up when a weapon becomes semi-automatic and automatic.If they were to ban semi-automatic rifles and pistols. It wouldn't effect me in the least. I don't need a semi-auto to hunt deer. In fact, I am mildly disgusted when I'm sitting in the woods and hear someone unload 5-7 rapid shots with a semi. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoI come from a family of therapists and I am a psychology grad, so I understand the need for increased mental health spending, but I don't think that it is going to be a panacea in this situation. Most people who would commit a tragedy like this don't seek out help.We're talking about increased border security to prevent illegal imports, increased police force, etc.Not really. Most guns used in North/South America come from the USA. Right now guns flow out, not in. People easily buy guns on the American side of the border and smuggle them into Mexico. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Ideally, we need MASSIVELY increased spending in mental health, but I don't think that is going to happen any time soon. In the short, we need to take the weapons of mass killing out of the hands of those who would commit such atrocities.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Do you think that wouldn't happen?The federal government monitors fertilizer more than it does guns because of terrorists.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]brokenex 16 points17 points18 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]brokenex 16 points17 points18 points 1 day agoTo be fair, just because guns aren't allowed in NYC and someone got shot there is not a good argument against gun control. NYC isn't isolated city. It is easy to buy guns just outside NYC and then bring them in. If someone is going to try to massacre a school filled with children, I would rather they try to do it with a knife instead of a gun. It would go completely differently.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I'm a secular person, but I don't know anyone who takes a completely firm materialistic stance. It's easy to criticize 'materialism' as limiting the imagination of humanity, but if we were to discover some other preternatural medium with which we interact, it would quickly be thrown in to the category of 'material' and would we would exactly where we are now.Most atheists I know are very open minded to there being more to this universe than just 'material', but they are often forced to take a hard-line position as an embattled minority undersiege by a moral seeking majority. From a sociological point of view, I think it might be inevitable that such an embattled minority takes some strong stances that are almost purely contrary to the larger majority (see: democrats vs republicans). If we ever get over this hump and non-theist points-of-view gain wide spread acceptance, I think you will see a flourishing of new ideas and philosophies other than just materialism, but right now it is a necessary evil because it contains the strongest arguments against theism. Materialism offers a strong cover for non-theists to carve out some space in this world, but I don't know anyone who limits their imagination to it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow one theatre in Paris is showing Life of Pi...  by  Bambillain  movies[+]brokenex 1 point2 points3 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]brokenex 1 point2 points3 points 14 days agoIt's all fun and games until someone has to piss....permalinksavecontextfull commentsInternet and Mobile Has Been Cut Off in Syria  by  swallsyin  worldnews[+]brokenex 4 points5 points6 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]brokenex 4 points5 points6 points 15 days agoThat's a complete false equivalency.permalinksavecontextfull commentsInternet and Mobile Has Been Cut Off in Syria  by  swallsyin  worldnews[+]brokenex 14 points15 points16 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]brokenex 14 points15 points16 points 15 days ago100% not sarcastic.
