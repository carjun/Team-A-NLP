Phillips and Tamer El-GhobashyUPDATED | New details emerged late Friday about the family of the suspected gunman in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., which left 28 people dead.Law-enforcement officials identified the suspected shooter as 20-year-old Adam Lanza and said he was found dead inside the school.Officials said the alleged shooters mother, Nancy Lanza, was believed to be among the victims.Earlier, a law-enforcement official incorrectly identified the suspect as 24-year-old Ryan Lanza, who is Adams brother. Ryan was questioned by investigators Friday but isnt believed to have had any role in the shooting.Two federal law-enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said the firearms recovered at the scene  Glock and Sig Sauer handguns were registered to the alleged shooters mother and are legal.A third firearm was registered to Ms. Lanza as well, the officials said.The registration answers one of the questions about the origin of the firearms believed used in the mass shooting. Under federal law, Adam Lanza would have been prohibited from buying handguns from a licensed dealer because of his age.According to state court records, the suspected gunmans parents divorced in 2009. Both Nancy and Peter Lanza filed certifications of their completion of a parenting-education program, a Connecticut state requirement in divorce proceedings if the couple has children under the age of 18.Beth Israel, a neighbor of the Lanza family whose daughter went to elementary school with Adam, said she recalled the suspected gunman as a socially awkward teenager.He was kind of a loner and shy. He didnt look you in the eye, she said. Ms. Israel described Adam as very thin with dirty-blonde hair and a long, narrow face.Mary Ann Lanza, the ex-wife of Adam Lanzas grandfather, said she remembers the family as a close-knit and loving group who lived across New England, from New Hampshire to Connecticut. Adams aunt and uncle live in New Hampshire, she said, and would often invite relatives to swim in their above-ground pool during the summers.They were just a lovely family, Mary Ann Lanza said.His former grandmother said she remembered Adam as a young child but didnt know him as a teenager. His parents had separated years before they divorced, she said.Her ex-husband, who died in 2010, was a widower when she met him, with children and grandchildren of his own. They married in the 1990s and divorced in 2001, she said.Mary Ann Lanza hadnt realized until informed by a reporter of her family connection to the suspect in the mass shooting. Oh my God, oh my God. Adam? she said. But theyre such a lovely family, the whole family was just beautiful.Katie Colaneri, a 24-year-old resident of Hoboken, N.J., described herself as a friend of Ryan, the suspects brother who for hours Friday was incorrectlyidentifiedas the alleged gunman.He [is] a little shy, but very nice and sweet, said Ms. Colaneri, who has known Ryan for over a year.She said Ryan is a gentle guy who was devoted to his job at the Ernst & Young accounting firm.A representative for Ernst & Young would not comment on his employment status.A law-enforcement official briefed on the investigation told the Associated Press that Ryan has been extremely co-operative and is not under arrest, although he was still being question late Friday.The official said Ryans computers and phone records were being searched but only in an abundance of caution. Ryan told authorities he had not been in touch with his brother Adam in recent years, and the official said he isnt believed to have any connection to the school killings.In Hoboken, Ryan lives in a newer building that was hard-hit by superstorm Sandy, Ms. Colaneri said. He lost power for a number of days following the storm.The last time she saw him, about a month ago, Ms. Colaneri recalled that Ryan ran up to her and gave her a hug. Im really shocked, she said. As the details unfolded, I was totally devastated.The well-to-do suburban neighborhood where the Lanzas lived was lit up as on a usual December Friday night, with lavish Christmas lights covering the trees and plastic reindeer set on manicured lawns.Police blocked off the street as a crush of news vans lined up behind the police tape.A neighbor of the Lanza family said that houses along Yogananda Street in the village of Sandy Hook occupy at least two acres of land. The home occupied by Nancy Lanza is a yellow Colonial with a swing set in the backyard, located in a wooded area at the end of a long, private road.I wouldnt know them if they drove right by me, he said of the family, describing them in a phone interview as a quiet presence in the neighborhood. We know all the neighbors but them.The 49-year-oldneighbor, who did not wish to be identified, said police surrounded the home on Friday afternoon and had forced open the garage door with a loud bang. He said police arrived before noon and were eventually joined by a heavily armed group of officers in full camouflage.A former school board official in Newtown called into question earlier reports that Nancy Lanza had been connected to Sandy Hook Elementary School, possibly as part of the teaching staff.No one has heard of her, said Lillian Bittman, who served on the local school board until 2011. Teachers dont know her.

Why on earth are people using this terrible event, the slaughter of children and adults, to post political comments attacking the president, or racist and anti-Semitic comments attacking Latinos and Jews? What is wrong with those of you who are doing this kind of stuff? Dont you have any respect for the dead? If not, you should get help quickly. Sociopathy is a danger to everyone around you. Please get help, and honor the lives of all of those who were murdered yesterday.         12:36 am December 15, 2012  Lanza is a Jewish-Italian name. wrote:              Lanza is a Jewish-Italian name.It is one of the names adopted (in particular) by Sicilian Jews when they were forced to convert.Adam is more obviously a Jewish name.This is why there was a mistake, and his brother Ryan Lanza was labeled the killer.Ryan Lanza is much less obviously Jewish.The two kids who carried out the Columbine High School massacre, were both Jews.You have to wonder why Jews are so violent.         12:12 am December 15, 2012  NAB wrote:              Thank the NRA for the killings Seymour DalkoffGrow up. He didnt own these guns, he had NO right to have them. NRA and their beliefs dont apply here. The NRA protects the rights of law abiding citizens. And the law abiding will be the only ones to be affected by gun control legislation.The criminals and scumbags and murderers dont care about laws and control. Stop using a tragedy as a way to support your political beliefs. Lets figure out why this happens.         10:43 pm December 14, 2012  Lisa K. wrote:              I agree this was not the best written article ever, but the title of it IS Details Emerge About FAMILY of Suspected Gunman, isnt it?About MetropolisRSSA blog of reporting and news from New York City, Metropolis is produced by Aaron Rutkoff and Carrie Melago, with contributions from the Wall StreetJournal staff.
