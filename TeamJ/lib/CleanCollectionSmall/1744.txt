It has some interesting white markings.  by  Coyotemarcianoin  curiosityrover[+]spin0 2 points3 points4 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]spin0 2 points3 points4 points 14 days agoCould the abrasion be some metallic material from the wheel? I don't think so. First, to me it looks just exposed bits of the rock, where the wheel removed some dust from the surface. And second, I can't think of a reason why metal from the wheel would stick onto it.Maybe the white marks are from rocks that rolled down from the top of the crater...?A rock would hardly roll this far. For that you'd need a landslide, which would be very apparent and visible phenomenom in the area.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis rock got the attention of Curiosity on Sol 112.

They appear brighter in the images because the wheel took some of the dust off from the rock's surface. It may look strange but it's just bits of exposed rock - named Bell Island.In this image from sol 104 the rock is under the left front wheel: http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=FLA_406728828EDR_F0050388FHAZ00302M_&s=104Then a little drive was made to get that rock into better position for the arm.In sol 111 the rock is in the center: http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=FLA_407353944EDR_F0050432FHAZ00302M_&s=111And there Bell Island is ready for the investigation with the arm.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMajor sub-races of Europe?  by  slender123in  history[+]spin0 3 points4 points5 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]spin0 3 points4 points5 points 15 days agoWhat is this, Stormfront?We actually had a subrace here in Europe: http://www.subrace.eu/I hope they make it annual.permalinksavecontextfull comments891011Curiosity technical papers still freely available, go get them while you can.

The surface looks uneven and mostly hard so the wheels won't necessarily leave a continous track.I compared those images to these Rear Hazcam images from sol 102: http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?s=102&camera=RHAZ_It's easy to see that the terrain causes intermittent breaks in the tracks.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone know what this is?  by  toml42in  curiosityrover[+]spin0 10 points11 points12 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]spin0 10 points11 points12 points 19 days agoThe images are taken by MARDI (Mars descent imager) - you can tell by the address and name of images.

That probably refers to the star catalogue measured by ESA's Hipparcos satellite. It also measured Tycho-2 Catalogue of 2.5 million stars with bit less accuracy.Next year ESA launches it's successor Gaia. During it's mission it will measure an even more precise 3D map of over 1 billion stars or about 1% of stars in our galaxy.Now that's gonna be an awesome map. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsYSK a Brief Timeline of how the World Found Out about Global Warming.  by  hombre8in  YouShouldKnow[+]spin0 4 points5 points6 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]spin0 4 points5 points6 points 22 days agoAmerican Institute of Physics' site has a very good and much more detailed history of climate science: The Discovery of Global Warming.The site has also a more detailed timeline (Milestones).permalinksavecontextfull commentsTimeline: How the World Found Out about Global Warming  by  camilstoenescuin  history[+]spin0 0 points1 point2 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]spin0 0 points1 point2 points 22 days agoAmerican Institute of Physics' site has a very good and bit more detailed history of climate science: The Discovery of Global Warming.The site has also a timeline (Milestones).permalinksavecontextfull comments$12.8 billion budget approved for European Space Agency  by  MiamiPowerin  science[+]spin0 0 points1 point2 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]spin0 0 points1 point2 points 22 days agoTech demonstration mission LISA Pathfinder got funded and is scheduled to launch in 2014.permalinksavecontextfull comments$12.8 billion budget approved for European Space Agency  by  MiamiPowerin  science[+]spin0 0 points1 point2 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]spin0 0 points1 point2 points 22 days agoTech demonstration mission LISA Pathfinder has funding and is going to be launched in 2014.From the budged fact sheet:Within this new subscription period (2013-2017), the science programme will launch Gaia, the mission that will map our Galaxy and catalogue a billion stars, LISA Pathfinder, which will redefine the understanding of time and space, and BepiColombo, ESAs mission to Mercury.

And as an European, I'm very happy to have Canada working in ESA. In fact Canada is the only country that has a special status as a Cooperating State: ESA and Canada renew cooperation agreement, building on long-term partnershipAs a cooperating state, Canada participates in ESA deliberative bodies and decision-making and takes part in ESA's programmes and activities. Canadian firms can bid for and receive contracts to work on programmes of interest to them. The agreement contains a specific provision ensuring a fair industrial return to Canada. Actually ESA Convention has no restriction that only European states could join as a member. But the ESA Council implements that de facto, so Canada has the status of an associate member. But as a special Cooperating State it is very much integrated with ESA. In 2012 Canada's direct monetary contribution to ESA's budged was 18.7 million (0.5%). Here's how ESA's budged was used in 2012. And here's a list of all the cool stuff ESA is going to do with the 2013-17 budged.ESA has currently 20 member states and Canada as a Cooperating State. ESA is in the process of enlargement, and has many (more or less European) countries as applicant states including Ukraine, Turkey and Israel.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHitler's Mannerheim Conversation: Secret recording from 1942 of the first 11 minutes of Adolf Hitler having a private conversation with Finland's General Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim.  by  skynet907in  history[+]spin0 1 point2 points3 points 26 days ago (0 children)[]spin0 1 point2 points3 points 26 days agoThere was a link here on reddit previously of a recording of Hitler talking to one of his generals about the Eastern Front, commenting on Russian tank production and so on.Could you please link to it?permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow did the common people view rape in Italy during the Renaissance?  by  ImNotSoSuperin  history[+]spin0 0 points1 point2 points 26 days ago*(0 children)[]spin0 0 points1 point2 points 26 days ago*It is.
