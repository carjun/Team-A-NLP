Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]aellington -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (0 children)[]aellington -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoThis makes me so fucking angry and sad. I know that everyone has a right to a trial but goddamn these shooters don't deserve that. They deserve to die...shooting adults is one thing, but innocent children is another thing. Fucking low lives. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDesperate for some advice on fighting to save a relationship.  by  Kavemannin  BreakUps[+]aellington 2 points3 points4 points 19 days ago*(0 children)[]aellington 2 points3 points4 points 19 days ago*The more you chase after her, the faster she's going to run away. I suggest not doing anything, atleast not right now. Its an emotional time after a breakup and one moment of an emotional breakdown with her and you might ruin things forever. Take some time to figure yourself out. Learn to live without her. If you can't do this then how can you possibly live with her? You gotta be able to stand on your own two feet. The good news is that women find this trait attractive and maybe she'll begin to see that in you again. Basically avoid doing what your instincts tell you because you'll be acting out of emotion. Instead try and understand how a women thinks and what is attractive to her. Be logical and methodical with your actions if you ever want her back. Obviously you can't control how she feels, but if you put emotions aside and start to think about the psychology of a women then you'll be putting yourself in a better position to maybe get her back.Good luck! I'm in a very similar situation as you. Its been 5 weeks since my breakup. No matter what happens thing's do get better as long as you don't let your emotions dictate what you do. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAdvice on how to break no contact  by  aellingtonin  BreakUps[+]aellington[S] 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]aellington[S] 0 points1 point2 points 19 days agoThe chances of that are slim to none. She's extremely busy with work and school and doesn't really have time to be hooking up with anybody. And I know her pretty well, she won't give it away to just anybody. And even if she's seeing someone that doesnt mean their sleeping together. This wasn't a breakup caused by her wanting to go out and screw other guys. Also people do NC for different reasons. Many do it because their ex really did hurt them by cheating or abusing them and they want NC to be permanent. I did it for myself and to avoid any further damage to our relationship during this emotional time. I'm ready to move and try to rebuild a relationship from the bottom up. Furthermore I'm going into it without any expectations of getting back together. Sure I'd eventually like to but right now I'm focusing on getting one of my best friends back, not a girlfriend. permalinksavecontextfull comments4123Advice on how to break no contact (self.BreakUps)submitted 19 days ago by aellington to BreakUps8 commentssharecancelloading...aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
