"Tomorrow evening the president will travel to Newtown, CT to meet with the families of those who were lost and thank first responders," White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement today. "The president will also speak at an interfaith vigil for families of the victims as well as families from Sandy Hook Elementary scheduled for 7PM EST."    On Friday, following the news of the massacre, the president told the nation: "As a country, we have been through this too many times." For Mr. Obama, his visit to Connecticut will be his third trip to a site following a mass shooting in the past 23 months. In January 2011, he took part in a vigil following the mass shooting that injured Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and this past July, Mr. Obama met with victims' families following the massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.  Obama: "We have been through this too many times" Obama repeats call for "meaningful action" on guns During his remarks on Friday, Mr. Obama said, "I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief I do" and noted that the majority of the victims were "children, beautiful little kids... They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own."  Word of a presidential visit to Newtown spread earlier Saturday when the mayor of nearby Danbury, Mark Boughton, tweeted that helicopters heard over the area were part of a presidential advance team.  "Those helicopters you hear are the Presidential advance team," Boughton wrote on Twitter. "They are scouting landing locations."      2012 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Our president is going to comfort victims and thank the first responders in Conneticut - who cares if you agree or not. Has nothing to with your political hate. "May he rot in hell" - to wish that on anyone makes you worse than I can describe, given the nature of the article and the victims' families that the POTUS is going to visit. This type of hate, if left unchecked, can lead to the killing of innocent people. And yet, someone asks "where does it begin, what went wrong?" How in the he** does one hate someone they don't know? Never met?

(But you can't assume that every citizen walking down the street isn't packing.)This would get the 'Murican death toll down to Swiss levels in about a year.            Type_Z replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Didn't say I had all the answers, personal responsibility for ourselves could include with knowledge of someone under our own roof who should never have access to gun, we should see to it that it does not happen. That would not have be law.It would be like this, "dear, you are telling me you have pain in your chest and can't breath?" it's reasonable for me to think this person is having a heart attack and I'm calling 911.Or, "this has been a rough day, I hear you telling me how troubled you are, i want you safe and happy...."it's again reasonable for me to seek help.We don't need laws to do this. We need to be educated. If the nation would look at the common denominator, and if mental health experts could teach us and help us, perhaps to changes in laws would be needed at all.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  JLWIII says: No doubt this is the most horrible tragedy since, well quite frankly since the last one. As for as the NRA is concerned, I think we total OVER ESTIMATE their control over the voters and over the members of congress. Didn't we just have an election and all though it would be bought and paid for by the Koch Brother and Karl Rover and his sinister band of merry men?? They spend hundreds of millions of dollars, and have absolutely nothing to show for it. The only people who benefited were the TV stations who took them to the cleaners on their rates. They under estimated the American Electorate, and this is another case where we should not do the same. The horrid deaths of these poor innocent children and the bravo souls who gave their lives to save them should be the foundation of an uprising against our current gun laws and for more sensible regulations. Every time you think the NRA has the upper hand, just remember the Koch Brothers and Karl Rove, who isn't even employed by FOX News any longer. Have confidence in We The People.....     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  Balarbn says: If I have power to change.. I would be device the gun law with these changes, effective immediately..a) All guns must have GPS enabled.(simple mobile has it, then why not).b) If that requires data plan, then gun owner pay for it.. he has money and scared, so he need to pay for it. How I pay for home security.c) All public places should be identified as 'No Gun' area and upon GPS identifies, itshould dial 911 by itself.d) As soon as a bullet is fired, it should automatically call 911.e) Any gathering more than 50+ ppl, should fall under 'No Gun' area.f) At a given point of time, no private person is entitled for more than 2 guns.If these changes requires lobby money, then i would contribute 200$. like how we collect for red cross to save for a disturbed cause, like wise all could jointly can make difference?It will create jobs for altering all, and data plan will boost telecom industry as well, we will all feel safer. its win-win situation.. what you say..Do add, if you guys think another points will make difference.     reply        cltsew9946 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  SURE , I would agree to that.....right after our POS POTUS comes clean with all his lies, cover ups and renounces his support of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Today the shooter's aunt said he was home schooled. The mother had a ongoing dispute with the school system. Perhaps he came to dislike or hate the school system because of the dispute. The mother was a gun collector. She took him with her to the firing range. He tried to buy a gun in Conn. but did not want to wait the 14 days required for a background check. So he raided his mother's collection, she tried to stop him. A struggle ensured and he shot her, reportedly in the face. He then proceeded to do harm to the school system that he had become so angry with.All 20 children killed were 6 or 7 years old. NRA supporters how can you heartlessly defend your position to never touch current gun laws that might reduce the possiblitity of this happening again?We as a country, adults and parents are suppose to be the protectors of our children but republicans and the NRA blocks every attempt to protect themMy condolences to the families of this tragedy. We have been thru this too many times and we must begin to address this. However, do not expect any help from republicans as they are in the pockets of the NRA and other entities hostile to ordinary Americans. Republicans must be voted out to remove their obstruction to making progress on this and other issues. Elections have consequences, and electing republicans to control congress will result in no movement to begin to address this or other issues America so desperately needs to address.     reply        3815-1 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  your right,what about the truth in lybia and fast and furious these dead heroes have parents also            mattyboy198921 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Okay Gun control ain't the solution here if anything it would make things worse (read below) ******After the 1997 shooting of 16 kids in Dunblane, England, the United Kingdom passed one of the strictest gun-control laws in the world, banning its citizens from owning almost all types of handguns. Britain seemed to get safer by the minute, as 162,000 newly-illegal firearms were forked over to British officials by law-abiding citizens.But this didn't decrease the amount of gun-related crime in the U.K. In fact, gun-related crime has nearly doubled in the U.K. since the ban was enacted.Might stricter gun laws result in more gun crime? It seems counterintuitive but makes sense if we consider one simple fact: Criminals don't obey the law. Strict gun laws, like the ban in Britain, probably only affect the actions of people who wouldn't commit crimes in the first place.England's ban didn't magically cause all British handguns to disappear. Officials estimate that more than 250,000 illegal weapons are still in circulation in the country. Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these weapons now have a much easier job, and the incidence of gun-related crime has risen. As the saying goes, "If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.******               linkicon reporticon emailicon  milesorellana says: Argument #1 : gun prohibition is futile.Argument #2 : marijuana prohibition is logical.The same people are pushing these two ideas... to allow something that is known to be harmful, because it cannot be controlled, but to fight something that is known to be harmless, even though it cannot be controlled.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  waynenipper says: Obama gave a great, touching talk yesterday.America, you may as well get used to gun massacres ... this is going to become a regular occurrence in your country. Poverty, poor education, mental illness, unemployment, numerous social stresses, and the total and unequivocal lack of will to implement some sort of counter to your second amendment right will fuel these tragedies. The NRA (the most powerful force in America, seemingly even more powerful than your government) will pump millions and millions of dollars to stop 'any' movement of sanity regarding gun legislation/control. So ... the next massacre should just be around the corner ... get used to it.     reply        JLWIII replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  You seem to be confused. We just had an election a lot of people though that the money spend by Karl Rove and the Koch Brothers was going to buy the election, lock, stock and barrel. Did not happen, did it?? For from it in fact. The American Electorate chose not to be bought, and voted with intelligence and wisdom. The NRA is FAR FROM the most powerful force in America. As the last election proved, We The People had something else in mind. By the way, where the hell are you from?? What is the social climate like where you hail from and your last line, "the next massacre should be right around the corner -get used to it" - that sounds like a serious threat that should be investigated by the Federal Government. Now to mention, today of all days, it's a despicable statement to make.            msbpodcast replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  <i>this is going to become a regular occurrence in your country</i>Senseless slaughter has been a regular feature of the <b><i>'Murican Way of Life</i></b> since the country was founded in 1776.Its not likely a change until they adopt the Swiss model of compulsory military service, and weapons training, for <b><i>all</i></b> of their citizens.
