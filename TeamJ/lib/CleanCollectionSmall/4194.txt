Feel free to send me a message if you need to chat. I was 20 when my dad died and 22 when my mom died. My younger brother (17 at the time) and I had to find a place to live since my mom rented and we couldn't afford our place. The cutoff for survivor's benefits is 17. My best advice? Spend as much time with her as you can stomach. You will think back later on all the time you wished you had spent with her. Ask her about her childhood. Ask her about her adulthood. Ask her about the things she wants for you. Ask her anything you can possibly think of. You won't regret it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am an old Grateful/Dead & Phish Tour Rat.

After repeating numerous times he had passed, still got threatening phone calls. Finally, I snapped: the lady on the phone demanded to speak to my father, when I said that wasn't possible, she said 'Well someone has to know how to get a hold of the fool!!!' My reponse was 'Yes, when they figure out how to call dead people I will let you know.' Her tone totally changed and they stopped calling. derrrrrrrrp.Also, the Illinois Tollway is trying to sue my been-dead-for-6-years mother for tolls she didn't pay..that occured 3 years after she had died.

He had had a few beers so he wasn't going to drive himself; he ended up staying home.

I was cocktailing at a super busy microbrewery that was across the parking lot from a big movie theater, some stupid Twilight or Harry Potter movie came out that night so we got slammed late and it was only me working. These 2 punkass guys (just turned 21) sat at one of my tables and ran up an $80 bill drinking Long Islands. I overheard them talking about what movie they wanted to see so I knew that's where they were headed.Fast forward to 30 minutes later, they skip out on the entire bill, left me a folded up $5 bill in the book when it should have been closer to $100. So I told the bartender, who is 6'5 and 250 pounds and intimidating as hell... let him know the 2 shits were going to a movie. He ran across the parking lot and ended up catching them in line, shook them down for all of the money they had in their pockets and told them never to come back again. I guess the one guy was crying. It was awesome.TL;DR Don't fuck your server over, we're always listeningpermalinksavecontextfull commentsOk ladies, we could really use some new opinions :]  by  alexandersmommyin  BabyBumps[+]kaps84 2 points3 points4 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]kaps84 2 points3 points4 points 20 days agoCould be worse, my boyfriend told me if we have a girl, we can name it UPS and ship it in a box to Abu Dhabi like Garfield did to Nermal.
