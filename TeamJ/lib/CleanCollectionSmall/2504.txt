Teachers and admin, yes.permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 31 points32 points33 points 56 minutes ago (12 children)[]Cylinsier 31 points32 points33 points 56 minutes agoReminds me of the time the school janitor shot and killed the principle in the halls of the school last year in California.  I guess that goes both ways, huh?  permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 4 points5 points6 points 33 minutes ago (7 children)[]skyfail 4 points5 points6 points 33 minutes agoAnd people will stab others to death if they want to harm someone http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/12/14/man-stabs-22-children-at-chinese-elementary-school/ Guns aren't the issue. permalinksaveparent[+]aznscourge 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]aznscourge 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rateAnd the rate is much lower in china.permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 1 point2 points3 points 32 minutes ago (5 children)[]Cylinsier 1 point2 points3 points 32 minutes agoI didn't say they were.  I just implied that more guns are not the solution.  permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail -3 points-2 points-1 points 25 minutes ago (4 children)[]skyfail -3 points-2 points-1 points 25 minutes agoUnless they are depending on the situation? permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 1 point2 points3 points 22 minutes ago (3 children)[]Cylinsier 1 point2 points3 points 22 minutes agoI don't know what that means.  permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes ago (2 children)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes agoI was thinking of situations where someone using a handgun safely in defense would save people instead of having more shootings occur. permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 0 points1 point2 points 4 minutes ago (1 child)[]Cylinsier 0 points1 point2 points 4 minutes agoThat would not reduce the number of shootings that occur.  It would arguably reduce the number of victims.  It could also potentially increase the number of victims if the "good guy" hits bystanders instead of the shooter.  The goal should be to find ways to prevent the shootings from occurring in the first place, not recreate the wild wild west the hallways of an already bloody school and pretend that it's justice.  Putting a gun in the hand of a faculty member does NOT guarantee a better or different outcome.  It provides the possibility of both better and worse outcomes and doesn't alter the original situation in any way, and that is all that it does.  permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 33 seconds ago (0 children)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 33 seconds agoI cannot see this situation being made worse by a faculty member with a hand gun. permalinksaveparent[+]fedupwith -1 points0 points1 point 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]fedupwith -1 points0 points1 point 25 minutes agoClearly, an administrator.permalinksaveparent[+]Fluffiebunnie 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]Fluffiebunnie 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes agoThe janitor could've gotten the gun anyway if he was prepared to murder someone.Things need to be pretty bad before people start acquiring illegal guns to protect themselves.permalinksaveparent[+]timothytandem 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes ago (1 child)[]timothytandem 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes agoYes because he couldn't do the same with a knife, if someone is so determined to kill somebody taking away one weapon won't keep them from finding another. permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]Cylinsier 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes agoI'm not saying you should take away his gun.  I'm just saying that when he shot somebody, the answer isn't to give every other faculty and staff member a gun.  You don't put a fire out by pouring gasoline on it.  permalinksaveparent[+]cronis 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]cronis 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoholy crap, link me!permalinksaveparent[+]Korietsu 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]Korietsu 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour agohttp://www.davekopel.com/2a/othwr/principal&gun.htmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_High_School_shootingpermalinksaveparent[+]m4tthu 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]m4tthu 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour agoThe quote from the kid who did the shooting in that story is extremely compelling. Not saying I agree with what he did, but his words still carry meaning. permalinksaveparent[+]ogenrwot 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]ogenrwot 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agohttp://www.davekopel.com/2A/OpEds/HeroesOutlawed.htmpermalinksaveparent[+]heliosdiem 0 points1 point2 points 45 seconds ago (0 children)[]heliosdiem 0 points1 point2 points 45 seconds agoIn high school our unarmed English teacher (female) single-handedly wrestled an armed student (male) that was high on angel dust down to the ground and unarmed him. I felt much safer in her class after that day.permalinksaveparent[+]nachochease -2 points-1 points0 points 53 minutes ago (1 child)[]nachochease -2 points-1 points0 points 53 minutes agoYes, I'm sure nothing could go wrong with putting guns in the desk of every elementary school teacher in America.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes agoI don't think anyone's suggesting we hand out a gun to anyone who's going to work near kids.  Just allow those who do work with kids and could otherwise legally own/carry a firearm do sopermalinksaveparent[+]tomdarch -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]tomdarch -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 hour agoHow many elementary school students are shot in any given year inside schools?  Then compare that to the number of faculty/staff who would shoot each other every year if they were all armed all the time...permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 9 points10 points11 points 54 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 9 points10 points11 points 54 minutes agoDude, if someone just had access to a gun and that makes them into murderers, they shouldn't be teachers.Do you honestly think that the majority of people would be murderers if they had guns?permalinksaveparent[+]IsaacLeibniz 10 points11 points12 points 55 minutes ago (0 children)[]IsaacLeibniz 10 points11 points12 points 55 minutes agoThen compare that to the number of faculty/staff who would shoot each other every year if they were all armed all the time...Zero?How many faculty/staff stab each other?You're fucking stupid.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes agoI don't think the no gun zone sign is what's stopping teachers from shooting each otherpermalinksaveparent[+]redrover -3 points-2 points-1 points 49 minutes ago (2 children)[]redrover -3 points-2 points-1 points 49 minutes agoThe shooter still managed to kill 2 students and injure seven more.permalinksaveparent[+]barrett51bmg 4 points5 points6 points 48 minutes ago (1 child)[]barrett51bmg 4 points5 points6 points 48 minutes agoPartially because Myrick took time to respond. Partially to blame is the fact that Myrick had to leave the property to retrieve his gun because the law wouldn't let him carry it in the building. permalinksaveparent[+]redrover -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes ago (0 children)[]redrover -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes agoThere's something seriously wrong if the principal of a school needs to carry a gun around.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
