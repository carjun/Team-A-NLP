I am just surprised when I hear someone say they have been threatened by guns that often, when my experience says it doesn't happen often at all. As I said, some of us just attract it maybe.

I worked jobs in retail and delivery, some in very shady places, and also went partying in NYC in some questionable areas, all over the course of 20-25 years during the 80's and 90's, and never was threatened by someone with a gun.
