Shootings will again force Congress to take up gun control | Mobile Washington ExaminerBACKPolitics        Saturday, December 15, 2012Shootings will again force Congress to take up gun control                                                                       By Susan FerrechioDecember 15, 2012 | 1:53 pm  | Modified: December 15, 2012 at 1:55 pm17  The deadly shooting at a Connecticut elementary school on Friday is likely to force Congress to consider major gun control legislation for the first time in nearly two decades, though it will be difficult for lawmakers to approve any new restrictions.    The House and Senate last debated a significant gun bill in 1994, when Democrat Bill Clinton was president and Republican Newt Gingrich was running the House. After a series of mass shootings over the previous few years, including at a restaurant in Texas and on the Long Island Railroad in New York, Congress approved a federal ban on assault weapons that prohibited the sale of 19 types of weapons and others that include assault-style features, like pistol grips.  But the ban expired 10 years later, in 2004, and has never been renewed by Congress, primarily because of opposition from Republicans and Democrats from pro-gun states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Many Democrats lost their seats in 1994, in part, because they supported the ban and when the Senate tried to reinstate the ban in 2004, it was defeated 90-8.Since then, the only gun legislation approved by Congress was a 2005 requirement that gun dealers include trigger locks on the guns they sell.But with dozens murdered in Friday's shooting spree, most of them children between the ages of 5 and 10, it will be next to impossible for President Obama and Congress to sidestep consideration of a new assault weapons ban, say gun-control advocates.Friday's shooting follows a series of mass slayings this year, including attacks on a religious school in California (April), a movie theater in Colorado (July), a Sikh temple in Wisconsin (August) and a shopping mall in Oregon (Dec. 12)."This is now an unavoidable debate and it is time for President Obama to lead," Joshua Horowitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which estimates there is a mass shooting spree about every three months. "It is time for action and that is what we expect."More From WashingtonExaminer.com12Next Photos            Related Articles Shootings will again force Congress to take up gun control Police, world wonder about Conn. shooting motiveMichael Moore: It is time to discuss gun control Official: 27 dead in Conn. school shootingWH says its inappropriate to argue about gun control todayAfter school shooting in Connecticut, Piers Morgan blasts Americas gun madness Court ruling on Ill. gun ban sets stage for fightGun rights find a new home Only one side of the storyIs Jason Whitlock a 'blame whitey firster'?Virginia GOP split on gun agenda for 2013Costas: I plan to continue raising gun culture issuesBob Costas: I wouldnt want to have a gun during a theater shootingObama expected to push gun control in second termA modest proposal: The women's gun mandateOn MSNBC, Bob Costas criticizes Wild West, Dirty Harry gun culture in AmericaBob Costas says he made mistake with Jovan Belcher/gun culture comments Costas takes his gun-control message to MSNBC, FoxPiers Morgan defends NBCs Bob Costa on gun control No need to 'aplogize' for your faith You're a good man, Charlie Brown, but some people hate you
