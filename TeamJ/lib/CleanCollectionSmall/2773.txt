There are ramifications to the whole community. Maybe they need to look at the school system or the mental health system, maybe it is entirely unrelated. I have researched a lot about Columbine and there is never one answer; there are a lot of twisting paths, some of them obscured or less defined than others. I expect that there will be no real clarity in this situation too.I also expect there will be a fruitless debate about gun laws. The main argument I see is, "people kill people!" but it is a lot easier and impersonal to shoot someone. Impersonal in the sense that you pull a trigger and that is that, whereas stabbing someone for example involves a lot more activity. I don't mean to sound callous, but I'd be interested to see if it was two shooters. It is a rare scenario for school shootings. Interesting dynamics. permalinksave[+]exedore6 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]exedore6 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoAlso (and I'm not sure stricter gun laws would have helped here), guns make it very easy to kill several people).permalinksaveparent[+]t0nkys 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]t0nkys 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI was going to essentially say that, but I thought it might be flippant of me to do so. Because there is that element of a "kill count" of sorts. It is one of the ways as a school shooter that you don't fade into complete obscurity. On the gun law side of things, I don't live in the US so I don't really have much grounding to argue for and against, because it is a different culture. I can't claim to know what is right or wrong. But if you really want to hurt someone, you can do so whatever country you are in with whatever tools. You are just less likely to see spree killings in countries where guns are not freely available.permalinksaveparent[+]exedore6 0 points1 point2 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)[]exedore6 0 points1 point2 points 59 minutes agoI hear you. I live here. I personally hate guns, but I think (some) people should be able to arm themselves (in some situations), and CT's laws seem pretty reasonable to me, though they're ridiculously opaque.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
