Laws are worthless. People have to step up to the plate and protect themselves. Your security is your responsibility. And these children should have had a security guard or guards plural protecting them.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  GOP-R--Con-Men says: We as a country, adults and parents are suppose to be the protectors of our children but republicans and the NRA blocks every attempt to protect them.My condolences to the families of this tragedy. We have been thru this too many times and we must begin to address this. However, do not expect any help from republicans as they are in the pockets of the NRA and other entities hostile to ordinary Americans. Republicans must be voted out to remove their obstruction to making progress on this and other issues. Elections have consequences, and electing republicans to control congress will result in no movement to begin to address this or other issues America so desperately needs to address.Please explain why republicans will not allow NO restriction to be placed on guns? And then tell us why the mentally impaired, terrorist and criminals have easy legal access to guns     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  pepper8892 says: This is not a issue of gun control, this is a issue of Justice! If we let these people that would attack our schools and our children know, that if they do a crime of this nature, the legal system will not help them, and the people of this country will not stand for this, they will get the point! Burn their ass at the stake!!!

This is an angle for a story? So far, celebrities react the same way that any person would react to such a horrible tragedy, with grief and sadness. I'm just shaking my head that this would even be noteworthy to report.     reply         Add a Comment      Submit Comment          Click here to add another comment.
