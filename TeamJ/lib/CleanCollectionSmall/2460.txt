Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]overthecascades 27 points28 points29 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]overthecascades 27 points28 points29 points 1 hour agoI'm nowhere near the shooting and have no connections to anyone there, but I'm shaking and near tears at work over this. Sickening, absolutely sickening. To think that of all the sick people in the world, a goddamn parent could (allegedly) do this to children... makes me absolutely ill. Heart, thoughts, prayers out to the victims and their loved ones.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSign this petition if you care!

I know that Arthur Marciano donated $3 million for the GS2 (per the BU Today report), but I don't know if BU chose to spend more than that on the project. I'd also be curious to know about that for other donor-funded projects.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSign this petition if you care!

The GS2 was built with donor funds that were specifically designated by the donor for the project.permalinksavecontextfull commentsonly female in the workplace -- ladies, have you experienced this?  by  overthecascadesin  TwoXChromosomes[+]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoAh, that makes sense.

I think that's pretty reasonable.permalinksavecontextfull commentsonly female in the workplace -- ladies, have you experienced this?  by  overthecascadesin  TwoXChromosomes[+]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI remember the take a joke and give it back mentality from when I used to work in a restaurant (it wasn't an all-male environment, but the kitchen was awfully close to it). I rolled with that then -- thanks for reminding me of that! My current situation isn't as intimidating as that was, thinking back on it. Do you think that there is an equivalent piece of advice to "you should be a big girl" that men give other men in a workplace environment? That's curious to me to think about.permalinksavecontextfull commentsonly female in the workplace -- ladies, have you experienced this?  by  overthecascadesin  TwoXChromosomes[+]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI would have been taken aback by that set-up, too! (In fact, I was, when I saw my now-boyfriend-of-a-year's apartment for the first time -- though that wasn't a work space, of course.) That's great that the situation turned out better than expected for you.

I am lucky in that the men I work with have not shown any discriminatory tendencies towards me, especially seeing that others in this post have not been so lucky.permalinksavecontextfull commentsonly female in the workplace -- ladies, have you experienced this?  by  overthecascadesin  TwoXChromosomes[+]overthecascades[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]overthecascades[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoOh, wow. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I definitely feel lucky that the things that are off-putting at my workplace are more subtle than things like sexual harassment. I hope you are in a better situation now.The subtle dynamics are interesting, though. I don't think I've experienced what you experienced in regards to competitiveness, but I've definitely come up against some territorial behavior when tasks get assigned to me that were previously done by men. Also, some of the men at my workplace have apologized to me for saying "fuck" around me (I don't know if this has to do with my gender, age [I'm about six years younger than the second-youngest person here], both, neither). I find that silly, and was surprised it happened more than once.permalinksavecontextfull commentsonly female in the workplace -- ladies, have you experienced this?  by  overthecascadesin  TwoXChromosomes[+]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI guess it depends on the guys and/or girls you're working with. I've known my share of gossipy guys, but at my work place, it sounds somewhat similar to your experience -- less gossip, less interest in my personal life.How did you handle the initial feelings of skepticism that were directed at you? permalinksavecontextfull commentsonly female in the workplace -- ladies, have you experienced this?  by  overthecascadesin  TwoXChromosomes[+]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoHow did you get into that type of work? I admire people who have repair skills like you! (I surely do not possess them.) I think it's awesome that you feel comfortable in that work environment -- I would have expected that to be one in which it would be difficult for a female to acclimate. I guess it's all about awesome co-workers!Out of curiosity, why don't the other females tend to stick around?permalinksavecontextfull commentsonly female in the workplace -- ladies, have you experienced this?  by  overthecascadesin  TwoXChromosomes[+]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]overthecascades[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoWhy did you hate it? I agree with you on the past a certain size thing. Small companies that are all men are more likely to be all men due to available talent, coincidence, etc., but large companies who are very male-dominated often give off the impression that something else is at play. That would make me nervous, too (I am at a small company currently).permalinksavecontextfull commentsonly female in the workplace -- ladies, have you experienced this?  by  overthecascadesin  TwoXChromosomes[+]overthecascades[S] 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]overthecascades[S] 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoThat sounds like a great work environment -- it's about awesome people, not the chromosomes.

Anything human-size doesn't stand a chance against a huge truck, unfortunately. I was just relaying the information from the Twitter account -- apologies if it came off as victim-blaming. That was certainly not my intention.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGetting word that another cyclist has been struck by a truck on Comm Ave and Pleasant St, any updates?  by  elfishwebblyin  BostonU[+]overthecascades 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]overthecascades 1 point2 points3 points 8 days agoAlso, on Twitter (twitter.com/universalhub) it was said that the victim was A) a white male in his 20s and B) not wearing a helmet.

And hey, I'm originally from Detroit -- so I'm willing to give a city nicknamed "Stab City" a chance at least. :)That's a great idea to look into the multinational companies -- I'll make sure to keep that in mind if I end up being able to pull this off. It's a matter of knowing that I do technically have the finances to cover it, it may not be the most responsible decision, especially knowing that times are tough everywhere. On the other hand, this is the age where I can do things like this, and I'm not afraid of challenges or rainy days, so to speak, so I can't bring myself to let go of the idea just yet.Again, I really appreciate your thoughts!
