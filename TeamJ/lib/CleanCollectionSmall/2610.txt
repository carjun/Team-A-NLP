Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]zBriGuy 39 points40 points41 points 58 minutes ago (0 children)[]zBriGuy 39 points40 points41 points 58 minutes agoIt's pretty hard to believe in a god that would allow 18 elementary school kids get murdered in cold blood.  But people will still say "everything happens for a reason" and "god has a plan for all of us".permalinksavecontextfull comments2123Rice Drops Bid for Secretary of State, Citing Opposition (nytimes.com)submitted 21 hours ago by zBriGuy to politics1 commentsharecancelloading...YSK about YouTab - it shows the guitar tabs as the song plays, making it easier to learn how to read/play guitar!  by  ColoredPencilin  YouShouldKnow[+]zBriGuy 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]zBriGuy 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoExpert level drums for Rock Band?permalinksavecontextfull commentsThank you Dr Tyson. :)  by  IStoleTheHiggsBosonin  funny[+]zBriGuy 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]zBriGuy 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago*No, but you could find that in my CV.

(Keeping religion and politics out of it)  by  Washain  AskReddit[+]zBriGuy 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]zBriGuy 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoHowever astronomical the odds, it is possible under certain conditions.  For example there is a medically confirmed story of a woman born with no vagina who got pregnant after giving a blow job.  Shortly after she swallowed she was stabbed which allowed the sperm to travel out of her stomach and enter the fallopean tube via the back door.I could imagine a scenario where the same kind of thing could happen after anal sex.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWait...what?  by  cloudwavesin  atheism[+]zBriGuy 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]zBriGuy 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoIt looks like someone tried to vandalize their "truth" fish.
