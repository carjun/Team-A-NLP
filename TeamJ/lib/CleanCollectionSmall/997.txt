Evey time my roommate would watch it, I'd sit and try to see it and it had amusing parts, but it just never really was that funny to me.I decided this last spring to start from the beginning and watch the first season at least, give it a chance.So many things that weren't that funny to me before that were so hilarious. I ended up burning through the episodes in about a month after that.So... not that my experiences should sway your opinion or anything, just explaining how it worked out with me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy does the screenwriting world not value collaboration projects for base/common libraries which can be shared/built up by the community? When I compare this to the success of software collaboration projects, I am puzzled at this indifference and wonder if software is "smarter" as a community.  by  SirByronin  Screenwriting[+]dane83 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]dane83 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI have given no comment on the validity of your idea, sir, merely the way you have argued for it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy does the screenwriting world not value collaboration projects for base/common libraries which can be shared/built up by the community?

Your original post is combative at best. It's as neutral as Fox News.You dismiss a perfectly valid argument before you've even allowed a response. And then you've attacked the few people who have responded to your question that they haven't answered you in the narrow context that you've defined.That's not looking for a discussion or consideration, sir.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI have Morgan Freeman's voice at my disposal.

But you are the one asking a question, and you would be more likely to get a response, I feel, if you weren't such a jerk about it.Honestly, the reason I can't take you seriously is because you've asked your question in such a way. You don't want an answer, you want a fight.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy has no one started offering a live ASMR experience for relaxation.

What is really the point in posing your question in this way? It feels like you are being unnecessarily antagonistic. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI have Morgan Freeman's voice at my disposal.

Hell, this is true for wages higher than minimum, too. I ended up leaving my job in part because, after five years in management and meager raises, they started off the new managers at 25 cents less than what I was making. When I asked my boss about it, I was simply told I shouldn't be discussing that information with other employees.I'm the one who does payroll, jackass.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo I've heard "Plan B" is actually going to do this.  by  LtPineapplein  zombies[+]dane83 34 points35 points36 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]dane83 34 points35 points36 points 3 days agoI'd pay good money to see it as an A&E/History Channel style 'documentary' film.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy Crash Bandicoot Aku Aku Tattoo I promised my 12 year old self I would get when I turned 18.  by  Skrimshaw_in  gaming[+]dane83 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]dane83 3 points4 points5 points 3 days agoSure, if that's something you want to have tattooed on your calf.It's your body, man.permalinksavecontextfull commentsYouTube Bob Ross treasure chest.
