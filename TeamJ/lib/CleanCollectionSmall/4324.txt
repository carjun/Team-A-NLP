If it's disrupting school then they are within their rights to take it during the school day (as they are partially legally responsible for you during said time).But longer then the school day? It's private property owned by you or your parents - they cannot keep it in their possession past the school day.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood Guy Teacher [My Version]  by  roboticon44in  teenagers[+]jakemates 4 points5 points6 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]jakemates 4 points5 points6 points 4 months agoLegally they can't. It's either your or your parent's property (depending on your age), and they have no legal right to take it away from you for any period of time longer than the school day.Of course, that's for public schools. If you're in a private school, no clue.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow would your parents react to this situation?

Anything that pertains to your real identity, specifically:NameStupid question, but I'm assuming it's okay that my username is my name? Also, are we allowed to give generic location details (as in country and state)?Gender flair will not be happening. Gender flair would needlessly sexualize the subreddit - it creates a focus on gender even when gender is wholly irrelevant.I completely agree, but on the off-chance that gender flair does happen, please include genderqueer for anyone who falls outside the gender binary!permalinksavecontextfull commentshow do y'all feel about a series of meet-ups?  by  romestfubin  LGBTeens[+]jakemates 1 point2 points3 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]jakemates 1 point2 points3 points 4 months agoThat'd be great!
