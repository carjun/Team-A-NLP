News4 hours agoAdam Lanza seemed not to feel physical or psychological pain in the same way as his classmates at Newtown High School, a former employee there has said. Richard Novia, the school district's head of security until 2008, who also served as adviser for the school technology club, said Lanza clearly "had some disabilities"."If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically," Mr Novia said. "It was my job to pay close attention to that."Mr Novia was responsible for monitoring students as they used soldering tools and other potentially dangerous electrical equipment.He recalled meeting school guidance counsellors, administrators and the boy's mother Nancy to understand his problems and find ways to ensure his safety. But there were other crises only a mother could solve."He would have an episode, and she'd have to return or come to the high school and deal with it," Mr Novia said, describing how the young man would sometimes withdraw completely "from whatever he was supposed to be doing", whether it was sitting in class or reading a book.A woman cries as she pays tribute to the victims of an elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, on DecemberLanza "could take flight, which I think was the big issue, and it wasn't a rebellious or defiant thing", Novia said. "It was withdrawal."Authorities are trying to understand what led the young man to kill his mother in their home and then slaughter 26 children and adults at a Connecticut elementary school before taking his own life.A law enforcement source said Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger's, a mild form of autism. People with the disorder tend to function poorly socially but can be highly intelligent.If he did have Asperger's, his lack of sensation could be related to the disorder, said psychologist Elizabeth Laugeson, an assistant clinical professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. People with Asperger's can be overly sensitive to things like touch, noise and pain, or sometimes under-sensitive, she said.In their teenage years, Lanza and his older brother, Ryan, were members of the tech club, which offered students a chance to work on computers, videotape school events and produce public access broadcasts.It was popular among socially awkward students, but Lanza, while clearly smart, had problems that went beyond an adolescent lack of social skills, Mr Novia said."You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people," Mr Novia said.The club provided a setting for students to build lasting friendships. But while other members were acquainted with Lanza, none was close to him.He was not physically bullied, although he might have been teased, Mr Novia said.The club gave the boy a place where he could be more at ease and indulge his interest in computers. His anxieties appeared to ease, but they never disappeared. When people approached him in the hallways, he would press himself against the wall or walk in a different direction, clutching tight to his black case."The behaviour would be more like an eight-year-old who refuses to give up his teddy bear," Mr Novia said. "What you knew with Adam is, it was a possession. It was not a possession to be put at risk."Even so, Mr Novia said, his primary concern was that Lanza might become a target for abuse by his fellow students, not that he might become a threat."Somewhere along in the last four years, there were significant changes that led to what has happened," Mr Novia said. "I could never have foreseen him doing that."Jim McDade, who lives a few houses from where Ms Lanza was killed, said his family got to know the two brothers and their mother because their children were about the same ages and rode the school bus together."There was certainly no indication of anything unusual that lets you think that a kid's going to do something like that," said Mr McDade, who works in finance in New York. "There was nothing that would indicate anything going on behind the scenes that would lead to this horrible mess."He recalled Lanza as "a very bright kid".Olivia DeVivo, a student at the University of Connecticut, was in Lanza's 10th grade English class."He was very different and very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody," she said.Ms DeVivo said Lanza always carried a briefcase and wore his shirts buttoned up to the top. She said he seemed bright but never really participated in class."Now, looking back, it's kind of like 'okay, he had all these signs', but you can't say every shy person would do something like this." @YahooNewsUK on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook  Best of Yahoo!

We'd have killings like this every day of the week if Asperger's made you kill people. A more likely explanation is that the guy either had another and undiagnosed psychopathy that was hidden by the Asperger symptoms or he had a psychopathy that included Asperger-like symptoms. But I guess that explanation is a little too much for the news media and their urge to dumb everything down as much as possible.v1/comments/context/b17e9b10-8419-38fd-b416-9899d68bc506/comment/1355678678442-2dd8e454-a408-4f13-832b-d03ed47b5e48FRED JONES3 hours agoit was reported that his mother took him to a shooting range where he was taught to use guns ; if this young man was mentaly disturbed why on earth did she let him use guns ?????v1/comments/context/b17e9b10-8419-38fd-b416-9899d68bc506/comment/1355689698792-7298b7c4-6878-4450-ab1f-514a3ecf6313Susan27 minutes agoHumanity has a habit of labelling and boxing people in a one size fits all approach. Be it medicine and illnesses both physical and mental and education etc (done because it is the most economical way to deal with volumes of people  but it is not the best way). Unfortunately life is not as simple as that; humans are simultaneously the same and very different, medicine which may help mend one can cause illness in another. A young man who had presumably been diagnosed with a form of Autism seems to have had other mental health issues that have been missed altogether or incorrectly diagnosed or they didnt have the correct label for him so decided autism was the most thereabouts category. How was he able to so easily gain access to weaponry and clearly knew how to use them?   The idea to choose a school to commit these murders? -  Without a shadow of doubt the source will have been news events about previous killings in schools. News reports on this type of killing spree - when it very first occurred (two decades?) should have been kept localised  but it was broadcast worldwide and ever since there have been ever increasing incidents of this nature.

Not necessarily because you`re evil, have devious or anti-social thoughts about others, but because you`ve had bad experiences from the way you were treated, excluded and treated as strange and weird for your innocence and virtuous behaviour. When your thoughts are on a different plane and dimension to other folk you can become an object of ridicule that affects your emotional psyche, where social interaction is awkward and creates tension, because people don`t know or understand why you think like that. If you`re lucky you find a positive outlet from the humiliation and isolation that becomes part of your early life of study by taking up a sport where you`re part of a winning team and can channel your intellect and physique into something others can understand and accept you for. If you`re unlucky you become withdrawn and isolated into niche clubs of playing chess, understanding number patterns in nature, a science club or developing computer programs. Whether you`re lucky or unlucky depends on the chances and opportunities available and how much you can come outside of your comfort zone to take part in them with the support of those who can see the potential within you. Everyones got a skill, talent and ability to become accepted and part of our community and society, it`s within everyones interest that we encourage and support these attributes and qualities so each individual has that acceptance and inclusion, instead of becoming isolated and social misfits.

To be able to go into a store in the U.S. and buy a gun as easy as buying a sweater is insane.   I know the guns belonged to his mother. But the same objection applies to her being able to go to a store, or mail order, and buy weapons.  It's just insane!v1/comments/context/b17e9b10-8419-38fd-b416-9899d68bc506/comment/1355688332829-c26408bd-609e-4917-9087-508782febec9Oh hey Bobby!49 minutes agoI got a feeling this cowardly SOB is getting exactly the response he wanted by committing this unspeakable crime.......now the little nobody can be somebody and will go down in history as the monster he wanted to be remembered as.

He's being slotted into a nice neat stereotype that the American public can feel cumfortable with. "Look... another teenage gunman. Lets call him a loner and say he had poor social skills because everyone understands that... case closed." Its obviously far more complicated than that, and it is way too early for people to start jumping to conclusions.v1/comments/context/b17e9b10-8419-38fd-b416-9899d68bc506/comment/1355682817691-2865c3fc-ffa3-4b0a-aa76-b47215eed862Royalty2 hours 21 minutes agoYou can be as mad as you like without guns; or you can be as gun mad as you like without any nutters.Although, perhaps changing the law slightly would be a better more simpler answer.v1/comments/context/b17e9b10-8419-38fd-b416-9899d68bc506/comment/1355685738623-23f4f3d0-87f6-4f8d-a1af-c68c4f2dd6f7Poet1 hour 33 minutes agoCraig Nicholls fails to commentv1/comments/context/b17e9b10-8419-38fd-b416-9899d68bc506/comment/1355685523358-664807bf-0aa0-4c0a-8f41-079412b2fea8Poet1 hour 36 minutes agoIt is BENRIK that is the problem, BENRIK that has brought this on, BENRIK which has still gone around scammingv1/comments/context/b17e9b10-8419-38fd-b416-9899d68bc506/comment/1355686748947-e9a39082-38d7-4940-9469-4eba7cdf6579Billie1 hour 16 minutes agoThe whole thing is a sad sorry mess, obviously for those innocent children and teachers killed, it gets to all our hearts, and naturally all our sympathy goes to them, all totally innocent, no one deserving to die that way be they adult or child, yet all that stays in most peoples heart is total hate for the killer.  I can understand that and I am not excusing what the lad did, but had he not done this terrible deed, just how many people were willing to help him or even try and understand him.  My remark may well cause abusive answers from others, but prior to that awful day, one can only wish that someone had understood the guy that killed all those people, and perhaps then this terrible deed would not have been done.
