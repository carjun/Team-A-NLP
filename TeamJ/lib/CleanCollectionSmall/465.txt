Usually the subtext underlying the surface of the question is something like: "how can this be fair -- can anybody be evil enough to merit eternal punishment?" The Connecticut shooting of twenty innocent children for no reason by Adam Lanza (after shooting his mother in the face) demonstrates that the answer is a resounding "yes".Whether or not he was an autistic is irrelevant; mass murder of the most innocent among us requires both intelligent design and malice aforethought. Whether or not the initial reports that he was a weirdo goth gamer (like the Columbine murderers) are true, it gains him no quarter. While it has become quite clear that many video games are occultic, violent and perverted, Adam Lanza still made the free will choice to rationalize these heartless murders (while many gamers would not), and dodge any earthly consequences by killing himself.They will never be forgotten      Photo credit:        Alex Wong/Getty Images      Unless he repented between the time he squeezed off his final shot and his death, I see no reason he should escape hell after the mark he left on earth. As to the question of what we can do to discourage these kinds of events from happening in the future, it's very simple: we need to invite God back into our schools. The entire basis of driving God out of schools ("separation of church and state") is a phony, dreamed up by former Klansman and anti-Catholic bigot Justice Hugo Black in 1947. The writers of our Constitution had God in their schools every day, saw no problem with that, and saw a grand total of zero school massacres.What Jefferson referred to in his 1802 letter about "separation of church and state" (which Black shamelessly exploited) was keeping the Federal government from establishing a national denomination. In other words, God was never supposed to be "kept out" of anything in America.So-called "Progressives" (who are actually regressives) have been busily pushing the secularization of anything they can for about a hundred years now, and we're beginning to see more and more of the rotten fruits of their labors. If we don't drive them back and re-claim the freedoms that are part of our heritage, we can only expect more rotten fruit hereforward.
