It usually is printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. By 2007, there were 6580 daily newspapers in the world selling 395 million copies a day. The worldwide recession of 2008, combined with the rapid growth of web-based alternatives, caused a serious decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers closed or sharply retrenched operations.[1]A wide variety of material has been published in newspapers, including editorial opinions, criticism, persuasion and op-eds; obituaries; entertainment features such as crosswords, sudoku and horoscopes; weather news and forecasts; advice, food and other columns; reviews of movies, plays and restaurants; classified ads; display ads, television listings, inserts from local merchants, editorial cartoons and comic strips.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 20 points21 points22 points 1 year ago (0 children)[][deleted] 20 points21 points22 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onHow adorable!permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago (2 children)[][deleted] 5 points6 points7 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onStrange, my source tells me that "newspaper" refers to an old, old, wooden ship, from the Civil War era. permalinksaveparent[+]rockymountainoysters 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (1 child)[]rockymountainoysters 0 points1 point2 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onNo, that's the USS Constitution.
