Ryan= brother of gunman and son to dead mother. He was identified as the shooter early because he gave his brother his id for beer. He was NOT the shooter. He was questioned but has no involvement. The media is trying to cover their ass by saying "but he was in handcuffs!!!" But the lawsuit is coming. At least I hope so. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I was very tired and should have left it alone. That said, I do disagree with some of what you are saying, but I believe that you and I have firmly entrenched ideas regarding this. So I say, again, lets agree to disagree. My only point in this whole thing is that guns are the symptom, not the cure. I believe you see it as the cure, not the symptom. And that is ok. We can disagree. As long as we are both willing to listen, that is what debate is all about. permalinksavecontextfull commentsEditorial comic 1-12-11: Guns vs Mental Health Care  by  z0mbiel0vein  politics[+]holybatmanballs 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]holybatmanballs 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoIf you create a "gun free zone" it needs to be protected very well. A rancher doesn't leave livestock defenseless, why do we when we send children to school? permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]holybatmanballs -3 points-2 points-1 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]holybatmanballs -3 points-2 points-1 points 14 hours agoAlright cuntbag here goes. Criminals will do anything and everything up to and including manufacture of whatever is needed to get their hands on anything to make themselves feel bigger/better/ tougher than the next retarded thug asshole down the street. You take away guns from people like you and me. The next step is that thugs control the guns. Thug 2 will then resort to the next level to be strong. What is that? I don't know? Bombing? Maybe. More than likely it will be gun manufacturing. A lathe and an hour and you have it. Then there's more killing. But since it isn't large groups of people you will feel OK. CNN doesn't cover inner city murder so you won't care.Mentally ill people need help. Get them help first then you can come for guns. Let me guess... you are all for the decriminalization of marijuana because banning doesn't work? Same shit here. Bans do not work. All I wanted to do was go to bed and you had to go all whiny 5th grader on me. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]holybatmanballs -2 points-1 points0 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]holybatmanballs -2 points-1 points0 points 14 hours agoThe problem is cheap ass guns. If they were more expensive, less thugs would have them. The problem with this argument is the thug v. mentally ill issue. The mentally ill could snap at any moment and find the nearest weapon. Thugs have guns for power. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

But you and I will not agree on this so I think I will bid you an agree to disagree. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]holybatmanballs 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]holybatmanballs 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours agoGun bans only take the guns out of the hands of the law abiding citizen. It's an unfortunate reality of the situation. We need better mental health care. We need people to understand that people are people. Guns are only an instrument of destruction. The triggers are easy to pull, but it takes a disturbed individual to point the barrel at another human being. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

She finally admitted that she hasn't talked to the guy since middle school. Her head was bobbing "no" for every question about him.

Kid acts out... ADHD. Can't get along with others... autistic. We need to undo all of the laws that were made in the 80s that were made to keep mental diseased people in society. We can't put every one in a home, but something should be done. Forced evaluation, better access to healthcare... something. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

The actual person A kills person B via gun is astonishingly low. Way more than the energy used by people who want guns banned or what have you. I know your sarcasm was high, but I'm hoping that you will read what I said and see that guns are not really the problem , it is people, especially people with mental health issues. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

If you cannot see that a government, any government, can turn against the populace you are poorly mistaken. You are assuming everything will be the same as today. If one small thing changes in society, the guns can easily be turned on us. A sickness, electricity or energy shortage, anything could push a government over the edge. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
