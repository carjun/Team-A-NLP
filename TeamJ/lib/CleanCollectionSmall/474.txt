She had the children crawl into a storage room, and they locked the door and barricaded it with a file cabinet. There happened to be materials for coloring, "so we set them up with paper and crayons."After what she guessed was about an hour, officers came to the door and knocked, but those inside couldn't be sure."One of them slid his badge under the door, and they called and said, 'It's OK, it's the police,'" Jacob said.The well-liked principal, Dawn Hochsprung, was believed to be among the dead. A woman who worked at the school was wounded.Adam Lanza attended Newtown High School, and several news clippings from recent years mention his name among the honor roll students.At least one parent said Lanza's mother was a substitute teacher there. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.Lanza's older brother, 24-year-old Ryan Lanza, of Hoboken, New Jersey, was questioned, but a law enforcement official said he was not believed to have had a role in the rampage. Investigators were searching his computers and phone records, but he told law enforcement he had not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the unfolding investigation.A law enforcement official said a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols, and a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle were found in the school and a fourth weapon was found outside the school, and that investigators were going to shooting ranges and gun stores to see if Lanza had frequented themThe official was not authorized to discuss information with reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity.Adam Lanza and his mother lived in prosperous Newtown, about 60 miles northeast of New York City, where neighbors are doctors or hold white-collar positions at companies such as General Electric, Pepsi and IBM.Lanza's parents filed for divorce in 2008, according to court records. His father, Peter Lanza, lives in Stamford, Conn., and works as a tax director for General Electric.The gunman's aunt Marsha Lanza said her nephew was raised by kind, nurturing parents who would not have hesitated to seek mental help for him if he needed it."Nancy wasn't one to deny reality," Marsha Lanza said, adding her husband had seen Adam as recently as June and recalled nothing out of the ordinary.Catherine Urso, of Newtown, said her college-age son knew the killer and remembered him for his alternative style. "He just said he was very thin, very remote," she said.Previous1|2|3NextGet free daily or weekly news updates from CSMonitor.com delivered to your inbox. Sign up today.
