She added: "Today when the shooting started Vicki hid her kids in closets and when the gunman came into her room she said the class was in gym. She was then murdered. Not one of her students were harmed. Words can not express how heartbreaking and tragic this is. I will miss you dearly."She took a bullet for her kids.Teacher Victoria Soto used her body to shield her students from the maniacal gunman who launched a massacre at a Connecticut school, relatives said Saturday.Soto paid for her bravery with her life. But in doing so, the 27-year-old may have saved her first-graders from the murderous wrath of Adam Lanza  and became a hero.The family received information she was found shielding her students in a closet, Sotos cousin Jim Wiltsie told the Daily News. She put herself between the gunman and her students.Wiltsie said police told the family of Sotos bravery at Sandy Hook Elementary School.Im very proud to report she was a hero, said Wiltsie, who is a police officer in Fairfield, Conn. I would expect nothing less from Vicki. Instinctively her training kicked in. She did what she was trained to do, but also what her heart told her to do.PHOTOS: SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIMS Knowing this, said Wiltsie, has given the family a small measure of peace.Emotionally, its a lot to process all at once, he said. Its still surreal to the family that this happened.And the fact that Soto was slain just before Christmas has devastated them, he added.PHOTOS: SCENES OF TERROR FROM CONN. MASS SHOOTINGShe absolutely adored her family, a very close-knit family, Wiltsie said. She was the ringleader of the bunch. They had just done secret Santa. She always took charge.Soto lived with her parents, her sisters and a brother in Stratford, Conn. Home was a modest Cape Cod-style house in a blue-collar neighborhood. She was single, doted on her black Labrador, Roxy, and was a regular worshiper at the Lordship Community Church in Stratford.PHOTOS: REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF SANDY HOOKHer mom, Donna, has worked as a nurse at Bridgeport Hospital for 30 years. Her dad, Carlos, is a crane operator for the states Department of Transportation.Vicki, as everybody called her, was the apple of her fathers eye. And it was left to him to formally identify his daughters body.Jessica Hill/APJillian Soto, identified by USA Today, brakes down as she learns the news about her sister, Victoria Soto, who was killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.He always talked about her, said Gary Verbanic, who works with the heartbroken dad. He loved her like you wouldnt believe. Every time he spoke to her on the phone, he was cheerful.Im heartbroken, Verbanic added. She was an amazing person.Sotos next-door neighbor said the fetching brunette was so sweet.NAMES REVEALED: LIST OF VICTIMS KILLED IN CONN. SCHOOL SHOOTINGLANZA FAMILY GRIEF AT "LOSS OF INNOCENCE"When I hurt my back, she came over and shoveled my walkway, said George Henderson, 55. She didnt have to do that. She was a young lady. She had a whole lot going for her.Sotos only complaint, Henderson said, was about her long commute to the school in Newtown. Im so sad I wont hear her car cranking up every morning, he said.HERO TEACHER RESCUES STUDENTS FROM GUNMANSoto had been teaching at the school for five years  and was adored by her students. She called them her angels and delighted the little devil in them by sometimes chewing gum in class, which all the kids knew is a no-no at the school.No funeral arrangements have been made yet for Soto because her body has not been released. But Wilstie said he wants the world to know Vickis story now, before she is buried and forgotten.I want to get this out there, he said. Instead of her just being a statistic or number on a piece of paper, I want people to know Vickis story and put a face behind what she did for those kids.csiemaszko@nydailynews.comPost a Comment CommentsSee All Comments[Discussion Guidelines                                                        ]To post your comments, please, Sign in                                                         .
