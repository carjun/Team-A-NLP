How, if at all, does the team see the games in the series connected, other than thematically?

I'm much more a fan of SPECIAL, GURPS and systems such as Arcanum's custom ruleset.And given how dialogue-heavy Planescape was, it would be interesting to see what they come up with. Say, for example, speech was broken down into several subcategories; knowledge, bluffing, dialect etc.  permalinksavecontextfull comments14272829My flatmates make needlessly complex meals that decimate the kitchen.

Im older than I was when I worked on Torment, and my questions now are different than they were. I have children now, and I look at the world through their eyes and through mine, and thats changed me  in fact, the intervening years have changed me so much that I have new answers for the central story in the original Torment. So now that I know what can change the nature of a man, I ask: What does one life matter?  and does it matter at all?Then Id re-examine the fundamentals of the setting. Id put it someplace other than Planescape (and Ill explain why in a followup). Id use a system other than D&D, because Id want to align the players story axes along different lines than Good/Evil or Law/Chaos to something more subjective. The core of Torment is, after all, a personal story, and while we can be judged by others on the basis of our actions, arbitrarily aligning those actions on an external and eternally fixed line removes some of the agency from the players game.I have a lot of ideas about what to put into a new Torment game, but my primary goal would be to help the player tell a story that was evocative of the original Torment without aping it. To be faithful to the odyssey of the Nameless One, and to recognize that it has ended, and that stories of Torment are ongoing.As all of you probably know by now, Brian Fargo's company InXile has acquired the rights to the Torment IP. It has also been known that Colin McComb is working on this project. And now Gamebanshee reports that Kevin Saunders, who was the project director on Mask of the Betrayer, has been hired by InXile in the same role - according to Kevin's own Formspring post:Are you working at InXile now then?Yes! I was contracting at inXile in November, but have recently joined full time as a project director. Its great to be involved in RPGs again and I love the route inXile is taking  making games directly for the players. It allows us to explore ideas and gameplay that many, including us, are passionate about, but that arent mainstream enough for the big publishers (with Wasteland 2 as an obvious example =) ).Ill be leading the development of the next game. The writers are finishing up their roles on WL2 and we want to keep that talented group together. Also, by the time WL2 is completed next fall, well want preproduction done for the next game so that the development team can rollover to it (after a well-deserved break, of course!). You need different size teams at various points in a project, and having multiple projects in development is important to allow you to keep your team together. So its time to plan for whats next!Given what we know already, it is, I believe, safe to assume that Kevin is going to be the project director on the new, yet unannounced Torment game, bringing his Mask of the Betrayer experience to the table. Now if they just hired George Ziets too, mmm...Chris Avellone>Like many other gaming news sites, Eurogamer has reported on the big Codex scoop from yesterday. Unlike the rest of them, they also have some exclusive information. Colin McComb told Eurogamer:"As you may recall, Chris [Avellone] mentioned his ideas for a spiritual successor to Torment with some frequency over the summer. This stemmed (at least in part) from discussions he and I were having about the possibility of resurrecting the IP, and this led to my reaching out to Wizards of the Coast. That did not yield fruit, but it did get the two of us talking about what we'd like to see in any regard, and we both agreed that Planescape was not the best route for us to take anyway, due to the mechanical issues and editorial oversight WotC would want."The Project: Eternity Kickstarter took them in a different direction than a direct successor. I told Chris that I would not work on a Torment successor without his approval. We talked about it for a bit, and he told me that he was entirely comfortable with me moving forward on a Torment game without him, and he gave me his explicit blessing to do it."Right now he's incredibly involved with Project: Eternity, and I do not want to distract him from a project that is incredibly important to his company. With that said, I would be happy - no, wait, overjoyed - to have him on board in any capacity whatsoever."permalinksavecontextfull commentsBrian Fargo & InExile have quietly acquired the 'Torment' IP.  by  Goldenboy451in  projecteternity[+]Goldenboy451[S] 4 points5 points6 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]Goldenboy451[S] 4 points5 points6 points 11 days agoI think that's the plan. And the nature of the Planes lends itself to new settings anyway.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBrian Fargo & InExile have quietly acquired the 'Torment' IP.  by  Goldenboy451in  projecteternity[+]Goldenboy451[S] 7 points8 points9 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]Goldenboy451[S] 7 points8 points9 points 11 days agoMy understanding:The Planescape campaign setting was discontinued shortly after the game was released, and Wizards of the Coast have, seemingly, no intention of bringing it back. As a result, they're wary of allowing for the setting to be used again in other mediums, such as games.In order to get around this, by buying the 'Torment' brand, they'll be able to produce a non-Planescape-based sequel, which could continue the themes of the game. So lets say that (simply for examples sake), they had the licence to create a Forgotten Realms game, they could develop 'Forgotten Realms: Torment' as a sequel to 'Planescape: Torment'.tl;dr - The subtitle is now the title. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBrian Fargo & InExile have quietly acquired the 'Torment' IP.  by  Goldenboy451in  projecteternity[+]Goldenboy451[S] 4 points5 points6 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]Goldenboy451[S] 4 points5 points6 points 11 days agoDefinitely. New universe, same themes, and presumably a new incarnation of Ravel.Although I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed about the lack of Placescape; although given that WotC have abandoned that setting, I think we're unlikely to see further developments. permalinksavecontextfull comments20495051Brian Fargo & InExile have quietly acquired the 'Torment' IP.
