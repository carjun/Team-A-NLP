Much easier to "control" weapons. Not to mention their people are far more "peaceful" and law abiding than Americans. America has far more violent crime than any other country, be it shootings, rape, beatings, etc etc. It's not a gun issue, it's a people issue.permalinksaveparent[+]soline 2 points3 points4 points 23 minutes ago (1 child)[]soline 2 points3 points4 points 23 minutes agoEach state can't control it's own gun laws? Have you ever tried to buy a hedgehog in a state where it's illegal. it's fucking impossible and the consequences are death to the animal. The govt and states can control what they feel they should control. permalinksaveparent[+]fedupwith 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]fedupwith 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes agoThere's over 300 million firearms in circulation in the US. How many hedgehogs are there in one state where it's illegal?permalinksaveparent[+]nwestnine 1 point2 points3 points 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]nwestnine 1 point2 points3 points 19 minutes agoPer capita, there are worse countries like South Africa.  Despite its geographic size, Japan's population is about 1/3 of the US and has had as few as 2 gun murders per year (Chicago had two this past Sunday).The people are also a problem.  One of the biggest problems is that American culture sees shooting people as a solution to problems.permalinksaveparent[+]pefyeah 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]pefyeah 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoAmerica does not have far more violent crime than anywhere else. We are right in the middle with most developed countries. permalinksaveparent[+]Apparatii -1 points0 points1 point 57 minutes ago (1 child)[]Apparatii -1 points0 points1 point 57 minutes ago"That sounds hard, better not try it."permalinksaveparent[+]skike 1 point2 points3 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]skike 1 point2 points3 points 10 minutes agoI'm all ears to hear your solution to literally removing the millions and millions of guns in America.  All of them.  Not just the ones that law abiding citizens legally own, but all the illegal ones also.  Please, enlighten us.  EDIT: A letter.permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 -2 points-1 points0 points 58 minutes ago (1 child)[]KKN50 -2 points-1 points0 points 58 minutes agoSure it's easier than it would be here, but that doesn't mean more of an effort could be made here.  I think if we made stricter gun laws and enforced them more strictly, we would see a change.  But nobody knows for sure, since nobody has even tried.  So why not try?  It sure wouldn't make things worse!permalinksaveparent[+]fedupwith 1 point2 points3 points 20 minutes ago (0 children)[]fedupwith 1 point2 points3 points 20 minutes agoNew York - virtual ban on firearms, Chicago - same, Washington DC - same. What are the gun crime rates in these places? Highest in the country.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
