Authorities did not say what type of gun he used on Nancy Lanza, 52.The fact that a type of assault weapon  federally banned until 2004  was used to kill 6- and 7-year-old children, renewed debate on gun control in Connecticut and Washington.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) pledged Sunday that she would introduce new gun-control legislation at the beginning of next year's congressional session.AlsoWho they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsPhoto:Connecticut school shootingSchool shooting: How do you tell a child his protectors are dead?See more stories XFor victims of Jewish center shooting, massacre renews their pain Connecticut shooter would 'just shut down' in high schoolFeinstein, a leading figure in the passage of a 1994 bill that banned assault weapons, said her legislation would be a renewed version of the original to get "weapons of war off the streets of our cities."On CBS' "Face the Nation," Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, said even his state's strict gun laws were not enough.PHOTOS: Connecticut school shooting "These are assault weapons. You don't hunt deer with these things," Malloy said. "And I think that's the question that a lot of people are going to have to resolve in their own minds. Where should this line get drawn?"Closer to home, guns were the talk at Sacred Heart Church, just east of Newtown. With a crowd of worshipers spilling outside into the vestibule, Pastor Joseph "Father Joe" Donnelly lamented that violence had become "such a pervasive part of our culture.""Assault weaponry?" Donnelly asked, his voice etched with outrage. "Who needs that in their house?"May this particular tragedy and this particular Christmas come together to accomplish something we have been talking about for decades, and maybe we just might be able to do it."He said his flock had peppered him with the inevitable, confounding question: Why did God let this happen? He explained that God endowed humans with free will."You and I have to live with other people's freedom to do good and evil," he said. "Where is the good God in the middle of all of this? He is weeping with us. He is weeping with Sandy Hook."So was the nation. Grief counselors and child psychologists from all over the country gathered at Reed Intermediate School in Newtown to console families.In one of the school's brightly lit art class rooms, three volunteers in red T-shirts set out paint brushes, arranged stuffed animals and spread out puzzle pieces decorated with candy canes for children to put back together.While the children played, parents talked through the effects of the shooting with mental health professionals and were given techniques to help their children handle their grief and fear. Just two days earlier, many of the same children huddled in classrooms, closets and bathrooms as a gunman hunted down their classmates."Playing helps them maintain a sense of normalcy amid all the chaos," said Ken Murdoch, who has lived in Newtown for nearly 20 years and helped set up the room. "They can still have their childhood."Murdoch is the chief information officer for Save the Children, an international aid organization based in Westport, Conn., that sponsored the playroom. The organization delivers food to children and, in times of disasters, sets up child-care rooms like this one where children can briefly escape the traumatic events around them.He never thought he would be doing this in his hometown."My heart bleeds for these kids," Murdoch said.Jeanne-Aimee De Marrais, who played with children over the weekend here and is director of U.S. emergency programs for Save the Children, said that many children came into the sunny room looking "closed off" and "shut down." But once they started to play, "the weight lifted off."Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Timesprevious123next|  single pageComments121Comments (121)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQcrusader4commonsense at 7:54 AM December 19, 2012                One thing I DO NOT find in common with ALL these shootings...how the gun did it itself. One thing I DO find in common with ALL these shootings...how EVERYONE always says things like, "we knew he was nuts", or "we knew he was a ticking time bomb & would eventually kill". What I DO NOT hear you idiots advocating new bans on guns saying....How you are going to protect the rest of us from deranged and unstable people who will use whatever they can find to kill children. Where is the blame going to lie when we have another whacko use things that aren't guns? Who will you blame then? Will you cancel out the internet so they can't find their weapons recipes? How about as parents, if you have a sick child, YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Don't whine to me how it's not fair to patients who have these problems. Try explaining to the families of 20 children how your kids right to exist in a normal life trumps the rest of our rights to live without fear. Ask why it was taking so long for this mother to lock him up. THAT'S who you can blame for this. As the victim of a violent gun crime, I may be one of the few on here who can speak about what a victim feels. Not once did I ever want guns taken away from anyone. What I did want, an explanation as to why someone who was known to be that violent was out on the street to begin with. Ban the crazies, not the guns.Milquetoast at 1:17 AM December 19, 2012                You talk about how no one can ever TAKEaway the LEGAL weapons in America, and thatthe Second Amendment guarantees this RIGHT ...but what if the legal guns were suddenly deemedILLEGAL?Like the illegal children of illegal citizens weresuddenly .. somehow .. deemed .. L E G A L ?HMMMMMM?We've seen that happen recently, uh - haven't we?And why? Because, as the one who said he would useHIS power to affect change NOW, he just thought thatit was the right thing to do THEN! And NOW we're paying for the education of illegals.FEELS GOOD, don't it?NEVER LET A GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE!Australia was only able to buy back 20% of the weaponsthey were seeking, about 700,000 of them.Obama, thanks to his "Broke Back" policies, has no money. Did you think he was going to TAKE those guns away?I'd like to see him try.And did you think an armed American population would be effectively pounded back by the U.S. military?I've got news for you: In the long runa roguegovernment can NEVER beat the American people.We have a hard enough time with just the Taliban.Remember, it's WE THE PEOPLE ...not WE THE GOVERNMENT.This is one thing Obama is not going to "deem" so.LJP305 at 8:04 AM December 18, 2012                Too many Americans -- men in particular -- have an unhealthy obsession with guns.  Closing the gun show loophole, implementing better background checks on  would be gun purchasers, longer waiting periods for gun purchases to  ensure info submitted on purchase applications is correct and limiting  high capacity magazines are reasonable ways to control and further  regulate gun purchases in the US.Govt in America has never tried to come after our legally possessed weapons, and no Govt in America ever will! The 2nd Amendment wasn't written with any thoughts of protecting Citizens' access to military-type assault rifles enabling purchasers to fire several rounds/min. I challenge anyone who supports Citizens' access to military-type assault rifles to name a single time in our history when Citizens' access to assault rifles kept a single Govt agency from coming after legally possessed guns in America or protected families members safe in their homes from intruders or elsewhere from criminals.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
