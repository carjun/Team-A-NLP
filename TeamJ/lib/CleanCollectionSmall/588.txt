Click to watch videoThe Daily was one of the first apps I downloaded after I finally purchased an iPad. I got the free trial and read every page of the first issue. But when it came time to cough up for a subscription... well, let's just say no thanks.Don't get me wrong, I loved the idea. But I'll confess I didn't read it every day. And after a while, I forgot I even had the app.Obviously I wasn't the only one unwilling to pay for The Daily's content. A few months ago, the editor-in-chief reported 100,000 subscribers as he denied rumors of The Daily's demise.Compare that to The Wall Street Journal Digital Network, which counts more than 1.3 million paid subscribers.Now if you were hoping to read The Daily before its final issue on December 15, you may be out of luck. The app has already been removed from the iTunes store.Post by: CNN Writer, Melissa Hassett Filed under: Personal musingsTechnologyNovember 20th, 201211:05 AM ETShare this on:FacebookTwitterDiggdel.icio.usredditMySpaceStumbleUponComments (2 comments)On the future of news Imagine news as a filter in the age of information overload.News Stream producer Ravi Hiranand recently spoke to The Verge on the future of TV news:"A TV news show has a finite length. So I cant show you every single photo of Superstorm Sandys power. I have to select the most powerful ones, the most important ones, and I can try to explain to people who might not necessarily know anything about New York why a particular image is so striking."If you too are a media junkie, read on. It's a great discussion piece.http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3652794/future-of-tv-news/in/3404219Post by: CNN Anchor and Correspondent, Kristie Lu Stout Filed under: News Stream ephemeraTechnologyNovember 15th, 201202:40 PM ETShare this on:FacebookTwitterDiggdel.icio.usredditMySpaceStumbleUponComments (Add comment)China's "effective second fiddle?" Chinajust had its own November of change.Earlier Thursday in Beijing, an elite group of seven men were named to the Politburo Standing Committee - the top decision-making body of the Chinese Communist Party.A lothas beenreported already on Xi Jinping, the new General-Secretary of the Party and the presumed next President of China. But what about Li Keqiang, the man destined tobe China's next Prime Minister?Click to watch videoToday on News Stream, I spoke to Victor Gao - a former top official in the Chinese Foreign Ministry (and English interpreter for the late Deng Xiaoping) about Li and the prospects for reform in China. Gao saidthe leader has some powerful patrons but must learn to be an "effectivesecond fiddle" to Xi Jinping. As for change, theStanding Committeeas a group must come up with solutions for new problems.Achieving both stability and solutions in an ever-dynamic and demanding China.It will bedelicate dance forChina's new leadership.Post by: CNN Anchor and Correspondent, Kristie Lu Stout Filed under: ChinaNovember 14th, 201206:36 PM ETShare this on:FacebookTwitterDiggdel.icio.usredditMySpaceStumbleUponComments (1 comment)Will there really be change in China? On Thursday, the curtain will lift on China's new leaders. That's when we expect to see Xi Jinping emerge as the Communist Party chief.But don't expect any big changes. At least not in the next five years.Willy Lam is a China scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He says, "Xi Jinping is a good guy. Hes a consensus candidate. Hes also willing to work with different factions so thats why he was chosen. However, he is not a visionary or charismatic figure. So particularly in his first term, when he hasnt yet consolidated his power base, he will toe the line given to him."For more about factions and the roadblocks to reform, watch the whole interview below.Click to watch videoPost by: CNN Writer, Melissa Hassett Filed under: ChinaNovember 13th, 201202:16 PM ETShare this on:FacebookTwitterDiggdel.icio.usredditMySpaceStumbleUponComments (Add comment)"It's the party's business" Thatrare once-in-a-decade leadership transition, or the 18th Party Congress,is still taking place in Beijing.It's a major political moment in the world's most populous country. But what do the people of China make of it?I posed the question to social commentator and author Lijia Zhang, and her answer is one big collective shrug:"Many ordinary people don't feel so excited or joyful about what's happening. It's the party's business and has nothing to do with us."Click on for the full interview.Click to watch videoPost by: CNN Anchor and Correspondent, Kristie Lu Stout Filed under: ChinaNovember 9th, 201207:12 AM ETShare this on:FacebookTwitterDiggdel.icio.usredditMySpaceStumbleUponComments (Add comment)The resurgence of Jiang Zemin I spoke to CSIS Senior Adviser Chris Johnson about how China's leadership transition will affect the U.S.- China relationship.But I was particularly intrigued by his final thoughts of the lingering presence of Jiang Zemin and what is says about governance in China.Commenting on the powerthe ex-leader of China still wields, Johnson says:"He has a considerable amount of influence as we're about to see a week from today when the new leadership lineupis rolled out. All indications are that several people who have close ties to Jiang Zeminwill be promoted into the Politburo Standing Committee.""There's been substantial rumor (when I was in Beijing last week I heard a lot about this) he's playing a huge role behind the scenes... interestingly, not just in personnel but also on policy. He's been pushingfor a more reformist tone to Hu Jintao's Work Report that was delivered yesterday, and dressing up his involvement in the personnel process as a criticism of the lack of reform and movement especially in the economic space during the last 10 years of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao's leadership.""So I think we're going to continue to see Jiang's influence felt strongly. It's sign the system still has a lot of work to do in terms of its political maturation - that an 86-year oldwho effectively hasn't been in office for 10 years has that much power andinfluence over the new lineup."If you have a moment, please watch the full clip below:Click to watch videoPost by: CNN Anchor and Correspondent, Kristie Lu Stout Filed under: ChinaOctober 31st, 201203:49 PM ETShare this on:FacebookTwitterDiggdel.icio.usredditMySpaceStumbleUponComments (2 comments)New Star Wars to be done by Disney Like it or not, there will be new Star Wars films.

At the time, 23 states had issued a Warning or Advisory for wind related to Sandys circulation.The storm is expected to make landfall later Monday evening.Based on pressure, Sandy is likely to be the strongest storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.When it hits, Sandy will be undergoing a transition from a "tropical cyclone" to a "wintertime cyclone." Mari Ramos explains the difference.Click to watch videoSandys field of tropical storm-force or greater winds extends nearly 6201,600 kilometers (1000 miles). That's roughly twice the size of the U.S. state of Texas.To put it another way, if that wind field were a country, it would be the 20th largest country in the world.Post by: CNN Writer, Melissa Hassett Filed under: DataGeneralWeather older postsAbout this showCatch News Stream with Kristie Lu Stout weekdays at 9pm HKT/ 1pm GMT / 8am ET on CNN International.Follow This Blog TwitterFacebook.On Twitter Gracias @calycaffafa#FFFF a los periodistas q valen OR@MariRamosCNNN@CNNMexe@aristeguicnnn@alejandraoraaa@LuciaCNNN@cafecnnn@dianna020505 MariRamosCNN1:29 pm ET December 14, 2012RETWEETThanks :) @AllyCNNNN: TGI Friday#FFF@mariejenkinsn@MariRamosCNNN@dimagnayCNNN@paulineCNNN@AliVelshih@TarnimususMariRamosCNN1:28 pm ET December 14, 2012RETWEETThe #starwars advent calendar is kinda cool, if a bit clone wars heavy.
