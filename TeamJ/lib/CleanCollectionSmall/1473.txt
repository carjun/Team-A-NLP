That was a passion. The whole family would go together.Nancy Lanza wound up being the first of her sons 27 victims when he used one of her guns to shoot her dead.Holmes, who often mowed the grass at the Lanzas sprawling Newtown home, said the doomed mom was proud of her arsenal and once showed him a big, beautiful rifle she had just purchased.She was very proud of it, he said. She loved her guns."It wasnt immediately clear whether this was the .223-caliber Bushmaster that was found in the trunk of Nancy Lanzas car after her son murdered six staffers and 20 innocent students at the Sandy Hook Elementary School.Lanza, 20, used a Glock 9-mm. handgun and a SIG Sauer handgun to kill all those people  and then end his own miserable life.GUNMAN OPENS FIRE AT CONN. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, KILLS 26COPS SEARCH FOR MOTIVE AS NEWTOWN, CONN. MOURNS SLAINKEVIN P. COUGHLIN/FlyingDogPhotos.comAn aerial view of the scene at and near the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.Shannon Hicks/Newtown Bee via APPeople flee Sandy Hook Elementary School after a gunman opened fire early Friday.ADAM LANZA, 20-YEAR-OLD KILLER, WAS A 'DEEPLY DISTURBED' KIDPHOTOS: SCENES OF TERROR OUTSIDE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY MASSACREWhen Lanza attended Newtown High School, he stood out from his classmates by adopting a uniform of khaki pants, short-sleeved button-down shirts  complete with plastic pocket protector. He also toted his books in a black briefcase.Lanza wore black Friday when he staged the massacre Sandy Hook, topping off his ensemble with body armor. It was not known if that too belonged to his mom  or if Lanza bought it specially for the slaughtering.A day after a mass murder that brought President Obama and the nation to tears  and sparked renewed calls for gun control from Democrats and shooting survivors  there were still many holes in the already disturbing portrait of the killer.Lanza and his older brother Ryan, 24, were reportedly driven hard to succeed academically by their mother. But while Lanza was in many ways as brilliant and bright as his big brother, he didnt cut the cord from his mother.Ryan Lanza lived in Hoboken, N.J. His brother never left the nest  or his mother.Holmes said Nancy Lanza was warm and affectionate and described her as a very smart business woman who also like hand-crafted beer. But she was often at a loss about what to do about her younger son, he said.She knew he was smart, book smart, the landscaper said. But he was very odd.She mentioned that Adam had a water phobia, Holmes recalled. He was afraid of the water. She wanted him to get swimming lessons and he just wouldnt.Lanza also didnt like to leave the house. Last year, his mom took his older brother to New Orleans to see the famous trombone player Troy Andrews, aka Trombone Shorty, said Holmes.I asked, Why isnt Adam going? he said. She just said he likes to stay home alone. That's what he wanted.""He was home alone a lot. He wanted to be.LinkedInPeter Lanza, the killer's father, who learned of the murders from a reporter.There have been reports that Lanza was suffering from a type of autism called Aspergers syndrome.Police said Lanza killed his 54-year-old mom on Friday in the 3,100-square-foot estate they shared before taking her car and driving over to Sandy Hook.Nancy Lanza reportedly taught there for a time, but Lanzas reason for targetting that school  and killing all those kids  continued to mystify investigators.Lanzas dad, Peter, a successful financial services expert, was divorced from his mother. But it was the dad who reportedly took the divorce hard. And he made sure his ex, and his kids, were well provided for.Peter Lanza was paying his ex annual alimony payments that started at $240,000 and would have reached $298,800 in 2015. He left her the family home before he decamped for Stamford.How Lanza reacted to his parents divorce was also unclear, but a family insider told The Daily News after the killings that they were lovely, very generous people who were very kind to each other during the divorce.Friends of the Lanza family said his mother kept the future killer busy with other activities like the Boy Scouts, as well as the shooting.Lanza, like many young boys of his generation collected Pokemon cards and played violent PlayStation video games like Dynasty Warriors, where animated characters waged brutal battles with an array of weapons.While not an outcast, Lanza kept his distance from other kids, who described him as quiet, as shy, as weird.Adam Lanza has been a weird kid since we were 5 years old, neighbor and former classmate Tim Dalton wrote on Twitter. As horrible as this was, I cant say I am surprise... Burn in hell, Adam.
