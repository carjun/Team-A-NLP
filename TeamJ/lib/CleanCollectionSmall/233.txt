The news reporter's cut a lot of parts from the recordings. And you can tell the parents are holding in there tears.I know because I've been on camera for the news for a horrible tragedy and they cut a lot of scenes. And when they played it, they didn't show were I was crying but you could tell I wanted to just like this mother. So many of you are so judgmental. You'll never know what its like unless your in there shoes. And the pain and grief doesn't just kick in.....Reply 2 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate 1027anceleste's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate 1027anceleste's comment.Sign inAll Comments (132)RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Userextremeshaytardsfan1                13 minutes agoI wanna mail letters 2 family's that r suffering from this letters 2 try getting them 2 Feel a little better 2 know people do careReply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate extremeshaytardsfan1's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate extremeshaytardsfan1's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Userbryza7210bl86                14 minutes agoGod bless ,America wake up.in Switzerland they have gun laws tht gets results.

America, has this not taught you anything? Put a ban on the purchase of guns and ammunition. This accident could of been avoided, let's make sure no one EVER has to go through something like This EVER again.
