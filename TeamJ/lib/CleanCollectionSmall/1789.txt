So there's a chance I get screwed on this game.permalinksavecontextfull comments3234[WDIS] Shonn Greene, Reggie Bush, Lance Moore (self.fantasyfootball)submitted 13 hours ago by JonBravo80 to fantasyfootball4 commentssharecancelloading...[WDIS] Torrey Smith or Joique Bell.  by  TheOneAndOnlyHOin  fantasyfootball[+]JonBravo80 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]JonBravo80 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoI would go Bell. I don't see Smith having a big day against Denver, especially if he has Champ Bailey on him for a lot of the game. I think Bell has a better chance of getting you mid-range points.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I think its safe to say at this point that the Lions are, in fact, not a good team. Sure they have a few individual stars, but when you go 4-8 it sounds foolish to make that argument.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGame Thread: Philadelphia Eagles (3-8) at Dallas Cowboys (5-6)  by  toilettingin  nfl[+]JonBravo80 2 points3 points4 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]JonBravo80 2 points3 points4 points 12 days agoOver/Under: 6.5 mentions of Andy Reid's future with the Eagles?permalinksavecontextfull commentswouldn't it be more logical to be called the green gang?
