I think most of the parents can afford it. I'm not saying "oh fuck, they can afford the funeral" because I know your intention was about alleviating the stress and heartache and not just the financial. BUT, in that regard, maybe a fund for a cause that directly benefits children would be appropriate? In the name of those that died. Or even to set up a memorial. Or a donation to the school. Or possibly a fund to help with the mental health of the students who are alive, to cope? I don't know. Instead of putting it into individual's hands who may not need it, I can see it being used towards a greater awareness and communal good. permalinksaveparent[+]dih_key 10 points11 points12 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]dih_key 10 points11 points12 points 21 hours agoI would be fine with the money going towards a memorial, better security, funeral costs, therapy costs, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]Anglewings -3 points-2 points-1 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Anglewings -3 points-2 points-1 points 21 hours agoI think Obama said the government would cover the costs. Or at least implied it.permalinksaveparent[+]CharliePancakes  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]CharliePancakes -6 points-5 points-4 points 14 hours agoJust go fuck yourself. I know reddit hates that they aren't all fucking billionaires but this isn't the time nor the place. I'm sorry you detest that foufymaus has empathy and wants to help people who lost something that is worth more than all the wealth in the world.permalinksaveparent[+]HyperbolicChamber  comment score below threshold (4 children)[]HyperbolicChamber -6 points-5 points-4 points 21 hours agoI understand what you are saying, but they aren't going to profit off of their children's funeral. If they can afford it themselves they will do something good with the money. It's very appropriate to donate the money to them and let them do what seems fit.permalinksaveparent[+]menomenaa 9 points10 points11 points 21 hours ago*(3 children)[]menomenaa 9 points10 points11 points 21 hours ago*I don't think you really understood what I said, if you think my post was about how they'd profit from the funeral costs being covered.....? I'm saying it's a gesture that might not end up having a benefactor because the money isn't needed. If a millionaire is given 20 dollars, who cares? If a homeless man is given 20 dollars, that means a A LOT. I know that's a really hyperbolic analogy, but what if the same amount of money could afford hiring a second child psychologist at the school for a couple of years? Or a grief counselor? My point is that that money can have a significant impact on a wide range of people in the community, much more so than the money sitting in a bank account of people who don't really need to touch it. Yes, it's "appropriate" to give money. I was commenting on the logic of it, and suggesting another idea. permalinksaveparent[+]HyperbolicChamber -2 points-1 points0 points 20 hours ago (2 children)[]HyperbolicChamber -2 points-1 points0 points 20 hours agoI do see what you are saying, and I think you are right, but I would just suggest letting the parents and families decide what to do with the money and experience the healing power of actually doing something good from a tradgedy, let them help people instead of us. permalinksaveparent[+]menomenaa 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]menomenaa 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours agoI have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. I don't really feel like talking about it anymore. You think a family that just lost their child to murder needs the "healing power" of giving to charity? And if nice strangers did something good for the community they would somehow be derailed from this magical power you've asserted exists? Whatever. I kind of think you're just disagreeing to disagree. permalinksaveparent[+]HyperbolicChamber -1 points0 points1 point 18 hours ago (0 children)[]HyperbolicChamber -1 points0 points1 point 18 hours agoI'm sorry I've offended you. I'm not trying to be an ass. I just feel like we shouldn't treat them differently because it's a wealthy area. I live in a wealthy area. Not everyone is automatically wealthy for living there. Donate to the families, let them do what they want with it. permalinksaveparent[+]seabucksrule  comment score below threshold (5 children)[]seabucksrule -6 points-5 points-4 points 20 hours agoFunerals cost at LEAST $10k and you have to put up the money immediately. Even wealthy families may not have that kind of money around.permalinksaveparent[+]menomenaa 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (4 children)[]menomenaa 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoWait..what? You think wealthy families don't have $10,000 in savings? I'm sorry but...what?It feels crass talking about this detail, especially in the given thread, but I know people from similar towns in Connecticut that get more than that as allowance per month. I think it's spoiled and disgusting, but I know people that have hundreds out of thousands in savings. To say that "wealthy families don't have 10k" is a bit odd. Also, funerals have longer-term payment options. Why do you think funerals are the only industry that require cash, in-full?And how do feel so confident stating complete lies as fact? You're entire comment is bullshit and you're touting it as if everything you've said is a given. permalinksaveparent[+]Silverbug -1 points0 points1 point 19 hours ago (2 children)[]Silverbug -1 points0 points1 point 19 hours agoThe people you're talking about probably have their kids in a private school.  From my understanding, this was a public elementary.  Don't knock people wanting to do something in the face of this tragedy because your limited experience suggests that everyone from small town Connecticut has money.permalinksaveparent[+]menomenaa 2 points3 points4 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]menomenaa 2 points3 points4 points 19 hours agoTo live in an area with such a great public school system, you do generally need to be in a very specific tax bracket. Newtown is one of those places. Also, he said "wealthy people don't have $10k in cash." I was saying they do. They don't have to be from Connecticut, I was just refuting that fact. I drew the parallel that the wealthy people I know happened to be from CT just to make it more relevant. permalinksaveparent[+]Silverbug 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]Silverbug 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoI wasn't refuting the wealthy people don't have $10k accessible, they usually do.  I was just saying that living in a wealthy zip code doesn't mean everyone in that zip code is wealthy.  I appreciate your response, but this branch is detracting from the conversation that was going on about doing something to support the families in their grief.permalinksaveparent[+]monkdick  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]monkdick -7 points-6 points-5 points 18 hours agoWait..what?

Sorry, but your comment really pissed me off. Yes, let's just assume they're all rich. :/permalinksaveparent[+]menomenaa 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours ago (13 children)[]menomenaa 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours agoHaha okay. So my suggestion that we could donate money to help ALL the kids in the community (therefore benefitting the kids that you're talking about, who aren't that wealthy) THAT suggestion really pissed you off? My point was that direct monetary charity isn't as beneficial in wealthy towns, generally. Please don't call me a fuckwit. You're assuming things about me, while asserting that I've made too many assumptions. I really hope berating people gets you super far in life. permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 18 hours ago (12 children)[][deleted] 18 hours ago[deleted]permalinksaveparent[+]menomenaa 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (11 children)[]menomenaa 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago....what the fuck is wrong with you?
