I bought that car with my hard earned money working for a neighboring farmer. We lived on dirt roads and needless to say I treated it like a truck! That was the toughest most badass car I've ever owned. I hit a deer doing 105mph trying to make it home for curfew. I rebuilt that car by myself for $300 by pulling my own parts in junk yards. Some friends and i used to jump this car on old backroads. We are talking 70mph 6ft high jumps. I miss that car!Edit: I paid $1000 dollars for it and it had 135,000 miles on it. It is now sitting in my dads pasture with approximately 205,000 miles.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI need to do a survey for my statistics class, largest sample size gets to skip midterms.
