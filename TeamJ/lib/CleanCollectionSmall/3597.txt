Those findings were released from the Connecticut State Chief Medical Examiner, who was doing autopsies on the shooter, Adam Lanza, 20, and his mother, Nancy.Also Sunday, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said on televised news shows that the gunman committed suicide as first responders closed in.PHOTOS:Latest from the scene| Shooting victims |Mass shootingsMORE: How it happened map |Tips for talking to kids | Latest videos |Complete coverage"We surmise that it was during the second classroom episode that he heard responders coming and apparently at that, decided to take his own life," Malloy said.Lanza blasted his way into the building and used a high-power rifle to kill his victims, including the principal who tried to stop him, authorities said.Speaking on NBC's "Meet The Press" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a high-profile advocate of gun control, said "it only happens in America. And it happens again and again. We've just got to stop this. We don't need military assault weapons with big magazines on the streets of our cities."Bloomberg called for new legislation banning assault weapons with large magazines. And he called for a law that would close a loophole that allows people to buy and sell weapons at gun shows without undergoing background checks.Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a Mineola Democrat, whose husband was killed and son wounded during an assault on passengers on a Long Island Rail Road train in 1993, said on CNN that President Barack Obama needs to deliver on his Friday call for "meaningful action" on gun control."The attitudes of the American people are a little bit different than they were on Friday," she said. "We have more guns in this country than any other civilized nation. It should have been done when Gabby Giffords was shot."Meanwhile, investigators said they are still trying to determine the motive behind the shooting."I am confident we will put every single resource we have into this investigation and will answer every question possible by the conclusion of this case," said Lt. J. Paul Vance of the Connecticut State Police, at a news conference Sunday. "We have the best of the best working on this case.""It's a huge case," he said. "We're using every single resource. Our goal is to paint a complete picture so that the public knows what went on here."Vance also warned Sunday that there were threatening postings on social media websites from people posing as the deceased shooter.Vance said at a news conference: "One thing that's starting to become a concern -- misinformation posted on social media sites, from people posing as the shooter, using other IDs, mimicking this crime and crime scene . . . there's been some things in somewhat of a threatening manner."It's important to note that we have discussed this with federal authorities -- these things are crimes. They will be investigated and prosecuted," Lance said.Lance also said that law enforcement and school officials throughout the state are reassessing emergency plans for schools."Parents should be confident that law enforcement in every community are. . . doing everything we can to make sure the schools are safe," he said.Lance said it was not clear when or where the surviving children from Sandy Hook would go back to school, but he said authorities wanted to keep them together because of the trauma they had undergone.Investigators are also looking carefully at the three guns used by Lanza. Lance said the weaponry would be traced "back to the workbench" where it was assembled.He declined to give any more details about the investigation, and would not comment on published reports of a shooting timeline."That is inappropriate at this time. We will not put that out as the investigation is ongoing," Lance said.Lance said bodies of the victims were starting to be released to their families.Sunday morning, a church where a service was being held to commemorate victims of Friday's mass school shooting was evacuated Sunday afternoon and worshippers were told there was a possible bomb threat.At least a dozen police officers in camouflage SWAT gear and carrying guns, apparently from the Connecticut State Police, arrived at the St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church and some headed toward an education center next door. An Associated Press photographer saw police leave carrying something in a red tarp.Guns drawn, they surrounded the rectory across the parking lot from the main church building. Officers were seen going through several buildings on church property, including the education center, while police and emergency vehicles surrounded the area and there was yellow caution tape placed on some of the buildings.There was no official report from police about the threat or evacuation. But CNN reported nothing suspicious had been found and church authorities said officers had secured the scene.Brian Wallace, a spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport, said "Monsignor Robert Weiss, the church's pastor, interrupted the homily at the mass. People left very calmly and with great dignity."He said activities for the day have been canceled and all of the church's buildings have been secured. "We felt in the interest of just protecting everyone that it was best to close down the church for today," said Wallace, who did not comment on the nature of the threat other than to say it was a phone threat that came in during the last Mass of the day.He said police looked at various church buildings and offices and "they were satisfied that it's safe.""I think it's just extremely difficult. It adds to the difficulty. It reinforces the fact that people do need prayer and silence in their lives to deal with this. They come to a place like this because they collectively need to be together . . . search for meaning, some kind of healing, so to interrupt that is a very tragic and difficult thing. But we'll get by it," Wallace said.Lanza, his mother and eight of the child victims attended St. Rose of Lima. It is a Roman Catholic Church with an adjacent school, which Lanza attended briefly.The church hosted overflow crowds at all three morning Masses Sunday.A crowd of more than 800 people attended the 9 a.m. service at the church, where there will be funerals for eight children later this week. In the town Sunday, there were "Pray for Newtown" signs everywhere. And in the town's main park, there was a memorial filled with dozens of flowers and teddy bears, candles and balloons. Parent could be seen bringing their children to drop off more teddy bears. A wreath with angel wings was placed on the white Sandy Hook sign. As Obama prepared to visit and churches opened their doors to comfort the grieving town Sunday, federal agents fanned out to dozens of gun stores and shooting ranges across Connecticut, chasing leads they hoped would cast light on Lanza's life.After fatally shooting his mother, Lanza drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School in her car with at least three of her guns, forced his way in by breaking a window and opened fire, authorities said. The killings took only minutes. All six adults killed at the school were women. Of the 20 children, eight were boys and 12 were girls. The chief medical examiner said the gunman used a military-style rifle rigged to quickly reload. All the school victims were shot with a rifle and all were apparently shot more than once, Chief Medical Examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver said. He said of the seven autopsies he personally performed, the victims had "three to 11 wounds apiece" and were shot in the head, extremities and torso -- two of them at close range."I believe everybody was hit more than once," he said.Asked whether the children suffered, Carver said, "If so, not for very long." Asked how many bullets were fired, Carver said, "I'm lucky if I can tell you how many I found." Parents identified the children through photos to spare them some shock, Carver said. He said the shooter was able to reload so quickly because he had taped two magazines together.The tragedy has plunged Newtown into mourning and added the picturesque New England community of 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change. Obama planned to attend an interfaith vigil -- the fourth time in his presidency when he will have traveled to a city after a mass shooting. In the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims and tourists Sunday that he is praying for the families of the victims. "I assure the families of the victims, especially those who lost a child, of my closeness in prayer," the pope said. "May the God of consolation touch their hearts and ease their pain."The gunman's father, Peter Lanza, issued a statement Saturday relating his own family's anguish in the aftermath. "Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express how heartbroken we are," he said. "We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can. We too are asking why . . . Like so many of you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has transpired."The rifle used was a Bushmaster .223-caliber, authorities confirmed. The gun is commonly seen at competitions and was the type used in the 2002 sniper killings in the Washington, D.C., area. Also found in the school were two handguns, a Glock 10 mm and a Sig Sauer 9 mm. Law enforcement officials have said they have found no note or manifesto from Lanza of the sort they have come to expect after murderous rampages such as the Virginia Tech bloodbath in 2007 that left 33 people dead. Education officials said they had found no link between Lanza's mother and the school, contrary to news reports that said she was a teacher there. Investigators said they believe Adam Lanza attended Sandy Hook many years ago, but they had no explanation for why he went there Friday. Authorities said Adam Lanza had no criminal history, and it was not clear whether he had a job. He was believed to have had a personality disorder, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another law enforcement official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Lanza had been diagnosed with Asperger's, a mild form of autism often characterized by social awkwardness. People with the disorder are often highly intelligent. While they can become frustrated more easily, there is no evidence of a link between Asperger's and violent behavior, experts say. Richard Novia, the school district's head of security until 2008, who also served as adviser for the school technology club, of which Lanza was a member, said he clearly "had some disabilities.""If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically," Novia said in a phone interview. "It was my job to pay close attention to that."With Bill Bleyer, Lauren R. Harrison and Tania LopezUser rating: 3(8) Click to rate CommentsPlease log in to comment.
