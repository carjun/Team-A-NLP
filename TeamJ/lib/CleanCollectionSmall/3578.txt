(AP Photo/Julio Cortez)                  By Gene WexlerJACKSONVILLE, Fla.  Some of our listeners called into WOKVs Over the Line this past weekend to voice their opinions on the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.Here is what some people in Jacksonville are saying:MaryThese children are our precious commodity. Having lost a child myself, Im grieving horribly for these families. It isIm overwhelmed.I strongly believe every school should have an armed policeman. I dont care where the money comes. I dont care what they have to cut back on. And I truly believestart it at the elementary schools. Let our children know that the police officers are not our enemies. They are not pigs. They are there to help protect and serve. And maybe, somewhere along the line, at some point, they will be looked at a little differently.JoshuaWhen I went through school, I was the victim of bullying quite a bit. And there were times in my life, especially after Columbine, when I could relate to a degree to how someone could want toyou knowcould snap and cause such mayhem.But when youre talking about people that are so young, I cannot fathom how someone could even begin to think about committing such an atrocity.It just goes to show that society is not advanced as far as we think. Not to make light of the situation but, if we cant protect our children, it says there is something seriously wrong.JoeYou know its a travesty what happened in Connecticut. But the thing that gets me is every time there is an incident involving a weapon, the people get all over weapons.How many people get killed in our country every day with an automobile? How many people get killed in our country every day as innocent babies in an abortion? How many people get killed every day by a doctors mistake?Why is that just because someone gets killed with a gun - its tragedy - but what do they start talking taking guns away? Guns dont kill. People behind them do.What you gotta do is remember its not the gun. The guns a cold piece of steel in a murderers hand. So is an automobile, quite often, in a drunks hands that kills a bunch of people.NewslettersRSS FeedsMobileFrom Our News PartnersPhotos: 2012 Miss Universe swimsuit competitionPolice arrest man suspected of posting Facebook threatsWeek in entertainment - December 15, 2012Museum discovers fuel in aircraft, plans temporary gallery shutdownPhotos: Worst mass casualty shootings in the past 20 yearsNews/Weather/TrafficNewsWeatherTrafficEvent GuideEventsFollow and ShareRSS FeedsAdvertisers and SponsorsHow to AdvertiseRecent on-air advertisersCars at AutotraderLocal Services at KudzuCoupons at ValpakAbout UsContact UsWork With UsEEOC StatementHelpAudio HelpVideo HelpSearch Help 2012 Cox Media Group.
