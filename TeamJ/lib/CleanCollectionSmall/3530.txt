Several hundred mourners packed a Newtown church Sunday morning for an emotional memorial to the victims of Fridays mass shooting  but a second mass was abruptly canceled by a mysterious threat."We just been threatened. Mass has ended," Father Robert Weiss of St. Rose of Lima church said as hundreds gathered to grieve collectively.Weiss said in an interview with Ora.TV, which is livestreaming video coverage from the chruch, that a parishoner answered a phone call and a man on the line said, "I'm coming to kill, I'm coming to kill," the New York Times reported."I went to the pulpit and said please quietly and calmly leave the church," Weiss said.Mourners walked out in orderly fashion, but were confused and traumatized."Many children left crying," Weiss said.Craig Warga/New York Daily NewsA distraught Father Robert Weiss of St. Rose of Lima church wipes away tears Friday as heleaves the Sandy Hook Firehouse in Newtown, CT. The firehouse became a rally point after the shooting at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School."Who would do such a thing? In a place, a church, where people come to feel safe," said a hysterical Ann Wood, 58, leaving the church.GRISLY DETAILS EMERGE FROM RAMPAGE: ALL VICTIMS SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES, MANY AT CLOSE RANGE"Oh God, What is the world coming to?! added Theresa Teixeira, 56, also walking away.

Most people walked to their cars and left as instructed as cops canvassed the church."It's probably nothing. Something stupid. But everyone has to go," a state trooper told the crowd.An "all clear" was declared a short time later.The afternoon evacuation followed a touching morning event that got even more emotional when church-goers learned that one of the tiny victims was scheduled to participate in her churchs Christmas Eve pageant next week.And the show will go on, said Weiss in tribute to its missing angel.GUNMAN ADAM LANZA LEARNED TO SHOOT FROM HIS GUN-COLLECTING MOMIN TRAGEDY, HEROISM AND SACRIFICE: PHOTOSFIRST GRADE TEACHER VICKI SOTO DIED PROTECTING HER STUDENTS"We are having practice for our pageant this morning at 11 a.m, he said. As you know, one of the little girls taken from us was scheduled to be an angel in the pageant," Father Weiss said holding back tears without mentioning her name."So we want to continue that Christmas Eve pageant in her memory and the memory of all the children.""Oh God," one woman said, sobbing.Many others could not contain their tears as they heard the revelation."Keep us in your prayers. We have at least eight funerals to get through this week of some of these children. It's heavy in the hearts of all of us."Msgr. Jerald Doyle, from the Bridgeport Diocese, tried to offer consolation to the crowded church.Robert Sabo/New York Daily NewsParishioners grieve at Trinity Church Sunday, December 16, 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut.FALLEN ANGELS: FULL LIST OF SANDY HOOK SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIMS"One cannot really imagine what's in the hearts of so many of you, particularly those who have lost a loved one, a child," Doyle said. "These events come so close to Christmas. Some of you say, I will never celebrate Christmas again. But you will. Not because you will have forgotten. You will because you still will be able to look forward."Parishioners said the mass felt comforting despite the widespread sadness."What happened had no rhyme or reason. It happened," said Craig Maginsky, 54. "We must go on. There were a lot of tears, a lot of hugs. What happened here ... you just can't never imagine. The entire town is in mourning."Danielle Lash, 40, left the mass in tears, thinking of the victims and her own kids, who are the same age as the fallen.Allen Breed/APResidents of Newtown, Conn., walk by with flowers to lay at a memorial at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 15, 2012."We came here looking for strength. We came to find consolation," said an emotional Lash. "This is especially difficult if you are a patent. You just can't imagine losing your children that way."The church will offer counseling to kids in grades eight through 12 at 6 p.m. to help them cope with the tragedy, father Weiss said.Church-goers also wrote messages on a board on their way out."God needed 20 angels so he called upon them," read one. "I pray for the kids like me that did not deserve that. God bless you."esandoval@nydailynews.comPost a Comment CommentsSee All Comments[Discussion Guidelines                                                        ]To post your comments, please, Sign in                                                         .
