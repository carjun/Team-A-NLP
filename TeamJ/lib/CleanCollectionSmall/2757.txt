I'm just about ready to sign up for gun classes for my mom, brothers, and myself. Seems like we are simply heading for a society in which everyone will need to be armed. Can we at least institute federal background checks to weed out the people with a disturbed history? permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Now, if you choose to not believe ANYTHING that comes out of any institution, corporation, government entity, then that's your right. But I prefer to give them the benefit of the doubt in most situations.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Eric Holder was not initially aware of the details of the operation. And even then, the cartels have been using citizens on this side of the border to purchase weapons for years. They get smuggled into Mexico. I can purchase a handgun right now and easily walk into Tijuana with it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Lunatics will resort to anything they can get a hold of such as knifes, so yea you're right.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Perhaps the government should recommend adults over the age of 18 carry guns to defend themselves? What is the answer?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I am on the sidelines on this issue so I just don't know.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLet's be clear: Nobody is getting laid off due to Obamacare.

I'm not so sure everyone else would qualify especially those with no credit history. So how would those people pay? The hospital will most likely have to foot the bill in most cases.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWith all the companies announcing layoffs, firing people, etc, due to the election result, why don't we make a list of the complainers so we can let them know we are paying attention and that mistreating their employees and punishing them for their politics won't go without penalty.  by  cecilx22in  politics[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI'm a democrat and don't hate whites or christians and I'm Hispanic and an atheist. Not all people of either party think a certain way. I wish the few vocal people on the Internet would stop generalizing all people of either party. We need a healthy and respectful discussion on all the issues.permalinksavecontextfull commentsVenezuela Electoral Council Says Hugo Chavez Wins Presidential Vote - ABC News  by  Buck-Nastyin  worldnews[+]flashman2006 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 2 points3 points4 points 2 months agoI'd be surprised to find many of the poor here in the U.S. voting Democratic for those reasons you stated. Most of the time, at least as a Hispanic myself, it's due to the notion that Republicans hate immigrants and are bigoted. For Blacks, it would perhaps be the same thinking. Which is why the Reps have been trying to address that misconception by embracing a more diverse party and making appeals to the Hispanic community, not through handouts, but via Hispanic politicians and leaders.permalinksavecontextfull commentsVenezuela Electoral Council Says Hugo Chavez Wins Presidential Vote - ABC News  by  Buck-Nastyin  worldnews[+]flashman2006 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoThe only reason he can give out some much aide to the poor (which I agree with) is because of the huge dollar revenues coming from the government owned oil. What would happen if all that were to just end? Taxes? Taxes on what? You've scared off all big businesses from your country. So you're left with having to cut back on all that aide. He needs to have a long term plan and I'm not sure what that is exactly.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAustin becomes first Texas city to endorse marriage equality  by  HouseSpeakerin  politics[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoYep.

But you're assuming the flow of illegal immigrants from south of the border continues unhindered. Studies have shown that the people coming over the border has decreased over the years thanks to better border security. And towns such as yours are perhaps more prone to the negative effects of illegal immigration, but having leaved in a city myself, it is much harder for that too happen simply because of the diversity that exists. Sure you'll have ESL classes in some schools, but the other classes continue to be taught in English. The security on the border gets better by the year so I'm not too worried about Spanish growing. The next generation after the illegals, will speak English and Spanish, and their kids will most likely just speak English. Spanish disappears along the way as with any immigrant group and their native language.permalinksavecontextfull commentsACLU: Emails from Arizona lawmaker support claims immigration law was racially motivated -AP  by  [deleted]in  politics[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 4 months agoAnd yet my brothers and I speak English perfectly and somewhat perfect Spanish. Those Spanish labels are mean't for the recent arrivals who may understand little English, but you're missing the point I was making in that most children of illegals, such as myself, speak English, so there's no way this country is somehow going to move from English to Spanish. The fact that our government is securing our borders will prevent further massive influxes of RECENT illegal immigrants.permalinksavecontextfull commentsACLU: Emails from Arizona lawmaker support claims immigration law was racially motivated -AP  by  [deleted]in  politics[+]flashman2006 2 points3 points4 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 2 points3 points4 points 4 months ago"A 2007 email sent from Pearce's legislative email account to a personal Pearce account said illegal immigration of Spanish-speakers puts the country's status as an English-speaking country at risk."'In one article forwarded by Pearce from one of his email accounts to another in 2006, a commentator spoke of the United States "facing an overwhelming illegal alien invasion" in which Hispanic illegal immigrants were "arrogantly corrupting our unifying national language while actively disrespecting our culture, society and country."'My mom who was once illegally here would laugh at this. Arrogant? Replace English? Really? What about the children of illegals who by and large speak English. It's called being bilingual you idiots. This paranoia of English being replaced is so laughable. My mom loves this country and loves the culture, so I've never seen her disrespect any aspect of this country except perhaps the extremist Republicans.permalinksavecontextfull commentsACLU: Emails from Arizona lawmaker support claims immigration law was racially motivated -AP  by  [deleted]in  politics[+]flashman2006 2 points3 points4 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 2 points3 points4 points 4 months agoThe problem with your argument is that the policy of deporting those held in detention has always been in place. He has simply perhaps speeded up the deportation of those with a criminal record. Arizona on the other hand, motivated by racist reasons such as:"A 2007 email sent from Pearce's legislative email account to a personal Pearce account said illegal immigration of Spanish-speakers puts the country's status as an English-speaking country at risk."or "In one article forwarded by Pearce from one of his email accounts to another in 2006, a commentator spoke of the United States "facing an overwhelming illegal alien invasion" in which Hispanic illegal immigrants were "arrogantly corrupting our unifying national language while actively disrespecting our culture, society and country."motivated them to proposed the law now in Arizona. I've never heard Obama or anyone in his administration speak that way or make that a reason for the increased deportations. permalinksavecontextfull commentsACLU: Emails from Arizona lawmaker support claims immigration law was racially motivated -AP  by  [deleted]in  politics[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 4 months agoIf they're actively profiling people that look like my Mom I'd be pretty pissed off. If anyone's family was being singled out simply because of the way they look they would understandably be upset, it's human nature. Nonetheless there is no evidence it is happening in Arizona... yet. If we later discover it is indeed a systematic problem, then I'd want the state to halt what it is doing and let the federal government deal with the issue the way it always has. Securing the border, as it has been doing for decades, is obviously the best way the government can stop the problem from continuing for another decade.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMexican drug cartels' spreading influence: Graphic  by  Loimerein  worldnews[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI don't know, is there an actual a debate on the matter? Because I follow politics very closely and I've been hearing for years from both sides that we need to secure the border. So I'm not too sure where you're hearing that there is some sort of disagreement on the matter. The debate currently centers on what should be done about the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, not the borders.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Spanish word "derecho" is used as an English loan-word.

The cable/satellite service providers or the content providers like Viacom? Service providers already charge the customer for their services, it's included in the monthly bill, so moving to a-la-carte shouldn't make much of a difference. On the other hand, content providers will no longer be able to bundle all their channels to the customer since we'll now have the power to pick and choose. Will that mean less revenue for content providers? permalinksavecontextfull commentsViacom just pulled the plug for DirecTV customers, What do you think will be the outcome?  by  Secularpridein  AskReddit[+]flashman2006 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoWell you need Viacom since they own Comedy Central. And they make the majority of their revenue from cable and satellite deals and so if all that were to disappear, they'd have to start charging online viewers to make up for the lost revenue. That's a couple of years off though...permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
