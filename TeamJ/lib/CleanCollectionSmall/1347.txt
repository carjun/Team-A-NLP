That means they learn how to work together to locate and stop a shooter.He mentioned the 2011 shooting in a Green Valley home that left three people dead and one injured. The shooter shot and injured himself and later died, though officers didnt know the situation when they responded. Tibbet said Fairfield used patrol officers only, something a lot of agencies would be unable to do.The Police Department works with the school district, Tibbet said. That work extends from doing threat assessments to having resource officers at the high schools and one for the middle schools. Beat officers pay attention to all the campuses, including the elementary schools, he said.Lt. Greg Hurlbut said the Police Department alerts a schoola couple of times a year to an incident that police are dealing with nearby. That often leads to a lockdown at the school. The department doesnt want criminal activity occurring in the area to spill over onto a campus, he said.School resource officers at the high schools work with the schools to coordinate a response plan, Hurlbut said. Police have the layouts of schools, know where the keys are and know what systems are in place for locating students and parents.Tibbet also stressed prevention. Often in school shooting cases, details later emerge about the shooter and the conflicts, threats and relationships that happened prior to the incident. People need to pay attention to these signs and report them early on, he said.Thats truly the way were going to prevent this, Tibbet said.Tibbet said the Fairfield Police Department provides its officers with the best training that exists in the nation as far as responding to an ongoing threat of violence or mass casualty.I feel were very well-prepared to respond to it, Tibbet said. I just hope we never have to.Reach Barry Eberling at 427-6929 or beberling@dailyrepublic.net. Follow him on Twitter at www.twitter.com/beberlingdr.

Michael HuntDecember 15, 2012 - 9:31 amYou should've asked him when the last time the officers had that training. I was told (by someone that works there) there out of compliance because its been awhile.Reply |  Report abusive comment  Recent PostsCity likely to retain lobbying group for TravisSudokuLost and found, the quest to find home, safety in later yearsRose is RoseGet FuzzyBaldoWizardTodays Print EditionWord SleuthB.C.Local teen singer makes it in music businessCryptoquoteCrosswordPicklesSubscribe via EmailEnter your email address to subscribe and receive notifications of new posts by email..Solano NewsSchool leaders discuss campus securityBy Danny Bernardini | From Page: A1Off-duty CHP officer killed on Highway 12By Heather Ah San | From Page: A1 | GalleryPerkins ends record-breaking quest, to honor school shooting victimsBy Heather Ah San | From Page: A1 | GalleryPolice train for mass violence, hope it never happensBy Barry Eberling | From Page: A1, 1 CommentThe Leaven brings an early Christmas to local sitesBy Amy Maginnis-Honey | From Page: A3 | GalleryChildren with special needs get a special dayBy Amy Maginnis-Honey | From Page: A3 | GalleryHearing in Travis Dairy robbery-murder case shifts to 2013By Jess Sullivan | From Page: A3Local woman gets free heater for cold houseBy Barry Eberling | From Page: A4 | GalleryJudge orders trial in Fairfield carjacking caseBy Jess Sullivan | From Page: A4Walgreens suit settlement sends $1.1 million to SolanoBy Jess Sullivan | From Page: A4Suisun City police log Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2012By Domini Williams | From Page: A9Fairfield police log Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2012By Domini Williams | From Page: A9Local teen singer makes it in music businessBy Heather Ah San | From Page: B10 | Gallery.US / WorldMan kills mother, then 26 at Connecticut schoolBy The Associated Press | From Page: A1 | Gallery2 dozen charged in Mexico-US meth smuggling schemeBy The Associated Press | From Page: A5Autopsy: Suspect in reservation slayings shot selfBy The Associated Press | From Page: A5Regulators approve free cellphones for the poorBy The Associated Press | From Page: A5Workers fired for lying about inspectionsBy The Associated Press | From Page: A6Calif. turnout was 72 percent in November electionBy The Associated Press | From Page: A6San Francisco Bay region 415 area code nearly fullBy The Associated Press | From Page: A6UC suspends new logo after widespread protestBy The Associated Press | From Page: A6 | GallerySF, Oakland plan holiday gun buybackBy The Associated Press | From Page: A6Womans sex romp exposes workers comp fraudBy The Associated Press | From Page: A6What parents should tell kids about school shootingBy Scripps Howard News Service | From Page: A9Police say 1 officer fatally shot, 1 hurt in Tenn.By The Associated Press | From Page: A10Rice withdrawal sparks gender concerns on CabinetBy The Associated Press | From Page: A104 doused with flammable liquid, set afire in Colo.By The Associated Press | From Page: A10EPA tightens standards for soot pollutionBy The Associated Press | From Page: A10AP-GfK Poll: Science doubters say world is warmingBy The Associated Press | From Page: A10Military families fret fiscal cliff cutsBy The Associated Press | From Page: A11 | GalleryAs Syrian rebels close in, Assad has cards to playBy The Associated Press | From Page: A11 | GalleryTempers rise ahead of vote on Egypt charterBy The Associated Press | From Page: A12 | GalleryLieberman pre-election exit roils Israeli politicsBy The Associated Press | From Page: A12Famed French mountaineer Maurice Herzog dies at 93By The Associated Press | From Page: A12Russia backtracks on statement about Assads fallBy The Associated Press | From Page: A12.OpinionRadiation exposure could lead to benefitsBy Ted Puntillo | From Page: A8Arnold: Lousy governor with worse memoryBy Thomas Elias | From Page: A8Editorial Cartoon for Dec. 15, 2012By Daily Republic Syndicated Content | From Page: A8Senior center fee is prohibitiveBy Letter to the Editor | From Page: A8A time for human compassionBy Daily Republic | From Page: A8.LivingCommunity calendar for Saturday, Dec. 15, 2012By Domini Williams | From Page: A2Celebrate the holidays  it will add energy to your relationshipBy Barton Goldsmith | From Page: A2Today in History for Dec. 15, 2012By The Associated Press | From Page: A2Horoscopes for Dec. 15, 2012By Holiday Mathis | From Page: B5Readers respond to husbands open letter to his wife about how his affair was justifiedBy Kathy Mitchell and Marcy Sugar | From Page: B5.EntertainmentJenni Riveras remains returned to So.
