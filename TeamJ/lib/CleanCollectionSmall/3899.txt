See More What we do know is that inside that school, for every dlild was, us there there was a teach horse was trying to save and I'm joined by jim willsie. His souzen, was just 25 years old. What happened? The family was informed she was trying to shield, get her children into a closet and protect them from harm. By doing that, put herself between the gunmen and the children and that is when sheep was tragically shot and killed. None of it makes any sense. But knowing vicki the way you did, she loved being a teacher. Yes. The kids were her first priority? Yes. Is it surprising that in a vie sis like this, this is the choice she made? No, I'm proud to have known vicki. Her life dream was to be a tea teacher and her instincts kicked in. How is the fanlly doing? Grieving. It's hard to take it in and process and it wrap your mind about it. Are so many unanswered questions. We are coping. When you think about a situation like this, your cousin was there to help little kids. Kindergarten? First grade. First grade kids, 6, 7 years old. What sense do you make how this could happen? There's no words to answer that. It's senseless. You are never prepared for something like that. And I'm just proud that vicki had the instincts to her -- her first instinct was to protect her kids from harm. And she did that and unfortunately, she didn't survive. The teachers were first responders here. Your cousin, others like her, telling kids story, keeping them calm. Even though they heard gun fire all around them. There can be no pride in somebody leaving this earth too soon. Does it give the fanlly sol list she was doing something of a higher calling than anyone could have ever imagined? Absolutely. Absolutely. She was doing what she loved, protecting the children and in our eyes, she's a hero. No question about that. She protected the most vulnerable and the worst of situations. We know a lot about what took her out of this world. But it's important people remember her for who she was at her best. What do you want people to remember about your cousin? She lost her life doing what she loved. I don't think she would have it any other way. She loved kids. Her goal in life was to be a teach intermold young minds. And that is what she achieved and she lost her life protecting the children. I am sorry to meet you this way. We are going to leave jim right now. Go to break.
