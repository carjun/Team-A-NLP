This includes comics ending in AdviceAnimalsNo comparison comicsThese are comics that compare one thing to another. If you're making any comparison in your comic, chances are you're doing it wrongNo repostingThis subreddit is for original content only, meaning comics YOU made. Don't post stuff you found from elsewhere on the web, it's probably been here already. And don't resubmit your comic because it did poorly. Reposting will result in a banUpvotes don't matterIt doesn't matter if your comic has 1.21 Gigavotes, we can and will remove it if it violates any of the rulesNo meta-postsDon't make a comic complaining about another user, comic, or the moderators. Additionally, don't make comics to introduce a new ragefaceNSFW tags are freePlease use NSFW tags for anything that might have the remote possibility of getting somone fired or in troubleComics must be between 2 and 8 panelsYour comic must be between 2 and 8 panels long. We don't want single panels, nor do we want novels. No comics made of double-width panels onlyNo blogpostsBlogposts are preachy, self-serving, boring comics. These often take the form of a full-panel stare face lecturing someone, posts about how your dog/cat/grandpa died, and similar. Your post must be relatable, not a personal anecdoteNo vote-beggingDo not mention cakedays, karma, upvotes, or anything similarBe light on textPeople come here for quick, simple humor. If you find your comic heavy on words, try submitting it to /r/ragenovels. This includes labeling poorly drawn televisions and similarNo non-imagesIf your comic is from some site other than imgur or minus, then its not permitted, and will be removed as spamNo dead horse beatingAvoid tropes of rage comics, including, but not limited to le, das, moi, true story, [FIRST], Extra Panel, Made for reddit, and [FIXED]Mods have the final sayIf a comic is removed by a moderator, even if it doesn't seem to violate any of the other rules, it remains removedFAQhover for detailsWhy isn't my comic on the "new" tab?Give it a second. It was probably caught by the evil robotic spam filter, but we've created an even more powerful robot to save everything from the filter; it just can take a couple minutes. If it still doesn't work, it was probably removed for breaking a rule (read them!).Can I be a moderator, too?As much as we love when community members want to help out, we can't accept requests for becoming moderators, or we'd be overwhelmed with nothing but such requests. Therefore, requesting to be a moderator will actually result in you getting banned instead. When we feel we need more moderators, we recruit from a list of people we have identified as being helpful and positive role models for the community. If you want to be a mod one day, that's how you'll go about doing itHow do I get flair?If you ask for flair, we will never give it to you, no matter how many blowjobs you offerMore linksCOMMENT FACESSee Alt-Text Without HoverComment Faces on All of Reddit: [Chrome] [Opera]Stylesheets and faces on GithubRage Faces in GChat and FB Chata community for 3 yearsSubmit a linkto anything interesting: news article, blog entry, video, picture...message the moderatorsMODERATORSPoromenosverdammtSynth3t1cCOCK a doodle doo.BritishEnglishPolicethebeefytacoUpvote for free tacosjeresigRswanyflabbergasted1EustisParadox...and 15 more 1192419251926Happy Birthday Grandma (imgur.com)submitted 6 hours ago by fhmason64 commentssharecancelloading...2977978979Oh, the romantics in my relationship...
