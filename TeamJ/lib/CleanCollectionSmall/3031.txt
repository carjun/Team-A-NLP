Jimmy and Opie are pretty apathetic but you could count on those other guys to at least balance it out somewhat. Now it's just a Fox News radio show. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnt is getting a lot of shit in the tweeters for this :D  by  iamfromreallifein  opieandanthony[+]KR1288 -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)[]KR1288 -1 points0 points1 point 4 days agoYeah Bill Burr does a great job. I love that Opie openly stated he hated that Anne Coulter was on the show. Some of the things Ant says really makes me scratch my head. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnt is getting a lot of shit in the tweeters for this :D  by  iamfromreallifein  opieandanthony[+]KR1288 -3 points-2 points-1 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]KR1288 -3 points-2 points-1 points 4 days agoI love Anthony, he is fucking hilarious and amazing on the show. His Dice impression and other things like that will literally leave me in tears from laughing so hard. But, I had to unfollow him on twitter. I just couldn't do it. Same with the show sometimes, I have to read the listening thread on Wackbag to find out when he goes of on taxes, Obama, blacks etc. so I know when to skip or start at. It is rather sad that they don't have anyone to debate him.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnt is getting a lot of shit in the tweeters for this :D  by  iamfromreallifein  opieandanthony[+]KR1288 -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]KR1288 -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days agoI am glad I am not the only guy who gets seriously creeped out when stuff like this goes on with Anthony.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnt is getting a lot of shit in the tweeters for this :D  by  iamfromreallifein  opieandanthony[+]KR1288 5 points6 points7 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]KR1288 5 points6 points7 points 4 days agoI made her blog, I did a satisfactory job of rustling her jimmies.
