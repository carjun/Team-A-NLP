That is the only reason I think I won't be getting anything.  I have had people ship late before, I have also shipped late before.  I know how it goes.  I just usually hear something by now.  Like I said though, it really isn't a big deal at all.  As long as my SS likes what they get then I am happy.  :-)permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm curious about something....  by  DreamsAndSchemesin  secretsanta[+]silverpixiefly 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]silverpixiefly 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI think my husband is more discouraged for me than I am.  I think it is because we will be alone this Christmas.  I told him it really wasn't a big deal.  I mean, I might get rematched.  And I have had fun shopping for my SS.  I do enjoy giving just as much, if not more, than receiving.  I just hope my SS enjoys their gift.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm curious about something....  by  DreamsAndSchemesin  secretsanta[+]silverpixiefly 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]silverpixiefly 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI would just be happy to get anything.  Actually, I don't even really mind getting shafted this year.  My card exchange sent a card (can't wait to get it!), so there is that.  Plus, I have been busy putting the finishing touches on my SS's gift so I can get it in the mail today.  I wanted to make sure the cookies were fresh and I may have extra room in the box past what I already have to send out . . . so I think I will be grabbing a little bit more last minute.Edit a word.permalinksavecontextfull comments$2900 gift be damned.

I didn't meet my soul mate until 20 and we didn't even start dating until 22. I am now 29, married for 2 years and pregnant with our first. My aunt who is 60 didn't meet her soulmate until 40. I know it seems so real right now. I have honestly been there and I was your age. I am so glad I didn't have sex with him. Like to this day I am utterly grateful I didn't. The jerk even used the, if you loved me you would, line. That set off all sorts of flags. You can be stronger than this if you want to. I hope you will.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy friend likes this guy who has been leading her on for a few months and he told her today that he would only actually love her if they had sex.  by  tesshissain  TwoXChromosomes[+]silverpixiefly 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]silverpixiefly 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoYou say no. he does not and will never love you.
