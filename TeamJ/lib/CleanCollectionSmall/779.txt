If you need a gun, head to Juarez and buy one from the ATF.  by  Scoled321in  conspiracy[+]CowboySpencer -6 points-5 points-4 points 4 hours ago*(0 children)[]CowboySpencer -6 points-5 points-4 points 4 hours ago*The author of the article is an idiot, and the headline for this post is also idiotic.  The ATF never sold any weapons - they became aware that people were buying lots of guns, and suspected they were moving them across the border.  The ATF didn't encourage the sales; they tracked them.  They wanted to take further action but weren't allowed to.  Edit:  Wow, you folks really don't know anything about Fast & Furious?  I guess they've done a better job than I thought of making it look like a scandal.

Knives are just as bad as guns, so we shouldn't bother banning guns.  I mean, look at this China story ... 22 kids got wounded by a knife, while 22 kids were killed with a gun in Connecticut.  It's basically the same thing!permalinksavecontextfull commentsSandy Hooking Elementary School: a visualization [x-post /r/imgoingtohellforthis]  by  brokeassgradstudentin  toosoon[+]CowboySpencer -16 points-15 points-14 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]CowboySpencer -16 points-15 points-14 points 21 hours agoThanks for your input.
