I'm not surprised that Obama has some of his own "flair" in writings, even if they are originally made by others. I wouldn't be surprised if ANY president did something like that, so for some to accuse our Commander-In-Chief of being anything other than sincere in this case baffles me. It doesn't matter the political side.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]xneurocentric 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agoI almost had it out with a family member during the election.

But if you ask a forensics psychiatrist, we shouldn't.  by  Rick_Cheneyin  videos[+]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours agoI guess that was part of the issue with the reporting. Apparently, she was a teacher at the school, but wasn't there during the shooting. She was killed already.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoI agree with you.Unfortunately, people with the mindset mentioned in my above post are of the same mind with the people who say the shooting happened because less people believe in God. Instead of trying to fix the problem, they just want to blame others. In the case of my (now ex) friend, I have a feeling she just didn't want to admit to being helpless and upset (possibly still about the elections?) so she blamed Obama for not doing what she thought he should do.permalinksavecontextfull commentsYou are not invincible. Everyone you love will die. And so will you. What the fuck are you doing with your life?  by  ElDerpin  AskReddit[+]xneurocentric 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoThis sounds like a rhetorical question, but I'll answer it anyway.I'm finishing up my Bachelor's in Russian, while getting a certificate in Russian translation. My boyfriend and I are on the road to marriage, having kids, and adopting another animal. My life is short, but I'm enjoying it the best I can.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]xneurocentric 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours agoI'm not really glorifying him. I thought his speech was very poignant. I also want to point out that I have a feeling Romney would have made a very similar speech, as he has kids and grandkids of his own. My point was, it's not exactly the best time to attack a president (no matter if he's Democrat or Republican), on how he addressed this issue. He couldn't have made a speech an hour after the attack; he needs more info. We don't know who wrote his speech. It just felt so tasteless during a situation like this, that instead of commending the speeches made by who is in charge, they pick apart everything he did because it wasn't the one they wanted in office.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, I want you to think of a band name.

I honestly doubt anyone who can do that has a normal mind.I think the reason why gun control is panned is because it won't change a damn thing. It might actually make things worse. People will still get guns illegally, and if they can't, they'll find other, more dangerous ways to kill. You have to fix the person.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoI did, I read it many times. I can't tell if you're calling me an idiot as well or what.

That's something to consider. However, you both would need - whether you ended up dating or not - to keep your professional and private relationships separate. If you can make that agreement, why not let her try to get the job? permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoI'm not sure it's an official job, but it seems to be the norm whenever tragedies strike.

People are still going to do it, but with a much higher risk for added danger. People will still get guns if they want, or they will find other ways to kill. It isn't the weapon, it's the person brandishing it.We need to treat the people, and we also need the media to stop going nuts over this. Other equally disturbed people see what the media does to a shooter or attacker and they know they will be famous posthumously as well. And that's another reason why this shit happens.TL;DR: Banning guns will only make it worse.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoNormally, I don't, because I know people are gonna say stupid shit regardless of whatever they believe in, but that really struck me. This woman has children of her own, and the only thing she can think of to say at the time is that Obama is stupid because someone else wrote his speech? How the fuck does she know who wrote his speech? And why the fuck would she focus on anything other than the poor parents who don't have fucking children to go home to now?I just wanted to yell all that to her, but I have gastritis and need to get the acid level down.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy cousin was in a motorcycle accident last month, has no insurance, and spent 4 days in the hospital.

She instead told the doctors she was dieting, but didn't, so they would give her the surgery.I don't speak to her anymore.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]xneurocentric 86 points87 points88 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 86 points87 points88 points 19 hours agoI was incredibly moved by the his speech. A few people I know on Facebook were not, posting how it would have been better if he hadn't had someone else write his speech for him, and how he should have been saying something directly after the shooting happened, and not six hours later. They also said this showed crap leadership and that they hope we're happy who we elected.Instead of arguing, I deleted them. Fuck idiots, especially today.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Sandy Hook Elementary murders will be covered on the news for weeks to come.

These are the reasons why before reports are made, you have to confirm. It's okay to report that you're not sure. But it's not okay to confirm something, and then have to redact it later because it was incorrect.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Sandy Hook Elementary murders will be covered on the news for weeks to come.

[Updated at 5:14  p.m. ET] The mother of the suspected shooter was found dead in her son's residence in Newtown, a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. CNN had previously identified the mother as Nancy Lanza, a teacher at the Sandy Hook Elementary, according to law enforcement sources.The source also told CNN there was no body found in the house searched by authorities in Hoboken, New Jersey. Two law enforcement sources say a man was taken away from questioning from that house. He is believed to be the brother of the shooter, according to the sources.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo at any point in this national tragedy are we going to talk about putting more money into identifying and treating mental illness?  by  skePTic30in  AskReddit[+]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]xneurocentric 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoIt's not even just about identifying the illnesses. People always talk about mental illness when something like this happens, but until it does, anyone who makes an off-hand comment, or says they're depressed is just told they're having a bad day and to get over it.I'm not saying we need to get up in arms if someone we know says something odd, but we need to start actually understanding that depression is a real thing and can be damaging. Just because it isn't schizophrenia doesn't mean it isn't real and isn't hard to handle. Look at the prank call in the UK. A nurse killed herself over the backlash. She might have just been a little depressed, but that sent her over the edge.I've tried to commit suicide. I have depression (dysthymic disorder). When someone tells me to just 'get over it' and 'there are people out there that have worse problems than you' I tell them to get bent. Yes, there are people out there with worse problems - this shooting comes to mind - but in my fucked up head, anything said that sounds wrong to me can mean a day of not getting out of bed.Fix the mentality of mental illness, and then you can start to fix the illnesses themselves.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
