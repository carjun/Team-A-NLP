It gets a good inside-joke kind of laugh every time.Also, keep the gift bags people give you, and put a post-it on it with the name of who gave it to you, then reuse them next year.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is there no SAM Turret?  by  BoonTobiasin  blackops2[+]loganz 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]loganz 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoghost keeps you off of the minimap when the enemy has a UAV up, Blind Eye will protect you from enemy assault killstreaks (hunter killer drones, stealth choppers etc.)..Since a lot of people run UAVs, ghost can be very helpful if you want to stay off the map. Whenever my clan plays together we always have UAVs up constantly, same with other stacked groups.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFriend is moving here...can you please give feedback on these apartments?  by  turtlekitty30in  Sacramento[+]loganz 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]loganz 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoIf you plan on getting an apartment, best to drive by in the evenings to check it out. Every apartment complex looks like the best place to live when you visit it in the middle of the day, while everyone is at work or school.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrip Cap Challenge  by  b4ckcountryin  blackops2[+]loganz 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]loganz 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoWhen we found out about the challenge we got it on our first try through pure luck. We triple capped early and then the other team left, leaving one guy to play. He never left, and we got it.We tried it a few other times for other clan mates and you just need to keep track of the time, If you have less than 3 minutes left in the first round, best to let the other team to cap some flags so you have more wiggle room during the 2nd round. We found that if you totally destroy a team (kills not caps), most likely people will rage out and leave a lopsided team for the 2nd round.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is there no SAM Turret?  by  BoonTobiasin  blackops2[+]loganz 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]loganz 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIt takes a little longer to hack a UAV than it is to shoot it down. Choppers take a loong time to hack and you need two of them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is there no SAM Turret?  by  BoonTobiasin  blackops2[+]loganz 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]loganz 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoGhost definitely helps when running lone wolf, or if playing against a tough party. The last thing you want to do is be seen on the map always, or not be running the objective because you are busy shooting stuff down.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOld picture found in my great-great grandmother's photo album.

Kaala (Waianae Mountain Range) from the Schofield Area. The building might possibly be an older Quad. Perhaps check with the National Archives to see if you can get her military info (if any), or the Topic Lightning Museum to see if they can help ID the building and dates.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOld picture found in my great-great grandmother's photo album.

We usually run a space heater in our room, sometimes we'll let it blow under our blankets before we go to bed (we hold it and make it blow under for a few seconds, we don't leave it under there). But it never ever gets warm enough.Last year, we spent the night at our friends house and they had an electric blanket. It was the BEST thing ever. From what I can tell it uses very little electricity (compared to a space heater), and it works really well and is QUIET. So I am picking one up for a christmas present to my girlfriend, I think she will love it, since she seems to be cold all the time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRandom Weekly Game Type Night!  by  thingsomethingin  westofnuketown[+]loganz 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]loganz 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI am down to play ANY game type.. it doesn't always have to be domination.
