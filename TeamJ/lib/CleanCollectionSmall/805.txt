Some people can't wrap their head around this idea, they keep coming back to an omniscient being/restricted concepts of the Bible. Though this idea of what 'god' is, is much bigger and the word 'god' really doesn't work well with itpermalinksavecontextfull commentsFasting before shroom trips  by  BCJunglistin  Psychonaut[+]Katie1230 1 point2 points3 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]Katie1230 1 point2 points3 points 19 days agoI don't really know enough about juicing fasts, and that's where the people at r/juicing could help.
