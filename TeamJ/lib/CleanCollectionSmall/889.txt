What did you get in massive trouble for as a child, only to commend yourself for as an adult?  by  UpUpDnDnLRLRBAstartin  AskReddit[+]saucyimp 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago*(0 children)[]saucyimp 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago*sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onWhen I was in college, I dated a guy for a bit who was bipolar and not receiving any kind of help for it. After discovering he had lied to me about a lot of things, I ended the relationship. Sometime after, I got wind he tried to kill himself. He also started stalking me at my apt, on campus, and online. I informed the campus police but they didn't do anything.This lasted a few months and then one day, I got a text message from him that appeared to be suicidal. So I said "fuck this" and called the police. I told them the message, thought he was suicidal, and also informed them that he had been stalking me. I didn't do this to humiliate him, I did it because I was legitimately concerned he would take his own life. The police apparently showed up at a friend's place looking for him that evening. I believe words were exchanged with the ex. But the ex showed up at a mutual college club thing I was at later that evening, acting completely normal. I took him out of the room, confronted him about the suicidal text and informed that if he ever contacted me again, I'd get a restraining order. My whole body shook as I used the word "fuck" more times than a Joe Pesci movie. To this day, I refuse to speak to him. Our mutual friends think I over-reacted to the situation and that I need to lighten up and take pity on someone who is obviously mentally ill. I always empathize with those who have to deal with mental illness, I really do. But bipolar or not, he was a danger to me and given the fact I felt threatened, I will always believe I did the right thing. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCommunication issues threatening relationships. Help!  by  communicationconundrin  relationships[+]saucyimp 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago (0 children)[]saucyimp 0 points1 point2 points 9 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onWhen I feel like my BF gives me a response that is critical of my emotions, I tend to over-react. Often times it's set up as "You're responding this way because of ____" and regardless of whether or not he's correct, I get angry because it can feel dismissive or too clinical. So when this happens, I will often say something such as "That comment feels very dismissive but I don't think you mean it that way. Do you maybe want to approach this differently?" It sounds super dumb but it helps put things in perspective for me when I acknowledge out loud that he's trying to help while also voicing my feelings. It also gives him a chance to change tactics before I just explode at him. It does take patience to say it. You both want a resolution and it's very easy to forget that. Sometimes reminding myself that this person is trying to help resolve this because they care makes a huge difference. Also if you feel yourself getting angry, take a moment to calm yourself before responding. If she says why aren't you responding, just tell her you don't want this to get out of a hand so you're taking a minute. I'm sure she doesn't want things to get elevated either. One other idea, maybe try injecting humor if things get way too serious? This can seriously backfire depending on the situation but if my BF and I have a hard time making a decision like picking dinner, one of us will usually jokingly suggest a restaurant we absolutely hate or has a bad reputation which can lighten the moment for a second and keep things from getting intense. permalinksavecontextfull comments6012Someone broke into my apt and stole several expensive items for me - Can RBI help me recover my stuff?

Interesting. I have a really hard time figuring out who could have done it that I know. Maybe another occupant? This whole thing feels like a gang situation to me since my apt was hit along with two others and I don't know the tenants of the other two. Apparently my apt complex was one of several on the street to be hit on Tuesday. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs a robbery an excuse to get out of your lease?  by  Philthy42in  needadvice[+]saucyimp 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (0 children)[]saucyimp 1 point2 points3 points 11 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onGotcha.

They are offering to move us to a different apartment within the complex on a higher floor and possibly a buy out option, though my roommate can't afford it.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs a robbery an excuse to get out of your lease?  by  Philthy42in  needadvice[+]saucyimp 2 points3 points4 points 11 months ago (0 children)[]saucyimp 2 points3 points4 points 11 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onHi guys, I'm Philthy42's friend who was robbed. I know that legally I don't have a leg to stand on. But you bring up an interesting point -- the habitability of the space. Last month, my friend who is another tenant at this complex, had her car stolen. In October, I had patio furniture stolen. I didn't report the patio furniture but I know my friend reported the car stolen. Wouldn't that mean the landlord should have improved the security of the place after the carjacking?(I know a carjacking isn't the same as a break-in but I'm also just really desperate to get out of this apt. My sense of security is completely gone now - my car doesn't feel safe and now my apartment doesn't feel safe. I'm scared for my life and no longer sleeping.)This also may be worth mentioning: my roommate has mold growing in her closet and it's been a problem since early-mid December. We put in a work order but it still hasn't been taken care of. I sent an email to the complex detailing my fear, my wish to move, and the reasons why, including the mold. Would this help me get out? permalinksavecontextfull commentsGirlfriends of Reddit: Would you be angry if you found out your boyfriend had a small amount of savings that he was not telling you about?  by  stanker420in  AskReddit[+]saucyimp 2 points3 points4 points 11 months ago (0 children)[]saucyimp 2 points3 points4 points 11 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onBut if it's not a big deal, that's all the more reason to tell her. Especially early on when you just started saving. In the general sense, it's not a big problem to have some savings. But I think the intent is more of the problem. As someone said earlier, if it had been a rainy day stash, that would have been pretty acceptable because you're looking out for the well-being of both of you. But holding back cash for a personal extraneous expense like a trip without mentioning it to the girlfriend is dishonest. She doesn't own your money but she does depend on your money to help out with everything. I'm sure she'd rather not have to be in the situation of worrying about your money but if cash is tight, there's not much of a choice. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGirlfriends of Reddit: Would you be angry if you found out your boyfriend had a small amount of savings that he was not telling you about?  by  stanker420in  AskReddit[+]saucyimp 5 points6 points7 points 11 months ago (0 children)[]saucyimp 5 points6 points7 points 11 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI fail to understand why you didn't just tell her in the first place. Like why does this need to be a big secret? You probably should have told her and she should be ok with it. But since you didn't tell her, she needs her time to be pissed and then get over it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPA- Makers of Avenger controllers take money and run.  by  DiHydroin  gaming[+]saucyimp 4 points5 points6 points 11 months ago (0 children)[]saucyimp 4 points5 points6 points 11 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI literally bought popcorn on my lunch break so I could have it while I sit here continuing to enjoy this shit fest. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMother Got A Co-worker written up at work because she asked for help and said she was feeling suicidal.

I'm all for privacy and everything but I'd want to know if there was something going on in my employee's life that's inhibiting them from doing their job to the best of their abilities. It's not only because I'd care about my employees, it's a matter of being able to run your business efficiently. If she's in a bank and she's suffering from suicidal thoughts, that's very likely interfering with her ability to multitask or perform well under pressure. Then again, I'm not a manager, I just believe in treating people with decency. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMother Got A Co-worker written up at work because she asked for help and said she was feeling suicidal.

I did it in a hurry at work to share with my friends. I never meant for it to make to reddit of all places. OP took it from a friend's feed on google + and reposted it. I don't honestly think it's that funny to wind up on here. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy friend wrote the weather report for Raleigh today.  by  [deleted]in  funny[+]saucyimp 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]saucyimp 0 points1 point2 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onHi everyone, I actually created that image. This thread was only just brought to my attention but I thought I would clarify a few things:No, I did not write the weather report for Raleigh. I took a screen cap and edited the image in photoshop at work. I wasn't trying to pass it as an actual weather report. Not even close. It was a joke, meant really just for my friends living in NC. I had originally posted the image on google+ and my friend reposted it. The OP then took it from my friend's feed and posted it here without my knowledge.I'm not mad it showed up here, I just find it creepy because the OP's my ex boyfriend, we never speak to each other, and we're not connected on google+. It's all very bewildering. This isn't the first time he's reposted my stuff without my knowledge though. At least he had the good sense this time to not claim it as his. Sorry OP mislead you, he's a douche. Yes, I know there other places in the world where it's much hotter. You have all of my sympathy as you are probably on fire right now. For those of you who enjoyed it, I'm happy to hear it. I really never expected this to get beyond my small circle of friends but I'm glad I made a few strangers laugh.
