But can we all just agree that mental health services need a drastic improvement in the U.S. so that fewer mentally unstable people are wandering around without access to any treatment?  I cannot believe any sane person could commit such an atrocity.At the very least some sort of psychological testing to make sure that people are in good mental health before they're allowed to purchase a firearm.  It would never be 100% foolproof, but if one mass shooting such as this could be prevented, it would be worth it.permalinksave[+]KoruMatau 2 points3 points4 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]KoruMatau 2 points3 points4 points 10 minutes agoI'm hoping that this is the final straw that makes us actually change something. I would imagine that the parents of those poor children will not be quiet. It was something similar that led to the banning of handguns in the UK.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacrepermalinksaveparent[+]charlie702 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]charlie702 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoI don't have to know exactly what happened here to say that it is WRONG that a single person can own and carry enough weaponry to KILL dozens of people. These innocent people are now DEAD. Their lives are OVER. Their families are forever destroyed by this.permalinksaveparent[+]eXePyrowolf 2 points3 points4 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)[]eXePyrowolf 2 points3 points4 points 6 minutes agoSorry but I see this arguement after every gun tragedy. People bicker about the guns then the pro-gun crowd always drops the mental health card, implying all murderers are mentally screwed and not just really really angry, uneducated, poor or drunk. I won't deny that mental health has some cause but America has a big population and this is a big problem. So focusing on one sect is not enough.Honestly I don't think this can be resolved Bottom-Up, it has to be Top-Down. Start with the guns, and go from there.permalinksaveparent[+]Belacqua 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)[]Belacqua 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes agoLook, I agree that with 300 million guns plus the 2nd amendment, "gun control" is no longer an attainable solution to the problem. I'm not advocating gun control. I would just like people to be able to admit that easy access to guns IS A MORE IMPORTANT FACTOR HERE than easy access to psychological evaluation and/or psychiatric care. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
