What a coward.permalinksave[+]zBriGuy 41 points42 points43 points 58 minutes ago (10 children)[]zBriGuy 41 points42 points43 points 58 minutes agoIt's pretty hard to believe in a god that would allow 18 elementary school kids get murdered in cold blood.  But people will still say "everything happens for a reason" and "god has a plan for all of us".permalinksaveparent[+]sfw-dyer 4 points5 points6 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]sfw-dyer 4 points5 points6 points 27 minutes agothe two things that always happen after a tragedy. argue politics. argue God. let's not.permalinksaveparent[+]thefreshscent 9 points10 points11 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]thefreshscent 9 points10 points11 points 27 minutes agoIt's pretty hard to believe in a god that would allow....I hate this. I am not arguing about religion or whether or not there is a God, but the whole point of God and Christianity is free-will and allowing people to make their own choices, regardless of the consequences. If you are expecting a lightning bolt to shoot down and preemptively murder the attacker, you are going to have a bad time.permalinksaveparent[+]luckdomain 2 points3 points4 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]luckdomain 2 points3 points4 points 27 minutes agoDon't be angered when they say things like that. People make statements like that to try to make sense of a crazy world that in fact often has no rhyme or reason. Yes, it's an opiate, but it's an opiate some people need to function. We all have our things we do and say just to get by in life, especially when such a tragedy occurs.permalinksaveparent[+]Mailman487 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]Mailman487 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes agoMy thoughts exactly permalinksaveparent[+]epocson -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes ago*(0 children)[]epocson -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes ago*My Facebook feed is littered with "Thoughts and Prayers go out to the families" I know they mean well, and its just what people do in situations like this but.  What are you praying for?  The kids and teachers are already dead.  They needed your prayers at 8am this morning. not an hour after the shooting.Edit: This came across poorly.  I don't mind the "thoughts and prayers" messages, I just don't understand what they are praying for.  That whole thing escapes me.  I'm sorry if it came off as insensitive.permalinksaveparent[+]he_eats_da_poo_poo -1 points0 points1 point 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]he_eats_da_poo_poo -1 points0 points1 point 10 minutes agoHow about we actually not bring religion into everything for a change.  permalinksaveparent[+]The_Keg 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]The_Keg 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoYour argument is fucking disgusting, Lets exploit these dead children and point out how stupid religious people are, what a self righteous cunt. permalinksaveparent[+]OhJustNothing 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]OhJustNothing 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoI hope this isn't terribly insensitive, but as a Christian I'd just like to add some insight here. I think it's very closed-minded to say that a God can't be good if he lets bad things happen. He gives us all a choice to do good or bad things, and he won't necessarily stop us if we make the wrong choice. It's like when you tell a toddler not to touch something hot. Sometimes you need to let them experience the consequences for them to really get it.I realize this may not be a satisfactory answer, and this is far more complicated and tragic situation than that, but I'm just trying to show you the Christian perspective on things like this. It's a way of thinking. I'm really not here to debate this, I'm just offering another perspective on the subject, take it or leave it. Hope this helps.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 38 minutes ago (1 child)[][deleted] 38 minutes ago[deleted]permalinksaveparent[+]cynicroute 3 points4 points5 points 35 minutes ago (0 children)[]cynicroute 3 points4 points5 points 35 minutes agoYou are the only one arguing about religion.

I don't believe in ultimate justice or punishment in some afterlife, but at times like this it's easy to understand why people do. permalinksaveparent[+]elshizzo 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]elshizzo 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoI hope there isn't a god, because if there was a god and he allowed this to happen, he's a douche.permalinksaveparent[+]whatsmyPW 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)[]whatsmyPW 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes agoReally? It is times like this that strengthens my beliefs that there is no god.permalinksaveparent[+]narcisslol 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (15 children)[]narcisslol 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoTotal coward.permalinksaveparent[+]Phallic 20 points21 points22 points 1 hour ago (14 children)[]Phallic 20 points21 points22 points 1 hour agoI always find calling shooters "cowards" an interesting response.  Like by emasculating the guys who do this stuff we can make ourselves feel slightly less horrible about it.But people in these situations just march in knowing they're going to die, one way or another.  I don't know what the fuck to call that but "cowardice" certainly doesn't seem appropriate.permalinksaveparent[+]GreenGlassDrgn 2 points3 points4 points 34 minutes ago (0 children)[]GreenGlassDrgn 2 points3 points4 points 34 minutes agoI think its related to the fact that some people consider the end-suicide taking the easy way out, while a braver person would take responsibility for his actions and face the people he has hurt. Also this guy basically went shooting goldfish in a barrel, that isn't perceived as a brave or manly deed either.permalinksaveparent[+]deadundead 2 points3 points4 points 46 minutes ago (2 children)[]deadundead 2 points3 points4 points 46 minutes agoI think 'terrorist' is fitting, and I don't throw around that term willy-nilly.permalinksaveparent[+]Mogul126 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes ago (1 child)[]Mogul126 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes agoDon't terrorists by definition need some kind of agenda, though? What could possibly be gained by this? Connecticut isn't Chechnya.permalinksaveparent[+]deadundead 2 points3 points4 points 17 minutes ago (0 children)[]deadundead 2 points3 points4 points 17 minutes agoI don't know if an agenda is needed to be called a terrorist (which is probably why I don't use the term very often).  Maybe they just wanted to incite terror.  It worked :(permalinksaveparent[+]narcisslol -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (9 children)[]narcisslol -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoThis sick twisted fuck kills up to what might now be 18 defenseless children and then shoots himself. And you don't think that's cowardice?permalinksaveparent[+]Phallic 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (4 children)[]Phallic 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour agoNo.  It seems more to me like complete despair.  It's an extended suicide filled with horrific violence.  To create that situation doesn't seem to me to be cowardice.permalinksaveparent[+]narcisslol -2 points-1 points0 points 57 minutes ago (3 children)[]narcisslol -2 points-1 points0 points 57 minutes agoDespair my ass.You kill children, then take your own life, where's the fucking justice in that? What are the families to do now? Where does their justice come from, again, my ass?It's a coward that does this, a selfish coward.permalinksaveparent[+]drew12 3 points4 points5 points 32 minutes ago (0 children)[]drew12 3 points4 points5 points 32 minutes agoHe never said it was justified, not sure where you're getting that from. I'd say complete despair is appropriate to describe this. As well as selfish. Not sure about coward.permalinksaveparent[+]arcticscrabble 2 points3 points4 points 32 minutes ago (0 children)[]arcticscrabble 2 points3 points4 points 32 minutes agoCoward isn't the right word, though. I agree with Phallic. It's a term of disgust, sure, but if the shooter was really just a coward, somebody afraid of things, he would have stayed at home. He wouldn't have gone through with a shooting that he knew would most likely result in his death. permalinksaveparent[+]skookybird 2 points3 points4 points 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]skookybird 2 points3 points4 points 29 minutes agoPlease calm down and stop talking as if Phallic is in any way defending the shooters actions (which would be ridiculous). We all agree that it was senseless, horrible, despicable, unjust (which is the only thing you make an argument for, and has no apparent connection to cowardice), and a billion other adjectives.Please give your definition of cowardice and explain why this qualifies.permalinksaveparent[+]coolbrys 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]coolbrys 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoIt's just semantics, especially considering words have special meanings to individuals. Coward or just plain insane though, this shooter did a horrific action to loads of innocent people, and no one knows how deep the ripple effect will go. I am so sorry for these people.permalinksaveparent[+]ologies 2 points3 points4 points 46 minutes ago (2 children)[]ologies 2 points3 points4 points 46 minutes agoWould it have been less cowardly somehow to shoot 18 fully-grown adults?There's a good chance the shooter(s) is/are gravely mentally ill. They're still deplorable human beings, but this had nothing to do with bravado.permalinksaveparent[+]narcisslol  comment score below threshold (1 child)[]narcisslol -7 points-6 points-5 points 40 minutes agoOh god, I don't have the time for this.permalinksaveparent[+]ologies 2 points3 points4 points 31 minutes ago (0 children)[]ologies 2 points3 points4 points 31 minutes agoThen you should probably reconsider openly stating your views in a public forum where anyone can respond and challenge them.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
