See More transition and get to the new details about the sandy hook gunman. Investigators have been combing every inch of adam lanza's life. They are looking for any clues that could help explain a motive behind the tragic shooting this past friday. Abc's brian ross has been following the story from the very start. And he joins with us the latest on the investigation. Reporter: Good morning, elizabeth. Police say they will go back to the day that adam lanza was born in their efforts to figure out the twisted motive behind this rampage. And why a young man so troubled would be given access to such powerful weapons by his mother. Even taken to target practice by her. Every gun shop and range within 15 miles of the crime scene is being canvassed by police and federal agents. They want to look at the last couple months to see what was Reporter: Authorities want to knowhy nancy lanza bought the bushmaster rifle that her son would use to kill her and other victims. That weapon, from the day it was built, to the day it was here, we'll look at it from stem to stern, who has had it. All of the clips, ammunitions. Reporter: Demonstrated here on the company youtube channel, the bushmaster rifle can fire 45 rounds in a minute, slightly modified so it is legal for sale, despite a connecticut ban on assault-style rifles. It's just as deadly. Whes it dangerous, of course, is the ability to take unlimited amounts of ammunition and a pistol grip. Reporter: The weapon was purchased legally in 2010, after the time adam's mother knew of serious issues. Even telling a babysitter years earlier, never to leave him alone. Nancy told me to always keep an eye on him. Reporter: Yet, for some reason, she felt comfortable introducing adam to one of the most dangerous weapons a civilian can own. It is just an extremely poor decision on her part. You're talking about sort of a psychological switch that i think got turned on for him, with the access of the weapons. And then, the ready availability. Reporter: This morning, a new york investment company tells abc news, it will sell its stake in bushmaster's parent company as a result of the sandy hook tragedy, which it called a watershed event that's raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level. At the time nancy lanza bought that weapon, the company was marketing the bushmaster as a gun for man's man. We're joined by one of america's leading psychologists. 1View CommentABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSsections:Most PopularU.S.WorldPoliticsBrian Ross InvestigatesHealthEntertainmentMoneyTechTravelExtreme VideoABC News AudioHome > Video > U.S. Thieves Make Off With Wii-ly Big HaulThieves Make Off With Wii-ly Big Haul$2 million worth of Wii gaming consoles were stolen from a Washington state warehouse.Newtown Elementary School Closed Over ThreatNewtown Elementary School Closed Over ThreatHead O' Meadow students were turned away from school after officials received a threat.Illinois Frat Members Charged in Hazing DeathIllinois Frat Members Charged in Hazing DeathNorthern Illinois University student David Bogenberger died after a night of heavy drinking.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooter: What Caused Shooting?Sandy Hook Elementary Shooter: What Caused Shooting?Forensic Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Welner discusses the shooter and possible cause of shooting.Sandy Hook Shooting: What Was Wrong with Adam Lanza?Sandy Hook Shooting: What Was Wrong with Adam Lanza?Brian Ross reports on clues to the possible motivation for the elementary school shooting.Gun Control Debate Resurfaces After Sandy Hook ShootingGun Control Debate Resurfaces After Sandy Hook ShootingThe president promised action on the search for solutions to gun violence.Who Was Newtown Gunman Adam Lanza?Who Was Newtown Gunman Adam Lanza?Troubling picture of Connecticut mass murderer slowly emerges.A Message of Hope from Newtown, Conn.A Message of Hope from Newtown, Conn.Sandy Hook shooting survivors stay hopeful in wake of tragedy.The Reality of Raising a Troubled ChildThe Reality of Raising a Troubled ChildParents speak out about the issues that can go with raising a mentally ill child.President Obama Pledges Action to Prevent More TragediesPresident Obama Pledges Action to Prevent More TragediesA new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows 54 percent of Americans favor stricter gun control.Day of Mourning in Newtown, Conn.Day of Mourning in Newtown, Conn.Funerals began for the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting.American Kids Head Back to SchoolAmerican Kids Head Back to SchoolAfter the shooting in Newton, Conn., schools across the country increase security.Sandy Hook Victims: Jack Pinto's Funeral HeldSandy Hook Victims: Jack Pinto's Funeral HeldThe 6-year-old shooting victim's favorite football team was the NY Giants.Sandy Hook Victims: Noah Pozner's Funeral Sandy Hook Victims: Noah Pozner's Funeral The 6-year-old, the youngest victim, and schoolmate Jack pinto were the first to be laid to rest.Newtown School Shooting Sparks False Postings on WebNewtown School Shooting Sparks False Postings on WebConnecticut police say people are posing as the 20-year-old shooter on social media sites.Previous | 2 of 3 | Next External links are provided for reference purposes.
