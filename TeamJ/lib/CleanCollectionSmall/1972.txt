It can fire ammo which Ignores Cover like the TF Cannon can, and (big advantage here) it can fire indirectly.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOpinions on Thunderfire Cannon  by  Cothordinin  Warhammer40k[+]GiantWhaleCannon 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]GiantWhaleCannon 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agothey cant move so you have to build your army around it.Well, most of my army will be mobile, but my idea is to have some Scouts hang back in an Aegis Defense Line.  Can the TF Cannon hide with them while other parts of the army advance?  (I ask because the Techmarine can help another band of Scouts by reinforcing a ruin.)permalinksavecontextfull commentsI was in Canton Ohio today, and decided to stop by the Hall of Fame.

Twice has he been the only thing standing between the nefarious Doctor Football (once known as Bill Belichick before Spygate drove him mad) and League domination, and twice has he prevailed against overwhelming odds.  If not for him, the whole country would have been conquered by the mad coach's nigh-invincible army of Patriot-Bots.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
