Then in 2000s, Koizumi gave it a final blow.Not saying other countries are any better, in fact some are worse than Japan.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate allgoo19's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate allgoo19's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserBornBadn1973                55 minutes agoJapan has the skilled workforce to make a comeback however they are plagued by the same issue the rest of the world has.... competing with China's slave workforce prices.. The U.N. and all countries need to tax China's imports to level the playing field and make trade fair for everyone... a better solution would be to have China pay fair wages to their people but I doubt that will happen..they're too busy building a nuclear arsenalReply 2 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate BornBadn1973's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate BornBadn1973's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserMySilverDestiny                1 hour ago---IMPORTANT--Ppl watch this true last MIRACLE, which said that is the last warning of our generation, A 2 days dead priest turn back to life right before he was buried, all caught on camera, 1000s ppl witnessedSearch for this video:Raised from the dead!
