Tons of prison money should really go to hospitals and psych wards. And we must examine what it is about our society that allows for these kinds of evil thoughts and actions to flourish.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I've found metacritic to provide a much more holistic view and more accurate meta score than rotten tomatoes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBecoming aware of feminism has made me stop enjoying media.

The question is rougly: How the WWI influenced Hemingway and how he sees it through his main characters in Farewel to Arms, In our Time and The Sun Also Rises? A backstory inside.  by  Othrondirin  AskLiteraryStudies[+]tmoraca 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]tmoraca 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoWell, since the course is in American Modernism and you prefer Hemingway, you have a bit of a feel for the tone of Modernism as expressed through his work, right? The war is a huge proponent of the whole tone of American Modernism, especially through Hemingway since he actually served (as an ambulance driver). I would first identify themes in those works that reflect the war and its effects on Hemingway and his contemporaries and then try to link that through his characters. Think about this: WWI was the first huge, I mean huge, international war. If you were thrust from youth in a burgeoning industrialized, commercialized America into service and the atrocities of a global war, how would you feel? How would it change your outlook on life? Try putting yourself in Hemingway's shoes to get a glimpse of where his themes and characters come from. Read essays about Hemingway's brand of philosophical naturalism and environmental determinism, which stem from his scientific upbringing (with a naturalist father, in the time of Agassiz and detailed field observations), but which is surely solidified with a cold cynicism by the war. Don't stress it; remember to always exhibit "grace under pressure."Source: I took a Hemingway & Fitzgerald class taught by a Hemingway scholar.
