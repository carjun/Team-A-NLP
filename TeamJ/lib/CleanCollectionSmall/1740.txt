I completely agree that interviewing kids right after the tragedy is completely unnecessary and tacky, but aside from that, these reporters are trying to get us the news. I'm sure those people didn't like cameras all over the place, but its those pics that stay with us and show us how the carnage actually played out.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow long would you let someone pee on you for $300 a day?

So let's get rid of cops. If someone really does want to get a gun, then they'll get it. But sending them to the hood where they could possibly get shot is a great preventer of this stuff than just seeing it in mom's closet. If you really want that gun, then go to the hood and get it. It shouldn't be that easy. permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]Mr_Titicaca 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Mr_Titicaca 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours agoHow is that infuriating?

I don't think mental issues should be an excuse, but it'd be good to know to at least find out if these really are rare cases or a mass problem of mental instability. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
