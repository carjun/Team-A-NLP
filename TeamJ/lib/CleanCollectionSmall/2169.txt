I promptly learned how to whittle with a pocket knife, which I thought was seriously cool shit. One day we were visiting my mom's cousins beach house on an island (required a ferry ride) and I decided to borrow my dad's knife to whittle some driftwood. The day I cut my finger tip almost all the way off was the day I learned you don't fuck around with knives and wet wood. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSomething that has worked amazingly well for me  by  bibithecatin  Fibromyalgia[+]sarochka 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]sarochka 1 point2 points3 points 12 days agoI was in the same boat as you. My symptoms kept increasing at a rapid rate and then I eventually had some extensive blood allergy tests run. I wasn't allergic to gluten or dairy (two if the big ones everyone suspects) but a whole bunch of seemingly benign foods (rosemary, chicken, brown rice, walnuts, and many more). As long as I keep those things out of my diet, my pain is less (although not much, but I'll take any little thing I can get), and my emotions are on an even keel (no more rage/depression, mood swings, etc). permalinksavecontextfull commentsClueless dad needs help finding a Christmas present for his 12 year old fashionista  by  mrhoopersin  femalefashionadvice[+]sarochka 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]sarochka 1 point2 points3 points 12 days agoIt really isn't that hard, especially with things like YouTube how to videos and the like.

If that's not available, stock up on Epsom salt for soaking baths, rice socks for helping sore muscles, and heating pads.

You seem like such an unlikely couple and I'd love to know the story behind you two. Kev, I'm such a fucking fangirl that I will take part in whatever you put out there. I read Tough Shit right after it came out and you are such an inspiration to a fellow artist that is trying to go where the puck is going to be (which is really hard wen everyone else in my industry is going where the puck is and making bank off of it). So thanks for that!And, I just have to say this...The best part about SModcast: I feel like we are friends even though we aren't. The worst part about SModcast: I feel like we are friends even though we aren't. (Can we be friends? I'll give you cake.)

Ask me anything.  by  ImRobertKingin  IAmA[+]sarochka 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]sarochka 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoHow did you get into this line of work? I'm a photographer and have dreams of doing something photo journalistic in areas that are not exactly war torn but still pretty bad off that never get attention (like the situation with Russian orphans and orphanages, for example). I haven't been able to find much info as to how to do this and am at a loss beyond simply paying for it out of pocket and doing it myself. Do you have any advice or tips or links as to how to turn this into a career?permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe president, the second most massive known tree on Earth (x-post from /r/pics)  by  Wolfhound_Papain  trees[+]sarochka 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]sarochka 0 points1 point2 points 14 days agoLooks like some Kashyyyk tree climbers are about to meet some wookies. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen I was a kid going on road trips, my dad would give us 1 dollar if we could spot a cop car. I always thought it was just a game to pass time, but later realized he just wanted to speed without getting caught. Any similar "tricks" you know of?  by  Sikiturin  AskReddit[+]sarochka 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]sarochka 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoMy mom has always played a lot of sports and was often bowling or playing racquetball on weekday evenings. My dad would tell me he would give me a dollar if I could take a bath (with washing everything correctly... no cheating) in one minute or less. I don't know if it was actually less than a minute, but I got my damn dollar almost every time. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNewborn (xpost from WTF credit to re_post_kid)  by  xoyiein  BabyBumps[+]sarochka 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]sarochka 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoBoth of my previous labors began with my water breaking naturally before any contractions.

However, growing up in south Texas it was impossible to escape it. "Remember When" by Alan Jackson has always made me emotional, but now that song reflects my life and I can't help but cry every time I hear it. I even cried looking up the lyrics 2 seconds ago.
