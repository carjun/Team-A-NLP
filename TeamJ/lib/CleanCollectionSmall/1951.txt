Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]aprestia 216 points217 points218 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]aprestia 216 points217 points218 points 1 day agoIt's because the killed little kids. Intentionally, not because they were in the way. It's possible the kids were the only targets and all the adults killed were only shot because they tried to stop them. We know people go crazy and think slaughtering people indiscriminately is a good idea. We know people will kill people they think have wronged them. We even know people are nuts enough to do things like murdering their own children when faced with the prospect of losing them.But slaughtering a whole bunch of little school children? They didn't wrong you. They weren't just in the way. That's a special kind of sick. And somehow there were two that felt this way.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

As her boyfriend, it's the OP's job to demonstrate to her that this isn't true.permalinksavecontextfull commentsA great discovery! Textured shelf liner keeps your junk drawer neat.

Or more specifically, by the time I got my second boyfriend, had sex and enjoyed it, while simultaneously starting to realize that teenage girls were all cunts. Until the age of about 15 all my crushes were on girls and I was reasonably sure I might be gay - ultimately I decided I'm actually bisexual, but most girls kind of annoy me, so I mostly stick with dudes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAMA Request: Someone who's been stranded on a deserted island  by  TheWorldAwaitsin  IAmA[+]aprestia 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI went to school with a guy named William Williams.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTil of Betelgeus: a massive star 450 light years away that may go supernova at any given moment and outshine the moon at night and be clearly visible during the day.  by  LexLuthor2012in  todayilearned[+]aprestia 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoNot that it has anything to do with what he was trying to say but we also don't see stars because of light reflecting off them - they are producing their own light.permalinksavecontextfull comments"I can't save this file.

Our IT guys seemed at a loss too. However since it quickly didn't effect me anymore I stopped caring. The error message just said something like "cannot save xxx.pdf to [volume]" with no reason or anything, and all other types of files saved fine. Same error message whether it was a PDF downloaded from an email or from a website or created from another document. Very strange indeed.permalinksavecontextfull comments"I can't save this file. I've attached it so you can see."  by  theOtherJTin  talesfromtechsupport[+]aprestia 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoActually... I had an issue at my old job where, after extensive security upgrades to all of our workstations, for some reason I never got solved (spent a half hour on the phone with IT about it to no end but then moved to a new location a few days later, so fuck it) I couldn't save PDF files to the computer. All other files, yes. PDF files, no. But if I received an email with a PDF attachment, I could easily forward it on to someone else. Not saying this is what happened but it's possible.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are the best boxed wines?  by  tiltedsunin  Frugal[+]aprestia 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoThey're not bad, but they're also not that cheap IIRC.

I'll make low fat, low sugar cranberry bran muffins for breakfast every once in a while, and I think they're delicious, but they're nothing like your average coffee shop muffin.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?  by  aprestiain  Frugal[+]aprestia[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoNo I don't have a costco membership, and I've got a good 10 lb of rice I liberated from my last job when they discontinued it from the menu. I really don't buy any food I can't get for a dirt cheap rate, which save the occasional clearance item or incredible special isn't really anything from my local grocery store. At any rate, aside from milk and eggs (definitely cheapest from aldi) and the occasional fresh vegetable (definitely not from my supermarket) I'm currently well stocked on most staples anyway. In an ideal world I'd use it to stock up on the few items I don't typically buy from Aldi for the future but I'm so strapped for cash at the moment even that seems like a luxury.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?  by  aprestiain  Frugal[+]aprestia[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoI'm just not buying anything other than food at the moment, and I have a hard time convincing myself to spend more money than necessary on food, even if it's free. Actually while I'd always love to buy food at this point I'm so poor I'd happily live off the pasta and beans in my pantry for an extended period of time if it meant being able to pay my credit card bills. Utilities I don't pay myself so that's a nonstarter.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?  by  aprestiain  Frugal[+]aprestia[S] -3 points-2 points-1 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia[S] -3 points-2 points-1 points 13 days agoWell that's a fair point except the closest Walmart is 20 miles away, I just can't see the wisdom is driving any distance (spending money) to get food for more than the minimum price (which is Aldi by far around here) when I am struggling just to pay my bills.  It wouldn't be a problem if I weren't unemployed - sure, I have lots of stuff I LIKE to buy. But I can't in good conscious by any of them at the moment.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?  by  aprestiain  Frugal[+]aprestia[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoThis is actually a really good idea, I didn't even think of it, thanks!permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?  by  aprestiain  Frugal[+]aprestia[S] -1 points0 points1 point 13 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia[S] -1 points0 points1 point 13 days agoDepends on the card I believe but after a fair amount of google searching I've not found anything to indicate that I can use this particular card for any of the things that I need to.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?  by  aprestiain  Frugal[+]aprestia[S] 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia[S] 1 point2 points3 points 13 days agoOh my god I just remembered one of my roommates has this for his band, I wondered he'd swap me cash for the payment...

I'm going to see if I can sell on the balance to a friend I think because I can't afford to spend any more money than necessary at this point and I really can't afford food from most places nearby except Aldi.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?  by  aprestiain  Frugal[+]aprestia[S] -4 points-3 points-2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia[S] -4 points-3 points-2 points 13 days agoLovely idea, aside from my lack of friends and the fact that I'm already halfway through homemade scarves for the few I do have, and everyone always loves the candy I make them at Christmas so I'm not inclined to skip that part either.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?  by  aprestiain  Frugal[+]aprestia[S] -16 points-15 points-14 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]aprestia[S] -16 points-15 points-14 points 13 days agoOnly shop at Aldi, they only take debit and cash.permalinksavecontextfull comments24000What should I do with an AMEX gift card when nothing I need money for can be charged?
