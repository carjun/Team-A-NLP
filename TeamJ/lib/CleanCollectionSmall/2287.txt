Thing is, people say they like spy movies or spy books but what they really like are spy thrillers (Bourne, spy games) or spy action (bond) but most spy movies (the good shepard) bore people. Spy movies are slow and 98% dialog. For Tinker tailor, you also need to understand a little, cold war ideology as well as how ussr and England also treats people including their own during those times. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Bigger the population more likely hood for it to happen. There have been school stabbings in Japan and other countries that I can remember. But personally I think it's a mix of the greater percentage of people who feel hopeless, depressed, apathetic and angry or any mix there of. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

What I'm saying is, it's such a big thing there that they do massage them a lot and give a whole level of care regular cows will never see.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJamie Foxx turns 'The Brady Bunch' theme song into a sexy slow jam...ridiculously talented.  by  iwouldfuckmostthingsin  videos[+]Shiftkgb 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Shiftkgb 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoHis standup about him going to Africa and having to watch out for SUPER-AIDS was fucking hilarious.

This works during the "battle for the fort" quest of each piece. I assume it's a clever way for stealth characters to stay in character and not have to fight in an open battlefield. The Jarl will comment "you're a clever one" or something similar when he falls to his/her knees.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDid the Nerevarine buy the farm?  by  bishop546in  teslore[+]Shiftkgb 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]Shiftkgb 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoIIRC  it's also mentioned in a book in Oblivion. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat snake venom does to blood  by  Kronsonin  WTF[+]Shiftkgb 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]Shiftkgb 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agohttp://www.reptilechannel.com/reptile-news/2012/12/06/egyptian-cobra-escapes-on-egyptair-jet.aspxpermalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Demetri Martin, AMA.  by  IAmDemetriMartinin  IAmA[+]Shiftkgb 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]Shiftkgb 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoHere I'll answer for him, money.Or to expand, money and exposure. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDoes this horrify anyone else?
