It was a crime scene on Tuesday, with police coming and going past a line of 26 Christmas trees, one for each victim, decorated with ornaments, stuffed animals and balloons in the school colors of green and white.The rest ofNewtown's schools reopened with grief counselors and police present, while two families buried their children."It's going to be awful, doing the things we used to do," saidMiguel, 16, who stopped by a doughnut shop on his way toNewtown High School. "There's going to be a lot of tears."The massacre prompted some Republican lawmakers to open the door to a national debate about gun control, a small sign of easing in Washington's entrenched reluctance to seriously consider new federal restrictions.The NRA uses political pressure against individual lawmakers and others to press for loosening constraints on gun sales and ownership across theUnited Stateswhile promoting hunting and gun sports.The group, which said it had not commented until now out of respect for the families and to allow time for mourning and an investigation, planned a news conference on Friday.Newtown buries its childrenPresidentBarack Obamacalled for action at a Sunday night prayer vigil inNewtown, and Democratic lawmakers have sought a new push for U.S. gun restrictions, including a ban on assault weapons such as theBushmasterAR-15-style assault rifle used by Lanza.The 20-year-old gunman carried hundreds of rounds of ammunition in extra clips and shot his victims repeatedly, one of them 11 times.
