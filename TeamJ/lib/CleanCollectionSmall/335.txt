The gunman in one of the worst mass shootings in the nations history forced his way into the elementary school where his mother worked before unleashing his arsenal in two classrooms, authorities said Saturday.There had been reports that the principal of the Sandy Hook Elementary School had recognized the shooter, identified as Adam Lanza of Newtown, and let him into the building where he shot and killed 20 children and six adults. But that did not happen, said Lt. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut state police.VIOREL FLORESCU / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHERPolice outside 1313 Grand St. in Hoboken on Friday, Dec. 14. Both the principal, identified as Dawn Hochsprung, and the shooters mother, Nancy, were among Lanzas victims.Vance said the gunman was not voluntarily let into the school. He added that investigators have unearthed very good evidence that hopefully will be painting a complete picture as to how, or more importantly, why this occurred.Vance in a press conference would not elaborate on how Lanza managed to get inside the school on Friday morning. Shattered windows in the front of the building had been broken by authorities attempting to rescue students and staff. Vance also declined to comment further on evidence that he said would point toward a motive.In addition, authorities on Friday night had said they expected to release the names of the 26 victims, but on Saturday morning, they said the information would not be available until the afternoon, at the earliest.Lanza, 20, shot and killed his mother at the home they shared in Newtown before driving to Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he began shooting, police said. He carried at least two guns and wore a bulletproof vest.The death toll of 28, including the gunman, far exceeded the 13 victims and two gunmen who died in 1999 at Columbine High School in Colorado and was surpassed only by the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, which left 32 victims and the gunman dead.A tearful President Obama addressed the massacre Friday afternoon, speaking of the beautiful little kids who had their entire lives ahead of them  birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.Newtown at a glanceThe Town of Newtown is an upscale municipality of about 27,500 people. It covers 60 square miles in a mostly rural area of northern Fairfield County. Sitting about 65 miles northwest of New York City and just to the east of Danbury, it has about the same number of people as Paramus, but is about six times the size. More than half the adults in Newtown have college degrees, and nearly half the households are families with children. Here are the demographics of the town, according to the U.S. Census Bureau:Population: 27,560People per square mile: 470RaceWhite: 94%Hispanic: 3%Asian: 1%Other: 2%AgeUnder 18:  30%18 to 64:  56%65 and older: 14%Education: Adults with college degree: 54%Household makeupFamilies with children: 39%Single parents: 7%Singles: 17%Married couples with no children, and others: 37%HousingOwners: 89%Renters: 11%Median home price: $450,000Median household income: $111,000Our hearts are broken today, Obama said, adding that the nation has been through this too many times. He referred to a shooting earlier this week at an Oregon mall and shootings this past summer at a Wisconsin temple and a Colorado movie theater.Were going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics, he said.Hundreds of people gathered Friday night for a vigil at St. Rose Roman Catholic Church, some holding their children tightly as they stood outside, shivering in the cold, because there wasnt enough room inside. They spoke in whispers and gathered in group hugs. Some held a single rose or candle.People wrote messages on a bulletin board inside the church. Under a sign that read In Our Hearts, one person wrote, simply, All of the kids.As the nation grieved, it was not clear what could have been done to prevent the shooting. Police said Lanza carried a Glock and a Sig Sauer pistol into the school  both reported to be legally purchased and registered to Lanzas mother  and a .223-caliber rifle was found in her car that he parked outside. There was no information available Friday on what led Lanza to target children.The investigation extended to Hoboken on Friday afternoon, as police surrounded an apartment building on Grand Street where Lanzas older brother, Ryan, lives. Ryan Lanza, 24, who was led out of his building in handcuffs, had nothing to do with the shooting and was cooperating with authorities by providing information about his brother, police said.Ryan Lanza told law enforcement that Adam was believed to suffer from a personality disorder, said a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified. He said Ryan Lanza told authorities that he had not seen his younger brother since 2010.Evil visited this community today, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Friday evening. Its too early to speak of recovery. The children, the beautiful, beautiful children, came to school to learn, and their day ended in a very different way than any of us could have imagined.Immediate panicThe shooting led to a lockdown at other schools in the area. A senior at Newtown High School, Nick Sajovic, said he broke the news to his classmates after reading about it on Twitter. He said students were terrified and huddled as rumors, later determined to be false, circulated that there was a second gunman. They feared the high school would be the next target, he said.Sajovic said the younger brother of one of his friends was killed.When you see something like Columbine or Virginia Tech, you dont look at it as closely, he said. Its a little close to home when you see some of your friends get hurt like that.Governor Christie expressed his condolences, calling the shootings an unspeakable tragedy, but said tougher gun laws would have a limited effect on preventing future massacres  though he added that it was important to examine this incident closely to see whether any lessons could be learned.Bad people do bad things, and I dont know that theres anything we could do in general to stop bad people, disturbed people, from committing awful acts, he said.U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey issued a statement calling Friday a great day of sadness in America and saying action should be taken to address gun violence Americans are sick and tired of these attacks on our children and neighbors and they are sick and tired of nothing being done in Washington to stop the bloodshed, he said.A spokesman for the Connecticut state police, Lt. Paul Vance, said 18 children and six adults died at the scene and two children died in a local hospital. He said a 27th victim, a female teacher who had been shot in the foot, was taken to a hospital. The medical examiner is expected to determine the identities of all of the victims by this morning, Vance said.The children were between 5 and 10 years old.One first-grade teacher, Kaitlin Roig, herded her students into a bathroom and locked the door to keep them safe, said her father, Pat Roig.She refused to open it even when police arrived, he said. Even after they showed their badges, she told them they could open the door with a key, if they really were the police.She fit 15 little kids into a 3-by-3 bathroom and they were very quiet, her father said, adding that his daughter was suffering from shock Friday and did not want to be interviewed. Shes having a terrible time with the shock and grief. Were all trying to understand the grief.Teachers hid childrenParents converged on the school, about 60 miles northeast of New York City, desperately looking for their children. As the shooting began a little after 9:30 a.m., students cowered in classrooms. A custodian ran through the halls, warning of a gunman on the loose, and someone switched on the intercom, alerting people in the building to the attack.Teachers locked their doors and ordered children to huddle in a corner or hide in closets as shots echoed through the building. They later fled with the help of teachers and police, who told them to close their eyes as they were led from the building.A photo taken by The Newtown Bee newspaper showed a group of young students, some of them crying and visibly frightened, being escorted by adults through a parking lot in a line with their hands on each others shoulders.Robert Licata said his 6-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher.Thats when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door, he told The Associated Press. He was very brave. He waited for his friends.The shooter, he said, didnt say a word.Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter, who was unharmed, heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner, the AP reported.Its alarming, especially in Newtown, Conn., which we always thought was the safest place in America, he said.Richard Wilfords 7-year-old son, Richie, is in the second grade at the school. His son told him that he heard a noise that sounded like what he described as cans falling.The boy told him a teacher went out to check on the noise, came back in, locked the door and had the kids huddle up in the corner until police arrived.Theres no words, Wilford said. Its sheer terror, a sense of imminent danger, to get to your child and be there to protect him.Danny McCarthy, a 14-year-old attending Friday nights vigil, said he knows a first-grader who grabbed the arm of a friend and ran out the door when the shooting began.They made it, he said, adding that they were found later walking around the neighborhood that surrounds the school.Danbury Hospital, 12 miles west of Newtown, was prepared to handle a large number of victims. Within 10 minutes of the shooting, the hospital assembled four trauma teams consisting of 80 surgeons, pediatricians and other medical personnel, said John Murphy, the hospitals president and CEO.But the anticipated number of patients never arrived. All but three of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene. And two of the three patients taken to the hospital, both of them children, died there.Staff Writers Stephanie Akin, Richard Cowen, John C.
