The music in Little Inferno does a perfect job at adding atmosphere at the right times (specifically with letters/mail and the 'last part' of the game), and Fez just has good music which doesn't just feel like background.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn 2015 the very first European Olympics will take place in Baku, Azerbaijan  by  angriersin  olympics[+]historyisgr8 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoIt's actually a damn good indicator (see what Robertej92 wrote), but for the record I don't believe the Olympics is about getting as many gold medals as you possibly can, if anything it's supporting athletes as individuals hoping that they achieve the best that they possibly can in their own abilities.I was just a bit struck at how such an arrogant post (on the olympic subreddit of all reddits) got upvoted so much, so I replied with a bit of a reality check. My post got downvoted though, of course :p The truth hurts if you hold an ignorant opinion.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn 2015 the very first European Olympics will take place in Baku, Azerbaijan  by  angriersin  olympics[+]historyisgr8 -2 points-1 points0 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 -2 points-1 points0 points 5 days agoConsider population, http://www.medalspercapita.com/permalinksavecontextfull commentsKate Middleton's Receptionist Found Dead In London Days After Being Duped By Prank Callers  by  Leesburgcapsfanin  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoYou shouldn't prank or be mean to someone who you don't even know.permalinksavecontextfull commentsApple CEO Tim Cook announces plans to manufacture Mac computers in USA starting in 2013  by  arontxin  technology[+]historyisgr8 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoI don't know what to saypermalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James's Palace has announced.  by  redditor53225253in  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 9 days agoIndeed, but they specifically campaign for the royal family to have more power, so that there is an excuse to remove the royal family. It doesn't really make sense to take away power from those who are elected in so that a monarch can have power, just so that theres an excuse to remove axe the royal family.Their website also brings up a number of odd points, like:Expensive, unaccountable and a drag on our democratic process, the monarchy is a broken institution. A head of state that's chosen by us could really represent our hopes and aspirations - and stop politicians exceeding their powers.How are they expensive when they generate money directly and indirectly? How do they drag on the democratic process? Why is it a broken institution if no valid points have been given? Why do you want a voted-in head of state who has the ability to axe voted in politicians? Are they basically wanting a voted-in monarch? Doesn't that then drag on the democratic process?Basically, either their message is unclear, or they have a few cogs missing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James's Palace has announced.  by  redditor53225253in  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 9 days agoYou may have missed it (though probably not as it had 1 downvote about 5 minutes after i posted it), but here is my post from earlier > http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/147elm/the_duchess_of_cambridge_is_expecting_a_baby_st/c7b33q8permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James's Palace has announced.  by  redditor53225253in  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago*(0 children)[]historyisgr8 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago*You're basically saying one whole side of this 'debate' is nulled because you believe the other side are puppets, which doesn't exactly show your point very well.Personally, I don't really see why people take so much offense to the royals.Edit: Though, the "Billions" statement from who you first replied to isn't exactly correct (The royal family only generates 160 million for the UK, whereas tourism indirectly generates $17.5 billion in 2011)permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James's Palace has announced.  by  redditor53225253in  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 9 days agoIt's because overall they're a huge positive to the country, rather than a huge negative.

So does slave trade and colonial imperialism. I'm not fully educated on 'druids' so I'll have to leave that, but I'll try to do some research.Some things get left behind with progress.Like the king/queen ruling everything about the country. Now they don't have power, and are just figureheads, like celebrities.I'd say when your argument boils down to "because celebrity culture," then you don't really have one.I'm afraid that's a bit of a null point then, leave the "They don't deserve what they're born with" at the doorpermalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James's Palace has announced.  by  redditor53225253in  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 10 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 10 days agoThat would be a loss due to people not seeing the royal family in the same light.

The, and they're part of our history. They have no influence in politics so if you don't like them that's not a problem. If your worried about them having a luxury life for no effort, see "celebrities". You can't honestly tell me footballers and used pop teenagers deserve more than someone who saves in taxes and help run the countries relations. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James's Palace has announced.  by  redditor53225253in  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 2 points3 points4 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 2 points3 points4 points 10 days agoYour humour is falling flat on its stomach. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James's Palace has announced.  by  redditor53225253in  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 -2 points-1 points0 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 -2 points-1 points0 points 10 days agoWe'd lose money, as the royal family bring in money due to tourism alone.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James's Palace has announced.  by  redditor53225253in  worldnews[+]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 10 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 -1 points0 points1 point 10 days agoAnd then have to pay more taxes to replace the amount of money the tourism brings us.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat games have you regretted buying the most this year?  by  Gamblor7in  Games[+]historyisgr8 2 points3 points4 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 2 points3 points4 points 11 days agoMists of Pandariapermalinksavecontextfull commentsHitler cracks a joke at FDR's expense  by  NewUSSRin  videos[+]historyisgr8 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]historyisgr8 1 point2 points3 points 13 days agoOr not.
