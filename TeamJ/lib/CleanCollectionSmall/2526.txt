You can call them rare if it makes you feel better, but relative to every other civilized society on Earth (and also the uncivilized ones), they're not, even when you adjust for population size.Guns are a complicated issue all around, as is mental health care in the US and how it plays into these issues, but those are the numbers.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 8 points9 points10 points 1 hour ago (20 children)[]StrahansToothGap 8 points9 points10 points 1 hour agosource?permalinksaveparent[+]cyclicamp 3 points4 points5 points 53 minutes ago (3 children)[]cyclicamp 3 points4 points5 points 53 minutes agoAfter searching "Anthony de Rosa school shootings Reuters," the first result here leads one to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which has a comprehensive listing of U.S. school shootings.  Unable to confirm international numbers but first-glance sources such as Wikipedia and CNN summary articles circumstantially back it up.And in the rare cases where people actually cite something, you can do this yourself too.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes ago (2 children)[]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes agoI understand that.  I'm reading a bunch of things during this right now, and if someone is presenting information, I just simply asked if they can point to a source since they've apparently already done the investigation.  I don't think that is so terrible.  I am self-sufficient, but I am also smart enough to not do work that's already done.  Technically, everything on reddit you can investigate yourself.  It's convenient when people bring it to you though.  permalinksaveparent[+]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (1 child)[]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoI apologize for being short.  Usually when I see someone typing "source" and nothing else they're doing it to express disbelief, and seeing it in response to a post with a citation seemed lazy since most of the work was done at that point.In other words, I was not expecting it to mean something rational like "Could you please expand upon that citation with a link?" since in all my time here it hadn't before.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes agoCool.  Not a problem at all.  And, you are right, I probably should have expanded on what I meant instead of saying 'source' without context like an ass.  Regardless, I enjoy an actual educational exchange with another redditor in which we can admit our faults. permalinksaveparent[+]rocketvat 9 points10 points11 points 1 hour ago (9 children)[]rocketvat 9 points10 points11 points 1 hour agoaccording to Anthony de Rosa from Reuters. permalinksaveparent[+]IsaacLeibniz -5 points-4 points-3 points 50 minutes ago (8 children)[]IsaacLeibniz -5 points-4 points-3 points 50 minutes agoAccording to the science journal "Nature" aliens have been found and exist in our solar system.See how that works?permalinksaveparent[+]rocketvat 2 points3 points4 points 48 minutes ago (7 children)[]rocketvat 2 points3 points4 points 48 minutes agoYou're a guy on the internet and he's from Reuters?

Someone listed an article that quoted a guy saying something from Reuters (the news agency).  Someone else asked for a source for the thing; the source was the guy from Reuters.  I quoted the part of the paragraph that said the guy from Reuters said the thing.  And now here we are with you talking about aliens and calling me retarded while reflexively downvoting my posts.permalinksaveparent[+]IsaacLeibniz 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (2 children)[]IsaacLeibniz 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoFirst, I didn't ask for a source. Secondly, no one listed an article. The guy said "blah blah blah" according to guy from reuters. THAT'S NOT A FUCKING SOURCE.I ask again, are you fucking retarded?Do you see a link here, you fucking idiot? http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/14uh3l/shooting_at_connecticut_elementary_school/c7gkf42permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]mygrapefruit 0 points1 point2 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]mygrapefruit 0 points1 point2 points 50 minutes agohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting might be a place to start?permalinksaveparent[+]GuaranteedSMS 0 points1 point2 points 42 minutes ago (0 children)[]GuaranteedSMS 0 points1 point2 points 42 minutes agohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting#Notable_school_shootingspermalinksaveparent[+]usrname42 0 points1 point2 points 40 minutes ago (0 children)[]usrname42 0 points1 point2 points 40 minutes agoAnthony de Rosa retweeted someone who linked to this websitepermalinksaveparent[+]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 35 minutes ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 35 minutes agoA couple of the incidents included in this data are non-school, but remove those and it shows a similar split between US shootings and international: http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0777958.html. Not sure if this was the data set de Rosa was citing or not, but it shows the same trend.Almost any news article that you read about school shootings cites the US's heavily elevated rate over the rest of the world. This isn't a big secret.permalinksaveparent[+]derrick81787 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]derrick81787 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour agoI second StrahansToothGap's request for a source.Additionally, I consider other ways of meeting a violent death to be just as bad as being shot to death.  If your numbers turn out to be true, and hypothetically, there were 2 mass stabbings in the US but 50 mass stabbings in the other countries, then I would think that the US comes out on top here.  However, things like that are not taken into consideration with the numbers that you present.permalinksaveparent[+]Stooby 1 point2 points3 points 49 minutes ago (0 children)[]Stooby 1 point2 points3 points 49 minutes agoI think I would rather have a mass stabber than a mass shooter.
