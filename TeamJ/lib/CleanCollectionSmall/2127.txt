People are items to these type of killers. It's hard for us to grasp but to them we are of no significance. permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]chrissymad 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoI dunno about this particular person not feeling any emotions. Seems too attached to the situation for that to be the case. The fact that he killed his mother and father and the school was his mother's workplace makes me wonder if there were emotional issues with his parents. But who knows, I'd also like to believe that he'd have to be a sociopath to have the gall to murder so many young children. permalinksaveparent[+]infectedtwin 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]infectedtwin 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI just assume the gunmen are sociopath in these type situations. I was not aware of the context. Wow. I just still can't grasp the fact that it happened at an Elementary school. The worst place. Damnpermalinksaveparent[+]junkit33 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]junkit33 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI'm not even sure it's that.  No human emotions means no motive.  This guy was likely psychologically broken in a way that made him hate children.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
