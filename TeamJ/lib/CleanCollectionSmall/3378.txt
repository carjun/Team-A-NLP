Young children were attacked, and 20 of them killed.The carnage brought upon a small American town by a gunman seems so unbelievable that I share your hurt for those parents who lost their children.These kids were not yet aware of the evil that lurks in this world. They went to school Friday morning carrying innocence as their shield from the worse this planet has to offer. That innocence was stolen from them; as were their classmates. The toll seems like a horror movie  20 children and six adults taken from their families; their futures snatched away by a monster who could have done the world a favor by making this Friday like any other  uneventful.Questions begin to surface in the aftermath of such tragedies. Questions like, "What has society come to? What makes a person decide to commit such a heinous act? How can we protect our children?"Today is Sunday. It's a day to thank God for the life you are given, for the family you enjoy and the children who have blessed our homes. Today more than ever, we need to ask God to keep those children safe.When I was a child, we roamed the streets, road our bikes to school and enjoyed playing all day without worry.Now days, we have become a society that seems to have the need for a bubble surrounding our families just to keep them safe. Who thinks when they send their small child to school there is a chance that they will be gunned down in their classroom? Before Friday, nobody. Today, every parent isn't so sure anymore.We've now endured  as a nation  killings in colleges, high schools, middle schools and now a rural elementary school. We've seen killers gun down innocent people in a movie theatre and in a mall.In 2001 the events in New York and Washington D.C. changed us forever  we were attacked on 9-11 by evil from a foreign country. As a result, we made changes in our security as a nation. We altered the way we accept visitors from other nations; we now take no chances in guarding our borders.But what do you do when the evil comes from within? How can we curtail the violence that has been unleashed on our children in buildings that are supposed to foster positive influence?As parents, we send our children to school to learn ... to grow ... to become better people. Friday, the children who entered Sandy Hook Elementary have had their lives changed forever. Their innocence is lost. I pray that each and every parent will have the strength to guide their children forward from this. I pray that each and every parent who lost their child Friday will cope with that loss and be able to move forward somehow. I shed tears for them today and even though I cannot begin to fathom the pain, I can sympathize as a parent.Debates will rage regarding gun control, or whether violent video games are having an effect on society. I have no clue what the answer is, nor the reason why this man chose to take so many lives. I know that we've had guns available in society for decades, but as a child, my parents didn't have to explain the type of violence we are forced to explain to our kids now.Again, I cannot pretend to have the answers. I know this ... something needs to be done. Children in a kindergarten class should not have to think about whether or not they will be attacked by a man wielding a gun. Danger is no longer located in the dark alleys of our inner cities. It has visited the most innocent of places and wreaked havoc.One Sandy Hook parent said Friday that he had a talk with his child recently about there being a "one in a zillion chance" something like this could happen to that school. It happened, and it's happening all too often.Let's not forget the victims at Sandy Hook Elementary. Please, let's all come together and figure out a way to protect our children. One more innocent life taken is going to be one too many. Leaders of our schools, our communities, our governments ... let's figure this out.Events CalendarConnect with Southwest Daily News - Sulphur, LAFacebookTwitterRSSBack to top                Site Services Contact Us Purchase Photos E-Edition Announcements                Market Place Classifieds Place an Ad Autos Real Estate Let's Go Shopping                Site Links Moss Bluff Vinton Westlake Featured Advertisers                Sister Publications Bastrop Daily Enterprise Beauregard Daily News Donaldsonville Chief Weekly Citizen Leesville Daily Leader Post SouthSign up for our Daily DealsRadarFrog Merchant DirectoryPropel MarketingRadarFrogStay InformedEmail NewsLetterSignup TodaySign up for our newsletter and have the top headlines from your community delivered right to your inbox.Your privacy is important, read our privacy policy.
