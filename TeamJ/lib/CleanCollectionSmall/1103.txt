Then, a cataloguing of Lanzas arsenal: Multiple weapons, including one rifle and handguns.It had been a half hour since the killer blasted his way into the hilltop school that housed 600 students in kindergarten through fourth grade.There had been no mention on open channels of how many people had died. But at 10 a.m., there was a frantic call, in police lingo, for ambulances.We need buses here. ASAP, said someone at the scene.Send the ambulance right up to me  Get the bus!
