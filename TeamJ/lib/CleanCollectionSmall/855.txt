It's not a bad system just by itself, but it has been taken to an extreme.  Like the whole story with Schoolcraft.  Other departments have adopted a similar system.  Like a lot of things, it becomes about the numbers.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFBI dads spyware experiment accidentally exposes pedophile principal  by  shallahin  news[+]LoftyDog -2 points-1 points0 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]LoftyDog -2 points-1 points0 points 11 days agoIn this case it doesn't help the principal that it was the schools computer so there's less of an expectation of privacy.  But take that away, say I  break into Mr. X's house and stumble upon child porn, I leave and call in an anonymous tip (unlikely story but just go with the hypothetical).  Cops get a warrant, find the evidence, and arrest the Mr. X.  Even though my actions were illegal and Mr. X had every expectation of privacy, as long as the search warrant was valid and executed properly, Mr. X is going to be convicted.  His only legal remedy  might be to sue me if he could ever figure out who I was.  And potentially I could be arrested for trespassing.  I had no right to do what I did, but it was still done.As far as the child porn cartoons and the like, and trust me I am in no way condoning child porn, the laws are messed up in many respects.  I'm not familiar with any case involving drawings but if they "look" underage it's scary that someone wold be arrested for it.  People get stiffer sentences for child porn than actually molesting the kids.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFBI dads spyware experiment accidentally exposes pedophile principal  by  shallahin  news[+]LoftyDog 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]LoftyDog 1 point2 points3 points 12 days agoI don't disagree with you that the line can be blurry.  In this case, I think he was acting on his own.  If he was having it sent to his FBI email rather than his private one and if he was doing it while he was supposed to be working that would be another factor.  I don't believe just because he works for the government he can't do things in a private capacity.As for you hypothetical, he technically would be guilty of having child porn, but realistically, I doubt he would be charged with it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFBI dads spyware experiment accidentally exposes pedophile principal  by  shallahin  news[+]LoftyDog 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]LoftyDog 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago4th amendment protection only extends to the government.  If a private citizen does something to get information and then gives it to the government, there's no protection from that.  The FBI agent wasn't acting in any official capacity so it was as if he was acting as a private citizen.  It's a scary thought but nothing new as far as protection goes.
