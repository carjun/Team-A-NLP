But people will still say "everything happens for a reason" and "god has a plan for all of us".permalinksaveparent[+]sfw-dyer 4 points5 points6 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]sfw-dyer 4 points5 points6 points 27 minutes agothe two things that always happen after a tragedy. argue politics. argue God. let's not.permalinksaveparent[+]thefreshscent 10 points11 points12 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]thefreshscent 10 points11 points12 points 27 minutes agoIt's pretty hard to believe in a god that would allow....I hate this. I am not arguing about religion or whether or not there is a God, but the whole point of God and Christianity is free-will and allowing people to make their own choices, regardless of the consequences. If you are expecting a lightning bolt to shoot down and preemptively murder the attacker, you are going to have a bad time.permalinksaveparent[+]luckdomain 2 points3 points4 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]luckdomain 2 points3 points4 points 27 minutes agoDon't be angered when they say things like that. People make statements like that to try to make sense of a crazy world that in fact often has no rhyme or reason. Yes, it's an opiate, but it's an opiate some people need to function. We all have our things we do and say just to get by in life, especially when such a tragedy occurs.permalinksaveparent[+]Mailman487 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]Mailman487 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes agoMy thoughts exactly permalinksaveparent[+]epocson -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes ago*(0 children)[]epocson -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes ago*My Facebook feed is littered with "Thoughts and Prayers go out to the families" I know they mean well, and its just what people do in situations like this but.  What are you praying for?  The kids and teachers are already dead.  They needed your prayers at 8am this morning. not an hour after the shooting.Edit: This came across poorly.  I don't mind the "thoughts and prayers" messages, I just don't understand what they are praying for.  That whole thing escapes me.  I'm sorry if it came off as insensitive.permalinksaveparent[+]he_eats_da_poo_poo -1 points0 points1 point 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]he_eats_da_poo_poo -1 points0 points1 point 10 minutes agoHow about we actually not bring religion into everything for a change.  permalinksaveparent[+]The_Keg 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]The_Keg 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoYour argument is fucking disgusting, Lets exploit these dead children and point out how stupid religious people are, what a self righteous cunt. permalinksaveparent[+]OhJustNothing 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]OhJustNothing 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoI hope this isn't terribly insensitive, but as a Christian I'd just like to add some insight here. I think it's very closed-minded to say that a God can't be good if he lets bad things happen. He gives us all a choice to do good or bad things, and he won't necessarily stop us if we make the wrong choice. It's like when you tell a toddler not to touch something hot. Sometimes you need to let them experience the consequences for them to really get it.I realize this may not be a satisfactory answer, and this is far more complicated and tragic situation than that, but I'm just trying to show you the Christian perspective on things like this. It's a way of thinking. I'm really not here to debate this, I'm just offering another perspective on the subject, take it or leave it. Hope this helps.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 38 minutes ago (1 child)[][deleted] 38 minutes ago[deleted]permalinksaveparent[+]cynicroute 3 points4 points5 points 35 minutes ago (0 children)[]cynicroute 3 points4 points5 points 35 minutes agoYou are the only one arguing about religion.
