When Marc Anthony incites an angry mob against Caesar's killers, they find some dude named Cinna.  This cat was just a poet, some poor artist bastard, but he had the same name as one of the senators, Cinna.The mob didn't care that he was the wrong Cinna and tore him to pieces for his name.Seems we haven't really changed much in five centuries.permalinksaveparent[+]GiantWhaleCannon 10 points11 points12 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]GiantWhaleCannon 10 points11 points12 points 21 hours ago"No no no!

I'm sorry, I don't do my best work under duress."permalinksaveparent[+]Sn1pe 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Sn1pe 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoThis reminds me of the time of the Trayvon Martin vs George Zimmerman case when some guy on Twitter who had the same name as Trayvon started gaining so many followers. About half of his tweets were addressing people that he was obviously not the then deceased Trayvon Martin.permalinksaveparent[+]FleshyMeatCreature 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]FleshyMeatCreature 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoAbout half of his tweets were addressing people that he was obviously not the then deceased Trayvon Martin.And yet, people still didn't understand.permalinksaveparent[+]annodomini 2 points3 points4 points 12 hours ago (1 child)[]annodomini 2 points3 points4 points 12 hours agoWait a sec. You're saying we haven't really changed much from a fictional account of something that had happened 1500 years earlier? And that "lots of people reporting the wrong guy as the killer" is no different than "tearing the wrong guy to pieces"?You know, I think that a civil society in which people's mistakes lead only to verbal abuse is much better than one in which someone is torn to pieces for a mistaken identity.permalinksaveparent[+]WadeK 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]WadeK 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoDo you think if he was walking down the street and someone said, "Dude, that's the guy who killed those kids" that nobody would assault him?  I think it's verbal abuse simply because they were separated by the internet.  Some of the comments that were made to this poor kid were absolutely terrifying and I have no doubt that he would be in physical danger if he were to meet any of the people who were harassing him.So yes.  I'm saying that mob mentality leads people to attack the innocent without doing research to make sure you're attacking the 'right' person.  When, in a group, we get whipped into a sort of 'blood frenzy', we turn pretty ignorant.permalinksaveparent[+]Augustus_Trollus_III 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (2 children)[]Augustus_Trollus_III 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agofive centuries.emm...permalinksaveparent[+]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours ago (1 child)[]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours agoFour centuries, 1599.

I can't imagine if that is the case. permalinksaveparent[+]GiantWhaleCannon 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]GiantWhaleCannon 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoWell, at least he has one hell of a defamation lawsuit on his hands.permalinksaveparent[+]ktool 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]ktool 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoHe better gets millions of dollars from the news organizations.

It wasn't a big news sensation but even for that, reporters hounded his girlfriendOne of them asked her "Was he hot? How sexy was he?"So anyone who know Adam or Ryan on facebook is going to get a lot of crap like that.permalinksaveparent[+]Barcode_Account 39 points40 points41 points 23 hours ago (10 children)[]Barcode_Account 39 points40 points41 points 23 hours agoOh man. Well the killer is dead so if this guy is managing to post.......  Anyone who happens to have that same name is going to have a pretty bad week.permalinksaveparent[+]bethanyj 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (9 children)[]bethanyj 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoI thought there were two shooters? One dead, one in custody?permalinksaveparent[+]TheGoomba 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (3 children)[]TheGoomba 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoI don't know if they confirmed the second guy. Last I heard was one guy, vest, 4 guns. Also that he killed his father at home before going to the school, and mother who worked at the school while he was there. Kind of hard to sort it all out and the media is doing a great job of making it worse.permalinksaveparent[+]bethanyj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]bethanyj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoHm. Okay. I was under the impression a father of a student was the shooter and they had a second shooter who was in his 20s in custody. Guess the media is just confused. permalinksaveparent[+]TheGoomba 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]TheGoomba 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoI think the second guy isn't confirmed as a shooter, but was detained during the chaos of everyone running away.permalinksaveparent[+]happypolychaetes 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]happypolychaetes 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoYeah there is so much conflicting information right now, it's impossible to know what's actually going on.permalinksaveparent[+]Pryer 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]Pryer 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoThe (possible) assistant was probably his little brother, who is now in custody. permalinksaveparent[+]bethanyj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]bethanyj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoOhh okay. Thanks.permalinksaveparent[+]Pryer 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Pryer 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoYeah, it was pretty tense til they found him. My family knew his family and they live up the road so we were unsure if he was nearby. Needless to say, we were locked and loaded. Helos are still flying around.permalinksaveparent[+]Barcode_Account 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Barcode_Account 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoApparently NOW those in custody are his roommates, and the dead person found in Hoboken is his brother.  I think I'm just going to go do anything but follow this for about 48 hours until the story is straight.permalinksaveparent[+]Pryer 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Pryer 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoFuck this is confusing.

They deleted it now but they were probably talking about him having Mass Effect and GTA4 on his facebook page.permalinksaveparent[+]12side 14 points15 points16 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]12side 14 points15 points16 points 23 hours agoIt didn't help that he lived in NJ and from Newtown. totally suckspermalinksaveparent[+]gococks 17 points18 points19 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]gococks 17 points18 points19 points 23 hours agoThis really shows how crazy the hive-mind effect is right now.

Because there's no possible way someone could make their own Ryan Lanza profile and use the same picture. Not saying that posting the guy's face all over the place is right, but come on. permalinksaveparent[+]BigBirdJRB 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]BigBirdJRB 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoWhy would anyone want to do that?

He should see he's had tens of thousands of shares of his profile by now. Or I dunno, maybe telling everyone to shut the fuck up will do it. /facepalmEDIT: He just deactivatedpermalinksaveparent[+]Third_Man_In 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Third_Man_In 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoDo you know how Facebook works?

I know that I can make a fake account right now, name it Ryan Lanza and make my profile picture the same as the real guy's. Then I can make some bullshit private posts (have you stopped to wonder why they're private yet?), take a screen shot, post it on reddit and get a bunch of people to not think for themselves. permalinksaveparent[+]Thomase1984 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Thomase1984 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoFuck, sue CNN.

Wouldn't put it past internet trolls to do something like this.permalinksaveparent[+]Barcode_Account 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Barcode_Account 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoEven if it IS him, let the cops sort this out. What burden do civilians have to seek out and attack people? If it WERE him, he'll be dealt with by the law and posting things to his social networks won't bring anyone back (he's actually dead, but if he wasn't). If it ISN'T him, but he gets the societal attacks for it, an innocent life could change in a very real way for a while.permalinksaveparent[+]HighSpeed556 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]HighSpeed556 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*Well shit, the media has already posted that boys name and picture all over the television.  :opermalinksaveparent[+]BioTangy 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]BioTangy 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agodamnpermalinksaveparent[+]stonyninja 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]stonyninja 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agowhat?!?.....permalinksaveparent[+]Extravaganzar 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Extravaganzar 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agopoor guy, he better lay low for a while.permalinksaveparent[+]sandmandj 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]sandmandj 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoyea, CNN just reported that.
