Believe what you want, but don't try to push your beliefs on me when I can't go anywhere you and have the power to make me look like an idiot (at least temporarily).  Hopefully they teach this in barber school now.  I voted with my wallet.permalinksavecontextfull comments24 Big Hours in Cincinnati.

M-185, a highway that encircles Mackinac Island, Michigan, allows only horse, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic. It experienced its only automobile accident when a fire truck hit an ambulance responding to an emergency.  by  ThatGuyFromFarkin  todayilearned[+]drinkingcoffeee 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]drinkingcoffeee 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoI heard an interview recently that towns in northern states needed a way to make more tourist money in colder months, so they started advertising "world famous fudge."permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood Vet near Batavia or Eastgate? Any recommendations?  by  Edonlin2004in  cincinnati[+]drinkingcoffeee 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]drinkingcoffeee 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoEastgate Animal Hospital is good.  We took a various cats there and besides a few attempts at up selling, they were good. Also, they did an emergency surgery on a friends dog when another vet didn't have someone that could do it and yet another vet was going to charge twice as much.

As a coffee nerd, I always try to stop by a local coffee shop when I travel.  Although I was tempted by Betterday's cold press coffee (Toddy method), I got a regular cup of coffee at each place.  I know this is anecdotal, but Betterdays had some Indonesian that was the best cup of coffee I've had in a while.  As someone here already mentioned, they get their beans from Stumptown Coffee Roasters out of Portland.  Damm good.

I've not a big fan of Google, but they have definitely left their mark in the Internet in the last 10 years.  Good web based email? Free. Start a blog about anything? Free. Competition for iOS, maps, streetview, etc.  Free means the masses use the Internet more and kept it from getting walled off.

Stay away from the Prima Vista.  Great view, way overpriced. Nada is a great place, but I wouldn't call it intimate.  There's always Sushi, which some veg. friends tell me can easily be veg.
