The national tragedy has sparked a search for ways to stop a senseless streak of mass killings.(Page 2 of 2)0 Until now at least, American views on gun ownership rights have not been budged by mass shootings such as the one in Aurora, Colo., in July, where 12 people were killed and 58 hurt at a midnight movie screening by a gunman who introduced himself afterwards to police as "The Joker." According to the Pew Research Center, Americans remain neatly split on the topic of gun control, with 47 percent supporting more restrictions and 46 percent favoring protecting gun rights.Skip to next paragraphRelated storiesIn Pictures: American Gun CultureSandy Hook shooting: Stories of heroism, ways to helpPresident Obama: American hearts 'heavy with hurt' When tragedy strikes: a prayerful response to the shootings in ConnecticutSubscribe Today to the MonitorClick Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital EditionAt the same time, those numbers could budge in the wake of Friday's tragic incident, especially given that polls show Americans on the whole are more receptive to specific proposals such as limiting the size of magazines, closing the so-called "gun show loophole," and shoring up mental health checks and procedures for gun purchasers.Meanwhile, some Democrats suggest that the National Rifle Association's grip on the political system  where both Republicans and Democrats are wary of crossing the powerful lobbying group  may be loosening, as evidenced by the GOP's election losses last month. So far, the NRA has withheld comment on the Sandy Hook massacre.If 20 kids at a school killed senselessly doesnt change anything, I dont know what will, Karl Swarts, who joined a gathering of gun control protesters in front of the White House Friday night, told Bloomberg News.But given the 300 million guns in circulation and a boom in the number of concealed weapons carriers in the US over the last decade, a counter argument has emerged primarily among conservatives that restricting gun ownership obscures what they see as the real problem: Limits on where guns can be carried by lawful citizens."Fortunately, the efforts to punish [lawful gun owners for massacres] are getting less traction these days," writes Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, in a USA Today column. "Given that gun-free zones seem to be a magnet for mass shooters, maybe we should be working to shrink or eliminate them, rather than expand them."Despite the inevitable partisanship of post-massacre gun control debates, the Sandy Hook shootings united Americans in grief, with House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, saying that "we will lock arms and unite as citizens, for that is how Americans rise above unspeakable evil.""If we stop politicizing it  and recognize that there's some part of the population that's vulnerable to media violence and recognize that assault weapons do play a role in the deadliness of incidents, then we may find we can start unraveling this," says Mr. Cassidy at the University of New Haven.As the country mourns along with the parents of the slain children and school staff, law enforcement authorities have not yet revealed any evidence of a motive in the shootings. Lanza's parents were divorced and his older brother, Ryan Lanza, told police he believed his brother had a personality disorder or was autistic. Friends described Lanza as a "Goth" type, a nerd, even a "genius." He was quiet, shy and rarely made eye contact when he communicated, friends said.Lanza left no messages behind and had no criminal record. Witnesses said he committed his crime without saying a word.The Monitor's View:Newtown shootings: What to say to ourselvesRelated storiesIn Pictures: American Gun CultureSandy Hook shooting: Stories of heroism, ways to helpPresident Obama: American hearts 'heavy with hurt' When tragedy strikes: a prayerful response to the shootings in ConnecticutFollow UsYou can find Patrik Jonssonon Twitter, Facebook, Google+.Previous1|2Get free daily or weekly news updates from CSMonitor.com delivered to your inbox.
