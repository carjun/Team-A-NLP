This composer recorded a bunch of people's voices, and then using a synthesizer, he created this piece I don't know the name of.  I believe it was in the 1970s.permalinksaveparent[+]aprupp[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[]aprupp[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI believe it is from the 70s, and the composer used a synthesizer to combine recorded voices or conversations into a musical work.  i learned about it in a music class years ago.
