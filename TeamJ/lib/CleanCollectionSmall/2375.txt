My company, which is owned by a national parent, released a statement reinforcing previous policies about substance use both on and off the job. I'm mostly curious about companies that take the "it's okay off-the-clock approach." But as people have said, companies that don't care might not say anything at all about the issue. Then again, it's Seattle, and some companies here reflect work policies in innovative or unexpected ways.permalinksavecontextfull comments8161718Has anyone's WA employer stated they are okay with you smoking marijuana?
