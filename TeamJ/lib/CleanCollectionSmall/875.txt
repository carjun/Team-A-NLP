I imagine whales are pretty hard to catch with just harpoons.  by  icansayanything1in  AskHistorians[+]OccamsRZA 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago*(0 children)[]OccamsRZA 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago*One addition I'd like to make: Usually, having harpooned a whale, the whalers would typically use a lance on the head to finish off a whale that has exhausted itself. Here is a link describing the usage of these lances (at least in the Atlantic whaling tradition), and some pictures of the different makes. Also, the scene in Moby-Dick where Ahab makes his lance in preparation of the battle the following day is one of my favorite parts in the entire book. It's made out of well-used horse shoes (the most dependable iron available on a whaling ship), tempered in pagan blood (from each of the non-white harpooners), and then lashed to the main mast and hit by lightning. Still doesn't help out Ahab well in the end. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I feel like I'm missing a part of the game when I'm watching a match on tv hundreds of miles away, by myself. The way I see it, the first time I actually get to go see a football match in person, it'll be that much more exciting. permalinksavecontextfull comments[OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT] A sex abuse counselor who specializes in girls with Dissociative Identity Disorder will be doing an AMA on Monday, 9 A.M EST  by  LeftoNhahein  TumblrInAction[+]OccamsRZA 15 points16 points17 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]OccamsRZA 15 points16 points17 points 13 days agoFantastic, I'd love to hear what she has to say.
