Earlier in the week, a federal appeals court struck down a ban on carrying concealed weapons in Illinois. And Florida officials announced that they would soon issue their millionth concealed weapon and firearm license  or, as a state news release put it, the program would be One Million Strong.        In short, the legal and political debate over the nations gun laws was following a familiar trajectory: toward fewer restrictions. Now, as the country absorbs yet another mass shooting, this one claiming the lives of young children, both supporters and opponents of stricter gun laws are asking whether the carnage might change that trajectory at the state or national levels.        As President Obama used his weekly Saturday address to repeat his impassioned but vague call to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, some gun-control advocates said they hoped that the shooting would be a catalyst for change.        We genuinely believe that this one is different, Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said in an interview on Saturday. Its different because no decent human being can look at a tragedy like this and not be outraged by the fact that it can happen in our nation. And because this time, were really poised to harness that outage and create a focused and sustained outcry for change.        But supporters of gun control sounded similar notes after other recent mass shootings  including one last year in Tucson in which six people were killed and a member of Congress, Gabrielle Giffords, was wounded  only to see little or no legislative action. And as governors from around the nation condemned the Connecticut shooting and expressed sympathy for its victims, their first flurry of statements, from Democrats and Republicans alike, were far more likely to mention prayer than gun laws.        One exception was in Colorado, which had started a debate on gun laws after Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, shifted his position and announced that the time is right for state lawmakers to consider new restrictions.        Mr. Hickenlooper had been cool to the idea of stricter gun laws in the immediate aftermath of the July shooting that killed 12 people and injured dozens at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. On Wednesday, however, he suggested in an Associated Press interview that lawmakers should take up the issue in January, and evaluate issues including assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold so much ammunition.        I wanted to have at least a couple of months off after the shooting in Aurora to let people process and grieve and get a little space, but it is, I think, now is the time is right, Mr. Hickenlooper told The A.P., drawing criticism from officials who oppose gun restrictions, including some fellow Democrats.        Otherwise, much of the initial reaction to Fridays shooting hewed more closely to the contours established by past mass shootings in America. Mayors who have long pushed for more restrictive gun laws reiterated their call. Some, but not many, Democratic governors echoed them. And opponents of gun restrictions condemned the shooting and expressed their condolences.        Mayor Michael A. Nutter of Philadelphia, the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said in a statement that too many times this year, mayors have expressed shock at a mass shooting and noted that the group has been calling for sensible gun laws to protect the public for more than 40 years. Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, a Democrat, pledged to push for stricter gun laws. As governor and as a parent, I intend to spearhead passage of strict laws that will protect our children and the people of Illinois from gun violence.        And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, another Democrat, called the shooting a wake-up call for aggressive action.        Republicans were more likely to draw other lessons from the shooting, at least in their initial responses.        Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, an outspoken supporter of gun rights, issued a statement asking the states school districts to review their emergency operation plans to ensure all schools are prepared respond to potential threats like todays tragic school shooting.        The National Rifle Association, one of the most powerful interest groups in Washington and in statehouses across the nation, said it would not comment on the shooting until the facts are thoroughly known. But the group had been gearing up to oppose any efforts to tighten the nations gun laws. After Mr. Obamas re-election, its president, David A. Keene, wrote, We have to be prepared to fight him on each front, rally friendly elected officials, persuade those in the middle and let all of them know that gun owners will not stand idly by as our constitutional rights are stripped from us.        With gun control efforts seen as unlikely in Washington, where the Republicans who control the House oppose efforts to tighten gun laws, the next frontiers of the debate may well be in states like Michigan, where the bill that would allow people to carry concealed weapons in school is being weighed by Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican.        Don Wotruba, the deputy director of the Michigan Association of School Boards, said the group was calling on the governor to veto the bill. Putting children in closer proximity with more guns is a risk that shouldnt be taken, he said in an interview.        A spokeswoman for the governor, Sara Wurfel, said the bill would go through careful review and analysis. Asked if the school shooting in Connecticut would be a factor, she said in an e-mail that the governor had said that these situations always must and should give pause as theyre so tragic, but that we cant jump to conclusions, either.
