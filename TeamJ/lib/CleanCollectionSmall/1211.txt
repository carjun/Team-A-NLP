He was very, very good. He used to come to see me and call me all the time."Mike Wimbridge added: "You just can't believe it, a young family move back to America ... for a better life for the children, then to be taken like this, I'm lost for words."Twenty children and seven adults, including the gunman's mother, died before Adam Lanza, 20, turned a gun on himself at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.It has been confirmed that US President Barack Obama will attend a memorial service in Newtown later today, and will speak at an interfaith vigil for families of the victims.The father of gunman Adam Lanza released a statement on Saturday night. He said: "Our hearts go out to the families and friends who lost loved ones and to all those who were injured."We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can. We too are asking why."On Saturday, police released a list of all the victims of Lanza: Charlotte Bacon, age 6, Daniel Barden, 7, Olivia Engel, 6, Josephine Gay, 7, Ana M Marquez-Greene, 6, Dylan Hockley, 6, Madeleine F Hsu, 6, Catherine V Hubbard, 6, Chase Kowalski , 7, Jesse Lewis, 6, James Mattioli, 6, Grace McDonnell, 7, Emilie Parker, 6, Jack Pinto, 6, Noah Pozner, 6, Caroline Previdi, 6, Jessica Rekos, 6, Avielle Richman, 6, Benjamin Wheeler, 6, Allison N Wyatt, 6, Rachel Davino, 29, Dawn Hochsprung, 47, Nancy Lanza, 52, Anne Marie Murphy, 52, Lauren Rousseau, 30, Mary Sherlach, 56, and Victoria Soto, 27. @YahooNewsUK on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook  Best of Yahoo!

In that time in the US, they have had at LEAST 31 mass killings - can you imagine how hard it must be for those affectd by such tragedy to constantly have to rebuild their lives? The US is a war zone; how many more kids and innocent people will die before someone has the guts to say enough?

It is always tragic that someone who is disturbed had access to guns, in this case his mother's, but the loss of these kids is even more so. You can never get over the loss of a child, especially one who dies so suddenly and so violently. There can be blame attributed, the mother of the perpetrator who collected guns without a thought about her own child's disturbed mind and the American Government for allowing 'the right to bear arms'.v1/comments/context/9754279c-f8f0-380c-8a00-17b12e1de4c4/comment/1355672247852-658a8bcf-f0fc-4e9f-8cc0-3c460d49a048H5 hours agoSorry for British child, but it does'nt make him any different from the American children that were also shot dead by this lunatic.v1/comments/context/9754279c-f8f0-380c-8a00-17b12e1de4c4/comment/1355672247852-658a8bcf-f0fc-4e9f-8cc0-3c460d49a048/reply/00006I000000000000000000000000-2d5951a9-f62b-4b9a-a117-2f26b5c7ea2etachyon3 hours agoLEE -  why do you say "the adults they are all savages"  - At what age do children lose your sympathy 10,16, or maybe 18 when they attain their majority?

The more they think they will get media coverage and notoriety for their crimes, the more they will be encouraged to commit them.Minimal reporting would contribute to the prevention of these mass shootings, but that will never happen.v1/comments/context/9754279c-f8f0-380c-8a00-17b12e1de4c4/comment/1355654424860-9c09b1f6-5164-4c12-b102-26d8ea1502e6Ms hiroshi10 hours agoNew shooting spree in California shocks US,Another shooting spree has occurred in the US state of California as the American public is still in shock over the recent spate of massacres across the countryv1/comments/context/9754279c-f8f0-380c-8a00-17b12e1de4c4/comment/1355647297579-160fec44-484a-4670-bb76-87e77f6ad7c6alex12 hours agoWhilst this is terrible news there isnt much that can be done as the Pro Gun lobby in the US is massive, any changes would take a very long time, and as its written into the constitution  "the right to bear arms" any attempted ban could be challenged for decades so its very long term if at allv1/comments/context/9754279c-f8f0-380c-8a00-17b12e1de4c4/comment/1355651402644-eb60b940-0e6f-4ae5-b817-02ff85afccccGreyhair11 hours ago8 murders with guns in the UK. 10,700 in the US.

So many little ones killed by a nutter.  Nationality, race or creed does not matter.In the UK the gun issue is more or less under control.   But Knives are not.

These children lived in the US, they were someone's sons/daughters as were the adults who were murdered.  This tragedy has really touched me.  Poor wee angels. God Bless them.
