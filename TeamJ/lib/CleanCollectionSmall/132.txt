TMZ reports that L.A. radio station KIIS-FM has taken the song out of rotation entirely. "Pumped Up Kicks," as poppy and upbeat as it is, chronicles the tale of a school shooter. The lyrics of the song read: "Yeah! He found a six-shooter gun / in his dad's closet, with the box of fun things. I don't even know what, but he's coming for you. Yeah, He's coming for you!" The song quickly turns into the dark chorus of, "All the other kids with the pumped up kicks / You better run, better run, outrun my gun. All the other kids with the pumped up kicks / You better run, better run, faster than my bullet."In an earlier interview with NPR, Foster the People frontman, Mark Foster, said that he had wondered "what would it be like to be inside of a kid's head that's a teenager and is basically losing his mind."While "Pumped Up Kicks" was first released months ago, the song was still receiving radio play. A more recent hit, Ke$ha's "Die Young" has also been pulled from radio stations in light of the tragedies at Sandy Hook Elementary. @keshasuxxke$ha I'm so so so sorry for anyone who has been effected by this tragedy.and I understand why my song is now inappropriate. words cannot express.December 19, 2012 12:06 am via Twitter for iPhone ReplyRetweetFavoriteKe$ha also said she was "forced" to sing "Die Young" -- which includes the lyric "Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young" -- though that tweet has since been deleted.Loading SlideshowTwenty-seven small U.S. flags adorn a large flag on a makeshift memorial on the side of Highway 84 near the Newtown, Conn., town line as residents mourn victims killed by gunman Adam Lanza, Monday, Dec. 17, 2012.

It's lyrics are meant to be an unpleasant trip into the mind of a killer.  What it really is, is the perception of a killer from the point of view of someone who is not a killer.  "Foster The People" has no idea what goes on in the mind of one of these individuals.  Lyrically, they only project what they think is going on in the mind of a killer.  In that sense, the song serves no purpose other than as an outlet for the rage of the lyricist at these killings.In the end, the lyric offers no enlightenment, nor any encouragement of these horrors.  We are kidding ourselves if we think that media (be it video games, movies, music, etc) are the stimulus for these tragedies.  We are simply not doing enough to screen and treat the mentally ill in our societies (that includes many other countries, where these things are happening as well)gdkzen: It would be in extremely bad taste to play thishttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/gdkzen/pumped-up-kicks-newtown-foster-the-people-school-shooting_n_2329503_214995855.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itTravellingMax174 Fans32 minutes ago ( 1:15 PM)I agree.  This is on that line, just like Tarrantino movies, of making us think about how violent society is by reflecting it in a song or a movie.   It seems like all of a sudden, law makers noticed there are lots of guns out there and lots of senseless killing.  I guess there are many donors who lived in Newtown.TravellingMax: I agree.
