Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]mojorisin2592 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]mojorisin2592 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoNo, sensationalizing is what the media has done. It took around 3 hours to even report a death in the national media outlets. That is intentional. It sucks you in and leaves you in confusion. The story exploded. Speculation is 100% intentional. It leads us in and leaves us waiting for more. I didn't contribute to sensationalizing, I contributed to opposing the media reaction, because I have no other option but to go off the page of the report they know is incomplete. That's what the internet is for, to discuss things the second they happen. Not to wait 5 hours while you watch the same child interview over and over. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]mojorisin2592 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]mojorisin2592 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*I think there's a higher correlation between mental health and mass shootings than high gun violence and mass shootings, like in the states you mention. Crime rates would be higher in urban populations, which have reason to have strict gun laws. Low access to mental health facilities and high suicide rates in relation to loose gun laws is a fairer reflection of the possibility for mass shootings, in my personal opinion. States like Colorado and Arizona fit this description, so those were the examples I used. However, the whole point of my comment was that this type of thing can happen anywhere. I'm just saying I have some reason to think that places like those are more likely to have mass shootings (including the previous media portrayal of mass shootings in those places), whether or not it's valid. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]mojorisin2592 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (0 children)[]mojorisin2592 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoWhy don't you contribute some possibilities instead of trying to shut down opinions about these types of things. I didn't confirm anything I said, because it's not meant to be. I'm speculating because that's what everyone's doing, all the way up to the government. Leave the thread if you don't contribute anything other than saying that nobody is sure about anything. That's common sense. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

One shooter is dead and the other suspect is arrested. The school has been cleared. Reports early on from neighbors talked about kids running through their back yards. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

As someone who grew up in CT, this is unbelievable. I always figured these types of things would only happen far away; deep in my imagination these things only happen in Colorado or Arizona or other places that seem like nowhere to me... I don't know why I had this mindset. False sense of security, I guess...

New rules, please read!  by  girafain  Frisson[+]mojorisin2592 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mojorisin2592 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoWe already saw what growth did to this subreddit. You can have good content with many users, but this place didn't. It turned into a breeding pool of karma whores trying to out-do each other's shitposts. Remove karma from the equation, those immature people leave. It's that simple. Plus the added effort of making a tag counts for at least something, and there's a high chance that I'd downvote pictures after seeing them as opposed to any other content anyway. permalinksavecontextfull commentsas a female on my first cakeday without knowing what to do...  by  ThetrueGizmoin  AdviceAnimals[+]mojorisin2592 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mojorisin2592 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoWHY IS IT SO MUCH FUNNIER WHEN PEOPLE PRETEND TO BE JOKINGYou might as well make your account sucks_dick_for_foodpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhich player on your team has overachieved so far this year?  by  devgin  CollegeBasketball[+]mojorisin2592 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (0 children)[]mojorisin2592 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoNo one. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo I'm sitting in a bar...and this chick asks me if I've ever seen "The Notebook"...  by  cmiller84in  pics[+]mojorisin2592 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mojorisin2592 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agohttp://i.imgur.com/2jxM2.gifpermalinksavecontextfull commentsThat's Enough For Today....  by  tech_in  EnoughInternet[+]mojorisin2592 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mojorisin2592 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoThis is pretty tame.
