An educated person would do some basic research about airport x-rays and breast milk.  A one minute google search brought me this link from the CDC, which says:X-rays used in airport screenings have no effect on breastfeeding, breast milk, or the process of lactation.In fact, when I googled "does airport X-rays affect breast milk", the very first hit was this, which says:There have been several queries regarding the effects of radiation on breast milk and on whether or not breast-feeding mothers should avoid x-rays, flying, and other sources of radiation.  It seems safe to say that exposure to radiation from airline travel, medical diagnostic procedures, or occupational radiation does not affect breast milk, and breast-feeding mothers need not worry about the effects of the x-ray exposure on their children.The TSA is an idiotic agency that needs to go, but episodes like this does not help.  A fucking google search, which counted among it's results the premier health agency in the world, should've solved this.  I think, instead of researching if airport X-ray machines had an actual affect on her breast milk, after the first incident, she decided to find something she could use to hoist the TSA on their own petard.  In other words, she wanted a confrontation, got one then sued.  Sounds like a lawyer to me.permalinksavecontextfull comments"The Pentagon ... runs a staggering 234 golf courses around the world, at a cost that is undisclosed." 7 absurd ways the military wastes $  by  pahgzin  politics[+]tillicum 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tillicum 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoAlthough Salon hosted that story on their alternet site, it was originally published by alternet.org, a completely different company.  Salon has their faults (all news organizations do - except Fox, because they are not a news organization), but I generally like their reporting.  Yes I am a liberal, and yes, I thought this story was full of crap, but I don't blame Salon for it, I blame the author.  Alternet.org is a very aggressive progressive site, more to the left than I am, and tends to go for the sensational rather than the rational.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe police officer that barged into a student's dorm from the youtube video "i hate cops" is now fired.  by  Inffectedin  news[+]tillicum 144 points145 points146 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tillicum 144 points145 points146 points 1 day agoLOOK AT ALL THAT RANCH DRESSING.

What a novel idea.Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in todays warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children.Conference on domestic violence in San Salvador, El Salvador (17 November 1998)Or, y'know, you go to back cherry picking quotes to fit your narrative.permalinksavecontextfull comments21192021Assassins Plotted to Castrate and Murder Justin Bieber (Seriously) - Entertainment - The Atlantic Wire (theatlanticwire.com)submitted 1 day ago by tillicum to nottheonion5 commentssharecancelloading...Meanwhile, Michigan is also considering a ban on Shariah law - Salon.com  by  tillicumin  politics[+]tillicum[S] 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tillicum[S] 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoWhen is shit like this going to stop?
