Others stumbled and suffered the consequences. Some just disappeared into the woodwork.Heres a snapshot of what happened to a handful of the countrys 308 MPs.* Peter MacKayHe was once a powerful figure in Parliament: a party leader in opposition, and later foreign affairs minister and then defence minister.But this was the fall MacKay fell silent  forbidden to answer repeated questions about the increasing costs of the F-35 plane he once touted. Instead, the public-relations task fell to Public Works Minister Rona Ambrose. MacKays future in defence is in doubt.* Thomas MulcairChosen as NDP leader in the spring, this was the session for the Montreal MP to prove himself. Would he fall flat on his face as an ill-tempered politician or would he shine as a credible, controlled opposition leader?Despite some instances of raw anger directed at Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the broad strokes of Mulcairs performance delivered what his supporters wanted: Tough but measured questions delivered without too many histrionics.* Justin TrudeauHe is the supposed Golden Boy who many Liberals, and the media, are assuming will win the party leadership next April. Hes also the MP who had virtually no presence in the Commons  speaking only once this fall in the chamber.Instead of bolstering his reputation with queries in Question Period, Trudeau spent the fall elsewhere  travelling throughout the country drumming up votes among Liberals for the leadership contest.* Peter Van LoanNormally, a Government House Leaders work is done quietly, behind closed doors. Van Loan departed from that practice one afternoon in the dying days of the session. Angered by an NDP tactic, Van Loan stormed across the aisle, glared at his NDP counterpart (Nathan Cullen) and hurled some unparliamentary language at him before being pulled back by MacKay.In other words, it would seem, he cursed. The next day, he publicly apologized. Still, the verbal dust-up confirmed the publics view that parliamentary decorum is in decline.* Gerry RitzThe agriculture minister was far from polished or consistent in his handling of the sweeping beef recall after a virulent strain of E. coli was found in meat from the XL Foods plant in Alberta.He told MPs early on that the government had done a tremendous job and he looked forward to getting the beef back into that lucrative American market.Ritz spoke too soon. The problem was worse than advertised. Then, as the crisis intensified, the minister was absent from the House for three days.Eventually, his department appeared to find its footing with consistent communication to the public. Too late to repair Ritzs tattered image.* Stephen WoodworthFor a brief time this fall, a backbench Conservative MP known primarily to his own Ontario constituents became nationally-known.Woodworth ignited a debate about abortion  even though he claimed that wasnt his purpose. MPs voted on his motion to have parliamentarians study whether a fetus is a human being before the moment of birth.It was defeated by a vote of 203 to 91, but the vote revealed a deep split among Tory MPs. Eighty-seven of the 163 Tory MPs supported the motion.Among those with Woodworth were eight ministers and two ministers of state  including Immigration Minister Jason Kenney (a possible successor to Harper as Conservative leader), and Ambrose, whose duties in cabinet include status of women.mkennedy(at)postmedia.comTwitter.com/Mark_Kennedy_Related articlesBudget bill passes Senate, set to become law (o.canada.com)Peter Van Loan says sorry for Commons brawl, urges NDP to also apologize (o.canada.com)Prime Minister Stephen Harper gets snarky on Twitter (o.canada.com)Poll suggests honeymoon is over for the NDP as support shifts to Liberals (o.canada.com)Long-term cost of F-35 jet fighter almost $45 billion (o.canada.com)Read more Articles from Mark Kennedy COPYRIGHT - POSTMEDIA NEWS!Report An ErrorcommentEmail Tags in this storyCanadian House of Commons, Canadian politics, Gerry Ritz, Government and Politics, Jason Kenney, Justin Trudeau, Nathan Cullen, New Democratic Party of Canada, Peter MacKay, Peter Van Loan, pn, rona ambrose, Stephen Harper, Stephen Woodworth, Thomas Mulcair Related StoriesSchool massacre: Authorities piecing togetherexplanationLoss of one voter enough to overturn election outcomes, robocalls hearingtoldNew jet-fighter process reportedly meant to preventfavouritismSchool shooting: The price of living in a world where fame and infamy are interchangeabletermsLatest StoriesTown officials say principal at US school died lunging at gunman duringrampageUS gunman forced his way into school; very good evidence found for possiblemotiveThousands turn out for anti-Putin rally in Moscow to mark anniversary of massprotestsInvestigators visit firing ranges, interview gun dealers to seek ties to USgunmanMore StoriesMost Viewed StoriesAnne Hathaway is mortified after no pantypictureUh-Oh!
