Although President Barack Obama supported restoring the law while running for president in 2008, he did not make it a priority during his first term.But asked if Mr Obama would throw his support behind her measure, Ms Feinstein said: "I believe he will."The medical examiner in Newtown said that all the murdered children he examined suffered gunshot wounds from a rifle, believed to be a .223 calibre Bushmaster.Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy said that the weapon was so powerful he was literally able to shoot an entrance into the building."That's what an assault weapon can do for you," he said.Dianne Feinstein has repeatedly campaigned for stricter gun controlsIn the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, a tearful President said: "We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."But the scale of the task facing anyone taking on the second amendment right to bear arms was emphasised by Texas Republican Louie Gohmert who maintained gun ownership was a constitutional right that ultimately protects Americans."I wish to God (the school principal) had a gun locked up her office so she could have taken off the shooters head, he told Fox News.Many states, including Connecticut, already have strict laws on the purchase of firearms, but with no federal statutes, there is little to stop the traffic of guns from other states where fewer restrictions apply.Joe Lieberman, an independent senator for Connecticut, called for a national commission to scrutinise the nation's gun laws, mental health system and the role that violent video games and movies might play in shootings.Dick Durbin, a Democrat for Illinois, agreed and told Fox News it was time the nation reflected in a "thoughtful way."We need to sit down and have a quiet and calm conversation on the second amendment, he said.Each year, more than 31,000 Americans die from gunshots. Most of them are self-inflicted but more than 11,000 are murders.Related StoriesShooting Prompts Calls For Stricter Gun LawsEmotional Obama Responds To School ShootingGraph: Gun Ownership WorldwideSmall Arms SurveyEnlargeTop StoriesUS Shooting: Gunman Blasted Way Into SchoolUS School Shooting: The Victims' StoriesGunman 'Socially Awkward But Super Smart''Hero' Teacher Shot Dead After Saving PupilsKate In First Public Engagement Since HospitalIraqi Death: Doctor 'Acted Dishonestly'By posting a comment you are agreeing to abide by our Terms & Conditions.
