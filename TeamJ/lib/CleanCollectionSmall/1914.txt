But I follow him on twitter and so forth. I mean he had the Atheist rally here in DC, which I think was a good pedestal in which to scream his views. Hitchens really had a battle with religion where he went back for a bit and then came back to the logical side (which I'm sure a lot of people do -- it is normal to question things.)BUT, Hitch I think was more relatable. He smoked and drank and didn't walk around giving a shit of his reputation. I think, in my humble opinion, they are/were both great advocated in their own way. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnniversary of the death of a great man; an inspirational man; a man I would love to of had a few drinks with...we miss you buddy!!!  by  yetanotherpoopin  ChristopherHitchens[+]yetanotherpoop[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]yetanotherpoop[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoThat was on my gift list for the holiday my family calls Christmas but we just use it as an excuse to get drunk and play with nerf guns. permalinksavecontextfull comments3727374Anniversary of the death of a great man; an inspirational man; a man I would love to of had a few drinks with...we miss you buddy!!!

After my suicide attempt the people in the mental hospital were much more understanding though. When you are having one, it is the worst feeling in the world. Combine that with having bipolar disorder and I will be happy not leaving the house. I am far better now because of meds aft 33 years of trying all different variations -- but you gotta stick it out. Xanax never worked for me. Even the kind that dissolves in your mouth. Instead my doc gave me a low dose of Klonipin and ativan and I am 2 years panic attack free.Some meds just work better on others. The shitty part is the trial and error. The brain intertwinings are a complicated thing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy drain is broken and after dying my hair, my bathtub looked like a Trinity bubble bath incident  by  bailstersin  Dexter[+]yetanotherpoop 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]yetanotherpoop 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoI made my Grandmother a Dexter xmas card because at 80, she LOVES the show.

I was in for meningitis for 4 days and it was only 65k. LOL @ only! Also, aside from our shitty fraudulent insurance companies, I am going to be mother hen and ask why on earth would he ride a motorcycle without insurance? I just wouldn't risk it. Even if he's safe; people don't know how to drive around motorcycles and how far back to be...etc.Yes you can say you can get hit just crossing the street, and I agree. But I would just limit my dangerous hobbies until I had insurance. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I didn't know whether I should flee or what. I was sitting with friends watching TV after they said "all flights are grounded"...and suddenly we hear the noise of a aircraft. We all start freaking out and run outside...by that time we see far in the distance fighter jets as they already passed and the noise just hit us. But for that second...I was terrified. More planes? Are they just going to hit houses? what is going on? friends in DC said they heard explosions. It was a memorable time. Something I will be telling my granddogs. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I have bipolar and recently tried to commit suicide. I was committed to a mental hospital where I got help and put me in a position to get the meds I so desperately needed -- that are working. Now, I've been functioning my entire life -- 33 years -- with this illness or whenever it started. I have had the same job for 7 years, which I love. I have great relationships and not so great, but i function. I have been on every kind of med you could imagine because doctors just THREW meds at me. It wasn't until I was in a place where I didn't feel alone that I was not afraid to admit who I was without the stigma that I got the help I needed.Now that I say that I want to address the very flawed system. In this facility were people who had all types of mental illnesses, some were there for addiction and some there for the inability to be on their own. The sad part was that they were released to shelters when they didn't have family. They were released to the outside world with a prescription and a "good luck" pat on the back like they were trash. People need help and the system needs help. It's hard to get help also when so many people are there to judge but this needs changing. I have no shame admitting my bipolar diagnosis and I hope maybe one person would have an incentive to do the same and seek treatment. There is light at the end of the tunnel and you can have a happier life. It just may take a bit of time. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I thought I got mine across having written 3 posts about mental health and MY personal experience suffering from a mental illness.I don't care if you feel as though memes aren't funny. Are you someone whose feelings about memes I should care about? No. Do I respect that you have the right you your ignorant opinion of me. Sure. Be ignorant. But learn to use reddit's comment history to see I have contributed to the conversation with personal anecdotes rather than jumping on the bandwagon of putting some guys person information on reddit and facebook and twitter.Do I have the right to say that someone who was accused of murdering innocent children and getting death threats as having bad luck? Yep. and 111 people agree. You point is noted. Now bugger off.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]yetanotherpoop 7 points8 points9 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]yetanotherpoop 7 points8 points9 points 23 hours agoAs someone who was in a mental health center for a suicide attempt, you are totally correct. There were people there with a bevy of different mental issues and some of them who didn't have families had no place to go. So when they were discharged, they were sent to a homeless shelter. A FUCKING HOMELESS SHELTER!! Just to lay on a cot and be there. They were thrown away like trash because they have a chemical imbalance that they have no control over? it is really so sad to see this and the judgement from others too. Being called crazy hurts. it isn't like we can control depression or turn it off. But you are right, a lot of it is mental health. A lot is educating the staff too because they were discharging people who I did NOT think should be discharged. I mean, they needed to be in a safe environment to them and to others. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
