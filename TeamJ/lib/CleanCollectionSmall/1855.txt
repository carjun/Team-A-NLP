It seems to have lots worth watching but the ratings will never be that high because it's Sky Atlantic. Sky 1's aren't that high and it's not only on more than one platform but it also has over 20 years to get established.That said, a while back the programme that was featured in all their advertising was a fly on the wall documentary about a Devon fishing town... not exactly an incentive to subscribe!Stuart Murphy is the person running Sky's entertainment channels, he was the controller of BBC Choice/BBC Three. He seems to have been the person who's been driving Sky's move into original programming. About time too really, they make enough money it's good they're ploughing some of it back into production at lastpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy digital radios only cycle through odd decimals?

Is this a US only thing?  by  dethkulturin  AskReddit[+]Scary_ 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Scary_ 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI think it is an American thing, stations here in the UK and presumably the rest of Europe are on even and odd frequencies.The other difference is that AM stations in North America are on frequencies which are in multiples of 10 (910, 920, 930... ) whereas in Europe they're in multiples of 9 (909, 918, 927...). Some radios have a little switch to change between the twopermalinksavecontextfull commentsChristianity down 13%, atheism up 10% according to UK census  by  cockblockingteatsin  atheism[+]Scary_ 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Scary_ 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoHow many former religious folks in the UK are now Muslims If they're Muslims they're not 'former religious folks' permalinksavecontextfull commentsUK Census 2011: What has caused this massive flight from Christianity?  by  Scary_in  atheism[+]Scary_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Scary_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoDon't look behind the curtain!permalinksavecontextfull comments23345UK Census 2011: What has caused this massive flight from Christianity?
