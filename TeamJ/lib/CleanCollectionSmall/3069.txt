Zambian news website Zambia Watchdog carried the story on Monday and it was picked up by the SpyGhana news website on Tuesday."We've had half as many visitors from Africa in the last few days as we'd expect generally in a whole month," John O'Farrell from NewsBiscuit told the BBC, adding that the story had been viewed over 50,000 times.A statement accredited to Iron Mike on the Spy Ghana website said: "I am still a man and I have always been fully in touch with my masculinity and have no intention of becoming a woman. The claims are not only untrue but unbelievably stupid. I was at the Pacquiao-Marquez fight on Saturday and any reasonable person could tell I was looking like a man."All Comments                        1,130 commentsPopular NowNewestOldestMost Repliedv1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355595408942-c19b9fa8-b4b1-4490-a174-633acc146d46Robert1 day 2 hours agoi cant believe he even felt the need to deny it lolv1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355688213451-a899e0d1-3f50-4867-8c6a-258bd1a99904Hiscoming50 minutes agoRapist will think very very well before bouncing on 'her'.v1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355576759401-d092981e-3bfe-4d4d-a23a-409a30b5a63cANDREW1 day 7 hours agoHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAv1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355690714380-bf5da31e-8d37-4c28-b7bd-49cdd2557e11Morag8 minutes agoWho cares - go for it big man?

Yet, that presupposes there is natural evil before the individualthat enables such corruption. But is that natural evil a byproduct of necessity arisingfrom collective human existence, or does natural evil precede humanexistence? Does natural evil have an essence? In short, can people be born who areessentially evil? Why would nature produce naturally evil people? Why does natureproduce deformities? Nature seems inconsistent, cruel, and arbitrary. Does thisinconsistency inform part of a larger whole? Is natural evil necessary for the greatergood? Is natural evil inevitably bound with natural good, so the two are binary, coexistent,mutually necessary, symbiotic, beyond good and evil?v1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355575371410-07894f03-664f-41f0-9053-bcfdb85adae3Neil1 day 8 hours ago"Nibble on my ear Michelle NO NO GEROFF"v1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355575371410-07894f03-664f-41f0-9053-bcfdb85adae3/reply/00003I000000000000000000000000-78a684a9-03fe-4063-9f92-e8f6a0b59575///1 day 5 hours agoHaHa we should have known Neil  More                            Replyv1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355591235434-050c305a-542a-4353-ba65-0a732a313cb7Whoo1 day 3 hours agoThey say beauty is only skin deep but c'mon   !!!v1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355652463665-db6bf6f7-1836-4137-a748-49e8e11a05cfPaul10 hours agoMichelle would be one ugly looking chic...she,d sit there tellin ye to do the hoovering,,dishes,,etc,etc,,wot would happen if you said no to her !!!!!!!v1/comments/context/82425941-3b02-3592-8349-51a513eb9150/comment/1355598934326-01ced1cc-2999-4fb2-88c7-43f245451059PETER1 day 1 hour agoI hope he does'nt get his hands on the one who started this spoof.
