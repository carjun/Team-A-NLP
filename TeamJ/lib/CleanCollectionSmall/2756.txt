You can't stop crazy people from doing this shit and no amount of legislation will affect those who ignore the law against MURDER. What we need is better involvement from society to RECOGNIZE these people before they've gotten to the breaking point, not hinder law-abiding citizens based upon the actions of lunatics.permalinksave[+]flashman2006 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour ago (15 children)[]flashman2006 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour agoThe argument from the other side is perhaps that if we reduce the amount of guns in the hands of people or restrict them, that statistically speaking, we'll reduce the gun murders at least. I am on the sidelines on this issue so I just don't know.permalinksaveparent[+]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoThen there will be a need for baseball bat legislation.permalinksaveparent[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWell at least people can run away from lunatics wielding bats in most situations especially outside. Perhaps the government should recommend adults over the age of 18 carry guns to defend themselves? What is the answer?permalinksaveparent[+]Volucris 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Volucris 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoYou'll find many police officers will recommend CCW for those who legally can. My sheriff who signed off on my papers recommends it himself. I doubt the U.S. Government would take an official stance that you should own a gun and carry one prior to taking an official stance that you shouldn't be fat or live in low-income areas. However we all have the right to own firearms and bear them.permalinksaveparent[+]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI will grant you that a bat isn't a good mass murder tool. I of course agree that this scene is a tragic one no matter if it is an elementary school or a crowded theatre. No one deserves to be shot up while just trying to live life.Your mind and emotions are being manipulated by powerful imagery. This stuff isn't supposed to happen in the good ol' USA! It makes us confront a part of humanity we wish to ignore: we are still just fancy animals. No matter the tool, there are those among us that will kill. They ignore the very basic law that says, "Thou shalt not kill." They ignore the inner voice that tells them it's wrong to take a life. What makes us think they will obey a law that says they cannot own/possess a firearm? I understand the sentiment, but it's not the answer. permalinksaveparent[+]Volucris 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]Volucris 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoThere are more guns in the United States than there are people. It's been that way for a long time. The elementary school is a gun-free zone; it's not even supposed to have guns. The point is that increasing our laws in violation of the second amendment does nothing to affect crime. Reasons being that you cannot affect the lawless by legislating the law-abiding. One would think that all these guns are just going around murdering people but that's not the case at all. Our homicide rate with a firearm in the U.S. is 2.7 per 100,000 as of the most recent FBI statistics. It's very, very small and much less compared to many countries that outright ban guns. But I also want to know why these shootings happen. Why are people going crazy, hitting the breaking point, and committing these atrocities. What was wrong with the Oregon shooter? His GF and him split, he had been evicted, his flight got canceled/missed, etc. He was so hellbent on leaving this world and taking people with him that he stole a gun to do it. So he illegally murdered and wounded people, and stole a gun which is also illegal. That guy is a pretty typical case of who does shootings in the U.S.. IE crazy people. The only way to stop them is a combination of making people alert and willing to get involved when they see someone in such obvious distress (what about his friends, family, etc?). Just being evicted should put up warning signs that the guy isn't going to be stable. The other solution that works now and has been gaining popularity is to arm the lawful populace. Self-defense shootings rarely make it past local news but they happen often. I myself carry a gun concealed because I simply do not want to be at the absent mercy of one of these crazed lunatics. I suggest to everyone feeling competent enough to do so to actually partake. Even Illinois is readying to pass a CCW statute because they've tried all the bans and it doesn't do anything. Criminals and crazies keep committing murder and meanwhile their victims remain unarmed and defenseless. Like I've said before, when seconds matter, the police are only minutes away.permalinksaveparent[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes ago (2 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes agoAlright fine. I'm just about ready to sign up for gun classes for my mom, brothers, and myself. Seems like we are simply heading for a society in which everyone will need to be armed. Can we at least institute federal background checks to weed out the people with a disturbed history? permalinksaveparent[+]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 42 minutes ago (0 children)[]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 42 minutes agoWe already have it...it's called the NICS system. People could do private sales which are impossible to track, but they still have to abide by the same laws those who buy from a dealer have to (look at a form 4473). Again, the lawless don't give two shits but they're also the same people who don't care about murdering others.If you want to make a legitimate improvement to the NICS system...and it'd be the only one I can really recommend, it would be to fix our healthcare bureaucracy. Those with mental illnesses go undiagnosed and often unreported to the FBI.permalinksaveparent[+]Samueul 0 points1 point2 points 24 minutes ago (0 children)[]Samueul 0 points1 point2 points 24 minutes agoWe would need a very robust mental health infrastructure in our country before we could even begin to know who may have disturbed histories.... See the problem here?permalinksaveparent[+]TituspulloXIII 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (5 children)[]TituspulloXIII 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoThe argument always boils down toMore strict guns laws or banning them all together will just make it much more difficult for the sane people to get guns --- The people who target shoot/compete/hunt (majority of guns owners). And that people who want to commit the crime will find out other (illegal) ways to get guns anyway. Another talking point is it won't stop the crime even if guns disappear as criminals would turn to other weapons (knives) just look at the UK/Chinapermalinksaveparent[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (4 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI doubt lunatics will go through the trouble of figuring out how to obtain a gun illegally, but organized crime will, just look at the Mexican Zeta cartel. Lunatics will resort to anything they can get a hold of such as knifes, so yea you're right.permalinksaveparent[+]bonked_or_maybe_not 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]bonked_or_maybe_not 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoYeah, the cartel goes through the trouble of ordering them from the US Justice Dept.permalinksaveparent[+]flashman2006 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (2 children)[]flashman2006 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoYou mean the ATF. Eric Holder was not initially aware of the details of the operation. And even then, the cartels have been using citizens on this side of the border to purchase weapons for years. They get smuggled into Mexico. I can purchase a handgun right now and easily walk into Tijuana with it.permalinksaveparent[+]bonked_or_maybe_not 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]bonked_or_maybe_not 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agowas not initially aware of the details of the operation.Uh huh.... suuuuure.permalinksaveparent[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 50 minutes agoThe investigation was conducted and the report released which was submitted to BOTH Republicans and Democrats came to that conclusion. Now, if you choose to not believe ANYTHING that comes out of any institution, corporation, government entity, then that's your right. But I prefer to give them the benefit of the doubt in most situations.permalinksaveparent[+]Samueul 0 points1 point2 points 26 minutes ago (0 children)[]Samueul 0 points1 point2 points 26 minutes agoWell the big argument used to be "assault weapons" if you didn't have access to them, you couldn't do as much harm, but so far only handguns were recovered..  and then what happens when you have multiple people employing any type of weapon?  The anti-gun argument is a fallacy much like the TSA to make you feel safe...  permalinksaveparent[+]Ceefax81 2 points3 points4 points 47 minutes ago (3 children)[]Ceefax81 2 points3 points4 points 47 minutes agoI've never known anyone massacre 20 children with a baseball bat. This will keep happening as long as you guys have such free access to guns. It's all very well saying murder is illegal, it didn't seem to act as much of a deterrent in this case. The UK handgun ban in the wake of the very similar Dunblane massacre didn't seem to cause any of the ridiculous problems that gun fetishists invent. permalinksaveparent[+]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes agohttp://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/12/14/china-knife-attack-school.htmlpermalinksaveparent[+]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes ago (1 child)[]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes agoExcept the U.K. has a higher violent crime rate than the U.S.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/5712573/UK-is-violent-crime-capital-of-Europe.htmlYour government just lies about it to make you lemmings feel safer on your tiny island. permalinksaveparent[+]gruffalos 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes ago (0 children)[]gruffalos 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes agoGun crimes play much in those statistics?
