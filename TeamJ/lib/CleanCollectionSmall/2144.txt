What he always weighs is the strength of his party and the other parties. His decisions are always made in the context of the next election," says a person close to the Socialist establishment.The Mittal episode highlighted his difficulties. Ahead of a meeting with Mr Mittal, the president publicly appeared to back a threat to nationalise the disputed French ArcelorMittal site made by Arnaud Montebourg, his leftwing industry minister.Mr Montebourg was then slapped down by Mr Ayrault, who reached a compromise deal with the company. Mr Ayrault -- and Mr Mittal -- made it clear that Mr Hollande was never serious about the nationalisation option. Mr Montebourg threatened to resign, but Mr Hollande intervened to keep him in government, weakening Mr Ayrault.Laurent Bouvet, political scientist at the University of Versailles-Saint-Quentin, says Mr Hollande's "permanent quest for compromise" makes it hard to establish how committed he is to what Mr Ayrault and Pierre Moscovici, the finance minister, have called a new French economic model -- as evidenced by a recent 20bn plan to boost corporate competitiveness."That is the problem. It is very difficult at the moment to know if the reorientation of policy is really a strategic change or simply a pragmatic response to the economic situation," says Mr Bouvet.Mr Ayrault, too, has been sending decidedly mixed signals. In a newspaper interview last weekend he said: "[The government] is of the reformist and social democratic left which believes that growth and jobs are not decreed but have to be created." But on Thursday he protested to reporters that he was not a "social-liberal" but was leading "the most leftist policy in Europe".Mr Hollande has also described himself as a social democrat -- a more loaded term on the French left than in other European countries. He has spoken of the need for "historic decisions". In private meetings, business leaders say he clearly understands the need for reform.But his characteristic pragmatism has also led him to be cautious about upsetting the hard left; not just keeping Mr Montebourg on board but also keeping two Green ministers in cabinet, despite their party's opposition to key elements of his European and economic policies.A turning point may come at the end of the year when a decision is due on reforms of France's complex and rigid labour market regulation, currently the subject of talks between employers and the trade unions. "That will be an important test of the capacity of the government and the president to take difficult decisions," says Mr Bouvet.Business leaders say that a dose of bracing labour market reform is the magic potion needed to convince them that the president will do the necessary to revive the economy. Obelix famously fell into a vat of such stuff as a baby; Mr Hollande has yet to take a proper gulp.
