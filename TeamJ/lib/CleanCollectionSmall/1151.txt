I've heard they try to steer the drops towards your group's makeup, but there is no guarantee.  So it's somewhat more likely something will drop that someone can use, but still not guaranteed.permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: The problem with the "friend zone"  by  friendzoneconfusionin  explainlikeimfive[+]Cyberhwk 3 points4 points5 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]Cyberhwk 3 points4 points5 points 9 hours agoNo, there's a big problem in that there tends to be a huge asymmetry in how much each party is benefiting from the relationship.  That's what causes the conflict.  If there was "no problem" nobody would complain.permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: The problem with the "friend zone"  by  friendzoneconfusionin  explainlikeimfive[+]Cyberhwk 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]Cyberhwk 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours agoAnd that's just fine.  The problem comes when you expect the emotional intimacy that is normally afforded to a partner in a romantic relationship, but don't also include the physical intimacy that your friend desires.The vib I get from those that hate the term "Friend Zone" is that they feel it implies that if the FZ exists, that it means there can't exist a platonic relationship between members of the opposite sex.  That's not true.  Platonic relationships are absolutely possible and very fulfilling.The difference is the presence of emotional intimacy.  I'll gladly sit through you bitching about work, talking about your vacation to Vegas, laughing at a drunk friend etc.  But don't expect me to spend my time and energy investing in the friendship if my only reason for existence is to be a shoulder to cry on.Have you ever had a guy that just wanted to sleep with you, but never actually have to pay any attention to you?  Same thing!  He's getting the physical intimacy he desires out of the relationship, while refusing to reciprocate.  Friend Zone is the same thing but in reverse.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould you considering living with a member of the opposite sex, "if they paid you?"  by  DJFunkyGrrLin  AskReddit[+]Cyberhwk 3 points4 points5 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Cyberhwk 3 points4 points5 points 10 hours agoHow "not hot" we talking here?permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow much money is $5000 to you?  by  getthatoutofherein  AskReddit[+]Cyberhwk 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Cyberhwk 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoWell now that I look it's over the course of three years so $1666 a year.

How do news organizations benefit from being biased?  by  enigmaticparadoxicalin  explainlikeimfive[+]Cyberhwk 6 points7 points8 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]Cyberhwk 6 points7 points8 points 12 hours agoBeing partisan can build them a loyal following.  People like having their preconceived notions affirmed.  Going to a news source where they have their notions affirmed over and over can gain them very loyal watchers.Plus, it allows advertisers to to very specifically target their advertisements.  Go to Fox News and see how many people you see selling Gold type investments and compare it to how much you see them on more general TV.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn light of all the talk about mental health care in the US...

They seem to throw out all rational thinking to get their fix.The others ones are drugs.permalinksavecontextfull commentsA non-American here.. Can someone explain to me why America does not have stricter gun control laws?  by  not_creative1in  AskReddit[+]Cyberhwk 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Cyberhwk 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoBecause we have a Constitutional right to own them and a very large portion of the country doesn't want any further restrictions.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Though the sample sizes are small, we find substantial negative correlations between firearm deaths and states that ban assault weapons (-.45), require trigger locks (-.42), and mandate safe storage requirements for guns (-.48).Citepermalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Cyberhwk 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Cyberhwk 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoYes.  I agree.  Lets do something.  A reasonable solution that has a chance to be effective.But the rationality has to be brought by both sides.  Liberals have to realize that banning guns would be nearly possible, nor even effective.  But conservatives have also realize that, you know what, maybe 20 round mags aren't as necessary as people want them to be.  I realize they're fun as shit, but maybe we should start drawing some lines at the capacity to cause mayhem.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
