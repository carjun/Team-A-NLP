Sunday December 16, 2012        EntertainmentLarger / SmallerNight Mode    Little-known man who undressed Marilyn      By            Garry Maddox          Dec. 16, 2012, 3 a.m.It is a mystery that involves Australia's most prolific Academy Award winner, a missing manuscript and the Hollywood star who was once his lover.While few Australians have heard of the costume designer Orry-Kelly, he won three Oscars in the 1950s - for An American in Paris, Les Girls and Some Like It Hot - and was also nominated for Gypsy.He also worked on such classic movies as Casablanca, Oklahoma!, The Maltese Falcon and Arsenic and Old Lace, designing dresses for the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner.Growing up in Kiama as Orry or ''Jack'' Kelly, the budding actor adopted a more stylish single name when he sailed to the United States and became a designer, first on Broadway then in Hollywood in the 1930s.His career was so successful that the pallbearers at his 1964 funeral were Cary Grant, Tony Curtis and the famed directors Billy Wilder and George Cukor, with the eulogy read by studio boss Jack Warner.The director Gillian Armstrong, whose own films have included My Brilliant Career, Little Women and Oscar and Lucinda, is planning to change Orry-Kelly's low profile in this country with a  documentary on his remarkable life.''It's the story of this boy from Kiama who always had a visual flair and interest in theatre,'' Armstrong says. ''He was very well known in the '30s and '40s   He was a great wit, quite outspoken. They say in America that people either loved or hated him.''While researching the film, Armstrong and writer Katherine Thomson have discovered that Orry-Kelly wrote a memoir, wittily titled Women I've Undressed.While he once wrote that the publishers loved the book, it never reached print - reputedly because of legal issues.Just one chapter that he sent to a friend survives, featuring observations about Hollywood history.Armstrong believes the sole copy of the full manuscript was passed down through Kelly's family to a relative named Ephron Manasseh, who has been  impossible to track down.''It still exists somewhere,'' says Armstrong, who believes the memoir will be a treasure trove of Hollywood memories and secrets if they can find it.''There was this whole hidden gay thing that went on,'' she says. ''The big secret is that when Orry first got to New York and was trying to get his start, painting murals on walls and selling hand-painted ties, he ended up rooming with a young British actor called Archie Leach ''They definitely became lovers and were living together for about five years.''After Orry-Kelly's designing career took off, Leach became famous in Hollywood as Cary Grant.Armstrong says it is rumoured that lawyers protecting Grant's reputation put a hold on the book.''There are secrets there about Cary they didn't want out,'' she says. ''He denied forever that he was bisexual.''Tweet      Print StorySaveLatest News Funding boosted for 'carbon and capture' project Killer forced his wayPerfect pupil's next big test - finding a jobMan dies as inflatable raft upturnsClass heroes save lives Editor's Picks Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireFun at the Clunes show.Newlyncouple shocked by truck accident Popular Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeMemories flow of Daylesford's Boathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesFloats needed for DaylesfordNew Years Eve GalaDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireMultimediaGallery: The Boathouse Cafe burns      Gallery: Keele BreenHannah Knight catches up with local artist Keele Breen.
