When he was a student at Newtown High, Adam Lanza would sometimes have what a school employee referred to as "an episode."No one knew what might bring it on. The shy teenager "would just shut down," said Richard Novia, a former advisor to the school tech club. He said Lanza would get together with other technology-minded students to play fantasy role-playing video games and for sleepovers at school. The thin, gangly boy would take part with enjoyment.AlsoPhotos:Massacre at elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Who they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsSchool shooting: How do you tell a child his protectors are dead?See more stories XFor victims of Jewish center shooting, massacre renews their pain It's time to target gun violenceAt school, Lanza would shuffle through the halls, clutching his briefcase to his chest and avoiding eye contact. At times, no one could predict when, he would simply shut down. He'd sit staring at the ground, refusing to talk to anyone."It would be total emotional withdrawal," Novia said. "He wouldn't hurt anyone or yell. He wouldn't speak or talk; he would walk away. Not in a defiant way, but in a scared way. Like, 'Leave me alone.'"PHOTOS: Connecticut school shootingAcquaintances of the family on Sunday drew a sharper picture of Lanza, 20, as investigators attempted to retrace his path last week from the 4,000-square-foot home where he shot his mother multiple times to a nearby elementary school. There, he fatally shot 26 students and staff members and then killed himself.When Lanza would have one of his episodes, Novia said, he would telephone Nancy Lanza. She was "a great parent," he said, and would often come within minutes, sitting with her son and making him feel better."She could pull him back in line," Novia said.Lanza appears to have left high school early, and at age 16 began taking classes at Western Connecticut State University in nearby Danbury, where he earned a B average.He dropped out of German as he was about to fail the class, but earned an A-minus in American history and a B in macroeconomics. He took his last class at the university in summer 2009, the year before he would have been a senior in high school.Starting college at 16 would have been jarring, Novia said, especially as Lanza's older brother left for college and later for a job in Manhattan, and their parents separated, leaving Lanza at home with his mother. The couple divorced in 2009."If I was to read the situation, he found himself so far disconnected from the world with no possibility of interaction. I'm sure he did not make friends well in a college setting," Novia said.Lanza, at least in high school, was fond of joining "LAN parties"  short for Local Area Network  in which students would gather at someone's house and hook up their computers into a small network. They played not hard-core shooter games but strategy games such as "World of Warcraft" and "Mario Party."FULL COVERAGE: Shooting at Connecticut school "We were not in favor of first-person shooter games," said one of those who played with Lanza, Joshua Milas.Lanza's older brother, Ryan Lanza, 24, was also a member of the tech club."There was a clear disconnect. Ryan was outgoing, energetic, well-respected, recognized for his talents," Novia said. Ryan took care of his brother, but Novia said he heard they had become estranged in recent years."There's obviously dysfunction between the siblings," Novia said. "I could very easily see Ryan saying, 'Enough is enough. I've been your caregiver when I was supposed to be a teenager. I've got a life to live.'"Nancy Lanza struggled to take care of her son and live a life of her own, friends said.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Times12next|  single pageComments44Comments (44)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQMitch Labuda at 3:59 AM December 19, 2012                The noise of the world, visual and auditory is simply too much at times, for some of us.I can relatee to the noise, the voices, growing ever louder to hear over each other, the noise from radio's and TV's, the noise from a city, etc.People need to understand others.Kazem Spahi at 10:15 PM December 17, 2012                Live in peace with one another.
