Post, this fed his knowledge of firearms, and will surely be discussed as part of the obligatory and necessary gun control debate.Adam Lanza used several different guns when he opened fire on Sandy Hook Elementary School. It is believed that all three weapons were registered to Nancy.Nancy Lanza was not a teacher at the school, despite initial reports claiming this. Nor was she killed at the school; Adam, who lived with her, shot her at home.From there, he went on to kill 20 kids and six adults before taking his own life as police arrived, making for one of the worst mass murders in U.S. history.Police have yet to disclose a motive for the attack, which left those who knew Lanza trying to discern whether anything in his past could have foreshadowed this.One of Lanza's aunts, Marsha, described Lanza as a "quiet, nice kid" who had issues with learning, she said. Her husband is Lanza's paternal uncle."He was definitely the challenge of the family in that house. Every family has one. They have one. I have one. But never in trouble with the law, or with anything."As for her connection to the school, if any? It's unclear, though Lanza's mother "battled" with the school board and ended up having her son home-schooled."She had issues with school," said the aunt, who lives in Illinois. "I'm not 100% certain if it was behavior or learning disabilities, but he was a very bright boy. He was smart."Tags:Adam Lanza, Connecticut ShootingTweet Comments4 PrintRelated StoriesPiers Morgan Gun Control Rant: How Many More Kids Have to Die?!Morgan Freeman Blames "Sensationalist Media" for Connecticut Shooting [Updated]Victoria Soto, Connecticut Teacher, Dies a Hero Saving StudentsMore From Around the WebComments (4 Total)You are posting as a guest.
