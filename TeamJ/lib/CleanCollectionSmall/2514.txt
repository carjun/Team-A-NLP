It's easy to shoot a bunch of people, but not as easy to stab that many people.  If we got serious about gun control, like Japan, we wouldn't have this problem, because not even the criminals would be able to get guns.  http://www.davekopel.com/2a/lawrev/japanese_gun_control.htmpermalinksaveparent[+]Riecth 3 points4 points5 points 34 minutes ago (1 child)[]Riecth 3 points4 points5 points 34 minutes agohttp://zeenews.india.com/news/world/in-china-22-school-students-stabbed_816680.htmlNot Japan but one does not need a gun.  I guess you're right though.  He only got 22 with a knife compared to the gun that got 27.permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]KKN50 -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes agoObviously one can injure people with weapons other than guns.  But it's way easier to shoot a bunch of people than it is to stab them.  That's why the perpetrator is initially suspected to be someone close to the victim in stabbing cases.  You need to get close to them, and it's harder to stab people than to shoot them, so it requires a lot of anger, and you usually only get that angry at people you know.permalinksaveparent[+]ogenrwot 18 points19 points20 points 1 hour ago (8 children)[]ogenrwot 18 points19 points20 points 1 hour agoJapan is an island roughly the size of Montana. Much easier to "control" weapons. Not to mention their people are far more "peaceful" and law abiding than Americans. America has far more violent crime than any other country, be it shootings, rape, beatings, etc etc. It's not a gun issue, it's a people issue.permalinksaveparent[+]soline 2 points3 points4 points 23 minutes ago (1 child)[]soline 2 points3 points4 points 23 minutes agoEach state can't control it's own gun laws? Have you ever tried to buy a hedgehog in a state where it's illegal. it's fucking impossible and the consequences are death to the animal. The govt and states can control what they feel they should control. permalinksaveparent[+]fedupwith 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]fedupwith 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes agoThere's over 300 million firearms in circulation in the US. How many hedgehogs are there in one state where it's illegal?permalinksaveparent[+]nwestnine 1 point2 points3 points 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]nwestnine 1 point2 points3 points 19 minutes agoPer capita, there are worse countries like South Africa.  Despite its geographic size, Japan's population is about 1/3 of the US and has had as few as 2 gun murders per year (Chicago had two this past Sunday).The people are also a problem.  One of the biggest problems is that American culture sees shooting people as a solution to problems.permalinksaveparent[+]pefyeah 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]pefyeah 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoAmerica does not have far more violent crime than anywhere else. We are right in the middle with most developed countries. permalinksaveparent[+]Apparatii -1 points0 points1 point 57 minutes ago (1 child)[]Apparatii -1 points0 points1 point 57 minutes ago"That sounds hard, better not try it."permalinksaveparent[+]skike 1 point2 points3 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]skike 1 point2 points3 points 10 minutes agoI'm all ears to hear your solution to literally removing the millions and millions of guns in America.  All of them.  Not just the ones that law abiding citizens legally own, but all the illegal ones also.  Please, enlighten us.  EDIT: A letter.permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 -2 points-1 points0 points 58 minutes ago (1 child)[]KKN50 -2 points-1 points0 points 58 minutes agoSure it's easier than it would be here, but that doesn't mean more of an effort could be made here.  I think if we made stricter gun laws and enforced them more strictly, we would see a change.  But nobody knows for sure, since nobody has even tried.  So why not try?  It sure wouldn't make things worse!permalinksaveparent[+]fedupwith 1 point2 points3 points 20 minutes ago (0 children)[]fedupwith 1 point2 points3 points 20 minutes agoNew York - virtual ban on firearms, Chicago - same, Washington DC - same. What are the gun crime rates in these places? Highest in the country.permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (10 children)[]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoLook at the size of Japan please. Also we have a thing called the 2nd amendment. permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50  comment score below threshold (7 children)[]KKN50 -9 points-8 points-7 points 54 minutes agoFuck the 2nd amendment.  It's killing us.permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 51 minutes ago (4 children)[]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 51 minutes agoHa, toss out the 1st amendment while we're at it.   I mean really just strip us of our rights, we don't deserve them. _So many factors in this nation put us where we're at.  The 2nd is not one of them. permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50  comment score below threshold (3 children)[]KKN50 -8 points-7 points-6 points 46 minutes agoI think the second amendment has everything to do with our gun violence problem.  The right to own guns is what has allowed us to develop our ridiculous gun culture.  If we never had that right in the Constitution, we could have strict gun laws today.permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 2 points3 points4 points 38 minutes ago (2 children)[]dieselgeek 2 points3 points4 points 38 minutes agoHow is it so ridiculous?  This event today is tragic and makes me want to vomit, but it's really pretty rare. Tons of countries have violence and strict gun laws on the book.  Really if they were proven to stop violence, and stop people from hurting others, than I'd be all for it. Simple fact is they don't really impact crime.    I mean look in prisons, NO weapons are allowed , yet they are made with the simplest of supplies they find, and the knowledge that is shared. permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 1 point2 points3 points 31 minutes ago (1 child)[]KKN50 1 point2 points3 points 31 minutes agoThe US leads the world in school shootings.  Sure they're rare, but not as rare as they should be.  Not rare enough that we shouldn't be doing something about the problem instead of sitting on our asses and saying "oh but the 2nd amendment!"permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek -1 points0 points1 point 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek -1 points0 points1 point 29 minutes agoLike what?   What would you do , that would cut down on mass murders? permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (1 child)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoJust like outlawing cocaine totally stopped drug deaths, good pointpermalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 -1 points0 points1 point 4 minutes ago (0 children)[]KKN50 -1 points0 points1 point 4 minutes agoWith drugs, making them legal seems to be what keeps deaths down the best.  But making guns perfectly legal doesn't seem to do any good.  Guns started being regulated for a reason.  If they weren't effective tools in the commission of crimes, they wouldn't have started being regulated in the first place.permalinksaveparent[+]Apparatii -5 points-4 points-3 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)[]Apparatii -5 points-4 points-3 points 56 minutes agoWe used to have a thing called the 18th amendment too.  They aren't stone tablets, they can be amended.permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 4 points5 points6 points 51 minutes ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek 4 points5 points6 points 51 minutes agoThat's not in the bill of RIGHTS. permalinksaveparent[+]egonil -1 points0 points1 point 56 minutes ago (2 children)[]egonil -1 points0 points1 point 56 minutes agoJapan is not free from school killings.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasebo_slashingpermalinksaveparent[+]ahalenia 2 points3 points4 points 56 minutes ago (0 children)[]ahalenia 2 points3 points4 points 56 minutes agoBut it's certainly rarer.permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 1 point2 points3 points 53 minutes ago (0 children)[]KKN50 1 point2 points3 points 53 minutes agoI'm aware of that, but they haven't had nearly as many as we have.  The problem I was referring to was the frequency with which we have these tragedies.permalinksaveparent[+]fedupwith 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes ago (0 children)[]fedupwith 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes agoIt's easier to make a bomb and blow a bunch of people up than it is to shoot or stab people. It was illegal when Timothy McVeigh did it.permalinksaveparent[+]jotch 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (1 child)[]jotch 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoHow do you suggest I go shoot my deer without a firearm? Should I go buy the processed meat handled in some packing facility by many peoples hands or should I continue to be self-sustaining?Should I take a chance getting in a knife fight with someone trying to carjack me? Trying to break into my house? No, I will continue to use my pistol.permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoBow and arrow.Unless you train regularly, in stressful situations, for home defense, I doubt your pistol would do shit to protect you in a home invasion.  It's one thing to shoot a deer, and quite another to shoot an invader in your home, while you're terrified.  And unless you drive with your hand on the trigger, I can't see how a gun would help you in a car-jacking.  The jacker usually gains control of the car incredibly quickly, and I don't see how you could grab your gun that fast.permalinksaveparent[+]justanotherreddituse 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]justanotherreddituse 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoCanada's largest mass killing was done with gasoline.  37 people dead.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Bird_Caf%C3%A9_firepermalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 34 minutes ago (4 children)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 34 minutes agohttp://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/12/14/man-stabs-22-children-at-chinese-elementary-school/permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes ago (3 children)[]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes agoThat's China, not Japan.permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes ago (2 children)[]skyfail 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes agoYou wroteIf we got serious about gun control, And I showed you that fucking crazies will be crazy regardless, so don't take sane peoples weapons. permalinksaveparent[+]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (1 child)[]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoCrazies will be crazy, but that doesn't mean we should allow them to have the best tool for their fucked up jobs.permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agoWell, how do we make a law that strictly targets crazies? permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
