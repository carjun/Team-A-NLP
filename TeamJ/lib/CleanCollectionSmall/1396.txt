And the children who endured the horror will carry it with them for the rest of their lives.Those who have read my columns through the years know my feeling about guns and the gun lobby and may expect another impassioned appeal for some form of gun control.But I cant do it.This is too big. This tragedy is too immense for arguments.Close readers also will know my feelings about governments abdication of support and care for the mentally ill. And they may be waiting for another polemic on that.Again, I cant do it.This is too big for that, too.Instead, I will make a plea.Instead of arguing about guns or government services or taxes, can we agree on just one thing? Can we agree that when 26 people  again, 20 of them children under the age of 10  are killed for no reason, we have a problem? Can we agree that children should not fear being shot to death in the classrooms where they practice their ABCs and memorize their multiplication tables? Can we agree that we owe this to our children?I ask this because Ive seen too many stories like this. Ive interviewed too many parents and siblings who have had their kids killed. Ive talked to too many people who have had huge wounds carved into their souls by this kind of mindless horror.(Page 2 of 2)I dont want to hear any more of those stories. I dont want to do any more of those interviews. I dont want to have more of those conversations.I just want the kids to be safe.If giving everyone guns will make this country safer for kids, I am for that. If taking every gun away from everyone will make this country safer for kids, I am for that. If taking some guns away and keeping others will make this country safer for kids, I am for that.I dont care about the guns.I just want the kids to be safe.Similarly, if it costs me more money in taxes to see that mentally ill people dont roam our streets doing harm to themselves and others, I dont care.I just want the kids to be safe.I say that because I think that is something upon which we all  regardless of ideology or party affiliation  agree. No one sane wants to see a child suffer.Or die.In a perfect world, someone could make us all see that the things we spend all of our time arguing about  guns, taxes, etc.  are far less important than the things upon which we all agree. In a perfect world, someone could get us to seek out our areas of agreement, however small they might be, and build on them so that we make our streets, our communities and, yes, our schools safer for our children.But we dont live in a perfect world.Instead, we live in a world in which at least 26 people  20 of them children under the age of 10  get killed in a Connecticut elementary school less than two weeks before Christmas.Sometimes, words fail.John Krull is director of Franklin Colleges Pulliam School of Journalism, host of No Limits WFYI 90.1 FM Indianapolis and executive editor of TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College.
