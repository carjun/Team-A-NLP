In fact, we don't even have the whole of that side. We really don't know much about what's going on here -- at least, I don't, having only the various news reports and postings that Dan himself put on reddit. What I don't understand is how this little bit of information warrants your judgment that he is a "spiteful, vindictive ass." Sure, he might be, but as b0neshaker and MasterCronus both suggest, there are other interpretations. permalinksavecontextfull commentsRachel Maddow is to PhD as Sean Hannity is to ?  by  VersatileScoutin  analogy[+]Swifty63 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 2 points3 points4 points 4 days agoEh.

The quote from Nietzsche is:"From life's military school: What doesn't kill me makes me stronger." The first clause qualifies the second; not everything that comes from "life's military school" applies in all ashes, presumably.Of course, Schwarzenegger or whoever it was in making Conan the Barbarian dropped the first part, so as to make it sound as though it were a universal truth, or something.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm a political science professor.

It might be worth adding something about questions that rely upon controversial social-scientific theories in order to answer well. Many questions about, say, the effects of various tax schemes or government expenditures on the economy, even specific sectors of the economy, cannot be answered without appealing to economic theories that are by no means well established. The same goes for questions regarding programs concerning poverty, only the theories may include those of sociology as well as economics. I'm not by any measure denigrating the social sciences; rather, I don't think we can rely on some of their theories in the same way that we can rely on, say, evolution by means of natural selection.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDocumentary: "Stealing America" - How much evidence is there to confirm intentional "vote-switching malfunctions" in the 2004 elections?  by  livinglightin  politicalfactchecking[+]Swifty63 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 2 points3 points4 points 2 months agoA further source of evidence is to be found in a longitudinal comparison between official poll results and exit polls, both before and after the installation of the machines in question. If the implementation of the voting machines correlates with a sudden increase in discrepancy between exit poll results and the official vote tally, and if the increase all favors one party's candidates, this would constitute good evidence of intentional vote-switching.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrue or false: "The poor are more likely than the rich to use a tax cut in a way that invests it back into the economy"  by  CaspianX2in  politicalfactchecking[+]Swifty63 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoNo doubt, it's important (although I'm not sure it's more important when you have more -- for a person living paycheck to paycheck, how you allocate your money can make the difference between going hungry or not the last few days before payday).But the point here concerns what uses of money are productive or not. Money that is spent on goods or services stimulates demand for those goods or services, and thereby creates an incentive for investment. Money that is sitting in a money market account is available for investment, but currently there is very little incentive to invest. Why? Because demand is depressed!Cutting taxes on the wealthy will have the effect only of allowing them to have more money lying around ready to invest; it won't create that incentive. Wealthy people are very smart about their money. They won't invest it unless they think it will pay off for them. And they won't judge it to be likely to pay off unless they think there is enough demand for the goods or services they are investing it producing.Giving the wealthy more money in current conditions is like, as the economists used to say, "pushing on a string."permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrue or false: "The poor are more likely than the rich to use a tax cut in a way that invests it back into the economy"  by  CaspianX2in  politicalfactchecking[+]Swifty63 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoI'm sorry, but this is very hard to credit. We're talking about the wealthy; they already have more money than they need for consumption, even for conspicuous consumption. They have pools of money sitting around in unproductive, short-term, liquid instruments; that money is going begging in our economy (interest rates are near zero). An increase in the tax rate of the wealthy is just very unlikely to reduce their per capita caviar consumption. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrue or false: "The poor are more likely than the rich to use a tax cut in a way that invests it back into the economy"  by  CaspianX2in  politicalfactchecking[+]Swifty63 8 points9 points10 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 8 points9 points10 points 2 months agoI am not sure this is a factual question. There is indeed much statistical and historical evidence relevant to it. But proper interpretation of that evidence turns on some highly controversial economic theory (e.g., monetarism, Keynesianism). This is well beyond the "did Obama really propose X?" variety of fact, which can be verified by consulting the public record.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrue or false: "The poor are more likely than the rich to use a tax cut in a way that invests it back into the economy"  by  CaspianX2in  politicalfactchecking[+]Swifty63 3 points4 points5 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 3 points4 points5 points 2 months agoWell... money doesn't find itself anywhere. People do what they judge best with what money they have. The poor spend it as soon as (or sooner than!) they get it, on food, rent, clothes, or other consumer goods, which has the effect of stimulating demand for those goods. The rich spend a bit, but look for the best return on their investment -- these are the "highest valued uses" you mention.The sticking point is that they will invest this money in productive uses primarily when they foresee demand for those goods or services they invest in. If they don't find any good investments, if they're all too risky, then the wealthy are OK with leaving their funds lie relatively idle (not under mattresses, but in money market funds or other short-term, highly liquid instruments). They don't gain much, but neither are they risking capital. This is the deficiency of demand that Keynes wrote of. The money is "in the economy," but it isn't really doing anything productive.TLDR; the poor always have to spend their money, the rich don't have to, so whether the rich stimulate the economy varies with other economic conditions.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI found porn on my son's internet broswer.

"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name," is something like what I say. A moment of embarrassment instead of lingering discomfort, kind of like ripping off a band-aid quickly.

If she tries to brush it off (and I'll bet she will), tell her that the fact that she doesn't take this seriously leads you to trust her even less -- which is the truth, right?permalinksavecontextfull commentsRomney says he will pursue and prosecute pornography if elected  by  rtphokiein  politics[+]Swifty63 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoThe problem these days, if you're sexually repressed, is that pornography is just too easily available for it to give you the thrill of guilt when you watch it.

What Romney found disgraceful was not Obama's own statement, but rather the statement released from the Embassy to condemn  the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims  as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions. That's the problematic statement, according to Romney. I stand corrected.But please forgive me -- it still looks like Romney is putting forth religious intolerance as an American value. I do believe that Mssrs. Madison and Jefferson would find that view highly disturbing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRomney tells surrogates how to deal with Libya fallout  by  DoremusJessupin  politics[+]Swifty63 3 points4 points5 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 3 points4 points5 points 3 months ago"It is never too soon to Stand up for American values and interests." So, Obama stepped over the line when he said that "we reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others"? So, denigrating the religious beliefs of others is an American value, according to Romney? It's not a value of this American!permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis article claims that Romney's position on Health Care is a "No Preexisting Conditions Guarantee Unless Youre Already Insured." Is this accurate to Romney's policies on health care and pre-existing condition coverage?  by  timothyjchambersin  politicalfactchecking[+]Swifty63 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 1 point2 points3 points 3 months agoThere are different factual claims one can check on this topic. One is: "Did Romney state such-and-such position on pre-existing conditions?" From what I have read, such a factual claim may well be verified, since Romney (or his campaign) apparently stated several different positions on pre-existing conditions over the weekend. But a rather different result may follow if the question is asked differently: "Is such-and-such Romney's policy on pre-existing conditions?" if you mean his stable policy, then the answer is likely no, sincere appears to have no stable policy (at least, not yet). If you mean what he believes about pre-existing conditions in his heart of hearts, then I would say that this is (at present) unverifiable.Edit: for typos.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn Sandra Fluke's DNC remarks, she claimed that "Republicans shut me out of a hearing on contraception.

Is this accurate?  by  [deleted]in  politicalfactchecking[+]Swifty63 3 points4 points5 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]Swifty63 3 points4 points5 points 3 months agoReally? Fact-checking is about hairsplitting? So, if politician A says, "This program cost $65 million," and the actual figure is $64.8 million, you're going to call A's statement "objectively false"? Well, that's fine, I suppose. But, I'm pretty confident that the average thoughtful person (without an axe to grind) is going to say of A's statement: "Yeah, That was about right."permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn Sandra Fluke's DNC remarks, she claimed that "Republicans shut me out of a hearing on contraception.

Intent and meaning are notoriously difficult to get a handle on and don't fit well with the project of fact-checking. To the extent that we have to rely upon concepts involving intent and meaning (and it's virtually impossible not to do so), the best standard is probably something like the legal one of what a "reasonable person" would say.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
