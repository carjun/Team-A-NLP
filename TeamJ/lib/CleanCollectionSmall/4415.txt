Police held his 24-year-old brother, Ryan, for questioning, in Hoboken, New Jersey. AP reported Ryan told police he had no contact with brother since 2010.

In this case, the man suffering from personality disorder killed his mom and took her guns to kill the poor innocent baby. Dear God many were just 5 years old.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  melbatom says: It will be a while before we know the why of this one. It did not just happen it obviously was planned long before it occurred. The many we have faced sure smell like terrorist activity. The death of the perpetrator sure makes you think that way!     reply        GossamerWings replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  He was the 20 year old son of the first victim and he was mentally ill.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  LordDragol says: Guns are not the problem here. Until we can make things perfectly safe we need the right to have guns to protect ourselves. The guns used here were registered to the mother. one of the people who lost her life. Are we going to blame her for her son getting access to the guns? Are we going to say if he did not have access he could not have done this? These are true statements, but are we really going to put the blame on one of the victims? No I dont think so. The shooter was 20 years old. Old enough to make adult decisions. All the blame goes on him. I own a gun and I have young children in the house. If I left my gun out and a tragedy occurred in my home, would the blame be on my child, NO. It would be on me. Because my children are too young to make those decisions. So the blame here goes strictly on the shooter. Not the mother or the guns. Gun control wont help. Even tighter security would not have helped because individuals cant carry guns on school campus's either. So even staff could not have been armed. Only thing that would have helped here is xray machines and armed guards. And if he killed them first then what. I dont have a solution here. But gun control is not going to help either. Let everyone carry a gun and then maybe we will be safe from the crazies. MAD for the most part worked with nuclear weapons. The 2 super powers had them and noone used them. If everyone had a gun and something like this happened at the very least the death toll would have been lower. Maybe he would have never made it to the classrooms and the children at least would have been safe. I dont know. This is a crazy world.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  angelofurnightmare says: Good to see a list of factsKeep your political views out of it just for tonight people...let me lay it out for you...there are 20 families grieving tonight...there children are lying cold on the floor of a school while the families have yet to even get a chance to identify them. Imagine for a moment you had to live with that...think of the pain it would cause you..to these families these children are not bodies...they are their babies and logic doesn't help. They lay dead in the floor..near the gunman that slaughtered them...stop raving about politics and whether you pray or send comforting thoughts or just keep your mouth shut please respect the children, the staff, and the families of those who died     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  jlexiann says: There is no ONE issue at the root of this appalling event, as in other similar situations. That there is a need now for stricter security, sadly so, for our young ones who we want to maintain their innocence as kids for as long as possible, is a valid call. It is @CBSAVA not THE issue, but one of MANY issues that created today's events; and only an issue because of today's events because never in our wildest imaginations could we have visualized this. That the guns were legally owned by the shooter's mother in light of the fact that reports are saying the shooter was mentally unstable, and even autistic, is another issue, and falls under the umbrella of gun control, which I believe you @GOP-R--Con-Men are alluding to, and not really trivializing this important issue by making it a Republican bashing. Bottom line, today's tragedy was an amalgamation of various issues, not just ONE issue.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  cariepma says: I am but an angel, innocent and kind.I was only here a little while, but when I was here I shined.I never had a bad day, our smiles lit up your face.I know it seems scarey, but I am okay.I am wrapped in angels wings, robes of white, God is here with me and he is holding me tight.I can't tell you not to cry, because I know you will.Remember how I loved you and remember I always will.Don't get lost in your sorrow, for me you must go on.Be my light and try to be strong.I'm loving you from Heaven for always!(Dedicated to the parents and families.

Really? Sorry that's not acceptable. And republicans are the party that represents the NRA over ordinary Americans to block any legislation to address it.     reply        GOP-R--Con-Men replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  CBSAVA?               linkicon reporticon emailicon  GOP-R--Con-Men says: We as a country, adults and parents are suppose to be the protectors of our children but republicans and the NRA blocks every attempt to protect them.My condolences to the families of this tragedy. We have been thru this too many times and we must begin to address this. However, do not expect any help from republicans as they are in the pockets of the NRA and other entities hostile to ordinary Americans. Republicans must be voted out to remove their obstruction to making progress on this and other issues. Elections have consequences, and electing republicans to control congress will result in no movement to begin to address this or other issues America so desperately needs to address.     reply        CbSaVa replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  This has nothing to do with political parties, I do not own a gun although I have in the past. This has to do with personal beliefs and health issues. Many people who own guns use them for strictly legal activities. Others do not. Use your head please. The constitution allows all people to bear arms. There are laws for waiting periods to attempt to insure that the guns are not sold to people with criminal backgrounds. Stricter school security is the issue here.            GOP-R--Con-Men replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  So you think current gun laws are just fine and need not be addressed? Really?

We would all be well advised to step back and look at this topic. The best work I have seen is of Dr. Peter Breggin who testified at Columbine.     reply        GossamerWings replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  His brother stated that he had autism personality disorder. It may be that he lacked the ability to have any empathy for others. The guns were his mothers and I guess she was his first victim. I'm not sure why she had guns knowing he had personality disorders. She must have thought she had the guns locked up.
