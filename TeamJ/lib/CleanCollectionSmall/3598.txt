A shooting at a Connecticut elementary school today left 27 people dead, including 18 children, the Associated Press reported, citing an official.  The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way. Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason, said the gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown was killed and apparently had two guns.

Sources told The Hartford Courant that there are at least 20 shooting victims. Many of the shootings took place in a kindergarten classroom, sources said. One entire classroom is unaccounted for, sources said.  If the death toll is confirmed it would be one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history. It comes after a series of shooting rampages in the United States this year that have killed multiple victims.  The suspected shooter, the father of a student there, was also killed, CBS reported. The principal and school psychologist were among the dead, CNN said.  There were unconfirmed reports of a second shooter after witnesses reported hearing dozens of shots fired.  Sandy Hook Elementary School teaches children from kindergarten through fourth grade, roughly ages 5 to 10.  It was horrendous, said parent Brenda Lebinski, who rushed to the school where her daughter is in the third grade. Everyone was in hysterics - parents, students. There were kids coming out of the school bloodied. I don't know if they were shot, but they were bloodied.  Television images showed police and ambulances at the scene, and parents rushing toward the school. Parents were seen reuniting with their children and taking them home.  This is going to be bad, a state official told Reuters, requesting anonymity because the scope of the tragedy remained uncertain.  All Newtown schools were placed in lockdown after the shooting, the Newtown Public School District said.  The shooter, an adult, was dead and two handguns were recovered from the scene, NBC News reported without citing a source.  Lebinski said a mother who was at the school during the shooting told her a masked man entered the principal's office and may have shot the principal. Lebinski, who is friends with the mother who was at the school, said the principal was severely injured.  Lebinski's daughter's teacher immediately locked the door to the classroom and put all the kids in the corner of the room.  Danbury Hospital, about 11 miles (18 km) west of the school, had received three patients from the scene, a hospital spokeswoman told NBC Connecticut. The mayor of Danbury, Mark Boughton, told MSNBC: They are very serious injuries.  Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was fine.  It's alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America, he said.  The superintendent's office said the district had locked down schools in Newtown, about 60 miles northeast of New York City. Schools in neighboring towns also were locked down as a precaution.
