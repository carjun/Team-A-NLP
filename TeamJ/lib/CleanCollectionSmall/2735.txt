It's probably my favorite feature and it's always the first thing I show people when they ask whats so great about the windows phone.If you haven't tried it out you should. It's free for a month! Then only $9.99 a month after or under $100 for a year pass.Download any songs you want to your phone and listen offline when ever you like as well! Also just discovered they have comedians as well. Just downloaded Jim Gaffigan's newest project. Plus the library is huge with small bands like NoBunny, Mischief Brew, and others I couldn't believe were available.All that said I feel terrible for you that they didn't build an appropriate integration for former Zune users to Xbox Music. I would be frustrated as well.Seems to me Microsoft was in a rush to get Windows Phone 8 on the market, with all of its new features, in an effort to increase the customer base and didn't have time to take care of those who were already on the platform. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould be nice if Google went on twitter/blogs to explain what happened to the ordering process. Complete mess.  by  the_hillshire_guyin  nexus4[+]tcavan1 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]tcavan1 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoBest advice is to make sure you are logged in to your google play account before. 16GB was not available so I ordered an 8GB. Left the paid window open and checked on the 16GB and sure enough I was able to order.I was able to get mine at 1:54 CST so don't give up!permalinksavecontextfull comments891011Just Posted Four Simple Words-best quality I've seen online (youtube.com)submitted 2 months ago by tcavan1 to frankturner4 commentssharecancelloading...9000Australians Clarke and Dawe.
