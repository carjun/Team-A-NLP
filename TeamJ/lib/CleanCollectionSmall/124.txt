It isn't clear if he was formally diagnosed.Enlarge ImageCloseABC News /Getty ImagesNancy Lanza, in an undated photo. Friends say bringing up her younger son, Adam, 'was hard as he was getting older.Profiles of the VictimsView InteractiveOne close friend, Ellen Adriani, recalled how Ms. Lanza once slept outside her son's room all night when Adam was ill because he wanted her nearby. To another confidant, Mark Tambascio, Ms. Lanza, a stay-at-home parent, mused about moving to Washington state where her bright but troubled 20-year-old son could enroll in a "special" college. "She always just said it was hard as he was getting older," Mr. Tambascio said.Related VideoThe Connecticut School ShootingLatest UpdatesFollow developments after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.For Parents of Newtown Students, No Easy AnswersWest Virginia Senator Gives Boost to Gun LimitsShooter's Persona Drew Concern at SchoolMs. Lanza, who was 52 years old, often bragged about both her sons, Adam and his older brother, 24-year-old Ryan Lanza, who lives in Hoboken, N.J., and works for Ernst & Young.For Adam, a man whom authorities and school officials have described as emotionally withdrawn and meek, his mother appeared to be one of his main contacts with the world.Those who knew Ms. Lanza struggled Monday to reconcile the fun-loving woman they knew with the unexplained mass shooting that left 27 dead, including Ms. Lanza, at the hands of her younger son. Mr. Lanza took his own life after killing 20 children and six adults in a local elementary school.Before Friday's rampage, Ms. Lanza and her son appeared to have a quiet, comfortable life in an upscale Newtown neighborhood. They lived in a yellow Colonial-style home, where Ms. Lanza remained after a divorce in 2009 from her husband, Peter Lanza, according to court records.Peter Lanza didn't return emailed requests to comment, or a message left with his employer, GE Energy Financial Services. In an earlier statement, Mr. Lanza said his family was "heartbroken" and struggling to understand what had happened.The divorce wasn't contentious, according to people with knowledge of the situation. It granted Ms. Lanza primary custody of Adam, then 16, but allowed his father "liberal visitation and vacations," according to court papers. Ms. Lanza would receive alimony of $240,000 a year, a figure set to grow to almost $300,000 a year by 2015, according to court papers.Divorce records say Ms. Lanza would make "all decisions" for her younger son "after having consulted with" her ex-husband.Friends said Ms. Lanza worked to help Adam live a normal life. When Mr. Lanza once missed class at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, his mother picked up his homework for him. Adam was capable of good grades in some courses, according to his college transcript and school officials. Ms. Lanza hoped her son could one day get a job, a friend said. Some friends said she hoped to teach Adam a sense of responsibility through the proper handling of guns. She owned several firearms. Authorities said the weapons Mr. Lanza used in Friday's shooting rampage were legally registered to his mother.Ms. Lanza, who was nicknamed "Beanie," according to her 1978 high-school yearbook, grew up near Kingston, N.H. She told friends in Connecticut that she was raised on a farm and was comfortable with guns.But raising her younger son could take a toll, friends said. A tavern in Newtown, My Place Pizza and Restaurant, became a haven for her, said Mr. Tambascio, one of the owners.She would eat there as often as three days a week and enjoyed a beer or two with her meal, a My Place bartender said."The last time I saw her, we were all passing around a guitar and singing," said Victoria Munoz, 50, from Waterbury who frequents My Place. "She was a super lady. Whenever she saw you, she'd give you a hug."By Monday afternoon, the bodies of the 26 teachers and children killed at Sandy Hook had been collected by loved ones from the state medical examiner. The bodies of Ms. Lanza and her son, Adam, remained.Jim Oberman, Tamer El-Ghobashy and Anton Troianovski contributed to this article.Write to                 Matthew Dolan at matthew.dolan@wsj.com and Tamara Audi at tammy.audi@wsj.comA version of this article appeared December 18, 2012, on page A6 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Mother Was Gunman's Link to World.Copyright 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
