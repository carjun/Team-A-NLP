Its fine, if a little funny around the house but when were in public and gets his hand stuck in something and yells "daddy! Cock!" it can be a bit akward.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

When they finally called off the search a reporter for Sky news broke that news live on tv to a volunteer who was searching for the kid, then asked how she felt.

I have a 2 yr old with my partner (she works part time so that helps) and I currently put money away for him but I count that with my monthly outgoings. After rent, bills, food and fuel I'm done. I can't justify spending 10 on something for myself at the moment if it's not essential.permalinksavecontextfull commentsScientists plan test to see if the entire universe is a simulation created by futuristic supercomputers  by  wegotblanketsin  technology[+]cadex 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]cadex 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago"Then the question is, Can you communicate with those other universes if they are running on the same platform?First contact? kittens.jpgpermalinksavecontextfull commentsTo all my roommates  by  BoonTobiasin  AdviceAnimals[+]cadex 69 points70 points71 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]cadex 69 points70 points71 points 3 days agoNever understood people who do that.

They didn't really need to be in the park at all as the baby couldn't walk, let alone reap the benefits of a toddler playground. But it was a sunny day and I guess they thought they would hang out in a relatively safe environment with their baby.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust act like nothing happpened...  by  chris43734in  funny[+]cadex 28 points29 points30 points 23 days ago (0 children)[]cadex 28 points29 points30 points 23 days agoIt doesn't help that they are so goddamn top heavypermalinksavecontextfull commentsJust act like nothing happpened...  by  chris43734in  funny[+]cadex 516 points517 points518 points 23 days ago*(0 children)[]cadex 516 points517 points518 points 23 days ago*A new parent couple were at the park the other day and the dad had his few month old baby on his shoulders when it started lunging towards it's mum. The mum catches the baby and starts having a go at the dad who takes a couple of steps forwards and knocks into my toddler who then bursts into tears having been knocked on his ass by a man 5 times his size.I felt so sorry for the guy. I told him not to worry about my boy and that he's fine but he looked so shocked. Almost dropped his kid then made a complete strangers kid eat shit, all in the matter of a few seconds.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSKELETOR  by  joerlegacyin  funny[+]cadex 7 points8 points9 points 23 days ago (0 children)[]cadex 7 points8 points9 points 23 days agoa worthy causepermalinksavecontextfull commentsToday i crapped myself on my way to work...

So we flew around it in space engine which was fun,  but then I sped up the time scale so the moon whipped around the earth at speed.  He cracked up,  laughing his little head off.  I took him to bed that night and we looked out the window and we could see the moon so he points at it,  goes "moon!" and then draws circles in the air with his pointing hand.  It gave me chills that he had a grasp of a basic celestial movement.Space engine fucking rocks. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGrand Theft Auto V Trailer 2  by  nmpraveenin  videos[+]cadex 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]cadex 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI decided I didn't like him when I saw his neck tattoo. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow I looked when I got home from the hospital with our son, or "9lbs and 12 ounces of trepidation"  by  notnatsin  daddit[+]cadex 3 points4 points5 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]cadex 3 points4 points5 points 1 month agoWe spent 5 days in the hospital, 2 of which I slept on the floor in a pile of coats because I didn't want to risk getting stuck out in the snow and missing the birth of my son.You can see the safe-as-fuck conditions in the Hospital car park here.We literelly slid our way out of there.
