All of which can push someone who may be in need of help over the edge. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your useless talent?  by  IamSofaKingIttyin  AskReddit[+]busted_up_chiffarobe 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]busted_up_chiffarobe 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI too have this ability, which is handy at work.However, it failed me once, years ago.Having sex with girlfriend (no, really!) in my bedroom with door open.

IIRC the Mazda 6 had no damage in the bumper tests while the Fusion (at the time) performed worse than the previous year of Fusion.So, Ford, color me impressed when you can beat that type of competition. Backing into a pole should not cost $3000 to fix.IIRC the VW Beetle had no damage either. And an engineer stated something to the effect that 'this can be easily done, it's just engineering.' Also the Maxima costs were horrific. Should find that article, I think it was NHTSA testing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAtheist Blogger Sentenced To 3 Years in Prison For Insulting Islam  by  scientologist2in  worldnews[+]busted_up_chiffarobe 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]busted_up_chiffarobe 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThe 'west' needs to do everything to ensure that this type of 'justice' does not spread our direction.I'm not going to sacrifice freedom of expression, nor live as a dhimmi.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAtheist Blogger Sentenced To 3 Years in Prison For Insulting Islam  by  scientologist2in  worldnews[+]busted_up_chiffarobe 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]busted_up_chiffarobe 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoHallowed are the Ori.permalinksavecontextfull comments22212223Missing woman in Helena - please keep your eyes open!
