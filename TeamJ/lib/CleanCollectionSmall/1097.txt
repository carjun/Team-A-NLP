OMG, This is the worst article ever published, a first grader could do better!!!!Larry Smith1 at 2:07 PM December 14, 2012                A little over 25 years ago, I visited a 3rd world country, what I found strange was that every one had very high concrete fences around their property. Then I also noticed that the Schools had even bigger fences with glass embedded on the top to stop unwanted people from entering. Maybe it is time that we the USA at least build fences around our schools. Put security gates that are monitored that can only be opened by security. Electonic equipment can be installed at the gates, if metal is detected, they are denied entrance, without a search first. It sound horrible but if it stops one thing like this it would be worth all the money spent. We do it in Airports, why not in our schools.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required. The Times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy.
