What does it take? So far, not Columbine, Colo., in 1999. Not the Washington, D.C., snipers in 2002. Not Virginia Tech in 2007. Not Northern Illinois University in 2008. Not former Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011. Not Aurora, Colo., last July. Not the Sikh Temple near Milwaukee last August. Not the ongoing gun violence    ]]>  Sat, 15 Dec 2012 17:32:19 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/17023686-452/president-faces-new-call-to-action-on-gun-control.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/17023686-452/president-faces-new-call-to-action-on-gun-control.html  WASHINGTON  Reacting as much as parent as president, an emotional President Barack Obama said our hearts are broken today in the wake of the Friday shootings at a Connecticut elementary school as he also took note of gun violence in Chicago. Obama, tearing up, called for meaningful action to prevent more horrific tragedies after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in the shooting spree at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. In his brief and heartfelt remarks  filled with pauses as Obama collected himself and wiped his eyes  the president said, Our hearts are broken for    ]]>  Sat, 15 Dec 2012 02:07:38 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/17021110-452/obama-gets-emotional.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/17021110-452/obama-gets-emotional.html  WASHINGTON  Embattled U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice took the hit on Thursday, asking President Barack Obama to not nominate her for secretary of state because she would face a bruising confirmation fight  a headache Obama did not need. Rice phoned Obama before sending him a letter on Thursday requesting he not consider her to replace departing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. The White House confirmed that Rice will be meeting with Obama on Friday afternoon. The episode represents a win for Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who vowed during the presidential campaign and after that    ]]>  Fri, 14 Dec 2012 08:44:34 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/17001846-452/obamas-loss-susan-rice-gives-up.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/17001846-452/obamas-loss-susan-rice-gives-up.html  WASHINGTON  The American public will be able to witness President Barack Obama getting sworn in for a second term; the Presidential Inaugural Committee said Wednesday that the unusual Sunday ceremony will be open to media coverage. This should not even have been a question  but it was, because the White House would not say, as recently as Tuesday, whether the event could be covered. The official swearing-in on Sunday will be open to media coverage, Addie Whisenant, the national spokesman for the Presidential Inaugural Committee told me after I asked her Wednesday about the status of coverage for    ]]>  Thu, 13 Dec 2012 02:20:27 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16980132-452/obamas-second-term-swearing-in-will-be-open-to-media.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16980132-452/obamas-second-term-swearing-in-will-be-open-to-media.html  WASHINGTON  Michael Oren, Israels ambassador to the U.S., denied Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu favored Mitt Romney over President Barack Obama, with his comment coming after I asked him about Mayor Rahm Emanuels criticism of Netanyahu on that very point at a forum here earlier this month. Relations between Netanyahu and Obama have been strained, and Netanyahu was seen as preferring Romney and meddling in the U.S. presidential election where the Jewish vote was especially important in the battleground states of Ohio and Florida. Did Netanyahu support Romney? Categorically no, Oren said. I questioned Oren about the November    ]]>  Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:55:08 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16958871-452/emanuel-israeli-ambassador-clash-over-netanyahu.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16958871-452/emanuel-israeli-ambassador-clash-over-netanyahu.html  WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama hosted an exclusive White House dinner on Friday for some of his most elite fund-raisers, including a group from Chicago. A White House aide confirming the event told me, As is commonplace with past administrations of both parties, the president hosted a holiday party with supporters Friday evening in the residence. The event was paid for by the Democratic National Committee. Its the holiday season and Obama and first lady Michelle  as is routine in prior administrations  are hosting many holiday receptions at the White House each night for hundreds of attendees.

Mitt Romneys selection of Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate was not a political choice; his warm personal chemistry with Ryan made it more like a bromance. A major mistake by President Barack Obamas team was waiting too long to give fund-raising assistance to the main SuperPAC bolstering Obamas re-election bid. Those insights came during a conference on the 2012 presidential campaign hosted by Harvards Institute of Politics, which included the key operatives from the Obama and Romney operations, Romneys GOP primary challengers and strategists who ran SuperPACs. The Decision Makers Conference took place last Wednesday    ]]>  Tue, 04 Dec 2012 02:22:52 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16794780-452/campaign-secrets-clint-mitts-debate-prep-and-a-bromance.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16794780-452/campaign-secrets-clint-mitts-debate-prep-and-a-bromance.html  WASHINGTON  The University of Chicago is quietly stepping up its push to land President Barack Obamas presidential library, I was told Saturday. Top U. of C. honchos are trying to figure out how to encourage the president and first lady to make the University of Chicago a serious contender, I was told by a source who is knowledgeable about developments to win the library for the U. of C. University President Robert Zimmer is very interested in securing the library, I was told.

Heres the latest: In the short term, it looks like the Obama army is already being prompted to mobilize to help Obama pressure congressional Republicans on fiscal cliff issues via the Obama for America website and Twitter feed. Obama national field director Jeremy Bird said in a Wednesday email more than 1 million campaign supporters answered a survey sent out    ]]>  Sat, 01 Dec 2012 17:24:44 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16728388-452/analyzing-where-obama-went-right-romney-wrong.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16728388-452/analyzing-where-obama-went-right-romney-wrong.html  CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  A few days after President Barack Obama won the election, his campaign manager, Jim Messina, contacted Matt Rhoades (who ran Mitt Romneys campaign) to arrange a meeting between the two men. The result of the outreach  which Messina confirmed he made when I asked him on Thursday  was that Romney arrived at the White House on Thursday to lunch with Obama. He visited with Obama in the Oval Officewhich a few weeks ago he though he would occupy on Jan. 21, Inauguration Day.

Dick Durbin delivered some tough love Tuesday to his fellow progressive Democrats in a speech on the fiscal cliff. His message: Be ready to compromise  or be left out of the conversation while others make decisions about the priorities you care about the most, such as preventing the middle class from carrying an unfair tax burden. Durbins speech, at the Center for American Progress  a progressive think tank  comes as President Barack Obama and House and Senate GOP and Democratic leaders are confronting a Dec. 31 deadline to avoid a fiscal cliff kicking in automatic tax    ]]>  Wed, 28 Nov 2012 02:21:34 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16664347-452/durbin-pushes-liberalsto-compromise-on-fiscal-cliff.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16664347-452/durbin-pushes-liberalsto-compromise-on-fiscal-cliff.html  It looks like former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), who resigned Wednesday, is trying to take any potential heat off of his wife, Ald. Sandi Jackson (7th)  who is also his campaign manager. Im told that Sandi Jackson has hired her own legal representation as her husbands lawyers try to work out a deal in the ongoing federal probe of his campaign finances. It doesnt take too much reading between the lines of Jacksons resignation letter  unusually poignant  that he is telling the feds to blame him  and leave his wife out of it.

Jesse Jackson Jr. is a monument to his better days, what was and what might have been. Jackson quit Congress on Wednesday, battling health issues and a federal criminal probe centered on his campaign funds. He hasnt been to his Rayburn Building office since he vanished in June, eventually landing in Mayo Clinic to treat his bipolar depression. His desk is frozen as he left it  with two computers and, under the glass, a Chicago Sun-Times front page from May 22, 2007, featuring the swearing-in of his wife, Sandi,    ]]>  Thu, 22 Nov 2012 02:26:00 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16547854-452/lynn-sweet-jesse-jackson-jrs-agony-he-couldnt-escape-fathers-shadow.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16547854-452/lynn-sweet-jesse-jackson-jrs-agony-he-couldnt-escape-fathers-shadow.html  WASHINGTON  The incoming House members  six from Illinois  are here for orientation sessions, looking for places to live and sizing up new colleagues they will be working with after being sworn in on Jan. 3 After 18 months of campaigning, I just want to get to work, Rep.-elect Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) told me. Its Thursday morning, and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) just hosted a breakfast for five of the new members in an office that is part of his Capitol suite.

Even if the Dec. 31 deadline passes without a tax, spending and deficit package in place, the overall impact would not hit the economy immediately. Consider the effect more a fiscal slope, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told me. One potential scenario: A stopgap measure could emerge to buy some more time.

Ambassador Susan Rice, whom he may pick to replace Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Obama fired off a warning to Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) at his Wednesday press conference if they go after Rice because of comments she made about the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans were murdered. You could feel the intensity in the East Room as Obama aimed at the two Republicans, who are talking about Watergate-style hearings over the Libyan killings. McCain and Graham have said if Obama    ]]>  Thu, 15 Nov 2012 02:29:12 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16388115-452/obama-warns-republican-critics-back-off-rice.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16388115-452/obama-warns-republican-critics-back-off-rice.html  President Barack Obama, his spine fortified by his re-election, is setting the stage for blaming Republicans for raising your taxes, as Congress returns to work Tuesday  racing a Dec. 31 deadline to avoid falling off of a fiscal cliff. Whats your preference: (A) a federal tax hike for everybody, or (B) a boost for only those people who make more than $250,000-a-year  thats about 2 percent of Americans. Obama is betting that most people will pick (B) as he spoke out Friday for the first time since he won his second term about the looming fiscal cliff battle    ]]>  Wed, 12 Dec 2012 06:46:06 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16289550-452/if-obama-and-republicans-cant-reach-deal-on-fiscal-cliff-we-all-pay.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16289550-452/if-obama-and-republicans-cant-reach-deal-on-fiscal-cliff-we-all-pay.html  NEW YORK  In a surprise move, CIA Director David Petraeus suddenly resigned on Friday  departing because of an extramarital affair that he said showed extremely poor judgment. CNN was reporting on Friday that the FBI Counterintelligence unit was investigating Petraeus over the affair  which is what is done to determine if an official is in position to be blackmailed, and the situation could turn into a national security threat. No one on Friday was suggesting that anyone was compromised. Petraeus rushed out the door  and could not or did not want to hang on until Thursday,    ]]>  Tue, 11 Dec 2012 06:11:09 -0600http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16278843-452/petraeus-admits-affair-steps-down-as-cia-director.htmlhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/16278843-452/petraeus-admits-affair-steps-down-as-cia-director.html
