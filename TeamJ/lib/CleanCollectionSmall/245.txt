(Allison Joyce / Getty Images /December 19, 2012)2 1/94By Tina Susman and Michael MuskalDecember 18, 2012, 9:31 a.m.NEWTOWN, Conn. -- Amid increased security, schools reopened here on Tuesday as this town searched for a road back to normality after last weeks massacre at a local elementary school.Funerals for the 20 first-graders and six adults killed Friday morning at Sandy Hook Elementary School will continue throughout the week. Two children were buried on Monday amid the cold and rain and two more funerals are scheduled for Tuesday.Sandy Hook remained closed, however, and will likely be shuttered for months as authorities continue their investigation into the shooting spree by Adam Lanza, 20, who killed himself after invading the school, opening fire on students and staff and then turning a gun on himself.AlsoVideo:Newtown tragedy casts shadow on N.Y. schoolWho they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsThe weapons Lanza used were legally owned by his mother, Nancy, who was the first of the 28 people who died from bullets that morning.Yellow school buses rumbled along roads Tuesday morning, some still dotted with makeshift memorials to those who were slain. Children laden with book bags waited outside their homes for the buses.PHOTOS: Shooting at Connecticut schoolBut it was clear this would not be a normal day for them despite teachers' efforts and the stepped-up presence oflawenforcement. Staffers met on Monday with psychologists and other specialists to hear how to handle their own grief and children's questions.It's important to try to make things feel normal for her, a mother who would give only her first name -- Barbara -- said, explaining why she decided to have her 8-year-old daughter head back to classes.FULL COVERAGE: Shooting at Connecticut schoolBarbara, who was driving her daughter to school, said she knew not all parents would be comfortable letting their kids go into the schools, even with extra security. I'll be a lot more anxious than usual, she admitted.Newtown police Lt. George Sinko said sending children back to school is a personal choice and parents would have to make their own decisions.I can't imagine what it must be like being a parent with a child that young, putting them on a school bus, Sinko said.In addition to trying to reassure parents, the increased police presence helped keep the media from the schools. Police have also said they will severely prosecute anyone perpetrating hoaxes, such as two telephone calls saying there were bombs on the grounds of a local church, St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church.Police have been told to act aggressively, as they did in nearby Ridgefield on Monday where they shut down schools amid reports of a suspicious man at the train station. After investigating, police told reporters there was no threat.In addition to the investigation at Ridgefield, about 20 miles from Newtown, there have been reports across the country of closures by anxious officials. Two schools were locked down in South Burlington, Vt., and a high school in Windham, N.H., was briefly locked down. Neither case involved any threat.Two more children will be buried on Tuesday and both funerals will be held at St. Rose, which has been a center of grief counseling and community support. Services will be held for 6-year-olds Jessica Rekos and James Mattioli.Jessica was avid about horses and had asked Santa for new cowgirl boots and a cowgirl hat this year, according to her family. Jessica loved everything about horses, her parents, Rich and Krista Rekos, said in a statement. She devoted her free time to watching horse movies, reading horse books, drawing horses and writing stories about horses.James was described by his relatives as a numbers guy who loved math.On Monday, two funeral homes were filled with mourners for Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto, both 6. Pozner had a Jewish service and Pinto a Christian one.Noah Pozners twin, Arielle, survived the rampage because she was assigned a different classroom.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Times12next|  single pageComments39Comments (39)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQjustme34 at 3:09 PM December 18, 2012                Even the NRA is calling the Newton shooting a game changer. Yet the gun owners believe nothing needs to be changed. The gun owners are a LUNATIC and PARANOIA to begin with.Imalan at 3:00 PM December 18, 2012                areyou solame, the problem with people like Adam Lanza is that our culture now is all about winners and losers, and some losers react badly to having that label hung on themlbjack at 2:55 PM December 18, 2012                Hey, you gun-loving geniuses, the shooter WAS a law-abiding citizen...until he wasn't. The same for you and all your gun-loving buddies. Let's finally get something straight about you gun lovers. It's not about rights, not about protection: you don't want to give up your guns because GUNS TURN YOU ON. Plain and simple. Your insane assertions (that we need MORE guns), you phony platitudes (Guns don't kill people bla bla bla) are simply smoke screens for your nasty little fetish.Civilized, decent people have had ENOUGH of debating the likes of you. I am ready to declare war on you gun lovers. The slogan you like to throw around, "I'll give you my gun when you pry (or take) it from my cold, dead hands," suits me fine. The fewer of you left afterwards the better for the human race.The time for excuses -- A ban won't work? How the hell do you know??? -- is over.  Stop talking with the NRA and their lunatic constituency. We need to act now to control, if not ban guns!Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
