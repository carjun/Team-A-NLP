His apology did not sound like an apology at all!

As long as you are striving to do what you want to do in life in order to be happy, then it is all good. A man with a goal that he is working towards is incredibly attractive, no matter what it is.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLadies who used to have body image issues... how did you learn to accept and like yourself?  by  fitnessnoob92in  AskWomen[+]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoI made changes to my life. I started being more responsible with how I eat, I started doing yoga (which really helped in its own way), and being good to my body made me feel good about my body. I also realized that every girl has a different body, and mine is great in its own ways. I started focusing on the things I love about my body instead of worrying about the things that I was born with that I can't do anything about. Every person has something about their body that is imperfect that they don't like, just remember that. When you are comparing yourself to a prettier girl, she is probably comparing herself to you and focusing on the things she is lacking and wishing she had that you do. I think comparing yourself to other girls is a difficult thing to not do, it almost feels like we're programmed to do it. However, its how you feel after comparing yourself to other girls that's important. Feeling self-conscious is not going to make you prettier, so instead of focusing on the negatives, focus on the good stuff, because that will make you feel good, which will give you confidence, which makes any person more attractive and appealing, and knowing that will make you feel good about yourself. It's a bit of a self-dependent cycle.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSaw this exact fb status this morning  by  Reddit_Rhymerin  AdviceAnimals[+]gravytown 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoGuilty.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter seeing several recently on the front page.  by  ben2kickersin  AdviceAnimals[+]gravytown 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoYou are not alone.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is it OK to tell your friends intimate details about your sex life regarding your partner?  by  sigtrapin  AskWomen[+]gravytown 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI have always found it so weird that some girls do this.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's something about you that would make Reddit hate you?  by  TheBastardTrollin  AskReddit[+]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI've never read or seen Lord of the Ringspermalinksavecontextfull commentsI found this carrot in my college's dining hall...  by  cuffs_and_a_smilein  WTF[+]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoSell it to the next person you see reading 50 Shades of Graypermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhats the longest that you have harbored secret romantic feelings for someone?  by  MobiWangin  AskReddit[+]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoOne month.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen you have a SO, what are you boundaries when interacting with other people?  by  denim_vestin  AskWomen[+]gravytown -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoIn my relationship with my SO (2 years and going strong), we have a mutual understanding (which we discussed) that we can do some innocent flirting with others, mainly if we're, for example, at the same party. We both know who we're going home with, and as long as we don't send the other person the wrong idea, it's no problem. Usually works best when there are groups of people. I love seeing a bunch of girls flirt with my boyfriend, knowing that I will be jumping on top of him that night, and in the same way my boyfriend likes to see that guys can drool over me, cause he knows he's got me. We have enough trust between us to know that all it is, is innocent fun social flirting. I can also hang out with anyone I want anytime anywhere, and same goes for him. We both work very hard at our relationship so we have a lot of confidence in it to not let petty things like jealousy get in the way.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI fucked this up, didn't I?  by  drunk_polish_girlin  funny[+]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoGreat, a new character for my nightmares.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo I'm sitting in a bar...and this chick asks me if I've ever seen "The Notebook"...  by  cmiller84in  pics[+]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThat's not her best movie, but a good movie nonetheless. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow did your parents explain sex to you?  by  DugongOfJusticein  AskWomen[+]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]gravytown 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThey didn't have to.
