She said the suspects mother was the host, not herself.A corrected version of the story is below:Connecticut shooting suspect was honors studentConnecticut school shooting suspect was honors student who lived in prosperous neighborhoodBy PETE YOST and JASON KEYSERAssociated PressWASHINGTON (AP)  He was an honors student who lived in a prosperous neighborhood with his mother, a well-liked woman who enjoyed hosting dice games and decorating the house for the holidays.Now Adam Lanza is suspected of killing his mother and then gunning down more than two dozen people, 20 of them children, at a Connecticut grade school before taking his own life.The 20-year-old may have suffered from a personality disorder, law enforcement officials said.Investigators were trying to learn as much as possible about Lanza and questioned his older brother, who is not believed to have any involvement in the rampage.Lanza shot his mother at their home before driving her car to Sandy Hook Elementary School and  armed with at least two handguns  carried out the massacre, officials said.A third weapon, a .223-caliber rifle, was found in the car, and more guns were recovered during the investigation.So far, authorities have not spoken publicly of any possible motive. They found no note or manifesto, and Lanza had no criminal history.Witnesses said the shooter didnt utter a word.Lanzas aunt said her nephew was raised by kind, nurturing parents who would not have hesitated to seek mental help for him if he needed it.Marsha Lanza, of Crystal Lake, Ill., said she was close with Adam Lanzas mother and sent her a Facebook message Friday morning asking how she was doing. Nancy Lanza never responded.Marsha Lanza described Nancy Lanza as a good mother and kind-hearted.If her son had needed counseling, Nancy wasnt one to deny reality, she told The Associated Press late Friday.Marsha Lanza said her husband saw Adam as recently as June and recalled nothing out of the ordinary about him.Catherine Urso, who was attending a vigil Friday evening in Newtown, Conn., said her college-age son knew the killer and remembered him for his alternative style.He just said he was very thin, very remote and was one of the goths, she said.Adam Lanza belonged to a technology club at Newtown High School that held LAN parties  short for local area network  in which students would gather at a members home, hook up their computers into a small network and play games.Gloria Milas, whose son Joshua was in the club with Lanza, said Nancy Lanza hosted one of the parties.She recalled a school meeting in 2008 organized by the gunmans mother to try to save the job of the clubs adviser. At the meeting, Milas said, Adam Lanzas brother Ryan said a few words in support of the adviser, who he said had taken his brother under his wing.My brother has always been a nerd, Ryan Lanza said then, according to Milas. He still wears a pocket protector.Joshua Milas, who graduated from Newtown High School in 2009, said Adam Lanza was generally a happy person but that he hadnt seen him in a few years.We would hang out, and he was a good kid. He was smart, Joshua Milas said. He was probably one of the smartest kids I know. He was probably a genius.Lanza and his mother, Nancy, lived in a well-to-do part of Newtown, a prosperous community of 27,000 people about 60 miles northeast of New York City.A grandmother of the suspect  who is also the mother of Nancy Lanza  was too distraught to speak when reached by phone at her home in Brooksville, Fla.I just dont know, and I cant make a comment right now, Dorothy Hanson, 78, said in a shaky voice as she started to cry. She said she hadnt heard anything official about her daughter and grandsons. She declined to comment further and hung up.A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said investigators believe Lanza attended the school several years ago but appeared to have no recent connection to the place.At least one parent said Lanzas mother was a substitute teacher there. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the law enforcement official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.Continued...
