I do not have personal experience, but I know there are group homes and similar services. I worked with a patient on my unit who had Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD/Autism spectrum). Dialectic Behavioral Therapy, which is offered as a group at CVH, is very effective for teaching social and reasoning skills within the axis II diagnoses.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]brillianteraser 71 points72 points73 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]brillianteraser 71 points72 points73 points 20 hours agoI am a nursing student in CT, and recently have been doing my clinical rotations at our state's in-patient psychiatric hospital (Connecticut Valley), specifically on the forensic unit. I love what I do, and I care a great deal for the patients I have worked with. I have always been an advocate for improved mental health services, though I've found it to be a losing battle. In this coming year, the Department of Mental Health and Addictions Services (DMHAS) is facing severe cuts to an already crippled budget. This needs to change. Now more than ever.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDLC after Omega is forecasted to have almost all of their DLC writers.  by  shpeilinin  masseffect[+]brillianteraser 2 points3 points4 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]brillianteraser 2 points3 points4 points 19 days agoHe is, and so is John Dombrow.If nothing else, I'm excited to see what these two can do this time around.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo what would happen if I stay here for two days?  by  HOBOBEARin  masseffect[+]brillianteraser 1 point2 points3 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]brillianteraser 1 point2 points3 points 20 days agoIf playing on XBox?
