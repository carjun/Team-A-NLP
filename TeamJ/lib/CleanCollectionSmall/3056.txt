Intentionally, not because they were in the way. It's possible the kids were the only targets and all the adults killed were only shot because they tried to stop them. We know people go crazy and think slaughtering people indiscriminately is a good idea. We know people will kill people they think have wronged them. We even know people are nuts enough to do things like murdering their own children when faced with the prospect of losing them.But slaughtering a whole bunch of little school children? They didn't wrong you. They weren't just in the way. That's a special kind of sick.

Lots of examples of that particular tactlessness over the years, it's a big reason why I don't watch live TV news anymore. Edit - maybe this is a good time to start a writing campaign to all the news stations asking them to rein in their reporters from asking these types of questions.  The incident that did it for me was the Waco massacre.  A reporter was with David Koresh's mom and they were watching their compound burning on the news.  The fucking reporter asked "what are you feeling right now as you watch this?"  DK's mom just looked at her like she was insane and said "Those are my grandchildren..."  I turned it off at that point, don't know if the reporter got booted out or not.  I think crap like this is why so many people cheer at the reporter getting punched in the die hard movies. permalinksaveparent[+]cadex 44 points45 points46 points 54 minutes ago (5 children)[]cadex 44 points45 points46 points 54 minutes agoOver here in the uk a 7 year old girl went missing.

It's a shitty, underpaid and unappreciated job on the best of days. Take my advice and do something else  get an IT degree or become a teacher or something. You'll be happier.If you do decide to go on with your degree, then harden up. You'll be asked to do a lot of things you don't want to do, that seem cruel or classless, but remember that your job is to be completely dispassionate and harden up. Your job in a situation like this is to tell the stories of the dead and the survivors, to capture the fear and anger, to get the facts out there, to find a way to give the story meaning, to ensure that people are still talking about it a week from now, and, if possible, to leverage the work you do to create some sort of positive change in the world. As a reporter, you hold up the mirror to society, which won't always like what it sees reflected back. If you hold the mirror right, people won't even notice who's doing the holding, all they'll care about is fixing what's wrong with that picture.permalinksaveparentload more comments(3 replies)load more comments(6 replies)[+]AssbuttAsses 44 points45 points46 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 44 points45 points46 points 1 hour agoThey are ghouls.permalinksaveparentload more comments(80 replies)[+]pimfram 47 points48 points49 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]pimfram 47 points48 points49 points 1 hour agoAn official with knowledge of Connecticut school shooting tells the Associated Press that 27 people are dead, including 18 children.

We are watching the news. We are horrified. We are all sobbing. 'm currently in one of the class rooms of the neighboring school and we're in lock down. So far we have heard nothing from the administration. We know that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook School (the elementry k-4 school). There were 2 shooters alledged. One kid (confirmed with multiple sources) is wounded and carried out of the school. The shooters are still out there, not caught. One teacher was shot.My town is trending on every major news site and it's scary as fuck. Update: 3 patients admitted to danbury hospital  by ambulance and the number of people shot is up to 4 (no ages yet). Update 2: one shooter reported dead (unconfirmed but multiple people are saying that)Update 3: One child dead. One shooter still on the loose. Yale hospital has opened a triage for victims. Update 4: Unconfirmed repoet that the principle is dead. The shooter is heading down river-side (the road). Update 5: Swatt team is sweeping the school Update 6: they've taken one woman aside and she's crying into a firefighter's arms. This could mean update number 3 about a kid dead is true. Update 7: We were released back to class. There was an announcement that said the area was safe, so we are conducting classes. I need to get back to class, so I will update later. We're watching the news, it's last period but we were forced to turn it off. One of the reporter's said,"and just think that these kids were seeing santa claus last weekend." We turned the audio off and we're all crying still.This is hell. Some kids are bawling in the bathroom, there are only 10 or so (out of 25) that remained in class). Nobody has a dry eye right now. Some kids are angry and swearing, others are staring at their feet. We don't know how to deal with this. This town has virtually no crime, we were unprepared. permalinksave[+]Saucy_Taco 55 points56 points57 points 2 hours ago (3 children)[]Saucy_Taco 55 points56 points57 points 2 hours agoSandy Hook is my hometown too, and I just can't believe this.

It makes me sick beyond belief.  permalinksaveload more comments(11 replies)[+]accel169 16 points17 points18 points 58 minutes ago*(2 children)[]accel169 16 points17 points18 points 58 minutes ago*I am from Newtown, CT and I live right down the road from Sandy Hook Elementary... I grew up here but went to a different elementary school. Please pray for all the families affected as well as our town. If anyone in the area wants to talk or vent feel free to PM me. This situation is downright horrifying, and I will keep updating what I hear from families and the CT state police.Edit: 27 dead is confirmed by NBC Connecticut, claiming 18 children included. Also a second person is in custody, they are trying to figure out what part he played in the incident.Edit: Paul Vance from CT State Police about to give details. He is not confirming the number of deaths, but has confirmed that adults and children were killed in the shooting. President Obama has pledged to give whatever resources needed to the effected families. They have made it clear they won't be answering any questions until they have another briefing. They claim the area is now secure, though.Edit: Haven't seen any more conferences, but definitely hearing stories of first responders who can't believe what they have seen. Confirmed that the shooter's name was Ryan Lanza, age 24.permalinksaveload more comments(2 replies)[+]CloverdaleColonel 15 points16 points17 points 55 minutes ago (7 children)[]CloverdaleColonel 15 points16 points17 points 55 minutes agoWhat school is this?

The families of the children, and all of the others will remember this every holiday season and it will always haunt them. Unimaginable.As a father with a daughter who is getting ready to start school in 2013, this hits hard. The real WTF here is that there are two shooters. It's hard enough trying to understand why one person would do such a thing, but to think that two people were able to carry this out really gets to me.permalinksaveload more comments(10 replies)[+]Sharkbait41 47 points48 points49 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]Sharkbait41 47 points48 points49 points 1 hour agoSo...can we maybe stop shooting each other for five fucking seconds?permalinksaveload more comments(3 replies)[+]rightwhoknows 13 points14 points15 points 1 hour ago (4 children)[]rightwhoknows 13 points14 points15 points 1 hour agoAs a teacher, this is my worst fear.

We HAVE to.I was in NYC this past weekend.  In case any of you don't know, there are no guns allowed in NYC...period.  20 minutes after I walked through Columbus Circle with my fianc, a man stepped up to the back of another man, shot him once in the head, then got into a car and drove off.You can take the guns out of the hands of people, but they WILL find a way to get them.  And if they don't get them, they will make them.  And if they don't make them, they will use knives, axes, chainsaws, even a car, to do what they want to do.The secondary problem is weapons.  The primary problem is PEOPLE and what is going on in their heads.  permalinksaveload more comments(6 replies)[+]ElBravo 10 points11 points12 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]ElBravo 10 points11 points12 points 2 hours agoif anyone wants the live feed from the newton's police : http://relay.radioreference.com:80/118749863permalinksave[+]anoxy 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]anoxy 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour agoMan, fuck everything about this.
