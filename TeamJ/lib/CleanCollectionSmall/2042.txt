The deal, which is still awaiting approval from US regulators, is the biggest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company.The Canadian approval sent a reassuring signal to investors about the country's openness to foreign takeovers.However, Stephen Harper, Canada's prime minister, also set out a new policy on acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies such as PetroChina and Cnooc, which puts new obstacles in the path of such deals, and bans them altogether in the oil sands of western Canada.The Nexen takeover should not be seen as "the beginning of a trend, but rather the end of a trend", Mr Harper said."To be blunt, Canadians have not spent years reducing the ownership of sectors of the economy by our own governments, only to see them bought and controlled by foreign governments instead."Asset deals such as PetroChina's latest purchase from Encana are unlikely to be blocked under the new rules, analysts believe.Natural gas, shale gas and deepwater fields have become priorities for China's oil majors as they try to acquire the expertise needed to tap shale and deepwater fields at home.Neil Beveridge, oil analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong, said PetroChina's investment in the Duvernay project would give it experience in developing "very deep shales" that are similar to China's own deposits.Randy Eresman, chief executive of Encana, said the new joint venture would enable the company to "accelerate the pace at which the full production potential of our Duvernay lands can be achieved". Encana has drilled nine wells in the Duvernay area and estimates that the area contains 9bn barrels of oil equivalent.Canadian regulators are considering whether or not the deal will require their review and approval, according to comments emailed to Bloomberg.
