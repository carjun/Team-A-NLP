A shooting at a Connecticut elementary school Friday left at least one child and the gunman dead, at least one teacher wounded and sent frightened pupils into the parking lot.  CBS News has confirmed at least one child is died and a law enforcement official told CBS News that "one gunman is dead" in the shooting. It is unclear if there was more than one gunman at the school. Law enforcement sources told CBS News senior correspondent John Miller that preliminary and unconfirmed information indicates that the shooter was the father of a student.  The shooter was killed and apparently had two guns, a person with knowledge of the shooting told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way.  19 PhotosConnecticut elementary school shooting  It wasn't clear how many people were injured at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. CBS Hartford affiliate WFSB-TV reports around 600 students attend the school.  Connecticut State Police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance described the situation to CBS New York station WCBS-AM as a "very serious school shooting."  A dispatcher at the Newtown Volunteer Ambulance Corps said a teacher had been shot in the foot and taken to Danbury Hospital.  Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was fine.  "It's alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America," he said.  Lisa Bailey, a Newtown resident with three children in Newtown schools, told CBSNewYork.com, "Newtown is a quiet town. I'd never expect this to happen here. It's so scary. Your kids are not safe anywhere."  The superintendent's office said the district had locked down schools in Newtown, about 60 miles northeast of New York City. Schools in neighboring towns also were locked down as a precaution.  State police said Newtown police called them around 9:40 a.m.  A photo posted by The Newtown Bee newspaper showed a group of young students  some crying, others looking visibly frightened  being escorted by adults through a parking lot in a line, hands on each other's shoulders.  Students were taken to a nearby firehouse to be reunited with their parents, CBSNewYork.com reports.    2012 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Pray for the people involved that Christ will be with them if you believe like I do. This isn't the time or place to debate gun control. if you want to do that there are other forums elsewhere.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  mecury69 says: "If a manaic is going to kill someone it can be done with anything handy. The maniac in this case could have attacked the children with a knife as easy as with a gun."I'm so sick of this argument.You have a knife, I'll have an automatic weapon. What do you think the over/under is on the number of people I could kill or you could? It's laughable.If you agree with this premise, here you can put up or shut up.Here's the challenge...a dual.You can have any sized blade you want and the other person can have any automatic weapon they want.See how STUPID your argument is then?     reply        steveotheboss replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Shutup hippie.            mecury69 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  LOL.
