Self-videoed Whitetail Deer Hunt 12 Ga Pump  by  jaggazzin  Hunting[+]jaggazz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]jaggazz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoI was hoping that posting this video would generate discussion.  Regarding the first deer down, I think he put it out on that second shot which was no more than a minute after the initial shot.  I think this is more the norm out there than one would like to think and don't believe the doe suffered long at all.  In Minnesota and Wisconsin you can shoot up to 6 deer depending on where you hunt and there is no magazine restrictions.  If given the opportunity in an overpopulated area, I would do the same thing, and every ounce of meat would end up in my freezer/belly.  MeatEater had an episode on the late season in Wisconsin and they had them stacked up like chord wood.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTeacher locked down in elementary school at the site of a school shooting (Connecticut) giving live updates.
