They are only commonly used on rural highway systems with few stop signs.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the most ridiculous thing someone has ever tried to convince you is true?

I couldn't think of what they were called yesterday morning; has I known my comment was going to be close to tops on the front page I probably would have thought more about my wording haha. While rumble strips are typically reserved for the side of the road, they are used across the road in the midwest quite often to signal that there is a stop sign ahead. This is because on these small town highways, you can often drive many miles without a stop sign, so you might be day dreaming and not see one coming without these warning strips.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the most ridiculous thing someone has ever tried to convince you is true?

It's a bullshit front meant to dupe people who are to ignorant to understand an issue. It makes the Fox News crowd feel justified behind warm and fuzzy names with malicious intents. Bills of any kind should have a generic name and that's it. "Right to Work" does nothing but take away the rights of workers. It's a fucking joke.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the most ridiculous thing someone has ever tried to convince you is true?
