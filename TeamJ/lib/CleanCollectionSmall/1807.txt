Ladies drink free.  Bar must have a 2 to 1 ratio of women and men.  They don't want equality when it comes to drinks.  Oh and why the fuck can't a woman hold a door open for me once.  JUST ONCE.  I hold it open for everybody.  Young, old, man, woman, black, white, etc...  I even hold them open so much I often hit that awkward point when they're too far away but I don't want to shut the door in their face so I sit there like a jackass waiting for them.  Not once has a woman ever held a door open for me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat gender-based double standard infuriates you the most?  by  AutumnMusickin  AskReddit[+]SunflowerFortunado 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]SunflowerFortunado 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours agoHit her back.

You know how they got it?  Paid an extra $50.  Yes, it's that easy.    In fact most gun crimes are committed with an illegal weapon so what you're saying makes no sense.  What they need are harsher penalties for having them illegally.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Do you really think somebody this insane would not have done something like this without a gun?  Guns aren't the only thing that kills you fool. In China the other day 22 people were stabbed with a knife.  So much for no guns and they'll just stop. Automatic weapons are illegal in California.  Guess what, PEOPLE STILL GET FUCKING KILLED FROM THEM ALL THE TIME THERE.  If there's not a way to get rid of every one, your plan would never work and just leave law abiding gun owners like me without a weapon to protect my own family.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo I'm sitting in a bar...and this chick asks me if I've ever seen "The Notebook"...  by  cmiller84in  pics[+]SunflowerFortunado -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)[]SunflowerFortunado -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoMake up your mind.

I have an 04 PT Cruiser and it's had a few problems.  It started vibrating when idling and would get worse if I used power like turning on the AC or headlights.  Brought it to a family friend who found oil in the spark plug wells.  He found this after my oil sending unit went bad.  He soaked the oil up and changed the plug but said their may be a leaking gasket.  Afterwards it was better.  It was even gone for a few days completely.  Now it's back with a vengeance and I'm wondering if you think he was correct?  I'm also curious if you think this is related.  When I reach certain speeds I hear a really low tingtintingtingting.  It's really fast but it only does it when accelerating.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL "Nearer, My God, to Thee" is the alleged last song played on Titanic by the band.  by  filbert13in  todayilearned[+]SunflowerFortunado 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]SunflowerFortunado 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoA large percentage of people that were on that side of the ship said it was that.

One of them let me go and in a right to work state, they don't have to provide a reason why.  The reason you ask?  I was a lifeguard and a kid shit in a pool.  Laws say you have to clean all of the water.  What'd they do?  Pulled the shit out and threw some bleach on the spot.  Guess where I was stationed?  Yep, right in the center of that spot.  Called the health department and was "coincidentally" fired because of it.2nd time was a place that was absolutely horrible.  Mandatory overtime and if you couldn't work it, you're "coincidentally" fired.  Every year in December you get a bonus.  Guess what happens, they fire half the people every year so the managers get most of that money.  If you worked there two years, you were likely working with new people and almost nobody you started with.Got fired from there, here's why.  We had to get all of the pallets from the shelves in the warehouse.  Rules say you have to use a reach truck to get them down but managers thought that took too long so they made us go up and one by one grab each pallet.  You're on a platform that's about 4x3ft so your only option is to twist and throw them or you can fall off.  On the busiest week of the year, on my 93rd pallet I twisted and it was like a jolt of electricity went through my body.  Had to go to the doctors and had a softball sized lump on my back from back spasms.  I still get pain til this day.After that incident, they transferred me to the other building to keep the incident hush hush.  Boss was in a hurry to get home so he had me do these other two guys job to finish quicker.  Unstack the pallet jacks and put them together.  Turns out, reason you have two guys do this, is because you can seriously get hurt.  Guess what happened.  I pulled the top pallet jack about 4ft off the ground by the feet and right as the wheel hit the ground, a piece of metal snapped down on my fingers.  Ended up getting a small bolt right through my finger.  Snapped down so hard straight to the bone and sealed the skin to the point it didn't bleed.  Got fired two weeks later.  The two bosses who put me in that position?  Got most of my bonus money.  To this day I still get back pain and wonder if I could sue them but this was around 5 years ago so I doubt it.Tl;drRight to work state employers completely take advantage of the laws and screw over hard working guys for their benefit.Edit:  Oh yeah, in the second place if you even said the word union, you were fired.permalinksavecontextfull commentsiAMA Mall Santa.
