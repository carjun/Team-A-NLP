We are watching the news. We are horrified. We are all sobbing. 'm currently in one of the class rooms of the neighboring school and we're in lock down. So far we have heard nothing from the administration. We know that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook School (the elementry k-4 school). There were 2 shooters alledged. One kid (confirmed with multiple sources) is wounded and carried out of the school. The shooters are still out there, not caught. One teacher was shot.My town is trending on every major news site and it's scary as fuck. Update: 3 patients admitted to danbury hospital  by ambulance and the number of people shot is up to 4 (no ages yet). Update 2: one shooter reported dead (unconfirmed but multiple people are saying that)Update 3: One child dead. One shooter still on the loose. Yale hospital has opened a triage for victims. Update 4: Unconfirmed repoet that the principle is dead. The shooter is heading down river-side (the road). Update 5: Swatt team is sweeping the school Update 6: they've taken one woman aside and she's crying into a firefighter's arms. This could mean update number 3 about a kid dead is true. Update 7: We were released back to class. There was an announcement that said the area was safe, so we are conducting classes. I need to get back to class, so I will update later. We're watching the news, it's last period but we were forced to turn it off. One of the reporter's said,"and just think that these kids were seeing santa claus last weekend." We turned the audio off and we're all crying still.This is hell. Some kids are bawling in the bathroom, there are only 10 or so (out of 25) that remained in class). Nobody has a dry eye right now. Some kids are angry and swearing, others are staring at their feet. We don't know how to deal with this. This town has virtually no crime, we were unprepared. permalinksave[+]Savioritis 284 points285 points286 points 1 hour ago*(33 children)[]Savioritis 284 points285 points286 points 1 hour ago*"Alright, shooting's over, back to class!"...dafuq??EDIT: Just heard on the police radio, they've decided to get the kids in the other schools home.

My surprise wasn't from the actual going back to the classrooms, but the continuation of classwork.

I'm not saying I agree, but I can at least see some reasoning to that line of thinking.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes agoI thought OP said he was pretty much next door?permalinksaveparent[+]mattmagician 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes ago (2 children)[]mattmagician 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes agoI think it's more to try to distract them, keep them occupied.

I remember someone in the elevator telling me a plane had hit the WTC.  When I got to my desk, I looked it up and it was right after the second plane hit.About 15 minutes later, they came on the PA and said "We are safe here.  Everyone return back to work."I packed up my shit and went home immediately.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 24 minutes ago (0 children)[]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 24 minutes agoSmart man. I was in school when it happened.. Watched the second hit live while I was returning a book to the library. Had no idea what was going on until they locked down the school, turned out the lights and had everyone watching the T.V.permalinksaveparent[+]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes agoSame thing happened when there was a school shooting near my high school.  They did business as usual, but there were TVs on in all the classes and absolutely NOBODY was allowed to roam the halls.  Parents came because they wanted to pick their kids up and take them home, but they weren't allowing any non-students or faculty in the building and that made a little clusterfuck.Really, when it's not your actual school that has the incident, letting kids go home would do nothing but create undue chaos.permalinksaveparent[+]epicflyman 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes ago (1 child)[]epicflyman 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes agoYou'd be surprised.

There were very nonchalant about it, most likely to keep fear and panic to a minimum. (One victim said it was because his parents were big-time funders)He got caught when he messed with the wrong chick, thankfully.permalinksaveparent[+]jilljuckhaven 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (1 child)[]jilljuckhaven 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoWhy the kids, man?

Never would have expected this, not in Newtown, not in an elementary school, not in a million years.  Thinking about the dead child's parents makes me want to cry, and I'm furious.
