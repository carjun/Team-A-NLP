You'll pay a fraction of what the big name schools charge,  and come out with 3 years of actual work experience, something a hiring chef will care more about than where you got a piece of paper from. I did it,  and am currently in charge of people who went to let cordon Bleu and graduated when I did. Though judging by your username, maybe it's a different line of work you're looking for! permalinksavecontextfull commentsWell played Nintendo, I wonder what the kids will ask Santa for...  by  ThHereticin  gaming[+]gastronaut66 0 points1 point2 points 18 days ago (0 children)[]gastronaut66 0 points1 point2 points 18 days agoThe way the image loaded on my phone was cropped to where it looked like the sign just said "Kevin jew"  and I was most confused permalinksavecontextfull commentsI was talking to a friend who works at Target, who wouldn't share certain store policies with me because she could lose her job. So, Reddit, what are some corporate secrets you can now disclose about [Company X] now that you no longer work there?  by  gigastazioin  AskReddit[+]gastronaut66 0 points1 point2 points 23 days ago (0 children)[]gastronaut66 0 points1 point2 points 23 days agoBeing polite to the front desk (and everyone,  really), is the best policy. My gf and I went to Louisville recently,  and our flight got in 5 hours before check in. Asked the front desk nicely,  and they let us check in waaaay early. Turned what would have been a big pain into a great experience. If anyone ever stays at the Galt House in Louisville,  just be nice and you will get the best service ever.

I have a saffron and shrimp stock hot in the stove. When I receive an order, I heat a pan,  and throw in my ingredients (for money,  I add chorizo, braised chicken leg meat,  raw whitefish,  raw shrimp,  raw mussels).  Once they're seared,  I hit it with the stock,  and cook it in that so it doesn't dry out.  When time to fire,  I toss in the already cooked rice and parsley,  and turn it out into a paella pan. Numerous customers who've been to Spain say it's the best in town,  though I do wish I could get that nice crust on the rice in the pan. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI scream, you scream...  by  DIP_MY_BALLS_IN_ITin  funny[+]gastronaut66 10 points11 points12 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]gastronaut66 10 points11 points12 points 2 months agoRoot beer milk aaaahhhhhhpermalinksavecontextfull commentsElectroswing, the best music genre you've probably never heard of.  by  xPushxin  Music[+]gastronaut66 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]gastronaut66 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoA few months ago my dishwasher played some of this style of music for me but said it was called "hip bop"? permalinksavecontextfull commentsspanglish in the walk-in  by  MrMentalloin  KitchenConfidential[+]gastronaut66 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]gastronaut66 2 points3 points4 points 2 months agoWe have a whiteboard where you write down items that need to be ordered.
