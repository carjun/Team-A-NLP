It should be no surprise that they tend to be more successful at delivering value.That's usually because the small businesses which don't, fail (natural selection in action!).The solution is obviously to break all large businesses into many small ones, and let the poorly-run bits fail (I say this only half in jest).permalinksavecontextfull commentsDear r/Economics, I don't understand Bitcoin.  by  mavensbotin  economy[+]mOdQuArK 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]mOdQuArK 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoI think you can essentially call it a requirement if you want your economy to extend beyond the boundaries of a collection of small agragrian villages.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDear r/Economics, I don't understand Bitcoin.  by  mavensbotin  economy[+]mOdQuArK 6 points7 points8 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]mOdQuArK 6 points7 points8 points 5 days agoYour argument is based on the assumption that milk is just as good a payment as a formalized form of currency.
