We aren't defined by our worst when most of us are fighting, or at least hoping, for decency and kindness.Edit: I'm not talking about those who suffer from mental illness, I'm talking about those who malevolently inflict pain on others. To me, that is a sick person. I'm not talking about depressed people, or bipolar people, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]RuTsui 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (8 children)[]RuTsui 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoThere is not really any such thing as a broken mind. Humans are each born individuals with individual brains. The way someone's brain functions (free of disease or physical damage) is just the way they are as an organism. It's the same with any living, thinking creature. It will never end because genetic diversity dictates that people with this type of mind will be born no matter what you try to do to prevent it. It's hardwired into them. The only thing we can do is separate them from society, from those of us who were born with our minds similar enough that we were able to make values, laws, and culture. These individual organisms that stray from that pattern are forced out either through prison or death. If you're scientifically minded, you'll accept that this was a course of nature, and that it's going to happen anyways. If you belong to one of many major religions, you probably believe that a higher deity has set this course and that it is again out of your hands. I know this isn't much to say for those dead, but what I want to convey is that this type of thing will continue to happen because that's how the world turns. permalinksaveparent[+]0ab83a7b 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]0ab83a7b 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoIn other words, Honey Nature don't give a fuck.permalinksaveparent[+]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoIndeed. It's the same as how some people are born stronger, some people are born more sociable, some people are born with high metabolisms, some people are born athletes, scholars, cowards, etc. These are all just variations of human beings that have branched out within the entirety of humanity. Some of these people, unfortunately, are born hostile. permalinksaveparent[+]RenlyIsAHomo 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (5 children)[]RenlyIsAHomo 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoAs a depressive person (with no violent tendencies so far) your comment makes me feel like offing myself is the right thing to do.permalinksaveparent[+]cdskip 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]cdskip 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoIt isn't. Depressive doesn't mean violent. Violent doesn't mean depressive. And maybe most importantly, depressive now doesn't have to mean depressive forever.Get counseling. Get drugs if they're warranted. Don't kill yourself because of misguided fear that you'll do something monstrous.permalinksaveparent[+]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoIf your depression is caused by a chemical imbalance, like many who are clinically depressed, then that is a ailment. That is a malfunction in your brain.Otherwise, you're still a human being. Like I said, we shun people who are different without the understanding that it is simply how they are made. If their hard-wiring causes damage or harm to society, then they isolate them. With someone who is depressed with no violent tendencies, all we can do is accept you. That's who you are because of a course of nature. It's nothing anyone did wrong, it's nothing that we can control. If you think you'll be a danger later down the road, go ahead and speak out about it. Specialists within society are trained just to work with those who are born outside of our standardized norms. Just remember that humanity is many individual organisms that make up a single biomass. We are still humanity, no matter where the individuals may branch out to. permalinksaveparent[+]pissoutofmyass 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (1 child)[]pissoutofmyass 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoWe do have medication meant to treat depression, some of which works very well.permalinksaveparent[+]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoRight, because clinical depression is a chemical imbalance. That's actually an ailment. This doesn't fall in line with biological individuality. It can happen to anyone, even those born within our social norms. Depression can be treated. Being naturally more violent can't be, that's the difference between biodiversity and an actual, mental problem. permalinksaveparent[+]pissoutofmyass 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago*(0 children)[]pissoutofmyass 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago*That is not at all what I meant.

To me, that is a sick person. I'm not talking about depressed people, or bipolar people, etc.Are they not commonly one and the same?permalinksaveparent[+]pissoutofmyass 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (1 child)[]pissoutofmyass 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoThis still does not establish the character of mentally ill people generally, only the character of hurtful people generally. In other words, mental illness may afflict a great proportion of "sick" people, but mentally ill people are not generally "sick" in the way I defined the term. Most mental illness is internalized suffering.permalinksaveparent[+]spencer102 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]spencer102 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoI meant it in the reverse.permalinksaveparent[+]Twotest 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Twotest 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago45 people (38 of which were children) died at an elementary school disaster in 1927.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disasterpermalinksaveparent[+]ABCosmos 9 points10 points11 points 1 day ago (14 children)[]ABCosmos 9 points10 points11 points 1 day agoPeople keep saying that.. But I think we should be careful to make such assumptions.  We might overlook potential causes for the recent increase (if there is one).  Anyone got any data to back up either claim?permalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You 16 points17 points18 points 23 hours ago (7 children)[]iGotChubs4You 16 points17 points18 points 23 hours agoFirst off, no its not going to cause us to overlook shit, especially in the paranoid country we are in.Google Steven Pinker "the surprising decline in violence".  Harvard professor explains how we are living in the least violent time in history with stats to back it up.permalinksaveparent[+]ABCosmos 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*(6 children)[]ABCosmos 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*Relative to the origin of humans on earth sure that makes sense.  I was really focused on a much smaller time frame.  Id be interested in a year by year analysis of this type of violence in america since the 1950's for example..Paranoid people will reach conclusions for sure.. I'm just worried they wont be the correct ones.permalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (5 children)[]iGotChubs4You -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoLook up the Bath shooting.permalinksaveparent[+]ABCosmos 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]ABCosmos 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoWell, i dont think anyone is arguing that nothing bad ever happened in the past.  Again, im interested in a real analysis of occurrence of this type of thing in the last several decades.  Not any one specific event.permalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago (3 children)[]iGotChubs4You -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours agohttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ushomicidesbyweapon.svg#permalinksaveparent[+]ABCosmos 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (2 children)[]ABCosmos 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoIm sorry... perhaps I am not being clear.  I am interested in how often this type of random mass killing type event has happened every year for the past several decades.  These events only count for a very small amount of the overall gun violence in the country, so overall gun violence/homicide rates are not really relevant.permalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]iGotChubs4You -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours agoThen fucking look it up yourself.permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]eugene76 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]eugene76 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoThe World?  Dude shit like this happens in the Congo every day, and has for the last 25 years.  So no, the world is the same.  But the US might be getting more crazy people who do things like this, despite the overall historically low murder rates.  Lack of mental health services?  Poor diet?permalinksaveparent[+]CapAhab 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]CapAhab 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoThere might be fluctuations within the past hundred years, but people have always been violent and found enjoyment in death throughout human history.  In Medieval times, all executions were public - people would bring their families and eat lunch while watching someone hang (there are many reports and paintings of this).  Also remember thousands of people would watch people in a ring kill each other just for the sport.  Many people like to believe that we are above the violence of these atrocious acts because we are more intelligent than other animals - we dress nicely, act cordial to others, and have wealth.  However, we're just as primitive and brutal as we were thousands of years ago.permalinksaveparent[+]brazilliandanny 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (3 children)[]brazilliandanny 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoDude, slavery, gladiators, genocide, mas executions, medieval torture. Humanity has always been harsh. The only thing that's changed is we've just  gotten better at killing eachother. permalinksaveparent[+]pilesofwater 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]pilesofwater 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours agoWe've gotten better at covering it 24/7 and shoving it down the throats of the populous.The news media is obsessed with deathpermalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]iGotChubs4You 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoNo, you have that completely wrong.  What gets a news station more money? More viewers.  How do you get more viewers? You cater to them.  Its the people who are obsessed with these acts.  This thread proves it.  What the fuck is the difference between a news station broadcasting it for a few days straight and Reddit talking about it for a few days straight.Not a god damn thing.permalinksaveparent[+]aaalexxx 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]aaalexxx 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoYup, our capacity to inflict harm has increased alongside technological advancements. Fully automatic guns, atom bombs, chemical weapons and push button delivery systems let us kill each other more "efficiently" and without getting all too personal compared with hand to hand combat. It makes me wonder whether technological achievements are worth the trouble.permalinksaveparent[+]gonetosea 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]gonetosea 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago*Schizophrenia is a real sickness. We can diagnosis it early and we can treat it. Just saying this person was sick is simply stating the obvious. Schizophrenia can't be cured by prayer -- talking to imaginary prayer friends makes it worse.permalinksaveparent[+]lilrabbitfoofoo 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]lilrabbitfoofoo 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoWhile there have always been people with mental illness killing others randomly, the difference today is that these people now have access to military grade weapons that can kills scores of people in very short periods of time.permalinksaveparent[+]ClusterFugg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]ClusterFugg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoWell said.

When I was in school things like this were rare--one every couple of years if that (this was the 70's and 80's).  Now there have been three in just the last couple of weeks.

It's not that human beings are sick, it's that they're individuals. permalinksaveparent[+]vincentkun 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago*(0 children)[]vincentkun 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago*Not really.  The reason we get all angry when this kind of stuff happen in the US is because of how rare it happens, and how many massacres there have been in 1 year.  Look at the middle east where it happens at least once a week.  Literally one or two weeks ago a school bus full of children got blown up...Take this for example.  It literally happened TODAY in China: http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-man-slashes-22-children-near-china-school-20121214,0,6383015.story  That's 22 children dead, and it is not even the first of these events over there.permalinksaveparent[+]KarmaAndLies 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]KarmaAndLies 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago"Guns don't kill people, people do."

People tend to perceive these events in Europe as happening in the individual country but when the chance per capita is averaged out, it is roughly the same as the US.I won't argue that we don't have a gun problem, other types of gun crimes are far more likely in the US but these multiple-victim public shootings seem to be happening at the same rate in Europe. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
