Went to Total Wine last night (thanks radio ad), and grabbed Dogfish Head Midas Touch, 90 Minute, and a Founders Breakfast Stout. We would never get this stuff back home. Now to go back tonight and try more new stuff. I wish I could bring it all home.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Jn Gnarr, Mayor of Reykjavk.

But you are missing out on some of the world's best beers that only the LCBO will ever get in for you. To each their own. I don't mind stocking up and keeping them at home so whenever I want something it is chilled in my beer fridge, and replaced with something new to try.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNever mind the LCBO  The Beer Store is an embarrassment  by  obixxin  toronto[+]ScienceKiller 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 4 points5 points6 points 3 days agoThe LCBO does carry Unibroue (http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?ITEM_NAME=unibroue&ITEM_NUMBER=&language=EN). They also carry Unibroue's La Terrible, a signature beer that The Beer Store doesn't carry. I agree they don't carry Maudite or Trois Pistoles, but still not bad.  Plus the LCBO carries Flying Monkey (http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?ITEM_NAME=flying+monkey&ITEM_NUMBER=&language=EN) and they carry Muskoka (http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?ITEM_NAME=lakes+of+muskoka&ITEM_NUMBER=&language=EN).  Your LCBO may not carry it, but if you speak to the manager, they will bring it in for you.  If you think The Beer Store has better selection, look at forum's like Bar Towel and check the LCBO site to see what they carry. Then talk to the local LCBO and ask them to bring that stuff in for you, and they will.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNever mind the LCBO  The Beer Store is an embarrassment  by  obixxin  toronto[+]ScienceKiller 9 points10 points11 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 9 points10 points11 points 3 days agoI have never once waited 30 minutes at line in the LCBO, so that is not a concern of mine.   I agree The Beer Store needs to be replaced with private competition, but I still think the LCBO would be the best place for quality beers.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNever mind the LCBO  The Beer Store is an embarrassment  by  obixxin  toronto[+]ScienceKiller 11 points12 points13 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 11 points12 points13 points 3 days agoYou must be joking. The LCBO is about to bring in Westvleteren 12, arguably the best beer made in the world. The Beer Store would never have a chance to bring it in. Not to mention some recent craft beers brought in by the LCBO including features on Shipyard Brewery and Nogne O. Just look at this forum: http://www.bartowel.com/board/viewforum.php?f=15&sid=61b302c07589543417c2045e4f5d7d23 Everything is discussing what the LCBO brings in, because they bring in good beer. Nothing The Beer Store does can compare to that.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNever mind the LCBO  The Beer Store is an embarrassment  by  obixxin  toronto[+]ScienceKiller 31 points32 points33 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 31 points32 points33 points 3 days agoAt the end of the day, the LCBO offers better beer anyway. Unless you buy 24s or kegs of swill, the LCBO will serve you far better.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRent reduction notices in the mail to 136,000 Toronto households  by  masteractorin  toronto[+]ScienceKiller 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoYour rent can only increase by 2.5% legally, so it shouldn't be that bad.

I remember about 2 years ago when Billy Bragg's online store found a box in their warehouse. $20 bucks each, they must have all been gone within an hour. That was a good day.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat the heck happened to Priestess?  by  RhymesWithEloquentin  stonerrock[+]ScienceKiller 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 3 points4 points5 points 4 days agoUncle Bad Touch played plenty of shows in 2012.

Myself and the guy who was trading are starting our own league with proper written rules. We posted various articles on how gutless people are who veto to prevent others from getting better, but as there are no rules on what constitutes a vetoable trade it didn't go through. Oh well. Him and i both have good shots at winning still. Hopefully we can take their money and be on our way. permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust noticed a playoff team not starting RG3 tomorrow...and has only played him once this year.  by  editthis7in  fantasyfootball[+]ScienceKiller 6 points7 points8 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 6 points7 points8 points 6 days agoGuy in my league has brees and rg3. He traded rg3 and ryan mathews for calvin johnson. But the league vetoed it because mathews and rg3 were bench players for him and the trade made him too strong. I hate my league. I didn't veto but i suppose I have a better shot at winning now that his team is not the monster team it could have been. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReminder: Don't Put Thursday Players in Your Flex Spot  by  eink21in  fantasyfootball[+]ScienceKiller 18 points19 points20 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 18 points19 points20 points 7 days agoSay you start 2 WR, 2 RB, and a RB/WR flex. If you put your Thursday night player in your flex, and then a RB is injured between now and Sunday, you are stuck replacing that person with another RB.  However, if you place your Thursday night player as the RB, and that other player gets hurt, you can arrange your roster so that your flex spot is open to either a RB or a WR, giving yourself more options come Sunday.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust Adam Vaughn catching up on...Adam Vaughn  by  laufauxin  toronto[+]ScienceKiller 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoIf you were really pumping up a mayoral bid you would have spelled his name correctly.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust Adam Vaughn catching up on...Adam Vaughn  by  laufauxin  toronto[+]ScienceKiller 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoYou created an account just to post that photo?

If I have to get a councillor involved, I'll likely not bother.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDoes the season end as soon as draft order is determined?

A large portion of them are from the GTA. There aren't that many free rides available, and most will still charge for gas.

You threaten to sue - 1st Rule in the Greyhound Bus corporate playbook  by  Darkumbrain  toronto[+]ScienceKiller 8 points9 points10 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]ScienceKiller 8 points9 points10 points 9 days agoThey thought of an idea for a market that is underserved, they successfully executed it in Kingston without issue, they priced it competitively in that it sold tickets in London. Idiots would not be able to accomplish all that. Sure it would have been smarter to research the legality of it in London, but not doing so doesn't make them idiots. Students at Fanshawe who start riots and blow cars up are idiots.  In your situation it would be the opposite of a genius, considering how easy drugs are to find on campus without outing yourself.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
