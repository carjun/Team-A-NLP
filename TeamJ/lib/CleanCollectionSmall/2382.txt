You can't bring on people that don't know anything / have the education.He has, however, put together the IT in the D program to teach willing folks some of these skills and offer them an opportunity to apply for an internship. I'm honestly shocked tat you're so pissed of at him for pouring money into the city.

Some courts are so overloaded that they offer to let people get out of jail for time served if they agree not to ask for an attorney.  by  doc_daneekain  todayilearned[+]vinspee 4 points5 points6 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]vinspee 4 points5 points6 points 2 months agoMost of the problem is mismanagement of the funds. You have to "grease the palms" of the appropriate person to get just about anything done, even if it's a logical, cost-effective, simple program. The city council blocks any aide from the state and insists on "running the city", but it's filled with old-school Detroit blood and money that won't allow change. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that the entire city of Detroit had (2008) only five part time public defenders, working an average of 2400-2800 cases each per year.

(Detroit, MI)  by  Margrain  WTF[+]vinspee 5 points6 points7 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]vinspee 5 points6 points7 points 2 months agoI live at 9 mile & Woodward. This street is at about 7 mile and Campau. Between us is the infamous "8 Mile", the so-called border between black and white neighborhoods, as well as I-75 (A major freeway). A lot of things happen between here and there. Also, if you travel down Woodward to seven mile, on the east side of the road are abandoned businesses an neighborhoods, on the west is an extremely affluent area. Detroit is weird that way. In addition, I probably should have said virtually no VIOLENT crime. permalinksavecontextfull commentsStill want to drive a Google Maps car?
