I know the judicial branch has somehow warped those words into meaning guns for everyone, but that's not what the Constitution says, its not how it should be read, and its only since the 60s that it has been interpreted as such.Historical ignorance has real world effects.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Even if he succeeds in filling Justin's super up (which is, inarguably, a crazy strategy) he has to actually hit the parry sequence. Which means he has to know exactly when Justin is going to throw it, and start tapping the parry before Justin visually triggers the SA.Thats why its an ultimate level technique that people always come back to. Its not just parrying the super, its setting it up and executing the response with 0% room for error.ETA: (No criticism to Justin either, throwing the Super in that situation is the proper move 99.9% of the time, no way anyone could predict they were being setup for a counter-parry situation, because that's just a crazy thing to even attempt)permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf the President of the US were to get assassinated in today's age, how would America react compared to when Kennedy was assassinated?  by  chendoguyin  AskReddit[+]glass_daggers -1 points0 points1 point 6 days ago (0 children)[]glass_daggers -1 points0 points1 point 6 days agoGotta disagree there.

You seem to be under the impression that two of the best rap artists in history didn't know what they were doing and half-assed it on a fucking track of the year. Like rhyming in 4/4 time was some amazing insight by Killer Mike. That shit is boring. His verse is boring. You got two artists trying to do something a little different, unique, identifiable, and it works, and you're saying they put zero effort into it.I think your grasp is exceeding your reach on this one.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBig Boi Says Andr 3000 Isn't on His Album Because of "Some Gillette Shit"  by  fila429in  hiphopheads[+]glass_daggers 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]glass_daggers 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoSyncopation, look it uppermalinksavecontextfull commentsBig Boi Says Andr 3000 Isn't on His Album Because of "Some Gillette Shit"  by  fila429in  hiphopheads[+]glass_daggers 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]glass_daggers 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoPlayer I grind, my focus is crime Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime My words are diamonds dug out a mine Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss I catch a beat runnin like Randy Moss That's not fun, that's nursery school shit, especially compared to bars like I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do I have always held a grudge against Mike for fucking that song up.
