Gohmert: More access to guns could avert mass shootingsPosted by Sean Sullivan on December 16, 2012 at 11:47 amText SizePrintReprintsShare:More   Facebook TwitterStumbleUpon Digg DeliciousRep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) suggested Sunday that greater access to guns could help prevent mass killings akin to the deadly shooting at a Connecticut school Friday.Once we have this actually open dialogue about the situation, Chris,you find out that  every mass killingof more than threepeoplein recent history has been in a place where guns were prohibited, Gohmert said in an interview on Fox News Sunday.He added: They choose this place. They know no one will be armed.Gohmert said he wished that the principal of the school where the deadly Connecticut shootingoccurredhad been armed in order to defend against the shooter.Principal Dawn Hochsprungwas killed in the attack after trying to stop the gunman, officials said.I wish to god she had an M4 in her office locked up, so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out, shetakes him out, Gohmert said.Even as gun-control advocates called Sunday for stepping up restrictions in the wake of Fridays massshooting, Gohmert said that he believed there as as morepeoplehave access to firearms, crime drops.Every time guns have been allowed  the crime rate has gone down, he said.Gohmert reacted to a deadly shooting at a Colorado movie theater earlier this year by suggesting that the outcome may have been different if someone else in the theater had beencarryinga gun and could have stopped the shooter.TAGSgun control, Sunday shows  PREVIOUS NEXT  Feinstein will introduce assault weapons ban in SenateBy Sean SullivanDecember 16, 2012What President Obama said about gun control in the 2012 campaignBy Chris CillizzaDecember 16, 2012The Post Most:Politics
