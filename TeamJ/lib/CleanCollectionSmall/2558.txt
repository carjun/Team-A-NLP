Although it would be surprising if Finland had as many shootings as the USA. I accept that the USA has the worst problem with this stuff, but it's hardly a black-and-white issue where one culture is sick and the other is well.permalinksaveparent[+]Delheru 3 points4 points5 points 22 minutes ago (1 child)[]Delheru 3 points4 points5 points 22 minutes agoAs a Finn, I'm fairly certain we have more of these than you do adjusted for population. Finland has really rather good health care services, though perhaps the cultural attitude towards mental illness is not always healthy (huge levels of anger can be considered good, in a 'sisu' type of way... dark side is fine as long as you channel it to productivity, if you will).Few points:1. US has roughly 60x Finlands population.2. Finland had a school shooting in 2008 at Kauhajoki3. Finland had a school shooting in 2007 at Jokela      So in the last 5 years, Finland has had 2 shootings. Adjusted to population the US should have had 120 school shooting in the past 5 years, or 2 school shootings every month.I dunno if you picked Finland at random, but it was a very bad choice of example of a place that has it better in this regard than the US.permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 19 minutes agoWith all due respect, you merely misunderstood my point. My point was that Finland was smaller than the USA, so it makes sense that they have fewer absolute shootings -- it would be truly bizarre if a country the size of Finland had more shooting that the USA. And I chose Finland not at random, but for exactly the reasons you say and the numbers you cite. In absolute numbers the USA is far worse, but in a relative sense, according to its population, it's shockingly similar. This highlights the fact that, while the USA has the worst problem with this stuff, it's also a larger country and that is a small part of what leads to more incidents as an absolute number.permalinksaveparent[+]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 26 minutes ago (2 children)[]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 26 minutes agoAmerican culture isn't sick, but the gun laws are ridiculous over there.People will say "Oh but if guns were illegal criminals still would have gotten them". True, but if you make guns so easy to get a hold of, insane people who otherwise wouldn't have made the effort will do disgusting shit like this.permalinksaveparent[+]smacbeats 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (1 child)[]smacbeats 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoThey're also incredibly easy to get a hold of on the black market. I could probably get an AK-47 in my hands by the time the day is over. I could also construct a working bomb powerful enough to kill a dozen people using freely available information on the internet and materials you can buy at a store.permalinksaveparent[+]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes agoI don't know what to about this problem, but I just don't get how people could be in favour of guns being legal.
