I think the BSA is a great organization for kids to have fun, learn cool stuff, and get to do things they might not normally do.  I help out with the executive board locally.   I had a great time in the scouts.  I'm so very glad that this guy never touched me.  He definitely tried a little grooming, but my parents (and others) recognized it and he was removed.I don't agree with the anti-gay stance, I don't agree with the christian themes.  Did I like camping and fires, and doing fun "boy stuff" like building shit, smoking cigarettes, cussing, and not bathing for a few days?  Hell yes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShit Android Users Say  by  [deleted]in  Android[+]xbenzerox 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]xbenzerox 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoholy shit that dude is ugly.permalinksavecontextfull comments102 year old practicing OB physician hospitalized after fall.

Info in comments.  by  xbenzeroxin  lego[+]xbenzerox[S] 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]xbenzerox[S] 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoGot this email from a buddy of mine.  It's amazing!  Hey Y'all,I thought you might be interested to see a LEGO project I worked on - it's a working Roman aqueduct. My company's having a contest amongst employees to celebrate its 100th anniversary, so teams were tasked with creating a LEGO creation that relates to architecture/engineering/planning, within a budget of $750 (sounds like a lot, but specialty LEGOs add up!).  The excutives in NYC are the judges, of which they'll donate $25,000 to the first place team's local Habitat for Humanity chapter ($12,500 for 2nd place and five $2,500 donations for honorable mention).  See YouTube links below, and I organized a good amount of the base's painting (drew/painted the Roman roads myself).I'll keep you posted if we win anything!permalinksavecontextfull comments25456Working Roman aqueduct!
