All young Israelis have mandatory national service. Many are allowed leave to go home or about the town. What the military does is that it requires all recruits to carry around their service weapon with them at all times during training in order for them to become accustomed and familiar with it.It's a great idea for a small nation whose neighbors all within a 300 kilometer radius hate them. So while I don't like Israel as a nation, the people there are swell.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted]  comment score below threshold (0 children)[][deleted] -6 points-5 points-4 points 1 hour agoMandatory service would be a good thing for this country.permalinksaveparent[+]Gadsden 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (8 children)[]Gadsden 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours agoMore stupid than a room full of dead kids and a teacher whose gun was left in the car?permalinksaveparent[+]FlyingRock 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]FlyingRock 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours agoThere's more to it then what meets the eye, such as how everyone serves in the military so they're properly trained.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted]  comment score below threshold (6 children)[][deleted] -7 points-6 points-5 points 2 hours agoLet's see what happens when that teacher has a mental breakdown and shoots up her class.

Having everyone carry guns around exacerbates the problem.permalinksaveparent[+]Gadsden 2 points3 points4 points 38 minutes ago (3 children)[]Gadsden 2 points3 points4 points 38 minutes agoYet the places you're most likely to be murdered are the gun-free zones of America.The nation was much more obsessed, guns were much more readily available, and ammo was cheaper years ago when kids could drive their cars to school with their guns hanging in the back windows of their pickup trucks w/o everyone having a shit fit, yet the shootings didn't really happen.Plus you're ignoring the fact that in the last few years gun sales have been through the roof, setting records, and the crime/murder rates have been dropping.I think the real problem here is the obsession with getting the bigger story [headlines].permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]davesidious  comment score below threshold (12 children)[]davesidious -77 points-76 points-75 points 2 hours agoAmericans mostly, it seems.

I can only surmise an older brother/relative of one of the students made the terribly drastic decision to take care of the kid bullying their brother/relative. Then the principal for not listening to the childs' crys for help.  That's the only logic I can put on the situation as I've read it now.
