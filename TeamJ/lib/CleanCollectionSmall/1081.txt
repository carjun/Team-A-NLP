They found Adam Lanza, dead by his own hand after shooting up two classrooms; no officer fired a gun.Student Brendan Murray told WABC-TV it was chaos in his classroom at first after he heard loud bangs and screaming. A police officer came in and asked, Is he in here? and then ran out. Then our teacher, somebody, yelled, Get to a safe place. Then we went to a closet in the gym and we sat there for a little while, and then the police were, like, knocking on the door and they were, like, Were evacuating people, were evacuating people, so we ran out.Children, warned to close their eyes so they could not see the product of his labors, were led away from their school.Parents rushed to the scene. Family members walked away from a firehouse that was being used as a staging area, some of them weeping. One man, wearing a T-shirt without a jacket, put his arms around a woman as they walked down the middle of the street, oblivious to everything around them.Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and other public officials came to the firehouse. So did clergymen like Monsignor Robert Weiss of Newtowns St. Rose Roman Catholic Church. He watched as parents came to realize that they would never see their children alive again. All of them were hoping their child would be found OK. But when they gave out the actual death toll, they realized their child was gone, Weiss said.He recalled the reaction of the brother of one of the victims. They told a little boy it was his sister who passed on, Weiss said. The boys response was, Im not going to have anyone to play with.___Jocelyn Noveck reported from New York.
