Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) promised to introduce a new assault weapons ban on the first day of the new Congress, challenging President Obama to back the bill. Feinstein sponsored the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, and has been working on a new ban since the Aurora movie theater shooting in July. Four shooting sprees later, Feinstein has vowed to introduce the legislation on the first day of the 113th Congress. Feinsteins assault weapons ban will force Obama to take a stance on gun control after many promises to address the issue. The senator told Meet the Press host David Gregory that her ban would cover the sale and importation of assault weapons, certain kinds of bullets, big drums and extended magazines:I can tell you that [Obama] is going to have a bill to lead on because its a first-day bill Im going to introduce in the Senate and the same bill is going to be introduced in the House. A bill to ban assault weapons. It will ban the sale, the importation, and the possession  not retroactively but perspectively. And it will ban the same of big clips, drums, or strips of big bullets. So there will be a bill. Weve been working on it now a year.In the wake of the elementary school shooting in Newtown, CT on Friday that left 28 people dead, the majority of whom were children, Obama gave an emotional speech calling for lawmakers to put politics aside and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like these. Gun control measures have wide support among Americans, including members of the National Rifle Association, the most powerful gun lobby in the world. The Newtown elementary school gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, primarily used a Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle.Tags:Dianne FeinsteinGuns CloseWant to see more great content like this?Like ThinkProgress on FacebookJust click the button below:Don't show this to me again Previous in TP Justice  Next in TP Justice By clicking and submitting a comment I acknowledge the ThinkProgress Privacy Policy and agree to the ThinkProgress Terms of Use.
