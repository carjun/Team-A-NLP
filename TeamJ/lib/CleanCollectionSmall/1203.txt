He was also driving under the influence, and was subsequently arrested and charged with DUI hit-and-run.Since that terrible accident occurred, Bush has been held in a Charlotte County jail while awaiting a trial. However, according to a Tampa Bay Times report on Friday, it appears that trial will not take place as the now 26-year-old has decided to accept a plea deal at his next scheduled hearing on Tuesday.Attorney Russell Kirshy declined to offer specifics on the agreement, at least until Tuesday's court hearing. But Bush's father, Daniel, said it will involve a prison sentence of at least three years, not including the time already served."He's taking it pretty good," Daniel Bush said. "He's not crying or sulking. He's preparing for it. Everybody in our family is backing him up."At the time of his arrest, Bush was attempting to make a comeback with the Tampa Bay Rays after being converted from a shortstop to a pitcher. He'd signed a minor league contract in 2010, worked his way through the organization, and in the opinion of many was right on the cusp of making it to the big leagues. The Rays held him on their restricted list throughout the season before releasing him in October.Big League Stew's David Brown spoke to Bush in February and provided an in-depth look at his personal struggles and comeback attempt when the accident was originally reported.Looking for more baseball chatter?Follow @bigleaguestew, @Townie813 and check out the BLS Facebook PageFantasy advice from the Yahoo!

He had removed his belt, swung it at a passing car and crashed his vehicle when trying to flee the scene. A fleet of police arrived to arrest him. Hog-tied on the ground, Bush kicked, screamed and carried on like a toddler denied a toy. I dont care, he yelled. Then he started to cry."From Yahoo news nine months ago.v1/comments/context/b442ce03-2814-34bf-bf4a-ffcc2a2ad197/comment/1355623589626-bee81c75-6cdf-46b3-9869-22f3aaedfa82/reply/0000eb000000000000000000000000-a31e86b6-0fee-4a46-84ea-745e6f5194e7WillieTheWimp1 hour 50 minutes agoAre them thangs real, Vavoom?

Did he pick up 2% milk at the store instead of skim? Did he forget to put the toilet seat up? He didn't make a mistake, he made a choice - a decision to drive drunk and put another person at risk. He also made the decision to leave the scene of the crime. Crimes are not mistakes. People are not put in jail for mistakes. And he is not going to jail because he accepts his 'mistakes', he's going because he got caught.

They dont get punished for breaking rules and many times in smaller towns for breaking laws.  They dont know how to act because they figure no one is ever going to hold them accountable.  When they actually do get arrested, they dont know why.v1/comments/context/b442ce03-2814-34bf-bf4a-ffcc2a2ad197/comment/1355639916509-1cd2826c-6253-4443-b072-c9a3aaaa2df2/reply/00006b000000000000000000000000-cec55056-0ec2-4b4c-be54-9c7b22a425baPHIL G5 hours agoRIGHT !!

But I do it at home.  I never drink when I'm out, because I don't want to be bothered with the inconvenience of a designated driver or taxi and I wouldn't dare drive drunk.

In the 2004 draft the Padres picked him mainly for his signability.  The #2 pick that year was Justin Verlander.  The only other #1 picks to not make the bigs are Brien Taylor (1991,pitcher,Yankees) and Steve Chilcott (1966,catcher, Mets).  In the 1966 draft the Mets took Chilcott over #2 pick Reggie Jackson.  In the 1991 draft the best player in the top 10 was probably Dmitri (the Meat Hook) Young.  Manny Ramirez was picked 13th.v1/comments/context/b442ce03-2814-34bf-bf4a-ffcc2a2ad197/comment/1355614999908-37809894-3027-4883-8c9d-43c99af9beed21 hours agoAnother example of misguided over rated talent.

I'm sure if you'd ask the victim he'd rather see something like this guy be ALLOWED to continue his career and then HE get a substantial portion of his salary in compensation.  That way the victim gets some form of compensation and this guy gets a chance at a decent life.  The way it stands now is one guy is a cripple and the other guy goes to jail and both will be a drain on society.
