They insisted we travel to Ammazzadespite the danger of walkers.Natan and I begrudging had to admit it was actually great pizza despite not being in NYC. Lila and Katie proceeded to celebrate their victory this round, but its not over yetThis work date was well timed with our joint assignment with Travel + Leisure. We would nominate Ammazza for best pizza in Atlanta. Whats your favorite place to eat like a local?

There are plenty of caveats, since turnout obviously wont be the same as it was, thanks to Superstorm Sandy and a host of other factors. But my takeaway is this: Hawaii is really close. Thats an attainable goal.Read the full story on CNN.com.come on, hawaii!

It starts with one person. Nani Teruya says Hawaii shouldnt be part of the United States. She doesnt vote because she believes the government is illigitimate. Still, a member of the Hawaiian royal family urged her to use her vote to push for change. Help convince Nani to vote by tweeting messages or videos to her with the hashtag #CTL3.

Post a message or video and tag it #CTL2. This is part of CNNs Change the List  an effort to boost voter participation in Hawaii, the state that had the lowest voter turnout rate in 2008.

Send him a message on YouTube or Twitter with the hashtag #CTL1. Ive never voted in my life, Hewlett told me when I met him on a beach in Hawaii. I dont think my one vote is going to make any difference.You could convince him otherwise. This project is part of CNNs Change the List. Our goal is to boost Hawaii off the bottom of the voter turnout ranking.#changethelistDid you know that Hawaii has the lowest voter turnout in the United States? Were trying to change that, one voter at a time. You can convince Paul Hewlett to vote by sending him a message at #CTL1 on various social networks, or uploading a video to iReport.
