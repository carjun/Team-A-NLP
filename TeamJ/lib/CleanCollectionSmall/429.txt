Paul Vance released new information regarding the tragic school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Friday between 9:30 and 9:40a.m. 20-year-old Adam Lanza forcibly entered Sandy Hook Elementary School. This contradicts earlier reports that Lanza was given entry. Lt. Paul Vance says they recovered all of the guns near the shooter's body. Detectives are investigating the history and ownership of the guns. Vance also says they have three teams of crime scene investigators processing both the interior and exterior of the school. He expects investigators will be at Sandy Hook Elementary for at least another day or two. Initially, students reported broken glass throughout the building. Lt. Vance says when first responders arrived on the scene, active shooter teams broke many school windows to get into the building.Once investigators learned the identity of the shooter they headed to the home that Lanza shared with his mother. There investigators found Lanza's mother dead.Lt. Vance would not get into the specific evidence found at the home, but he says the evidence will help explain how and more importantly why Lanza broke into the school and gunned down 27 innocent people before turning the gun on himself. A complete list of victims' names is expected out later today. A state trooper has been assigned to the families of each victim.Many around the Tristate and country are mourning the dead which includes 20 children. Yesterday President Obama held back tears as he spoke to the nation about this tragedy. "The majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful, little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own." We expect to learn more details when the school superintendent, Newtown medical examiner and town leaders speak later Saturday.Stay with Local 12 News and Local12.com for any new information.Print StoryShare0 Comment(s)Comments: Show | HideHere are the most recent story comments.View AllThe views expressed here do not necessarily represent those of WKRC-TV :: Cincinnati Weather and Forecasts, Cincinnati News, Breaking News, and Sports for the Cincinnati area, Ohio, northern Kentucky, Indiana, and the tristate areaNo comments yet!Click Here to Add Your CommentsView AllReport Reason:(Select a reason for reporting this content)Offensive LanguageSpam/AdvertisingPersonal AttackFlooding/Multiple PostsOff-TopicOtherThe content has been reported and it will be reviewed by a moderator.Upcoming Sponsored EventsA.J.
