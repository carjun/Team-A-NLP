First, he killed his mother.Nancy Lanza's body was found later at their home on Yogananda Street in Newtown  after the carnage at Sandy Hook Elementary School; after a quiet New England town was scarred forever by unthinkable tragedy; after a nation seemingly inured to violence found itself stunned by the slaughter of innocents.Nobody knows why 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot his mother, why he then took her guns to the school and murdered 20 children and six adults.But on Friday he drove his mother's car through this 300-year-old town with its fine old churches and towering trees and arrived at a school full of the season's joy. Somehow, he got past a security door to a place where children should have been safe from harm.Theodore Varga and other fourth-grade teachers were meeting; the glow remained from the previous night's fourth-grade concert."It was a lovely day," Varga said. "Everybody was joyful and cheerful. We were ending the week on a high note."And then, suddenly and unfathomably, gunshots rang out. "I can't even remember how many," he said.The fourth-graders, the oldest children in the school, were in specialty classes like gym and music. There was no lock on the meeting room door, so the teachers had to think about how to escape, knowing that their students were with other teachers.Someone turned the loudspeaker on, so everyone could hear what was happening in the office."You could hear the hysteria that was going on," Varga said. "Whoever did that saved a lot of people. Everyone in the school was listening to the terror that was transpiring."Gathered in another room for a 9:30 a.m. meeting were principal Dawn Hochsprung and school therapist Diane Day along with a school psychologist, other staff members and a parent. They were meeting to discuss a second-grader."We were there for about five minutes chatting, and we heard Pop! Pop!, Pop!" Day told The Wall Street Journal. "I went under the table."But Hochsprung and the psychologist leaped out of their seats and ran out of the room, Day recalled. "They didn't think twice about confronting or seeing what was going on," she said. Hochsprung was killed, and the psychologist was believed to have been killed as well.A custodian ran around, warning people there was a gunman, Varga said."He said, 'Guys! Get down! Hide!'" Varga said. "So he was actually a hero."Did he survive? The teacher did not know.___Police radios crackled with first word of the shooting at 9:36, according to the New York Post."Sandy Hook School. Caller is indicating she thinks there's someone shooting in the building," a Newtown dispatcher radioed, according to a tape posted on the paper's website.___In a first-grade classroom, teacher Kaitlin Roig heard the shots. She immediately barricaded her 15 students into a tiny bathroom, sitting one of them on top of the toilet. She pulled a bookshelf across the door and locked it. She told the kids to be "absolutely quiet.""I said, 'There are bad guys out there now. We need to wait for the good guys,'" she told ABC News."The kids were being so good," she said. "They asked, 'Can we go see if anyone is out there?' 'I just want Christmas. I don't want to die, I just want to have Christmas.' I said, 'You're going to have Christmas and Hanukkah.'"One student claimed to know karate. "It's OK. I'll lead the way out," the student said.In the gym, crying fourth-graders huddled in a corner. One of them was 10-year-old Philip Makris."He said he heard a lot of loud noises and then screaming," said his mother, Melissa Makris. "Then the gym teachers immediately gathered the children in a corner and kept them safe."Another girl who was in the gym recalled hearing "like, seven loud booms.""The gym teacher told us to go in a corner, so we all huddled and I kept hearing these booming noises," the girl, who was not identified by name, told NBC News. "We all started  well, we didn't scream; we started crying, so all the gym teachers told us to go into the office where no one could find us."An 8-year-old boy described how a teacher saved him."I saw some of the bullets going past the hall that I was right next to, and then a teacher pulled me into her classroom," said the boy, who was not identified by CBSNews.com.Robert Licata said his 6-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher. "That's when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door," he said. "He was very brave. He waited for his friends."He said the shooter didn't utter a word.___"The shooting appears to have stopped," the dispatcher radioed at 9:38 a.m., according to the Post. "There is silence at this time. The school is in lockdown."And at 9:46 a.m., an anguished voice from the school: "I've got bodies here. Need ambulances."___Carefully, police searched room to room, removing children and staff from harm's way. They found Adam Lanza, dead by his own hand after shooting up two classrooms; no officer fired a gun.Student Brendan Murray told WABC-TV it was chaos in his classroom at first after he heard loud bangs and screaming. A police officer came in and asked, "Is he in here?" and then ran out. "Then our teacher, somebody, yelled, 'Get to a safe place.' Then we went to a closet in the gym and we sat there for a little while, and then the police were, like, knocking on the door and they were, like, 'We're evacuating people, we're evacuating people,' so we ran out."Children, warned to close their eyes so they could not see the product of his labors, were led away from their school.Parents rushed to the scene. Family members walked away from a firehouse that was being used as a staging area, some of them openly weeping. One man, wearing a T-shirt without a jacket, put his arms around a woman as they walked down the middle of the street, oblivious to everything around them.Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and other public officials came to the firehouse. So did clergymen like Monsignor Robert Weiss of Newtown's St. Rose Roman Catholic Church. He watched as parents came to realize that they would never see their children alive again."All of them were hoping their child would be found OK. But when they gave out the actual death toll, they realized their child was gone," Weiss said.He recalled the reaction of the brother of one of the victims."They told a little boy it was his sister who passed on," Weiss said. "The boy's response was, 'I'm not going to have anyone to play with.'"Text Only| Photo ReprintsRecent Local NewsSCHOOL SHOOTING, HOW IT HAPPENED: Routine morning, then shots and unthinkable terrorDecember 15, 2012Connecticut officials: Principal died lunging at gunmanDecember 15, 2012WISH BOOK: Crawford family shows being together is a lesson many take for grantedDecember 15, 20121 PhotoNEWS AND TRIBUNE BRIEFS  For Dec. 15-16December 14, 2012AP source: Suspect killed mother at their homeDecember 14, 2012Connecticut school shooting revives gun debateDecember 14, 2012Floyd burglary suspect in custodyDecember 14, 2012WISH BOOK: Normans hope public can help with medical and other needsDecember 14, 20121 PhotoArea schools talk response to school shootingDecember 14, 2012Readers respond to news of school shootingDecember 14, 2012How to talk with your kids about tragedyDecember 14, 2012Man kills 26 at Conn. school, including 20 kidsDecember 14, 2012Two accidents tie up traffic on southbound I-65December 14, 20121 PhotoSWEET SUCCESS: Slate Run students again make, sell chocolate suckersDecember 14, 20123 PhotosCivil Air Patrol to lay nearly 800 wreaths at New Albany National CemeteryA holiday tribute to veterans will come to New Albany on Saturday as part of the annual Wreaths Across America Day.December 14, 2012 More Recent Local News HeadlinesLOCAL MAGAZINESSEASONAL CONTENTREADERS' COMMENTSTwitter UpdatesFollow me on TwitterMaps, Menus, Store hours, Coupons, and more...Find a businessLocationPopular Searches Apartments in jeffersonville Attorneys in jeffersonville Auto Dealers in jeffersonville Auto Parts in jeffersonville Auto Repair in jeffersonville Beauty Salons in jeffersonville Car Rental in jeffersonville Dentists in jeffersonville Doctors in jeffersonville Flowers in jeffersonville Hotels in jeffersonville Insurance in jeffersonville Loans in jeffersonville Mortgages in jeffersonville Movers in jeffersonville Pizza in jeffersonville Realtors in jeffersonville Restaurants in jeffersonville Storage in jeffersonville Tax Preparation in jeffersonville Travel in jeffersonville Featured More...Powered by Local.comSite MapContact us   About Us                  Contact InfoSouthern Indiana News   Clark County Stories                  Floyd County Stories                  Business/Money                  Education/Schools                  ObituariesSouthern Indiana Sports   Clark County Sports                  Floyd County Sports                  High School SportsClassified Ads   Ads by Category                  Legals                  Place a Classified AdSocial Media   Facebook                  Twitter Headlines                  Twitter ScoresBlogs  Kick It Southern Indiana Soccer                  Welcome to Planet Terry                  Scene and Heard Photo BlogE-MAIL ALERTSSign up for Daily HeadlinesContact UsADVERTISING DISPLAY812-206-2133      ADVERTISING CLASSIFIEDS812-206-2119      DELIVERY ISSUE (Jeff)812-206-2192      DELIVERY ISSUE (New Albany)812-206-2192      NEWSROOM (Jeff)812-206-2111      NEWSROOM (New Albany)812-206-6397      ORDER REPRINTS812-206-6397      SUBMIT NEWS/TIPS812-206-6397      SUBSCRIBE812-206-2192      WEBMASTER812-206-6397       2012 Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc.
