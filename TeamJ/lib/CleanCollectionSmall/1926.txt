I went to middle school with a young girl that was murdered, the story covered heavily by all the major news outlets. So many lives affected by one event even over a decade later. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

They peddle fear, hate and paranoia, preying on the emotions of people to get a couple points up in the ratings. Television news has become a parody of itself and is continuing to spiral deeper and deeper in this fucked up direction.permalinksavecontextfull comments4001Visual Storytelling 05: Clapping [x-post from r/Infographics] (column5.columnfivemedia.netdna-cdn.com)submitted 1 day ago by Pun_isher to funnycommentsharecancelloading...5101112Visual Storytelling 05: Clapping (column5.columnfivemedia.netdna-cdn.com)submitted 1 day ago by Pun_isher to Infographics2 commentssharecancelloading...6001Exploring Interactive Visualization (columnfivemedia.com)submitted 2 days ago by Pun_isher to visualizationcommentsharecancelloading...Exploring Interactive Visualization  by  Pun_isherin  dataisbeautiful[+]Pun_isher 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Pun_isher 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoUnderstood. Sorry about that. I figured that since the content was directly related to data visualization, this would be the correct place to post. I will post elsewhere next time.

I strategically chose which words to try and guess first narrowed those down to 3-5 options each, and then figured out which surrounding words would make the most sense before or after them. Once you figure out a few words, you can keep building off those to figure out the rest. It is quite a bit of trial and error but mostly just common sense if you slow down and think about the way sentences are structured and what types of words traditionally accompany one-another.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI got this amazing puzzle...can someone help me? :)  by  Koopabroin  secretsanta[+]Pun_isher 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]Pun_isher 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoThanks :) appreciate it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI got this amazing puzzle...can someone help me? :)  by  Koopabroin  secretsanta[+]Pun_isher 93 points94 points95 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]Pun_isher 93 points94 points95 points 1 month agoHere you go.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust picked one of these up at a thrift shop today; Why did nobody tell me Nintendo made something this classy?  by  nazigassingsin  gamecollecting[+]Pun_isher 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Pun_isher 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoI was flabbergasted and amazed the first time I laid eyes upon one as well, but over the course of my collecting career, I have come to realize that these are actually much more common than I first thought. I've probably seen about 4 or 5 since then, mostly at various swap meets and thrift stores.They are still friggen sweet, don't get me wrong! I just thought I had uncovered the holy grail of off-beat promo / exclusive / extra-special Nintendo items when I first found mine, and I'm sure others have shared the sentiment :Ppermalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
