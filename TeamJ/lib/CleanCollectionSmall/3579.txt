Dianne Feinstein pledged Sunday that she would introduce new gun-control legislation at the beginning of next years congressional session.It [the bill] will ban the sale, the transfer, the transportation and the possession, the California senator said on NBCs Meet the Press. Not retroactively, but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips of more than 10 bullets.Feinstein said the purpose of her proposal, a version of the assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004, is to get weapons of war off the streets of our cities.FULL COVERAGE: Connecticut school shootingOfficials have said that most of those killed in Fridays massacre  a toll that included 20 children  were shot with a semiautomatic assault-style rifle.Feinstein has been at the forefront of gun-control efforts nationally. The assault weapons ban that she pushed followed mass killings in a Stockton schoolyard and in a San Francisco office tower. Feinstein was also at San Francisco City Hall in 1978 when Supervisor Dan White killed Mayor George Moscone and fellow Supervisor Harvey Milk. Feinstein saw White flee their offices and found Milk, memorably saying afterward that when she felt for a pulse, her finger slipped into a bullet hole. Feinstein, then the head of the Board of Supervisors, became mayor upon Moscones death.PHOTOS: Connecticut school shootingShe declined to comment when asked whether President Obama has failed to lead on the issue of gun control but did add that her bill would give him a vehicle to oppose assault weapons.Although Obama has spoken generally in the past about the need to lessen gun violence, his administration has not said how he will proceed. The president was due to speak at a memorial service in Newtown on Sunday night."As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether its an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago  these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children," Obama said in an address Friday. "And were going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."Follow Politics Now on Twitter and FacebookCopyright  2012, Los Angeles TimesComments31Comments (31)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQBill Thebert at 12:42 PM December 16, 2012                >Glad to see Sen. Feinstein to legislate this issue. After  enacted, the  law will mean this horrific event will never happen again,  ever. Thanks  to the senator.Does the distinguished Senator  know that Connecticut *already* has a State Law version of the expired  1994-2004 federal assault weapons ban in place, and that it nevertheless  did nothing at all to prevent this tragedy? A state law that mirrors  the expired federal ban in every way?Or that Connecticut's  handgun laws are *already* among the strictest in the nation, which  *also* did nothing to prevent this madness?FarEastLA1 at 12:39 PM December 16, 2012                From an anti-NRA voter, I have to observe that no amount of "gun control" laws would have changed Sandy Hook. It MIGHT have changed Tucson and we MIGHT have the original Gabby Giffords with us still.What we need is a radically improved comprehensive mental health system. That MIGHT have prevented Sandy Hook and Tucson, et al.DeepSix2 at 12:39 PM December 16, 2012                Laws that forbid the carrying of arms... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."
