Stop making these people victims, of course dudes gonna sue, and the cop caused a lot of people to loose money. We cannot arrest people for filming unless they interfere with our job, otherwise ignore them and do your job well. If we do not give the people anything to complain about we look awsome when they complain. And complain they will, so when the video is reviewed we look good and they look like idiots.Posted by I177 on Thursday, April 21, 2011 08:57 PM PacificReport AbuseHe wasn't shooting to "KILL," he was shooting to "STOP the threat." As he was trained to do. Unfortunate for both families involved, but would have done the same thing. Maybe with the family knowing about this pre-existing medical condition the family should have been providing more direct supervision of the firefighter, to prevent something like this from happening??  Posted by I177 on Thursday, April 21, 2011 08:11 PM PacificReport AbuseMr. Garrett, to answer your question, We DON'T "shoot to kill," we shoot to "STOP the threat!" A very sad situation indeed for both of the families involved. I would have done the same, exact thing.Posted by I177 on Thursday, April 21, 2011 08:09 PM PacificReport AbuseMr. Garrett, to answer your question, We DON'T "shoot to kill," we shoot to "STOP the threat!"

We all feel the pain when a fellow Officer is lost.Posted by Dan736 on Wednesday, March 02, 2011 07:10 AM PacificReport AbuseHahaha!  I was gonna say the same thing sniper.  That kid smoked both of those CHP guys.  It was like a 5 second sprint and it was over.  The job got done nonetheless, but im sure they heard about it from their buddies.  Posted by C0200 on Wednesday, February 16, 2011 04:35 AM PacificReport AbuseI watched this video with a critical eye and observed officers going easy over board.  The officers became the criminals.  The subject after being hit with the car proned out.  Then the beating began.  It doesn't matter what the perp did before.  When he proned out take him into custody don't beat him.  The officers committed a crime.  Don't defend them by making excuses.  We in the field of policing need to take back our integrity and stop defending the criminals in uniform.  Remember the oath we took, uphold the Constitution of The United States.  The constitution says every one is created equally and need to be treated the same.  If that was your child who committed the crime the young man did would you think he deserved what that young man received?  Would you defend what the officers did or would you be yelling loudly?

Felony if in possession of one while in commission of a felony.   Posted by Dan736 on Friday, February 11, 2011 05:50 PM PacificReport AbuseI agree with Jcboston...a DR could have immediately gone outside to see if he/she could help.  Im pretty sure I have seen backboards and C-collars inside of hospitals if that was the concern.  I am also sure a DR/nurse would probably not get fired for trying to save a life...in their own parking lot.

Im a border patrol agent in southern az and I don't know how many times I've popped vehicles loaded with illegal aliens or dope who were driven by senior citizens or young couples with kids.  Gotta love the religious items in the cars too.  Posted by I177 on Saturday, January 01, 2011 07:23 AM PacificReport AbuseProtect the currency, narcotics or even their own life by owing the distributor himself for the seized drugs or cash. One arrest at a time makes our communities safer and better for all who live and work there. Be safe fellow officers.  APOLOGIES for such an incredibly long post's, ill keep em shorter next time I post.   Posted by I177 on Saturday, January 01, 2011 07:20 AM PacificReport AbuseVehicles that are occupied by one or two subjects, not fully packed, they know that too draws police attention. A lot of traffickers here even use persons with no or minimal criminal histories, ones with valid ops to avoid the driver looking suspicious or having to exit the vehicle. I try to look beyond the obvious and usually have more success that way. Another thing I observe for is the multiple vehicle transports. I see a lot of "blocker" cars with the transport car. Cars designed to get police attention so the narcotics can keep on driving by. Money is also usually kept separate from the narcotics to avoid seizure so observe for that as well. I personally feel its also an officer safety issue. If I am unaware of other possible vehicles involved then while making my stop I am exposing myself to possible retaliation by other subjects wanting to
