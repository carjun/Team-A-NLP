It's likely she was his first victim. Still, the media has been all over the place today, so even this info could be inaccurate.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Maybe we'll get some flashbacks for Harrow next season.  I thought he told Jimmy back in Season 1 that he got shot in the face.  I can't remember exactly however.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs there any significance to recurring bullet holes under the eye? Or is it just cool looking?

Have you asked for other music from her?  I have gone to Pandora to listen to different genres of love & party songs, etc.  You can plug the Stars song into Pandora and see what it spits out as similar.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOneY, I've realised I'm afraid of women  by  frank_fincherin  OneY[+]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoPlease don't take offense; this is a legit question: have you ever considered you might be gay or bi?  I'm not bringing this up because I think all gay or bi guys have the same issues you're running into, but the whole thing about only being able to have sex with girls while being really drunk is somewhat of a gaydar flag (I'm queer myself).  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some of your funniest high school memories?  by  ParkerEHin  AskReddit[+]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoWas in high school before school shootings were fairly common and before 9/11, so the rules were more lax.  In my French class we were allowed to make little video skits (in French) for class assignments.  Had just finished a unit on French landmarks (Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, etc.) and two friends made a video where they starred as two terrorists blowing up the monuments. They made little paper models of the monuments and set them on fire, to the tune of Another One Bites the Dust from Queen.  French teacher nearly had an aneurysm.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI need to know, what are some of the more fringe, weird, crazy subreddits that you have been on or are a frequenter?  by  NeonGreenTVin  AskReddit[+]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago/r/popping is pretty funpermalinksavecontextfull commentsHow did you get that scar?  by  conorclearshotin  AskReddit[+]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoFirst chicken pox sore I got (age 4).

I think this is one of Nucky's biggest character flaws, and why he tries to "buy back" Margaret at the end of the season finale, for example.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsSearching for apartments  by  LazarusRisesin  berkeley[+]firewerx 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]firewerx 1 point2 points3 points 10 days agoI'll PM you some questions and we can talk off thread.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSearching for apartments  by  LazarusRisesin  berkeley[+]firewerx 6 points7 points8 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]firewerx 6 points7 points8 points 11 days agoBecause I'm tired of seeing students being taken advantage of by landlords around here, you should also read through these resources and keep them handy:Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board: the govt entity that governs how much your landlord can raise your rent during your lease; Berkeley is a rent control townCal Tenant Law: a housing attorney's website with lots of info on your rights (formatting is a little crazy)CA Tenants' & Landlords' Rights & Responsibilities: from the CA Dept of Consumer AffairsASUC Renters Legal Assistance: advice & help from your peersThe main things you are going to run into are repair issues (lots of old, musty houses in the Bay Area), and getting your security deposit back after you move out.  Make sure you get EVERYTHING in writing when dealing with landlords, including a lease that specifies how much your deposit is and notes any special arrangements you make with the landlord.  Avoid renting from Din Properties; the owner has a rep for stealing security deposits.  And finally, please be a good neighbor wherever you end up!permalinksavecontextfull commentsWant to actually discuss the finale? Then post here!  by  nachoman456in  BoardwalkEmpire[+]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]firewerx 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agoLucky has/d an arc--he was learning how to be a more business savvy gangster under Rothstein, which included of course how to keep his temper in check. So he's definitely less nuts now than he was at the beginning of the series. Given that Gyp's purpose was more to be foil for Nucky in Season 3, I wasn't expecting he'd have any real character growth, which of course didn't happen. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWant to actually discuss the finale?

We've seen the 'hothead gangster' type many times already (Lucky & now Bugsy) & I was glad to see him go.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWant to actually discuss the finale?

Yes, she's a horrible person, but she got this way largely because she was a pawn in Nucky's & the Commodore's power games. They took her life away from her & she essentially had to raise Jimmy on her own. She's a survivor, and does whatever it takes to survive, which now unfortunately means she's incredibly self-centered to the point of being delusional. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWant to actually discuss the finale?

I think AR & Masseria essentially cutting Lucky & Meyer out of their own drug dealing business is the right motivation to finally see the two younger guys start going out on their own in earnest.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOfficial Season Finale Prediction Thread!  by  Unlucky13in  BoardwalkEmpire[+]firewerx 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]firewerx 1 point2 points3 points 12 days agoWow, thank you!
