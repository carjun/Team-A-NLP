How could this have been prevented by a law? Where there's a will there's a way. If he wanted to go in there and raise hell and guns were outlawed, he could've just planted a bomb, or done some other terrible shit. Don't blame the gun laws or lack thereof, in my opinion. Blame the person doing the actions, who's obviously not mentally right. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

It was a deeper sound than this and is seems like this shofar was able to fluctuate it's sound. What I heard was more like a single trumpet blow, lasted 10-15 seconds and the same tone, never changed key. And it would go away for maybe 30 seconds and happen again. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDid you see the bright "meteor" over Houston this morning? #blueflash  by  Nutricidalin  conspiracy[+]RoutinelySpontaneous 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]RoutinelySpontaneous 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoThere's pics in the link OP provided. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNon- stop ''MYSTERY'' Booms across the map, 7 in the past 24 hours...Still think nut*n is up?  by  EndisHerein  conspiracy[+]RoutinelySpontaneous 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]RoutinelySpontaneous 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoYeah, and I really hesitate to even talk about it.
