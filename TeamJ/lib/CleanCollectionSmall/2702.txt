During the 2008 sentencing, prosecutors said the rapist had threatened to mutilate his former girlfriend with a heated screwdriver, then made other violent threats before he raped her and committed other crimes. Johnson said that the rape victim "didn't put up a fight" and went on to say "if someone doesn't want sexual intercourse, the body will not permit that to happen unless a lot of damage is inflicted, and we heard nothing about that in this case."Johnson imposed a 6-year prison sentence instead of a 16-year-sentence the prosecutor had been seeking, saying that the case was only "worth" a 6-year prison sentence. The Commission on Judicial Performance said Superior Court Judge Derek G. Johnson's comments breached judicial ethics.Johnson apologized to the commission, saying his comments were inappropriate. Johnson added that he was frustrated after arguing with the prosecutor about the sentencing when he made the remarks. Johnson remains on the bench.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksavecontextfull comments3456Reported shooting on Dickinson Drive in Newtown | WTNH.com Connecticut - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 2 hours ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThatcommentsharecancelloading...Shooting at Connecticut elementary school.

The Rapid Repairs programs has only fixed 1,200 homes so far, leaving over 11,000 waiting families without heat or electricity, according to a report from WABC.Several FEMA trailers are being used in New Jersey but not in New York. The reason, according to a FEMA representative, is that there isn't enough open space outside of flood zones to install trailers safely. Some New York residents waiting for their homes to be repaired say they would like to stay in FEMA trailers to get out of the cold, noting that there is available space to install them.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksavecontextfull commentsEx-megachurch worker gets 55-year-prison term for raping a 13-year-old in the church stairwell  by  Daryl_Dixonin  news[+]SkimThat_TLDR 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoSummarized article: Chris Denman, a 22-year-old former janitor of Victory Christian Center in Oklahoma, was sentenced to 55 years in prison after pleading guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl and other sex crimes involving underage girls.The judge also sentenced Denman to an additional 5 years probation and $12,000 in fines. Denman pleaded guilty to first-degree rape, forcible oral sodomy of a child, lewd molestation, making a lewd proposal to a child and 2 counts of using a computer to facilitate a sex crime. Prosecutors said Denman used religion and the safety of the church to prey on young girls. The crimes took place this summer. A second former employee awaits trial on a charge of making a lewd or indecent proposal to a child.Five other church employees face misdemeanor charges for failing to report the alleged rape after the victim alerted them. They have all pleaded not guilty and their sentencing has been delayed until January. The 13-year-old victim's mother is suing the church, accusing employees of trying to cover up the rape. She said the church was more interested in damage control and making her daughter feel as if she were to blame for the rape.Victory Christian Center is a worldwide ministry located in Tulsa with 17,000 members. In September, the church released a statement accepting responsibility for the lapse in reporting. Additionally, the church said it will work with the Department of Human Services to audit their child abuse reporting policy.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksavecontextfull comments1091011Amsterdam won't enforce coffee shop tourist ban-mayor - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 23 hours ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThatcommentsharecancelloading...Google boss Eric Schmidt: I'm proud of our tax avoidance scheme...it's called capitalism  by  waggawaggain  worldnews[+]SkimThat_TLDR 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoSummarized article: In an interview reported by Bloomberg, Eric Schmidt, chairman of search giant Google, has said his company's approach to corporation tax is just "capitalism" and that he is "very proud" of the structure in place.It was recently revealed that Google shifted nearly $10 billion in worldwide revenue to its operations in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. The move saved the company around $2 billion in tax. Schmidt has defended his company's tax procedures, claiming the company abides by all local tax laws.Starbucks recently faced so much criticism in the UK over its tax avoidance scheme that the company decided to voluntarily pay more tax than legally required. Criticizing Starbucks' move, Schmidt said it doesn't make sense for Google to pay the UK more than required simply because it pitied the country. Last week, Britain's Chancellor George Osborne announced he aims to lead the international effort to clamp down on tax avoidance and plans to bring the issue to the annual G-8 summit, where he will be the chairman.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle tweaks image search to make porn harder to find - Summarized  by  SkimThat_TLDRin  SkimThat[+]SkimThat_TLDR[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoTell us what you think: Is this censoring or is it an improvement?permalinksavecontextfull comments13789Google tweaks image search to make porn harder to find - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 1 day ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThat1 commentsharecancelloading...Amsterdam police will turn a blind eye to foreigners buying cannabis in its famous "coffee shops" when a national ban comes into force next year, the city's mayor said on Wednesday.  by  Libertateain  worldnews[+]SkimThat_TLDR 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoSummarized article: A national ban on the purchase of marijuana by tourists in the Netherlands will not be enforced in Amsterdam, a city where up to 1/3 of its annual 7 million tourists visit its famous cannabis cafes.But from the New Year, Amsterdam will impose new restrictions on cannabis use including requiring cafes to be at least 275 yards from schools. Additionally, the city is considering banning cannabis use in public playgrounds. The ban was introduced because Dutch cities on the border with Belgium and Germany have complained that drug tourism attracted crime, unwelcome visitors and traffic congestion.The now-defunct Liberal-Christian Democrat coalition government approved the national ban last year. Now, the current government has left it up to local authorities to choose if they implement the ban or not but have yet to repeal the ban.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksavecontextfull commentsProposed Army manual tells G.I.s not to insult Taliban, speak up for women - Summarized  by  SkimThat_TLDRin  SkimThat[+]SkimThat_TLDR[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoTell us what you think: Is Western ignorance to blame for the spike in insider attacks?permalinksavecontextfull comments16678Proposed Army manual tells G.I.s not to insult Taliban, speak up for women - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 1 day ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThat2 commentssharecancelloading...Proposed new Army manual tells deployed troops not to speak up for women's rights in Afghanistan  by  Basselopehunterin  news[+]SkimThat_TLDR 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoSummarized article: According to The Wall Street Journal, a new draft of the as-yet unreleased US Army handbook suggests that Western ignorance of Afghan culture can cause Afghan soldiers to react violently and carry out what are known as "green-on-blue" attacks on coalition forces.So far this year, 63 members of the coalition forces have been killed in over 30 attacks by Afghan soldiers. The attacks pose a threat to US plans to hand over security responsibilities to Afghanistan in 2014. In an effort to prepare US soldiers for serving in Afghanistan, the handbook says to avoid several taboo conversation topics when meeting Afghan soldiers, including advocating for women's rights, criticizing pedophilia, homosexuality, Taliban misdeeds and Islam. The proposed handbook is based on a study which interviewed hundreds of US and Afghan soldiers and found that they harbored a "simmering disdain" for one another. A spokesman for Marine General John Allen, the top commander in Afghanistan, said that Allen does not endorse the handbook's contents nor does he intend to provide a foreword.The draft is still subject to revision, according to Army officials.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksavecontextfull comments18131415Public Buses Across Country Quietly Adding Microphones to Record Passenger Conversations | Threat Level | Wired.com - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 1 day ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThat2 commentssharecancelloading...Public Buses Across Country Quietly Adding Microphones to Record Passenger Conversations  by  brotherofbadulain  news[+]SkimThat_TLDR 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoSummarized article: An increasing number of transit companies are investing in security systems capable of recording passenger conversations, and in doing so have raised significant privacy concerns.The systems have already been installed in California, Oregon, Michigan, Ohio, Maryland, Connecticut and Georgia, and are likely to spread to more states in the future. In some cases, the system installations were funded by the Department of Homeland Security, according to the news publication The Daily. The surveillance microphone systems are being paired with video systems, which can use WiFi to put the audio and images together. The videos can be watched live but are also recorded and held in a memory board for 30 days.Since there are approximately 6 camera and microphone combinations on each bus, authorities are able to listen to conversations going on in virtually every seat.In Oregon, the surveillance technology was so advanced that it had the ability to decipher and separate individual conversations, as well as cut out background noises like traffic and wind.From the perspective of bus companies, these advanced surveillance systems offer passengers and drivers a greater level of security. However, civil liberty and privacy-minded groups insist that such recordings violate wiretapping laws.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksavecontextfull comments2091011Spain arrests woman with cocaine breast implants - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 1 day ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThat1 commentsharecancelloading...21232425'Unique' smuggling attempt: $42,500-worth of marijuana shot into Ariz. by cannon - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 1 day ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThatcommentsharecancelloading...22101112Porsche breaks car sales record - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 1 day ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThatcommentsharecancelloading...Porsche breaks car sales record in 2012  by  Applemacbookproin  business[+]SkimThat_TLDR -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day agoSummarized article: German sports carmaker Porsche, owned by Volkswagen, says it has already broken last year's record for sales with a month to spare. In the first 11 months of 2012, the company sold 128,978 cars worldwide, up from 118,868 cars sold in the entirety of 2011. Porsche's strongest markets were in China and the US, where sales increased by about 70% from last year. The ongoing debt crisis in Europe is depressing economies across the continent, leading to a 7.1% drop in new car sales so far this year. Despite the European crisis, growth in emerging markets such as China are helping fuel sales of both high-end and economy cars around the world. However, the mid-market carmakers, including Ford and GM, are seeing the biggest decline in sales and market shares.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksavecontextfull comments248910Famed sitarist Ravi Shankar dies at 92 - Summarized (skimthat.com)submitted 2 days ago by SkimThat_TLDR to SkimThatcommentsharecancelloading...Famed sitarist Ravi Shankar dies at 92 - latimes.com  by  ChibiSFin  news[+]SkimThat_TLDR 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]SkimThat_TLDR 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoSummarized article: Ravi Shankar, the sitar master who influenced The Beatles and introduced Indian music to Western audiences, died Tuesday at age 92.
