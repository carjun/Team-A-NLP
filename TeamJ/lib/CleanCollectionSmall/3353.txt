He had plenty of time to bundle the ball under Reina from eight yards out as Villa moved two goals clear, much to the disbelief of a home support still basking in the afterglow of a fine 3-2 win at West Ham United six days earlier.If that goal was an item of real beauty, the third goal was down to Liverpool's wretched defending as Benteke was allowed to bound unchallenged into the heart of the home area before beating Reina with some ease on 51 minutes.Liverpool had appealed for a penalty seconds before Villa moved three goals clear as Ciaran Clark appealed to pull Daniel Agger's shirt, but replays suggested both players were equally culpable in the jostling match as referee Neil Swarbrick - who enjoyed a fine afternoon - rightly waved play on.Liverpool continued to binge on possession, but were ultimately undone by their own finishing as Villa continued to hold firm in the face of home pressure. But it was pressure without any real hint of a true cutting edge.Steven Gerrard flicked a Glen Johnson shot into the net with his head on 87 minutes, but the game was already well up for Liverpool with some of their fans already scampering for the exit doors.Villa suddenly look like a side transformed and are clearly in a confident mood after their 4-1 win at Norwich in midweek booked their place in the last four of the League Cup.For Liverpool and coach Brendan Rodgers, it is back to the drawing board to try to figure out what went wrong after it had gone so right for them at West Ham's Upton Park.This was the first time an away side scored three goals at Anfield since Villa won 3-1 in August 2009. More importantly for Lambert, it means his side are now three points clear of the relegation places in the table.Liverpool remain in 12th place with 22 points from their 17 matches. They are only five points behind local rivals Everton in fourth spot, but will need to address their inability to finish off large dollops of possession.Liverpool's best moments came before they fell behind with Gerrard forcing Brad Guzan to save and Eric Lichaj almost turning a Stewart Downing cross into his own net, but it could be argued that Villa had several chances to add to their tally on the break.Reina was forced to save a Benteke header in the opening seconds while the Spanish goalkeeper was alert to tackle Weimann after he rounded him on 16 minutes. Weimann should have added a second when he lifted the ball over the bar on 32 minutes as Liverpool's inadequacies in defence were exposed.The home side threw on Joe Cole for Jonjo Shelvey at half-time but never looked like breaching Villa more than once as Suarez saw a free-kick scrambled clear on 66 minutes. The Uruguayan forward was booked for dissent in the dying seconds as Liverpool's fate became more than apparent.MAN OF THE MATCHChristian Benteke (Aston Villa): Stunning display of forward power play by the young Belgian striker.

Fed up of the hard luck stories. Liverpool FC is a multi-million world wide franchise. Not the local corner shop struggling to survive through the recession. Stop trying to do things on the cheap in an arena that is for billionaires only. By all means buy wisely, shrewdly and have a long term plan and not fire-fight with a quick fix. But this is the results business where the more ground you lose the more expensive it becomes to recover that ground. Liverpool are losing too much ground. A manager with a proven track record would get better results with the group of players that are there now. Tiqui-taca Spanish football, academy grown talent, majority of the possession, leading the attack; it was all there ticked-off like the football purists check-list of what makes Barcelona the best team in the World. And then we were properly bashed by a mediocre Aston Villa side. Keep Rodgers as the first team coach if his ego could handle that but put a real manager in there. One that by hook or #$%$ will get the results until natural confidence has the team playing beautiful football by the end of the season.v1/comments/context/7e5f14a4-bfa4-3738-84a0-497c082cfdd2/comment/1355598084972-488d0620-1dc2-4a03-b301-24aa05e03900Leo1 day 1 hour agoRodgers hasn't got a clue to what he is doing, he keeps changing his starting line-up!!v1/comments/context/7e5f14a4-bfa4-3738-84a0-497c082cfdd2/comment/1355601466594-df3289b6-a17e-441a-b677-a7b179f89d06EDWARD1 day 0 hours agoPoooor old liverpool.

Gerrard is on the slow way down but has been incredible.  It happens to all players eventually.  Get Lucas back playing how he was, sign a new striker and goalkeeper and things may turn around a bit. They will not be in the top four for a very long time but they can be well secure in the 5-12 Prem group.  This Villa result has been coming.  They have played OK and lost so when they play well they deserve that win.v1/comments/context/7e5f14a4-bfa4-3738-84a0-497c082cfdd2/comment/1355641267171-f9aa9b02-678a-4576-8b06-053840266306joe13 hours agoI think liverpool have been Rogeredv1/comments/context/7e5f14a4-bfa4-3738-84a0-497c082cfdd2/comment/1355602131168-935f17f8-f9fd-4fd2-9127-bda2d5563688Mutley1 day 0 hours agoEvery dog has its day, usually against Liverpool on a saturdayv1/comments/context/7e5f14a4-bfa4-3738-84a0-497c082cfdd2/comment/1355596590096-532a1a01-1026-4ec3-a93b-435c2a2a80d1Joseph1 day 2 hours agoHow shocking are Liverpool?!Discuss.v1/comments/context/7e5f14a4-bfa4-3738-84a0-497c082cfdd2/comment/1355599366080-178ce88c-28ec-4357-a787-35fc57abe705Shaun1 day 1 hour agoNo excuse for losing at home to villa, we were #$%$ vs west ham as well.

Sterling seems to be going backwards he looked far stronger on the left at the beginning of the season with Suso on the right. Even Gerrard looks a shadow of himself to me the style of play employed by BR doesn't seem to suit him. BR seems to have no back up plan and keeps talking rubbish (i.e. finishing 2nd, Allen best player on the pitch) making himself and the club look stupid. To top it off looks like Sturridge and Ince are the players being brought in at Jan can't see how they will make much difference to the team.v1/comments/context/7e5f14a4-bfa4-3738-84a0-497c082cfdd2/comment/1355682666338-b685ad74-78be-413c-9b92-e7aa1e123254D2 hours 23 minutes agoKing Kenny?
