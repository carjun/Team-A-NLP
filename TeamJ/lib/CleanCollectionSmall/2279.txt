Apples iPhone 4S seen outselling iPhone 5  by  gobble_gabblein  technology[+]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoI think that's the problem for a lot of people: the cables aren't the same. My husband has a 4s (got it before 5 ever came out) We have a radio that his iphone plugs in to, but a 5 can't, for instance.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSetting up home pharmacy  by  Jacob2040in  Frugal[+]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoI can tell you what I always keep stocked:Band-aidsAlcoholNyquil/Dayquil (or equivalent)Pepto Bismol (or equivalent)Pain reliever of some sort (I keep ibuprofen)permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Vanetia 1 point2 points3 points 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 1 point2 points3 points 18 minutes agoAnd you have another incident similar to this one in China. You have the TSA detaining a wheelchair-bound girl because omg terrorism. You have drone strikes and actual terrorism. Every day there are murders, rapes, and other acts of violence not just once but hundreds if not thousands of times.And you have a "what's the worst thing you've ever stuck your penis into?" thread that I don't even want to click on at work. Oh and this thread. (joking on these ones but seriously: wtf people?)Yes. Humanity as a whole does some pretty fucked up shit and it's sickening and disheartening and hard for me to wrap my mind around sometimes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGang members/former gang members of reddit, what did you do for gang initiation?  by  BellyButtonLindtin  AskReddit[+]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 54 minutes ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 54 minutes agoHeydilly hey!permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

If it was just some random pair of crazy people that'd be stranger.But my confusion is toward the second gunman. Why would not one but TWO people do something like this? Are they related in some way? I would guess so.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI misread the title of another thread and it piqued my interest... who is the hottest fat man you know?  by  creepyeyesin  AskWomen[+]Vanetia 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoMy husband :PBut if we're talking celebrities...hmmmm Jack Black, maybe?

If they challenge you on it, then you can do the above regarding the in-person court date.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBuy decorations for next year's Christmas in the week after this year's. They'll be much cheaper, sometimes even 90% off.  by  smallpolyin  Frugal[+]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoYou'll find that a lot with frugal tips. Buying in bulk is another one you may not be able to do because you need to store it (and/or eat it before it goes bad).But I lived in a small apartment and still did this. I didn't get the big decorations but even for smaller things I had a spot in my closet for them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBuy decorations for next year's Christmas in the week after this year's. They'll be much cheaper, sometimes even 90% off.  by  smallpolyin  Frugal[+]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoHalloween candy is often hit-or-miss. The chocolates are the first to go and that's if they even make it past the holiday to begin with, so if you're looking for chocolate you'll often be disappointed. Especially since they'll only mark it down if it's specifically Halloween candy (and a lot of it isn't). You're usually left with shit like candy corn. Still good to get your decorations after halloween, though. Going and looking every year for the stuff you like will eventually get you a great hoarde :PIf you're looking for discount chocolates, the best day of the year is February 15th.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBuy decorations for next year's Christmas in the week after this year's.

Not just for Christmas but for every holiday. Halloween is another one for cheap decorations (candy can be hit or miss, really, since the good stuff is usually gone). Easter, too, if you decorate for it. Day after Valentines for some sweet, sweet discount chocolates.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFirst weekend managing at a new casino  by  aiovine10688in  TalesFromRetail[+]Vanetia 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoWhen you're a strangerpermalinksavecontextfull commentsPaused STNG ep "Dark Page" To Come Back and Find Mitt Romney's Final Form.  by  VladZladin  startrek[+]Vanetia 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour agoCheer up, mate.

It's been over a decade since I've watched the movie, though, so my memory has finally faded.

Here's mine!  by  Mitcheypooin  startrek[+]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoYes. I do anyway. That scene is what caused me to turn off Enterprise.I re-discovered the show when I ran across the episode with Dean Stockwell and that made me give it another chance, but, seriously, the theme music and then that gel scene totally pissed me off. It wasn't Star Trek at that point. It was "Lets see how many people we can pander to in order to pull in viewers and use the words 'Star Trek' to keep that base, too!"permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Jokers, thought some of you might like this.  by  ManieOin  pics[+]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoThat is one creepy fucking picture.Jack Nicholson scares the crap out of me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]Vanetia 5 points6 points7 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 5 points6 points7 points 19 hours agoThat was my experience only I was under 25 so the person who dragged me in there got in trouble and I got free tickets to a comedy show and buffet :Dpermalinksavecontextfull comments$10 off purchase of $50 or more at Target!  by  vell_oin  coupons[+]Vanetia 6 points7 points8 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 6 points7 points8 points 19 hours agoI made one herepermalinksavecontextfull comments$10 off purchase of $50 or more at Target!  by  vell_oin  coupons[+]Vanetia 2 points3 points4 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 2 points3 points4 points 19 hours agoHow about a .png?permalinksavecontextfull comments$10 off purchase of $50 or more at Target!  by  vell_oin  coupons[+]Vanetia 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours agoHow about a .png?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoDidn't they make this illegal recently as part of CC reform?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]Vanetia 8 points9 points10 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 8 points9 points10 points 20 hours agoI like timeshares.

I finally moved to my own VoIP service provider (a local one that was recommended to me--MJ apparently has shitty customer service whereas my provider does not), and it's great. I paid for 2 years at the cost of ~$6/mo. It's just my land line that I use to call long-distance or give out the number to people I think will harass me (straight to machine). Much better than the cost per month I was paying ATTpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]Vanetia 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours agoDentists are like mechanics. You need to find a good honest one and then never move.I went without going to the dentist for 12 years (yup) and only finally broke down and went when my wisdom teeth needed out. I told the nurse I hadn't gone in 12 years and she went "Really?! Your teeth are so good!"Come back for a check up. I have a cavity I didn't have before. Mmmk.Come back 6 months later. Oh look. Two more cavities.Wtf? I managed 12 years with no cavities and now you're telling me I got 3 in 6 months? Fuck.
