See, They were in the garden. Every day they would hang out, and blindly follow orders from god. He would say to do something and they would do it. They weren't allowed to say no. Ever. So anyway either a talking snake with legs that was smarter than them, (somehow?)Or, the devil (Why the fuck did God let him in there? His lack of protection now is said to be because of "the fall", but he wasn't protecting us at all even before then.) turned into a talking snake. Why didn't he just stay in the form of the devil? I'm sure they wouldn't have thought anything of it. So yeah they get tricked into eating from a super smart "king of lies" authority figure. The master of manipulation and trickery vs. submissive humans that have been conditioned to blindly obey, and have no idea what the difference between right and wrong is. So they eat and god punishes the snake (Why if it was the devil? The devil doesn't get a punishment, the snake does...)There's no mention of the devil here, they always say it's a talking snake. But people say it was the devil. And they say it was a talking snake. People can't agree. So anyway now God won't protect us, half the animals become carnivores, things are hard to grow, childbirth will now hurt, and basically every horrible thing you can imagine starts up. God throws down some flaming swords to slice Adam and Eve to bits, and burn them, if they come back.The swords are gone now though. In fact the garden was on earth right? We should be able to go there right? I mean what happened to it, and the flaming swords and magic gates? If god was going to make the Garden of Eden completely vanish, why not just do that right away? When did the garden cease to exist? So anyway because two people, who you can't even call people yet really. They were sub humans. They lacked the ability to evaluate decisions in any form. They got tricked, and now like, God lets the same guy who rallied an army against him, fuck with us and get his rocks off. Because like, leading an insurrection is nothing compared to being tricked. So now God is totally cool with the Devil doing whatever the fuck he wants to do, as long as the people don't "cast him back to hell" "In Jeasus name, In Jeasus name" You know, magic fucking words. If we use literal magic words on the devil he has to leave us alone, uh, for a little while. So that's the story. Makes total sense. Oh wait. like, we were all more fucked til god sacrificed himself for whatever reason, even though he really didn't. Jesus' death was super important though because it did this and that and totally changed everything. Oh and God is love.permalinksavecontextfull commentsARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?  by  Surreal_Effectin  atheism[+]silverscreemer 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]silverscreemer 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoOf course they also believe that the devil doesn't have a spec of power that God doesn't allow him to have. God could finish the Devil off at any time, or at least protect us from him...But God is STILL pissy that 2 people allowed theirselves to get tricked forever ago. So the devil gets to have free reign.. permalinksavecontextfull commentsARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?  by  Surreal_Effectin  atheism[+]silverscreemer 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]silverscreemer 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoNo, it couldn't have.

And I know it shouldn't have. Because I was irritated by one of the parents of one of the kids that survived. I think it was a father and he was doing an interview, and he started talking like "Thank God my kid survived" (paraphrasing) I know it's just a figure of speach, but do these people really think God shielded their kids from danger... and uh, just didn't worry about the others? There's no God between the killers and their intended victims. Sure there are circumstances, maybe they will miss, maybe the target will show stellar athleticism and get the fuck away, maybe the gun will jam or run out of ammo. Or maybe your kid will be in another room entirely behind a locked door. To say that God protected his kid, is to say that God didn't protect the other 20. It's not really a big thing, but people don't think about the deep implications of their beliefs. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGuy asks girl to prom in class  by  Jodie_Sweetinin  cringe[+]silverscreemer 16 points17 points18 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]silverscreemer 16 points17 points18 points 16 hours agoThe truth is she seems like a really cool person.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]silverscreemer 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]silverscreemer 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours agoOk here's what it boils down to, and it SORT of makes sense. If you ignore the fact that there's virtually no chance of this happening...But the idea is that if our Government turns on us, and they have all the guns, then we're screwed. We can't defend ourselves. If the only people to have guns are Cops, Military, and well, criminals, then we the other people, we can't fight back. In reality, even with guns we couldn't fight back, our military outclasses us normal people (we normal people?) quite a lot. So if they turned on us, we wouldn't be able to do much. But the idea is that you should be able to hold your own as a private militia. And since the whole point is that the authority is who you're fighting...And yeah, we just don't want to be outmatched. I think nowadays people just want to have a gun to shoot people with though. They say it's protection. It is more complex than "Just no one but military and police should have guns" though. It's like saying only the rich should be allowed to have money. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

But people believe because of the strong desire for others to suffer. We want amplified punishment. We don't care about justice.
