I'm sitting here getting new brakes in my car and I can't help but to think about my son that's in daycare right now. I really want to vomit right now. School is suppose to be a safe place. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]gddess 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]gddess 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoJust read that an entire kindergarten class is unaccounted for. This makes me fucking sick. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMilk production  by  AllNew2012in  Parenting[+]gddess 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoIs your son not gaining at least 5oz per week? How often is he hungry like every 2 to 3 hours or less than that? Have spoken with a lactation consultant, you can go to LLL for free. Also, is your son eating 12 times a day? To increase milk production there are lots of things to do, first stop stressing that is huge, second drink a ton of water. Eat oatmeal, I hate oatmeal so I made granola bars with cranberries and apricots, you can try herbal supplements like blessed thistle and fenugreek, I had a ton on success with this combo some people had more success with More Milk Plus or lactation tea. Make sure you are eating well and getting some sleep. Also, make sure your son guides feeding either by falling asleep on the breast and/or being happy and content after nursing. Make sure you are offering both sides during each nursing session. In my experience, my son was a little slow with the weight gain and instead of finding a solution it was just immediately that my milk production sucked. I took my son to a lc and they weighed before and after a feeding and its showed he was eating well. But he was sleeping through the night and was "missing" two feedings at nighttime so I dream fed him and he immediately got back on track. I would seriously recommend going to either an lc or the LLL so you can have your latch and positioning evaluated and to do the weight test. I'm not against formula feeding but I often see it being unnecessarily recommended and usually first and it ends up causing more problems. Just remember that anytime you use formula, you are telling your body that you don't need milk at that time. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCutting baby's hair?  by  jabanicatin  Parenting[+]gddess 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 2 points3 points4 points 4 days agoThe first time I cut my son's hair, I took him to the barber, he sat in my lap and I let him in play with my forward facing camera and he was perfectly fine. The second time I cut my son's hair, we went to supercuts, he sat in my lap and fussed and cried the whole time. I had books and snacks nothing worked. We got a Spock haircut. Next time, I'm bringing out my forward facing camera. permalinksavecontextfull commentsmy 8mo old daughter has a bad diaper rash. it hurts when we rub cream on it. help!  by  i_jump_wakesin  Parenting[+]gddess 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoWe had a terrible one that wouldn't go away, we ended up doing oatmeal baths, fresh air and at night using bag balm. Also, keep you eye on it to make sure it isn't a yeast infection. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGo for child support, or no?  by  FranniPantsin  Parenting[+]gddess 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoI would not worry about the state taking your son, it more than likely will not happen. He is threatening you and using intimidation, which in my opinion are still forms of abuse, which is a big reason why survivors of abuse don't say anything, they believe their abuser could be right. The only way the state would ever step in and take your child is if you are unfit, like you abusing your son. Your son is entitled to be supported by his father and if that is getting a court order, I would encourage you to do that. If he starts trying for an established visitation and it isn't in the best interest of your son, which I personally think hanging out with abusers isn't, than you can have the people that have seen the bruises be your witnesses. I would seek support from a domestic abuse nonprofit to help you out with this and help make that your son is 100% protected and that you remain protected. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGo for child support, or no?  by  FranniPantsin  Parenting[+]gddess 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoYes, you should go after support. But I just wanted to point out that if you are able to prove abuse, the state will not take your child, they will actually limit his visitation and it would probably be supervised, in my state anyway. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhere to find reputable child care?  by  mynameisacoolnamein  Parenting[+]gddess 3 points4 points5 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 3 points4 points5 points 7 days agoOne of my coworkers raved about care.com. I used  my company's employee assistance program, they researched all daycares in my neighborhood that were licensed and got openings and rates and recommendations for me. I also used yelp and our local county public records for incidents and violations. Hope some of this info is helpful. permalinksavecontextfull commentsJohnson&Johnson products, opinions!  by  Momma2Maxin  Mommit[+]gddess 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 1 point2 points3 points 8 days agoAveeno is Johnson and Johnson. permalinksavecontextfull commentsRetail workers of Reddit: what is the worst thing a customer has ever said/demanded of you?  by  howardkritzin  AskReddit[+]gddess 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoThis was in late 90's.permalinksavecontextfull comments(23f)my son (2m) possibly molested by dad  by  raunchytowelin  relationship_advice[+]gddess -2 points-1 points0 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]gddess -2 points-1 points0 points 9 days agoI'm not sure why you posted this response to me. Because yes a child being molested is probably the worst experience that they could ever go through, aside from death.I wasn't trying to empathize with pedos or anything, I never said ignore obvious red flags, I was saying that this parent needs to take her child to the doctor and stop having the babysitter question the child. These types situations need to be handled by experienced individuals that know what to do, what to ask and how to move forward in helping this child. permalinksavecontextfull comments(23f)my son (2m) possibly molested by dad  by  raunchytowelin  relationship_advice[+]gddess -1 points0 points1 point 10 days ago*(0 children)[]gddess -1 points0 points1 point 10 days ago*I'm sorry but your sitter is not experienced to be asking questions or being a part of this situation at all. Children are very susceptible to outside influence on these types of topics, so you and your sitter need to stop and take him to the doctor and have him examined. Other than abuse, there are several reasons why a child would touch themselves like a medical issue, discovery of genitals, etc.You need to tread lightly because an accusation like this can ruin a person's life if it isn't true.

I was once told that I should go home and fuck my dog because a customer was charged for using Internet adult services. I don't own a dog so I was really perplexed at that. I was told that I'm nothing but a nasty slut,that ruins good Christian families and that I will burn in hell from a female customer because her husband was charged for using Internet adult services. Working retail, I was once called a racist and told I hate black people because I questioned a woman that was trying to return something that didn't have a receipt for an item that we didn't carry or had ever carried in the store. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow much sleep did you get in the first week with your newborn and how did you cope with the lack of it?  by  nzwaspin  Parenting[+]gddess 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoFor the first six months, I was getting anywhere 2 to 4 hour blocks of sleep and we were breastfeeding so it didn't make much sense to have my husband get up with our son. I basically kicked into survivor mode and never tried focusing on being tired, I tried to keep active and establish a routine and schedule. My son slept in a pack and play in our room and for like a month, slept in the same bed. These two things were lifesavers for my sanity and just being able to maximize my ability to get a little longer stretches of sleep. I also napped when he did and I still do because cuddle naps are awesome. I also readjusted when I went to bed, I went to bed when my son had his longer stretch of sleep, like 9 to 2. The first weeks are tough and exciting but always remember it's just a phase. This will pass. I would also recommend reading Wonder Weeks, it was a lifesaver in understanding infant sleep, regression and milestones, it really helped prepare me. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAm I the only one who thinks telling your kids about Santa Claus is ridiculous?  by  nikkiyozin  Mommit[+]gddess 5 points6 points7 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 5 points6 points7 points 11 days agoI'm an atheist and we celebrate Christmas because I remember being little and Christmas and santa were magical and exciting. I want my kid to have that experience and joy. We don't put Christian context around Christmas instead it's a magical day to have fun, be thankful and appreciate the family, friends and things we have in our lives. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI've seen askreddit's opinions on spanking, and now I want to hear actual mothers opinions. Were you spanked as a child? Would you/ do you spank your child? Why or why not?  by  loki93009in  Mommit[+]gddess 4 points5 points6 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 4 points5 points6 points 11 days agoI was spanked twice as a child and I don't think those two times did anything to affect me. I, personally, am not a fan of spanking, it would only be used as a last resort maybe. I won't spank because I'm kind of a pacifist but also if I would not physical altercations happen between my husband and I, I think it would be hypocritical to hit my child. Spanking is like cio because it works for some and others not and as parents, you gotta do what works for your family. permalinksavecontextfull commentsmachine sewing binding vs hand sewing?  by  Dead_leafin  quilting[+]gddess 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 1 point2 points3 points 12 days agoI just finished a quilt for my neice and did machine sewing for the binding for the first time. I sewed the binding on the back really straight and then used my line as a guide for the front. I did cheat though. I used something called wonder tape that is water soluble double sided tape when doing the front. Since I was using a decorative feather stitch, I needed to go slow and consistent and having the front completely attached to the blanket let me just concentrate on my consistency with little focus on getting the binding on perfectly straight. It turned out really nice. I usually do binding by hand but wanted to try machine binding, I like it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSister of my BF(29) lost her newborn girl 4 years ago, anniversary past week. A lot of grief in the family. Advice how to deal with this?  by  XHTEin  relationships[+]gddess 5 points6 points7 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 5 points6 points7 points 13 days agoI don't think you need to do anything. If she brings up Amy and wants to talk about just listen and offer your support. Although, this tragedy happened 4 years ago, losing a child especially a newborn is something I hear you never really get over. So offering an ear and support is the best thing you can do. permalinksavecontextfull commentsKansas City Chiefs football player killed his girlfriend and then himself at team's football stadium  by  00boyinain  news[+]gddess 29 points30 points31 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 29 points30 points31 points 13 days agoSo sad.

From 6 to 12 months solids are considered exploratory and determining allergies, solids at this age aren't meant to be meals or anything. You can also try baby led weaning. Babies this age typically eat around 2 to 3 teaspoons of solids, which is totally normal. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGot a (BS) parking ticket, but they recorded my license plate # wrong, do I have to do anything?  by  FlanMonstain  Seattle[+]gddess 1 point2 points3 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]gddess 1 point2 points3 points 15 days agoI wouldn't chance it.

I smoked my fair share in the nineties and I'm just not interested in smoking these days. Makes me paranoid and a bit off. But that's me. Other people can do whatever they want as long as I'm not negatively affected by it.
