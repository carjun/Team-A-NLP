All the petitions had at least 200 signatures as of 4:30 p.m. EST, and one had garnered more than 5,000.The first petition called on the Obama administration to immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress, requesting legislation to change the way citizens obtain guns.Other topics focused primarily on starting a conversation about gun control. One request called for mental health to be declared a national emergency to prevent future shooting such as todays issue at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. and the shooting earlier this year at a movie theater in Aurora Colo.The mental health petition also said gun control needed to be discussed.One petition read:We ask that President Obama form a commission of appointed citizens to explore meaningful steps we as a nation can take to control and reduce gun violence. The commission would have a time limit to develop recommendations that would be forwarded to Congress for review and action.The petitions each have one month to accumulate 25,000 digital signatures in order to garner a formal response from the White House.Posted By: kyle.campbell@chron.com (Kyle Campbell)(Email) |Dec 14 at 1:29 pmListed Under: Congress, Connecticut, Obama, Sandy Hook elementary school, crime and punishment, gun control, shooting | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0)Comments & Replies (1)Comments & Replies () : Post CommentPost CommentPost Comment  Massacre reaction: Tearful Obama says nations hearts are broken; some Democrats push for gun control | Main |Rush Limbaugh: Liberals already hatching a plan to blame Newtown shooting on conservatives, Republicans  Thousands immediately petition White House to address gun control, mental healthBlogsSix petitions have been started on the White Houses website today calling for the president to address issues related to mass shootings.
