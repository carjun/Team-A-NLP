They were met by large lit letters at the village crossroads that read, "Faith. Hope. Love."Their urge to congregate in support of the families of the children echoed a wave of global support and prayers that have poured into the town since a local20-year-old named Adam Lanza forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School Friday morning and killed 20 children at close range, and also shot six staffers trying to shield the children. As police closed in, Mr. Lanza, police say, shot himself with the assault-style rifle used in the attack.When tragedy strikes: a prayerful response to the shootings in Connecticut"I'm here to do what I can do, offer up a prayer," said Dana Hyatt, a middle school teacher in East Haddam, Conn., who drove an hour to see the site. Mr. Hyatt said as a Marine he worked with children in Iraq and Germany."I just felt I needed to make a pilgrimage to show my support," said Frank Piazza from Trumbull, Conn., after laying flowers on one makeshift memorial.A red-eyed man trudged quickly past a deflated Santa Claus street ornament and up the hill toward the school, holding a bouquet of roses. "Tragic day," he whispered.Jim Roodhuyzen, a teacher at a nearby school, found himself out driving Sunday and was pulled as if by a magnet toward the shooting site memorial. Once he saw it, he fetched his wife, Sharon, to come, as well."I thought I'd processed this, but I hadn't," he said."We still can't comprehend that [this massacre] was possible," said Ms. Roodhuyzen through a torrent of tears. "This is not who we are, this is not who we ever will be."Local pastors and community leaders were besieged by calls and emails from places like Russia, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, South Korea, and West Africa.The support pouring into this village on the nook of the Pootatuck River provided an antidote to fears raised by Ms. Roodhuyzen that their hometown would always be associated with inexplicable violence unleashed in their bucolic corner of New England.Theres an awful lot to just knowing that people care, Rev. Raymond Petrucci, a chaplain at nearby Danbury Hospital, told NBC News.Near the school, a row of Christmas trees became filled with teddy bears as people walked the half mile from the village center to the firehouse near the school that marked the end of public access.Daniel Gregg, who works with high school principals and superintendents, brought a bouquet of white roses in an "act of solidarity.""Somehow we've been faced with the ultimate extreme," he said.President Obama, who summed up the national mood when he wiped tears from his face after pondering the senseless deaths of "beautiful children," planned to make his own pilgrimage to Sandy Hook Village on Sunday to meet with grieving families and address a town vigil at the high school Sunday evening.When tragedy strikes: a prayerful response to the shootings in ConnecticutRelated storiesIn Pictures: American Gun CultureSandy Hook families: Coming together to comfort and healSandy Hook school shooting: Few easy answers for a violent culture (+video)Sandy Hook School shooting: Voices from around the worldThe Monitor's View:Newtown shootings: What to say to ourselvesFollow UsYou can find Patrik Jonssonon Twitter, Facebook, Google+.Get free daily or weekly news updates from CSMonitor.com delivered to your inbox.
