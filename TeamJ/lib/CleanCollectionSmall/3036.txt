In the next few days people will use this tragedy to argue their sides on gun control. Of course, nothing will be done, the debate will slide off the public radar, and we'll all go back to watching our primetime shows about serial killers and child molesters, but it's okay because nobody will say the F word or show a titty. And then, when this happens again (it will), we'll all wonder why...Sometimes I really fucking hate my country.My heart goes out to those who lost loved ones this morning. I cannot imagine such a tragedy. permalinksave[+]Bayou_wulf 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]Bayou_wulf 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoThe problem is not the implement used to commit the act.  Its a society that refuses to help or identify people prior to committing the act.permalinksaveparent[+]colonel_mortimer 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]colonel_mortimer 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoYou forgot the part where the psycho's face is plastered on every news broadcast, website and paper for the next several weeks. And also where our healthcare system, mental health in particular, utterly fails society.permalinksaveparent[+]bonked_or_maybe_not -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (9 children)[]bonked_or_maybe_not -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoMaybe because gun control wouldn't change anything.permalinksaveparent[+]Ceefax81 3 points4 points5 points 37 minutes ago (1 child)[]Ceefax81 3 points4 points5 points 37 minutes agoHow many UK mass shootings after the handgun ban following the massacre of children with legally owned guns at Dunblane? The US has decided events like this are the trade off they're willing to make in order to collect, read about, take photos of and pose with their lethal toys. This is what happens and will continue to happen, so it's just what needs to be lived with as long as that attitude prevails. permalinksaveparent[+]eXePyrowolf 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]eXePyrowolf 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes agoOh man Dunblane, that was aaaages ago. When I was still in Primary School even. It's the only one I know about in the UK since i've been alive and seeing how many appear in the US (proportionate to population) is insane.permalinksaveparent[+]end_of_discussion 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]end_of_discussion 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoBullshit, I call bullshit. Lack of gun control is getting us this, so we need to do somethingpermalinksaveparent[+]Astrozombie79 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]Astrozombie79 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes agoWho carries a gun at a school that could have shot this guy? These guys would have gotten guns one way or the other.  permalinksaveparent[+]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoI agree, more laws would just mean more crimes... but there won't be any change to the glorification of violence, the shows that focus on murder cases, the news reports that make psychopaths famous... all those, to me, contribute much more to this problem than guns do. Guns are the tool, but the blueprint for this horrific crime was designed by American culture and a lack of mental help for this person, not by his access to guns. permalinksaveparent[+]Avista -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]Avista -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 hour agoWell, that is at least a common and shared mentality, so nothing will happen for a while yet. I wonder how many shootings it will take, because one day I believe your nation will shift it's views. People will just have to brace themselves until then, huh?permalinksaveparent[+]bonked_or_maybe_not -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]bonked_or_maybe_not -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 hour agoThis happened today as well http://www.courant.com/sns-rt-us-china-stabbingsbre8bd065-20121213,0,5592318.storypermalinksaveparent[+]Avista 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Avista 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoAnd?permalinksaveparent[+]seattle-ist  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]seattle-ist -11 points-10 points-9 points 1 hour agoGo fuck yourself.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
