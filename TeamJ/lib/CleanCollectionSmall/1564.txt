Opponents such as the Michigan Education Association said the shootings should prompt Gov. Rick Snyder to veto the measure."All we can hope is that this won't lead to more incidents like what we are seeing in Connecticut," said Linda Wacyk of the Michigan Association of School Administrators. Students are expelled for bringing a weapon to school, she said, there's no good reason to allow concealed weapons for others on campus.Snyder told The Detroit News on Friday he'd give special attention to the legislation about concealed weapons and abortion, saying "social issues are things I do not seek out so those will be ones we spend an extra amount of time scrutinizing."Backers say the tragedy is the work of one deranged person and shouldn't cloud the debate in Michigan, and could actually aid in ending the slayings.Ari Adler, spokesman for Republican House Speaker Jase Bolger, said many "believe citizens who are allowed to carry concealed pistols can act in a positive way to bring a tragedy to a close more quickly,"Don Wotruba deputy director of the Michigan Association of School Boards, said trained professionals rather than citizens are best equipped to handle school shootings."More guns in close proximity to kids isn't going to make our schools safer," he said.Currently, those with a concealed weapons permit can carry a pistol in a gun-free zone as long as it's visible. The new legislation would ban open carry in such places and allow concealed weapons on the premise if permit holders received additional training.Sen. Rick Jones, R- Grand Ledge, said the legislation closed a loophole that allowed some to carry guns "like a cowboy" and would ultimately limit guns in public places."This is a move to make sure there are less guns in these places," said Jones, a retired sheriff. It's not the licensed gun holders that should be a concern, Jones said, but criminals with illegal guns who will disregard a school's gun free sign to inflict tragedy.Ryan Mitchell, a spokesman for bill sponsor Sen. Mike Green, R-Mayville, said the legislation is "about letting those who are vulnerable and defenseless defend themselves."Though all sides of the argument argued the focus Friday should be on the victims in Connecticut they acknowledged the timing of the school shootings impacts the political conversation. The Michigan Education Association said Snyder should veto the measure out of respect for those who died and for the safety of Michigan students."Those who think that students and teachers will be safer with more guns in our schools are just plain wrong," Michigan MEA President Steve Cook said in a statement. "Thinking that teachers should carry weapons and fire on threats is a recipe for even more death  not safety." To sign this bill in light of this tragedy would be unfathomable," he added.Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm spouted off via Twitter Friday afternoon against gun legislation passed in the GOP-led Legislature."OMG: R Michigan House passes right to carry guns in schools, churches, daycare centers last night," Granholm tweeted Friday afternoon. "Please: Stop. The. Madness."mschultz@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2310 TweetEmailPrintShareLinkedInTumblrStumbleUponRedditDel.icio.usDiggAAAJoin the ConversationThe Detroit News aims to provide a forum that fosters smart, civil discussions on the news and events that we cover.
