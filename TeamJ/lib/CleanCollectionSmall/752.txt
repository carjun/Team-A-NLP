When Marc Anthony incites an angry mob against Caesar's killers, they find some dude named Cinna.  This cat was just a poet, some poor artist bastard, but he had the same name as one of the senators, Cinna.The mob didn't care that he was the wrong Cinna and tore him to pieces for his name.Seems we haven't really changed much in five centuries.permalinksaveparent[+]GiantWhaleCannon 8 points9 points10 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]GiantWhaleCannon 8 points9 points10 points 21 hours ago"No no no!  I'm Cinna the poet!  Not the Senator!""A poet, eh?  Let's have some poetry, then.""Uh...'I think that I shall never see...a poem lovely as a...bee?'  I'm sorry, I don't do my best work under duress."permalinksaveparent[+]Sn1pe 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Sn1pe 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoThis reminds me of the time of the Trayvon Martin vs George Zimmerman case when some guy on Twitter who had the same name as Trayvon started gaining so many followers. About half of his tweets were addressing people that he was obviously not the then deceased Trayvon Martin.permalinksaveparent[+]FleshyMeatCreature 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]FleshyMeatCreature 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoAbout half of his tweets were addressing people that he was obviously not the then deceased Trayvon Martin.And yet, people still didn't understand.permalinksaveparent[+]annodomini 2 points3 points4 points 12 hours ago (1 child)[]annodomini 2 points3 points4 points 12 hours agoWait a sec. You're saying we haven't really changed much from a fictional account of something that had happened 1500 years earlier? And that "lots of people reporting the wrong guy as the killer" is no different than "tearing the wrong guy to pieces"?You know, I think that a civil society in which people's mistakes lead only to verbal abuse is much better than one in which someone is torn to pieces for a mistaken identity.permalinksaveparent[+]WadeK 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]WadeK 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoDo you think if he was walking down the street and someone said, "Dude, that's the guy who killed those kids" that nobody would assault him?  I think it's verbal abuse simply because they were separated by the internet.  Some of the comments that were made to this poor kid were absolutely terrifying and I have no doubt that he would be in physical danger if he were to meet any of the people who were harassing him.So yes.  I'm saying that mob mentality leads people to attack the innocent without doing research to make sure you're attacking the 'right' person.  When, in a group, we get whipped into a sort of 'blood frenzy', we turn pretty ignorant.permalinksaveparent[+]Augustus_Trollus_III 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (2 children)[]Augustus_Trollus_III 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agofive centuries.emm...permalinksaveparent[+]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours ago (1 child)[]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours agoFour centuries, 1599.

It wasn't a big news sensation but even for that, reporters hounded his girlfriendOne of them asked her "Was he hot? How sexy was he?"So anyone who know Adam or Ryan on facebook is going to get a lot of crap like that.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
