The idea is to give money to civilian groups to help rebuild bakeries, set up medical or collect trash even as the civil war rages on.According to this article, France has so far sent 1.5 million Euros to fourteen civilian revolutionarycommittees from Aleppo, Damascus, Homs and other hard-hit regions.This is also interesting because according to this report, Frances ambassador to Syria, Eric Chevallier, travels to within a few hundred meters of Syria to meet with the representatives of these committees and to give them French help.During these meetings, the report goes on to say, the men talk about the unrelenting violence in Syria but also come equipped with reports and a spreadsheet explaining every expense. For each financial donation, a promise is made to provide a detailed expense reports.Posted by: Hala GoraniFiled under: FranceSyriaShare this on:Twitterdel.icio.us | 2 Comments  |  Add a comment | PermalinkOctober 18, 2012Are sanctions against Syria hurting the regime?Posted: 2215 GMTLawrence Rubin from Georgia Tech came on the show today and talked about whether sanctions against Syria are making a difference.

The visit was designed to discuss Greeces bailout plan and the austerity measures that have angered so many Greeks. Matthew Chance is live with us from the Greek capital.Also topping the show today, the massive suicide blasts that reportedly targeted the Air Force Intelligence compound in Damascus. Experts say the AFI is considered the elite, primary intelligence agency of the Assad regime. A shadowy jihadist group called Al Nusra Front has claimed responsibility for the attack.It is unknown how many people may have been killed or whether anti-regime detainees in the complex were hurt."We also fear for the lives of hundreds if not thousands of anti-government detainees that are being held in the basements of the air force security compound," said Rami Abdulrahman of the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.If this Jihadi group was able to mount a successful attack against AFI, it could be significant for two reasons: first, it means the Jihadi suicide bomb tactics used in Iraq are now becoming a more prominent weapon used by some members of the anti-Assad rebellion; second, it could constitute more than a symbolic blow to the Syrian government by damaging or destroying surveillance equipment.A little later, well take you live to Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, where former PennState football coach Jerry Sandusky was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for sexually abusing children during his time at the university.Plus, theres a new poll out that is no doubt given Mitt Romneys campaign a little spring in their step.
