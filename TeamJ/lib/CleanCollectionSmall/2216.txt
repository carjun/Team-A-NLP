One that I am sure will be controversial, but may get people thinking in a different direction.When NATO implemented the no-fly zone over Libya with UN approval,  it was stated that the purpose was to protect mass civilian casualties.  However they ended up using this permission in order to do more than just protect civilians, and actively helped bring about the end of Gaddafi's regime.  Gaddafi has been on many Western countries shit-list for a long time, and many countries were happy to remove his thorn from their side. Thus knocking him out of power, while protecting western oil interest in Libya, ended up dovetailing together nicely.Now lets look at Syria.  The US does not have much compelling interest in getting involved in their civil war.  There are not many major western assets there to protect.  Assad is not liked in the US government, especially after he was caught building a nuclear reactor with North Korea help.  However, looking at what would come should Assad's regime be toppled, looks even less attractive.  Furthermore, whoever emerges as a leader in Syria would continue to buy arms from Russia and China, due to price, so there is no upside there either.Could NATO implement a no-fly zone without UN approval?  Yes they could, but they would take a diplomatic hit for doing it.  The only thing the US is really concerned with Syria is that they are propped up by Iran, and their interference with Lebanon (which the US would like to see diminish).  So from the US's standpoint the best way to change these things may not be for a quick end to hostilities, but for a long conflict that greatly weakens Syria and their regional influence.  This could have the added effect of also drawing Syria's ally into a long and costly support campaign.  The more money, manpower, and material that Iran sends to Syria the greater the drag it will be for their economic and military power.So maybe just maybe, the US wants to prop up the rebels just enough so they can wage an insurgency, but not enough that they can win quickly.  Just a theory of mine, most likely wrong.  I just cannot get over the suspicion that some US policy makers see Syria's civil war, as an opportunity to turn into slow open wound for Iran.  Comparable to the USSR's war in Afghanistan, or the US's long nightmare in Vietnam.Sorry for the wall of text.

They have more range than a Stinger and are available on the black market.  The US had quite a problem with them in Iraq, so I am sure many of these systems are still available in the region.permalinksavecontextfull comments5000Romney Surges to Tie Obama in National Poll - WSJ.com (online.wsj.com)submitted 1 month ago by sick_reality to politics2 commentssharecancelloading...Five suspected terrorists - including radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri - will be extradited to the US to face trial, UK High Court judges rule.  by  syukin  worldnews[+]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoCan you say Florence Colorado?

I'm here to answer any question you have to the best of my ability.  by  harrington9999in  IAmA[+]sick_reality 47 points48 points49 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 47 points48 points49 points 2 months agoSo much misinformation in this story yesterday it is ridiculous.  The US government has not declared Wikileaks or Julian Assange an "Enemy of the State" despite what the SMH has reported.  First off the US Military cannot declare another state, organization, or person to be an enemy of the US.  That can only be done by the State department or the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Treasury department.  They do this at the direction of the President or the FBI.They keep a public list of states, organization, and person who American citizens and companies are banned from engaging in financial activities with or exporting sensitive technology to.  These are the lists that list Al-Qaeda, their member, and other organization.  Guess what neither Wikileaks nor Julian Assange are on any of these lists.  American citizens (without a clearance) are free to donate to Wikileaks or visit the website as they like.  Here is a link to the list http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdnlist.txtThe part where it gets tricky is for those American citizens with a clearance or military personnel.  As part of your completion of your SF-86 form and NDAs for receiving your clearance you are told that you cannot access the Wikileaks site or communicate with them in any way, unless you are strictly told to do so by a commanding officer.  The penalty for doing so is an immediate loss of clearance, and an investigation would be performed to see if you violated any of your areas of trust.  The security departments even emailed a memo to all cleared persons in the US DoD warning them when this change was put into effect.What the case in the paper was detailing, was an analyst with a TS clearance that was violating this restriction.  The result was an obvious loss of clearance and an investigation.  After the investigation the Air Force thought about charging the analyst with the crime of communicating with the enemy, but after deliberation decided not to do so.  The reason not is the analyst had not provided them with any classified information.  The analyst was never charged, prosecuted, or convicted of any crime.  If she had provided classified information then that is the crime she would have been charged with.This whole notion that the US has declared Wikileaks or Julian Assange as an enemy of the state is nonsense.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Republican Brain Drain  by  The_Write_Stuffin  politics[+]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoTruly the Republicans need to get their heads out of their asses and come up with a better primary caucus structure for choosing a candidate.  The one they have is destined for takeover by their radical elements and destined for failure come November.  The game has fundamentally changed in the last 20 years.  The idea that you can be way right during the primaries and swing back to the middle during the general election is an anachronism in the days of instant video and social media.  Hopefully they can get it together in the future, so that we do not end up with a defacto one party system in the running for the highest office.permalinksavecontextfull commentsItaly's Highest Court Upholds The Convictions of 23 CIA Agents for Kidnapping a Terror Suspect in Milan - NYTimes.com  by  nilss0nin  worldnews[+]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoThey do not know most of the agents names, only their aliases.  They just spent their time and money trying ghosts in absentia using court appointed attorneys that have never met or talked to their defendants.  You cannot extradite a person when you do not even know their real name.  These trials are mostly meaningless.permalinksavecontextfull commentsItaly's Highest Court Upholds The Convictions of 23 CIA Agents for Kidnapping a Terror Suspect in Milan - NYTimes.com  by  nilss0nin  worldnews[+]sick_reality 3 points4 points5 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 3 points4 points5 points 2 months agoSo most of those tried they do not even know there names.

The 150 billion medicare cut that they are asking hospitals to take over 10 years will likely be changed with taxpayers paying the difference.  The 2.3% tax on companies that make medical devices is already being eyed by the medial industry lobbyist for reduction.  The pharmaceutical companies want other changes to their benefit, which will be to the taxpayers detriment as well.When both parties of Congress are in the pocket of the corporate lobbyist this is what you can expect.  Anybody that expects that the current version of the ACA to remain as written, in regards to its funding, is either ignorant of how the system works or delusional.  Few people really want to pull back the curtain of the butcher's shop to see how the sausage gets made.permalinksavecontextfull commentsZuckerbergs 1.05% Loan Shows How Wealthy Stay Rich  by  alephtelosin  news[+]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 4 months agoIt is an ARM product that he is using to get this low rate.  The rate on these products could easily balloon up.  In which case he would either have to pay it off, refinance, pay the higher rate, or sell.

Their strategy is to hold a gun to the economy's head to scare companies and investors into protection mode before the election.  Their thinking is if the economy tanks enough before November that will give them a small enough edge to beat Obama.From a political junkie standpoint it is both interesting and scary to watch at the same time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMitt Romney Meets the Blacks  by  99redditin  politics[+]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWhat Romney did at this speech was actually pretty clever from a political viewpoint.  Obviously he has made the rollback of the PPACA (Obamacare) a central tenant of his campaign.  By not shying away from that and affirming his position in an environment opposed to that viewpoint, he may come across to independent voters as someone committed to his position.  A non-waffler if you will.You can say he was for expanding Medicaid as governor of MA before he is against as a presidential candidate.  However, in my opinion that nuance will not stick well and will be relegated to the backpages of the newspaper.  Political junkies will dig into it, but the moderate voters who just look at the headlines and the front page will not.Do not take this as I like Mitt, as I do not and think he is not the right person for the job.  However, I did admire his approach to this difficult situation.  Usually when Republicans go for the yearly speeches at the NCAAP they either come off as pandering or skewing their talking points.  To independent voters I do not think this will be the case this time.  He will not win many votes in the black community for this speech (although that was forgone conclusion), but it may have helped in the demographic he needs the most.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBritain embarrassed by Olympics security shortfall: Britain could be forced to deploy thousands of extra troops in London during the Olympics, after a last-minute security blunder dealt an embarrassing blow to the government just two weeks before the Games.  by  davidreiss666in  worldnews[+]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIn government contracting the general rule of thumb is 200% of the salary for the cost of the contract.

In other words the appropriations for CIA counter terrorism activities in fiscal year 2001, would have been appropriated in 2000.  Blaming lack of CIA funding on Bush in fiscal year 2001 is not just a stretch, it is simply untrue.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEcuador says Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is seeking asylum at its embassy in London - The Washington Post  by  Krusmirin  worldnews[+]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]sick_reality 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHe wants asylum to avoid the rape charge in Sweden.  He knows if he gets out of Europe, it will be tough for Sweden to get him back for questioning.In all likelihood the US does not want to extradite him to stand trial.  The courts would protect most of his actions as a journalist, just as in the Pentagon Papers.  Secondly the trial would be a complete circus with a lot of the US's dirty laundry being shown for public display.  That is something they would rather bury and have forgotten.The ideal scenario for the US would be for him to be charged, tried, and convicted for sexual assault.  If he is ridiculed and his reputation destroyed, then Wikileaks will probably die off.  That would be their best outcome.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit?
