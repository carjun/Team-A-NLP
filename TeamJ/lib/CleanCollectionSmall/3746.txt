CNN producers quickly dismissed the story, but that didnt stop it from being recommended more than 10,000 times on Facebook. In case youre new to iReport, all iReports are user-submitted, and have the words "NOT VETTED BY CNN" stamped across the top until someone at CNN talks to the submitter and confirms the information (you can learn more on our About page. Because this story was so popular, we decided to add an additional note that it was not confirmed by CNN and provided a link to additional information.Most of the people who commented on the story didn't seem too worried about it. Some made jokes, while others did their own detective work and declared it a hoax.iReporter balefire97 said folks just need to relax:"Being born in 1979, this will be the 49th doomsday I have lived through. If memory serves me right, the last 48 werent very memorable, nor accurate, but that may go without saying, so I predict this one is going to be equally uninteresting and equally false. Tinfoil hats for everyone!" he wrote.NASA saw it too, and they weren't thrilled. They've been pretty busy knocking down various "end of the world prophesies" in the months leading up to the Mayan Apocalypse. Some people believe it is coming on December 21, because that's when the end of the 5,126-year cycle on the Maya's Long Count calendar.We talked with the senior editor of the NASA website (who used to work here at CNN) and encouraged him to participate in the conversation, so that the thousands of people who were going to iReport would also be able to the real story. He agreed and created the NASAWeb iReport account.He said the story was "absolutely false" and that "if Nibiru were real and headed for Earth, astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade." He also said that if it Nibiru was about to hit the Earth it would be visible to the naked eye, so you'd be able to see it for yourself. You can read more about Niribu and other apocalypse hoaxes on the NASA website.We are always looking for space stories here at CNN iReport, so if you're an amateur astronomer we'd love for you to share your (true) stories with us. In the meantime, we've got our fingers crossed that NASAWeb will hook us up with some future astronauts or give us the Mars Curiosity rover's phone number.Posted by: davidw //             December 1, 2012 10 comments                 // Add a comment                Posted in:                         storiesiReporters demand justice over brutal Nigeria murders   The horrific murder last month of four students in the Nigerian city of Port Harcourt galvanised dozens of iReporters to demand action from authorities -- and to call on CNN to cover the story.The four men, who studied at the University of Port Harcourt, were caught up in a frenzy of violence in circumstances that remain unclear.It is thought one of them may have been trying to collect a debt, however, word somehow spread that the men were thieves.In response, a mob beat and dragged the men through the citys streets, before setting them on fire.The mens murders were captured in graphic footage on at least one cell phone and disseminated widely through social media networks.Soon, appalled Nigerians were sending the video in to iReport, imploring CNN to cover the story.After watching the video of the lynching of those students, I was completely terrified, said iReporter Oladayo Oladimeji Sadiku, originally from the Nigerian city of Lagos but now living in Germany.I couldn't just keep quiet and I felt I had to do something by raising awareness.Although it was not the first time such a terrible crime had happened in the country and nor was it the first time such videos had been seen, the sheer brutality of the crime against the young men, now known as the Aluu Four, sparked condemnation in Nigeria and beyond.Such killings in Nigeria are often described as jungle justice, and some iReporters said they were ashamed that such acts were the face of "justice" in their country.To be frank, I wept, said iReporter Ogechukwu Nna, a student in Lagos. They are people's brothers. I have lots of friends at the University of Port Harcourt and every one of them I called said the same thing: Those boys were innocent.Many iReporters expressed anger that little had been done to protect the men by those in positions of authority who had the power to intercede.Oladokun Olanrewaju, an IT consultant from Lagos, said the government must take stringent measures to stop this crazy public menace:First, the government should enact strict laws to punish those guilty of illegal killings. Secondly, there should be a nationwide sensitization campaigns to re-orientate the people against such acts and leave justice to the judiciary, he said. Lastly, the police should wake up to their duty in protecting the lives of the people.iReporter Sandra Sopuluchukwu Ezekwesili said she shared the video in the hope that it would galvanise Nigerians from all areas of society to act against such brutal murders.I spoke out because I felt if the world knew what the order of the day was, maybe our security and justice system will sit up, she said. Maybe it will sow the seed of remorse in the hearts of Nigerians and further deter them from taking laws into their hands.Nigerian police have since arrested and charged 13 people in relation to the case, and online petitions calling for justice have circulated online.Thanks to some determined iReporters, the tragic story of the Aluu Four -- and the fight for justice -- has reached a global audience.Posted by: sarahbrowngb //             November 26, 2012 11 comments                 // Add a comment                Posted in:                         communityPresenting your iReport local news teamThere are quite a few aspiring journalists honing their skills on iReport. We caught up with five iReporters who have turned their journalistic dreams into a career in journalism.Kyle Aevermann has been a constant presence on iReport since 2008, discussing his thoughts on everything from American Idol" to one of his favorite annual events, Black Friday. This year, he took on a role as weekend anchor, reporter and morning producer for KOBI-TV in Medford, Oregon.I think that being part of iReport really helped me shape my philosophy as a journalist, he said. I want to use my position to give people a voice.Katy Brown joined the team at WCHS/WVAH-TV in Charleston, West Virginia, in just the past few months and she's already on air. Describing herself as a one-man band, shes responsible for being the photographer, reporter, editor and writer for all her stories.She credited her time on iReport with developing a very specific skill set.When I was iReporting, I was watching debates and speeches for the 2008 election. I trained my ear for things that didn't seem right or were just odd. I would then take off from there, researching or voicing my opinion on whatever caught my ear. Now, I do the same thing. I listen really close to interviews and sometimes catch things that maybe I wasn't supposed to or no one else caught.Ashley Porter made a big impression right away on iReport with stories from the Boston area, such as the star-studded Hasty Pudding event and the Boston Marathon.It wasnt long before she was working in local markets like West Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas. Shes currently a multimedia journalist at WTSP-TV in Tampa, Florida.In college, iReport was what inspired me to dig for stories about people making a difference, she said, referring to her iReport about a man walking across the U.S. gathering peoples messages for then-President-elect Obama. "I never thought about using those stories to get my first job out of college, but I put them in a portfolio and, thankfully, it worked.Chris Soriano caught our attention with his very first iReport: a video poem in honor of the movie Moneyball. The San Diego resident went on to report for KYMA-TV in Yuma, Arizona, starting less than a week after he attended the 2012 iReport Awards in June. (He is now a weekend anchor.)I learned that the vital component about being a reporter is throwing yourself in the story and overcoming your fears of what others might think, he said.I was a shy person when I first started as an iReporter. I was afraid of what people might think as they passed me by on the street as I'm filming myself doing a story, but the more I did it, the more the confidence it built inside me.Abbey Niezgoda, whom we first caught up with last year, is now a multimedia reporter for Providence, Rhode Islands WLNE.iReport gave me an outlet to measure my work through view counts and comments, beyond my inner-circle of friends and colleagues, she said. And while not all of my iReports were popular or received positive feedback, that only helped me grow the thick skin needed to survive the broadcast world.Were tremendously proud to have contributed  if only in a small way  to the new careers of these reporters.Have you been able to apply your experience with iReport to your own career? Let us know in the comments.Posted by: hhanks //             November 20, 2012 11 comments                 // Add a comment                Posted in:                         storiesBehind the scenes at HLN's Morning ExpressLast week, I had the opportunity to shadow the production crew of HLNs Morning Express with Robin Meade. While there, I was able to learn from producers and writers on the show, listen in from the control room and even meet the anchor, Robin Meade.Starting my day out with HLN was a whirlwind of excitement; I could hardly sleep the night before because I was so anxious to see how the show is put together and how they use stories from iReporters in the show.When I arrived, I found out that the morning show team gives new meaning to the words starting your day bright and early by getting in at 2:30 a.m. followed by a rundown meeting at 3 a.m. of interesting news topics. On this particular day, the teams focus was covering the scandal surrounding former CIA Director David Petraeus, honoring service members for Veterans Day and making sense of the fiscal cliff.HLN and especially Morning Express focuses on telling the stories of people who are affected by the news, so it makes sense that they love to use iReports.On the day that I was there they featured Christine OConnors iReport video of her three year old son, Corbin, singing the national anthem for Veterans Day. Morning Express also places a huge emphasis on our countrys military, celebrating troops with a daily shout-out that usually comes from the Salute to Troops assignment.The show often partners with iReport to create assignments that their viewers can relate to and can have fun with, like the battle of the marching bands assignment that recently ended.The newest Morning Express assignment is a call-out for holiday sing-a-longs. They're looking for original video of church choirs, glee clubs and other musical groups belting out holiday music. The show will be airing submissions to that assignment every Friday in the month of December!Be sure to join the Morning Express assignment group to get up to date information on what the show is looking for.Posted by: Jamescia //             November 20, 2012 3 comments                 // Add a comment                Posted in:                         storiesNo sex required for unfaithfulness to beginMany readers said unfaithfulness can begin with sending e-mails and texts.We've seen literally thousands of comments and social media posts about the tangled web of former CIA Director David Petraeus' career-ending affair. Readers are talking about politics, the timing of Petraeus' announcement and possible long-term impact. But an especially popular theme that keeps coming up is fidelity and faithfulness, to which some readers say they can relate all too well.So we posted a survey on Facebook asking readers where that line of unfaithfulness begins. Is it fantasizing, flirting, communicating online, hugging, kissing or having sex? We received more than 2,000 answers to our unscientific poll, and as of 2:15 p.m. Wednesday, the majority of respondents said one may stray without ever making physical contact. About 47% of readers said unfaithfulness can begin when people are sending e-mails and texts without their partner's knowledge."I think it is the sneaking and lying that make it infidelity as much as the sex," explained commenter Jean Timmels. Another reader, Tess Gipson, said, "When the relationship has to be kept secret from your partner it is wrong. Otherwise you could bring the person in and sit them down in the living room and visit like a friend!"Drawing the line at sex was the second most popular choice, but it only got 20% overall."Kissing, per se, is meaningless," wrote Michael Wilson.Indeed, other forms of touch like kissing (13%) and hugging (less than 1%) were picked even less often. Some drew the line at flirtatious behavior (11%). We also heard from a few readers about fantasizing, which garnered the most comments but only 8% of the survey votes. Overall, readers seemed to place a lot of power in the mental aspect of love."It starts when you are thinking about it," said Belinda Lipscomb. "Because where your thoughts go, your actions will soon follow."Where do you think unfaithfulness begins? How do you feel about the Petraeus affair?

Two. Three. Imagine the future of the GOP.We recently tried an experiment to find out what readers think about the post-election political world. Since a lot of that conversation was happening in the comments sections across CNN.com, we decided to focus our efforts there.Several CNN iReport staffers started jumping right into the comments sections, typing out questions about what President Obama should do and the meaning of liberalism. Readers posted dozens of responses to those questions, and this one as well: What should the GOP do right now? We asked the readers to follow a structured list, and they did. Having that consistent format among the responses allowed us to produce a story culling together 10 of the best posts.We were impressed with readers thoughtfulness. Focus on true conservative values was one of the three suggestions for the GOP listed by CNN.com reader WazzaMatta4U. SRM2012 suggested that Republicans engage young African Americans and Latinos.The story also inspired some commenters to respond by listing their wishes for what the Democratic Party should do next, like this item from user SaneReason: Bask in the reflected glory of your recent presidential victory, but recognize the number of Americans that feel differently.This is part of our new effort to connect the CNN.com commenting community with CNN iReport, bringing together two worlds of discussion that have, until now, always been pretty separate. Comments on news stories have traditionally had a rough-and-tumble reputation, but we are quite often blown away by readers thoughtfulness. We hope to try new projects like this in the future, and wed love to hear what you think.Please share your thoughts and suggestions on bringing your voices into CNNs coverage in the comments section below (you can put them in a list format if youd like).

Superstorm Sandy brought flooding, destruction and power loss, and just as cleanup was beginning, a nor'easter cooled temperatures to freezing and dumped a fresh batch of snow over the region.New York was one of the hardest hit areas in the storms. But amongst the devastation, iReporters found moments of beauty and strength. Here are a few of their most stunning images:Edgar Alan Zeta Yap, who's visiting New York from the Philippines, was delighted to see the snow and documented it around Manhattan. "I immediately rushed outside with my camera to capture some images, and as the snowfall got heavier, I ended up walking from [the] Upper East Side, down Fifth Avenue, to Times Square, taking snapshots of the snow bearing down on people and blanketing the streets," he said.Also visiting New York, Jonathan Albizures of Atlanta had mixed feelings when he saw the snow. "I was excited to see the snow but at the same time, I felt bad because it complicated the situation with the storm," he said. He snapped this photo of people walking through Times Square.Lower Manhattan, including the new One World Trade Center (at left, under construction), is seen from snowy Jersey City. Pankaj Purohit shot this and other photos of the snow blanketing his city.Snow flurries hit the Bronx's Van Cortlandt Park. "This is making the destruction from Sandy take a step back," said Beth Alice Barret, a New Yorker who shot photos around the city. "The snow is wet and brings undesired weight to the already bowed trees."Columbia University students in upper Manhattan brave the snow on their campus in this photo by Roshen Weliwatta.If you're in the Northeast and can do so safely, show us how the severe weather is affecting you.Posted by: rachel8 //             November 9, 2012 5 comments                 // Add a comment                Posted in:                         stories5 things we learned from the 'I Voted' challengeThroughout this election season, the CNN Politics team has published a series of "5 things we learned" stories after big political events, like debates and conventions.We thought we'd follow in their footsteps with our own set of five learnings after completing the nationwide "I Voted" iReport challenge. You shared more than 2,700 "I Voted" stickers and other voter artifacts from all 50 states - congratulations!Here's what we learned from your submissions, from serious to silly:1. Oregonians vote by mail  Did you know that Oregon doesn't have precincts and voting machines? Residents there can only vote via mail or by dropping their ballot off at designated libraries and offices. Oregonian iReporter Emily Erwin shared a photo of herself sending in her ballot on Election Day. The downside to mail-in ballots? "I don't have a sticker to show off," she said.2. Georgia's sticker stands out from the rest  Here in Atlanta, we're definitely fans of the "I'm a Georgia Voter" sticker with its pretty peach background. But besides being symbolic of the peach state, it's also the only "I Voted" sticker we saw that didn't feature red or blue. Here's to standing out from the crowd!3. It's a hipster civic duty to post your sticker on Instagram We know where all the cool kids were on Election Day. Seriously, look at you guys. Instagram was flooded with photos of voters proudly sporting their stickers (we'll admit, we did it too). We invited you to share yours via the hashtag #ivotedcnn and received more than 2,000 photos.4. Not everyone gets a sticker after they vote  It's tragic, really. But voters in New York, New Jersey and Oregon - along with many people who voted absentee, voted early, or whose precincts couldn't afford stickers or ran out - didn't get stickers after casting their ballots. We thought that was very sad, so we created a lovely printable sticker for all you voters who didn't get one to show your pride. And some of you even designed your own!5. You bring your kids to vote  Some parents wanted to teach their kids about the democratic process, others just couldn't find child care. But whatever the reason, many of you with kids brought them along to the polling place. "Taking children to the polls is important, even though there's sometimes a wait," said Lucy Tyler, whose daughter is in the pink shirt above. She stood in line for three hours to vote in Alexandria, Virginia. Still, she says, "it's important for them to understand the meaning of election day at a young age." And, of course, nobody loves to wear the "I Voted" stickers more than kids!Didn't share your sticker yet? What are you waiting for?!

"You look like one of those great Saints fans, who would be a good luck charm for us. We'll find a way to get you to a game. It'll be my birthday present to you."Seven months later, this past Sunday night, Tristan finally got to redeem Brees' offer and see his hero in action.As Tristan told his mother, "Our seats were great -- up high but a perfect view from the end zone of the whole field."Tristan also got to see Brees warming up on the field as he entered the stadium, a special highlight.Although the Saints lost to his home team Denver Broncos 34-14, Tristan said he was not upset, because "I won... big time."Check out a video slideshow of Tristan's big day below.

Now other iReporters have gotten in on the act by busting rhymes about both sides in the presidential race. The reasons for the videos are as varied as the many issues we've heard about during the iReport debate. Los Angeles resident Luke Caldwell burst onto the scene back in August, for a rap video shot in the nations capital - a full-throated endorsement for presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Our country needs restoration, he told us at the time. I'm very interested in being pivotal in expressing it in a way the youth will find interesting. Then, we had an October surprise as Obama supporter Reese decided to continue his streak with a very energetic rap performance about Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan. The self-described independent from Cincinnati said, This was a simple, silly ABC style rap that touched on some of the Romney team accomplishments. The clear message is the team is about something, not just negative things, but I would hope that voters do their research and vote for their family. (True to form, Reese did a rap video for Obama as well.) On the other side of the coin, Chad Lewine from New York was convinced after seeing the polls that his fellow Obama supporters needed some encouragement, so he put together his own rap video, with a positive, pro-voting message. Most average citizens don't love reading text or listening to speeches, but most of us love listening to music and watching fun videos, he said. So, a melody and some lyrics popped into my head one day. I wrote them down and started working on the song. it took me about 3 weeks to make it perfect. One of those fellow Obama supporters, Brad Turner from Bloomington, Illinois, had a decidedly different take with his video. He wanted to reach out to undecided voters, with a song taking on the feel of a campaign rally. We want the viewer to see see white, black, brown, young and old people coming together to fight for the President, he explained. No matter who watches it, they can see someone like them in it. With a few days left before the election, theres still time to lay down a few beats for your candidate of choice if youre up to the challenge.

And as they weathered the storm, iReporters captured thousands of amazing images and shared them with the world. Here are 11 photos and videos that told the story of Sandy like nothing else could.1. Flooded taxisThe photo of the flooded taxis above could only happen in the New York area. Jonathan Otto captured it and other images in Hoboken, New Jersey, which he says turned into "one big pond" during the storm.2. Dramatic winds in Jersey City Water whips through the air and trees become horizontal in this dramatic video from Jersey City, New Jersey. "It was hard to stand up and felt like a freight train was going through the area," said George Nikolis. "At one point the Hudson [River] started coming through our building lobby."3. Power: Brooklyn vs. Manhattan As of October 30, much of Brooklyn had electricity, while much of lower Manhattan didn't. This photo of the Williamsburg Bridge by Jordan Shapiro illustrates the situation like nothing else.4. Subway under waterThis Brooklyn subway station looked more like a canal on Monday night. Maggie Huang, who rides the train from this station to work every day, said the water was only a foot from the platform. Luckily, by the next day, the water had drained and the tracks were clear.5. Crashing Lake Michigan waves Of course, Sandy didn't only affect the New York area. In this video, the storm churns up unbelievably huge waves in Lake Michigan near Chicago. "I don't believe Lake Michigan has been this violent" before, said Andy Bovos.6. Flooding in Staten IslandSandy hit Staten Island, New York, hard. Roshen Weliwatta documented the damage, from boats pushed ashore to cars flooded up to their windows.7. LaGuardia closed for business More than 19,000 flights were canceled because of Sandy. This footage from LaGuardia airport in New York, showing the flooded tarmac and runway, illustrates why. It was shot by an airport employee who wishes to remain anonymous.8. Trees down in the Bronx In addition to flooding, Sandy knocked down trees and left millions without electricity. In the Bronx, Damion Watkins filmed this video showing the enormous trees that were felled (and took power lines with them). Unbelievably, his power remained on.9. Building facade collapses As Sandy passed through New York, it caused all kinds of damage, including ripping the facade clean off a building in Chelsea. Firefighters come to the rescue in this video by Sarkis Alex Kalashian.10. Huddling around outletsElectricity has been a scarce resource in New York since the storm hit on Monday. 6.2 million people are still without power, and many won't get it back until next week. In this photo by Marjorie Zien, students at the New School gather in the one building with power.11. Rocking the boat Sandy transformed a relaxing cruise into a torrential night on October 26 as the ship and its passengers endured rough waters near Miami, Florida. David Evans shared this video of flooded decks, doors slamming open and shut, and a destroyed gift shop onboard the ship. It's since become the most viewed iReport of all time.See a map and timeline of all the best Sandy iReports at our Open Story. Are you experiencing the effects of superstorm Sandy?

It just isn't worth the hassle, he says. This, despite the fact that he loves politics and has a firm opinion on just about every candidate and issue on the ticket.These are three nonvoters I met on a trip to Hawaii last month as part of a new CNN project I'm heading up called Change the List. I went to Hawaii not for the scenery or surf, but because the state has the lowest voter turnout rate in the country. My goal is to help create a conversation that could change that -- not by shaming Hawaii, but by rooting for it as an underdog.It's a cliche but it's true: Change can start with a person. That's why I'm asking iReporters to help convince one nonvoter in Hawaii to vote in the upcoming election. The three people I described at the top of this post -- Nani, Skyler and Michael -- as well as a few others, have agreed to let the People of the Internet (that's you!) send them messages trying to convince them to vote.If you're interested, here's what you need to do. Three easy steps:Step 1: Pick a person. Here are your choices.#CTL1: Paul Hewlett: The it's-all-good guy.I met Paul on a beach in Oahu just as he was finishing a night of canoeing. Things are generally pretty good in Hawaii, he said, so he's never felt the need to vote. "I've never voted in my life," he said. "I don't think my one vote is going to make any difference."#CTL2: Michael Remen: The disenfranchised voter.Michael loves voting. Along with football, it's his favorite "water cooler" topic. He knows the candidates and the issues. He always voted. Until this year. He had such trouble at his polling place earlier this year -- he spent an hour and a half trying to vote and left frustrated -- that he lost trust in the system. He told me he doesn't plan to cast a ballot in November.#CTL3: Nani Teruya: The Hawaii separatist.If you like a challenge, pick Nani. She basically told me she dares someone -- anyone -- to try to convince her to vote. Nani doesn't vote because she doesn't consider Hawaii to be part of the United States. Still, I talked to members of the Hawaiian family who said people like Nani should use their unique voices to sway politicians. Plus, Nani is already engaged in politics. She helped a friend of hers campaign for office, standing on street corners holding signs.#CTL4: Skyler Gayhart: The high school student.Soon-to-be 18, Skyler told me he feels to young to vote. Elections and politics are thigns that affect older people -- property owners -- not him, he said. Still, there are issues he holds dear, particularly overcrowding on Oahu. "If you go to Sandy Beach and catch a wave," he said during a discussion about voting in his high school class, "theres 10 other people on that same wave!"#CTL5: Nanci Munroe: The one who says it doesn't matter.Nanci Munroe has several reasons not to vote. Most unique: Hawaii is six hours behind the East Coast. National results are announced before she goes to the polls.#CTL6: Tyler Tawara: The university student."I don't vote because I don't believe what the politicians are saying," said Tyler Tawara, an 18-year-old University of Hawaii student. "I'm indifferent. They're just lying."Step 2: Send that person a messageYou can do that by sending a video on CNN iReport. Or by sending a message on Twitter. Please be sure to include the hashtag for the person you've chosen. If you're talking to Tyler, for example, tag your iReport or Tweet #CTL6. For Skyler, it's #CTL4. Get it? Kinda like "American Idol."Here's a video I sent to #CTL2.I would encourage you to make it personal. Why do you vote. A thoughtful explanation may be the best form of persuasion. Or what about that person speaks to you? Do you relate to them?Step 3: See if your message makes the cutI created a CNN page for each nonvoter. Check back on these pages to see if your message makes the cut. If it does, it means the nonvoter you chose will see your message. Here they are:#CTL1 | #CTL2 | #CTL3 | #CTL4 | #CTL5 | #CTL6Step 4: Find out if you made a differenceFollow the CNN Change the List Tumblr for updates on the project. I'll report back on which -- if any -- of the six nonvoters decides to cast a ballot in November.

Lots of people supported him for speaking out, but many others showered him with insults.Dishler says he meant what he wrote and he knows hes probably not going to change the minds of the current students (and others) who have been calling him names on the Internet and treating him like an evil super villain trying to destroy his old schools traditions and make his town look ignorant and racist."I understand that they dont get why I did what I did. Thats fine. Thats why this problem happened -- because they dont understand why these things were offensive," he told CNN. "I still personally believe, and will defend to the end, that [the skit] was ridiculous and should have never taken place. I expressed that view and it was obviously a view that was not very popular with quite a few people."To recap, the controversy began with a photo of Waverly students wearing face makeup to appear black and reenacting performer Chris Browns 2009 assault on his then-girlfriend Rihanna. It was part of a skit for Friday nights pep rally. The photo started making its way around Facebook, where Dishler spotted it in his News Feed on Sunday. He wrote up his thoughts, got some quotes from other alums who saw the picture, and posted the story to iReport.Dishler, a college student who lives in nearby Elmira, New York, grew up in Waverly, a small town on the New York-Pennsylvania border. Of Waverly's 4,444 people, 4,312 were white, according to 2010 census data.He had a great experience in high school, and his parents both work for the Waverly school district. But he was offended and wondered how the school could have allowed a skit making light of domestic violence, while also apparently ignoring the racist history of blackface.He says he hoped posting the photo on CNN would generate some meaningful discussion in the community. And he still hopes that.He might have succeeded. On Thursday, The Daily Review reported that more than 50 community members packed the Waverly Central School Districts administration building to discuss the fall-out. According to the newspaper, superintendent Joseph Yellch told the crowd, "We're seizing this as a teachable moment  We're putting together a real good, ongoing intervention plan. This is not going to be a one-time thing."Posted by: dsashin //             October 19, 2012 24 comments                 // Add a comment                Posted in:                         storiesAbout the iReport Blog                            The latest and greatest on CNN iReport, brought to you by Team iReport.Blog Home @cnnireport on TwitterCategoriesStoriesCommunitySiteWeek in iReportRecent postsThe hoax that brought NASA to CNN iReport  iReporters demand justice over brutal Nigeria murders   Presenting your iReport local news teamBehind the scenes at HLN's Morning ExpressNo sex required for unfaithfulness to beginSharing your thoughts on election can be easy as 1, 2, 3Finding beauty in the chaos5 things we learned from the 'I Voted' challengeiReport and Superstorm Sandy: Tune in to CNN tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. ETYoung iReporter's NFL dream come trueMonthlyDecember 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 SubscribeiReport 101About |Blog Community Guidelines Meet the Team Terms of UseWe are Everywhere Facebook Twitter Tumblr FlickrGet Help StoryTelling Toolkit FAQs Contact Us Advertising ContactsTools How to post iReports CNN Mobile appsHomeVideoCNN TrendsU.S.WorldPoliticsJusticeEntertainmentTechHealthLivingTravelOpinioniReportMoneySports Tools & widgetsRSSPodcastsBlogsCNN mobileMy profileE-mail alertsCNN shopSite map  2012 Cable News Network.
