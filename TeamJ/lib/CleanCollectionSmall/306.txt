Others just wanted to see familiar faces and try to make sense of a tragedy that none could explain.Many of the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School just a few blocks away, have likely sat in Sandy Hook Diner and scribbled in the coloring books the waitresses keep under the worn counter, said Jodi Mucherino, 51, who was pouring coffee and delivering orders of pancakes and eggs on Saturday.PHOTOS: Connecticut school shootingThe diner prides itself on being a place parents can bring their kids and the servers don't mind if the little ones are screaming or crying or running in circles, she said. The cooks often make pancakes shaped like animals and smiley faces for the kids."There are no words," said Mucherino, who attended the Sandy Hook school. "Everybody is a mess."It is Msgr. Robert Weiss's habit to have breakfast every morning at this diner, and he felt that it was important -- this morning of all mornings -- that he make an appearance and be able to minister to anyone who was grieving. When he sat down and ordered a small stack of pancakes he took off his blue plaid scarf to show his black and white priest's collar.FULL COVERAGE: Connecticut school shooting"The reality is just settling in," he said.Weiss was up before dawn on Saturday to help the Connecticut State Police notify families whose loved ones had been confirmed dead by investigators working at the crime scene through the night. He joined a three-person team that included a state police officer and a grief counselor. One of the two families he visited had lost both a parent and a child in the shooting.He has ministered to parents who have lost young children before, but little could prepare him for the magnitude of evil that came to this town yesterday, he said."I just hope God's hand will be on me," he said.Weiss was in the town's fire station all day Friday counseling parents and teachers from the school. He recalled baptizing some of the children who were killed and on Friday night led a memorial service at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church."I draw strength from these families," he said, as walked out to meet with more members of his congregation. "They have suffered and are still going."ALSO:A Connecticut town reels from heartbreak Connecticut school shooting: Resources for parents Principal died in Connecticut school shooting, official confirmsbrian.bennett@latimes.comTwitter: @ByBrianBennettCopyright  2012, Los Angeles TimesComments13Comments (14)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQITSTRAGIC at 10:04 AM December 15, 2012                Here are some of the commony heard excuses used by gun lobbyists when pushing on their self-interest in the face of monthly tragedies like the Newtown massacre:1) "Guns don't kill people, people kill people". If that was true, why don't we have other mass killing weapons available as well, such as hand grenades, machine guns, and rocket launchers?2) "Don't take away my right to own a gun". No one wants to take away your right to own a gun. However, we do want to keep in check the obscene proliferation of mass-killing weapons. Where does it say in the Constitution that you can own 50 guns that can kill 20 people in a few minutes?3) "I need a gun to protect myself or for hunting". Again if you really feel that threatened or have an urge to kill animals, go buy one gun, register and train for it. However do you really need a dozen semi-automatic weapons to protect yourself or shoot Bambi? If yes, then consult a therapist quick, there is a high possiblity that you might one of the crazed mass killers we hear about.4) "Cars kill too, why don't we outlaw them?". Cars have one main function and it's transport, not killing. Yet, we have more oversight, regulations, taxes and law enforcement dedicated to their safe operation and ownership.it's high time we put pressure on our Congress and president to pass common sense laws and regulations about gun ownership and gun safety.castaway1945 at 9:55 AM December 15, 2012                We have a pattern of gun violence. We have been having this pattern for too long. We must all agree to stricker gun sales and ownership. The natural right to live of themasses outweight the rights of the few.ew_ew_ew at 9:42 AM December 15, 2012                This could have been a terrorist attack. Same victims, same dastardly act, same guns, but no one would be calling for gun control. Not even liberals. Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
