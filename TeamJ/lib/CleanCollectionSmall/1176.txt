If these people can get help before they spiral out of control, maybe we wouldn't have these senseless mass murders.We also need to be able to force someone to do a mental evaluation or talk to someone. The really crazy people, don't know they are crazy. They will never get help because they believe nothing is wrong with them. But most have families and friends who know the truth.I have personal experience with this. It's impossible to commit someone, get a mental evaluation or do anything to help them if they don't want help or believe they need help.My dad was mentally ill, there is an increased risk for children to develop the same illness.I already told the rest of my family, if I go crazy like my Dad, put a bullet in my head, don't think twice about it.What he dealt with was horrible, what we dealt with was just as bad. We tried to get him help, we called the state, the hospital, spoke to psychiatrists and psychologists. "They couldn't do anything". That's what we were told. Nothing could be done if he didn't want help or admitting to hearing voices, seeing lasers, etc.He got worse over time. At one point, he started boiling water in the microwave. Claiming it was killing someone. He would take a laser pointer and run it up and down his head, did the same thing with a  flashlight. Then he go outside and shine it at something. He took coax cable and put it in ice, saying they were recording him.I'm glad that he didn't hurt anyone, but he could have. He was fixated on our old neighbors, who he had believed they were the ones doing this too him, talking to him. At times they were friends, sometimes they were enemies. He fired a gun in the house at the floor, we got rid of the gun.People want to focus on gun laws, we should focus on mental health laws.How many times do we see some crazy person rambling on the internet? We see it all the time, but we dismiss it. We ignore it. We want to believe they are just trolling or playing around.We can be blind to our own family.There is a difference between non-violent crazy and violent crazy. They both need help and attention.I wouldn't be surprised if this guy told someone like his mom his thoughts. I doubt he would tell her his plan, but I bet there were plenty of signs that were ignored.I would see a psychiatrist if it was free or affordable for me. My whole family could use therapy, I want it but it's not affordable.TL;DR Guns are only 1/2 the problem. We continue to ignore mental health laws. We need better healthcare, we need cheap and free ways for people to get help and speak to a mental health professional. We need an easier way to get people who don't want help, some help.permalinksave[+]boxerhound 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]boxerhound 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours agoForcing someone to see a doctor because you believe they are crazy because of what they say is NOT the answer.  Besides the obvious first amendment issues here, it's wrong.  Also, if you dad was a danger to himself or others they CAN put him in observation on a unit for 72 hours.  I forget what it's called but, it's perfectly legal and you don't need a warrant to do it.  Your MOTHER is the one you should be pissed at because she had all the power to have him hauled in and didn't use it.  permalinksaveparent[+]soothfast 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]soothfast 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoTotally agree with you.  Knee jerk "ban guns" isn't the whole problem here, it all goes much deeper and mental health issues are another key factor in all these incidents as far as I can tell.   Each and every time the individual/s who carry out these atrocities are not well.  Not excusing them (not AT ALL) but it is a truth: they are all deeply disturbed individuals.  The fact they have access to weapons just adds to the deadly mix.   No doubt in my mind there needs to be restrictions/bans on semi automatic weapons but also there needs to be something done in the area of mental health support services.  permalinksaveparent[+]davesidious 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]davesidious 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoHealthcare in the US will not make sense for generations to come.
