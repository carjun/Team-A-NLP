Disagreement is fine, but try to add a contesting point for debate and discussion.Read the FAQSteam Groupvirtuous_d's comprehensive guide to improving your TF2 experienceHelpful Submissions and Links for All ClassesEvents CalendarThanks to Klanana for our new community logo!created by TarabukkaMedic, creator of this suba community for 1 yearSubmit a linkto anything interesting: news article, blog entry, video, picture...message the moderatorsMODERATORSTarabukkaMedic, creator of this subDavidmooseUGC AdminbamfusernamePyro Novelist1131415New unlocks possibly in ETF2L Season 14 (self.truetf2)submitted 3 hours ago by DavidTheWin6v6 Div6 EU Demo19 commentssharecancelloading...2Unlocks banned/allowed on a game-by-game basis instead of league-wide.
