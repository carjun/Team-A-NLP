I like the web dev / enterprise stuff because development & testing seems to be a lot less "complicated". Of course hardware restrictions have to be considered, but it's not as fully dependent. In terms of my current company, I don't know if I could get that excited about maintaining FW on a RF dimmer.DevBootcamp looks amazing btw. I wish I would have known about this while I was looking for a job.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

He managed to fend them off. That was enough to not watch the show. But this is because I like watching shows that could happen.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I would have realized I really do not enjoy electrical engineering as much as programming, and/or been making a lot more money right now.My best bet might be to get a Master in CS, and then apply for internships after my first or second semester. Even though I know have the mind for solving programming problem, I feel like companies will still be hesitant to hire me for a full-time position because I don't have real-world programming experience.I could try to get involved with FW at the company I'm currently at, but I honestly don't know if I want to deal with crappy hardware tools.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy friend has slept with her Raggedy Ann doll every night for the past 22 years.  by  grantevin  WTF[+]Kreeker 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago*(0 children)[]Kreeker 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago*"small holes in critical places" Did you sodomize this innocent bear?

I've started going through python and ruby with code academy, but I feel like I'm wasting my time because it all seems to be stuff I already know. I took a bunch of programming classes in HS but didn't major in CS because I was stupid.Right now I working as a quality engineer for an av & automation company, specifically relating to our lighting division. There is no true programming with this job, other than some simple logic with our proprietary software for creating control programs. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow many of you are doing what you WANTED to do?  by  jobbbingin  jobs[+]Kreeker 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]Kreeker 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoMy plan A was to work in the defense industry as a hardware engineer. I obtained 0 internships during college because I liked my non-engineering job. When I graduated with a 3.8 gpa, I stated applying to defense contractors, and now one responded to my applications. A year after graduating I was contacted by a a/v & automation company for a Quality engineering position. I ended up taking the job and have been work there for 6 months. Although I enjoy working with my coworkers, the job is usually boring, and not very rewarding. My true passion since high school has been programming. I did not major in CS because I foolishly listened to people who said there were no jobs in this field. Anyway, I have just started slowing refreshing myself on programming fundamentals in the past month, and plan to really build up knowledge in the coming months. My goal is to work at Google within a few years. I'm actually pretty excited! permalinksavecontextfull comments17 y/o Boy with Months left to live, writes and records a song to say goodbye to his family  by  Garret_AJin  videos[+]Kreeker 1 point2 points3 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]Kreeker 1 point2 points3 points 14 hours agoI'm 23 and I don't think I would be able to handle being told I only had a few months to live.. permalinksavecontextfull commentsJava Beginners Course, Making a 3D Game, Minecraft 2D Tutorials, Tower Defence Tutorials!  by  ulixavain  learnprogramming[+]Kreeker 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]Kreeker 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoThanks for this!

There is never a mention that Doyle was instructed to do so via Nucky or his Brother. However, I still think my suspicion could be wrong, because there is also no mention of Nucky wondering how Rothstein even found out about Overholt.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
