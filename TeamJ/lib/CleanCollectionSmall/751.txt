Not unless the $100 bill you handed me was counterfeit.It was just sitting in my wallet for perpetuity it did indeed stimulate the economy.As soon as the money is taxed, it loses its stimulative effect, yes. So long as its in circulation, its stimulative.Thanks for proving that this statement:of that $320B has been repaid, you can really only count $70B loss as "stimulative spending"was complete bullshit.  You don't need stimulus after the recovery, you need it during the downturn.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust bought my first house with ridiculously low mortgage interest rate. Pay it off or invest?  by  ChronoGNin  personalfinance[+]EventualCyborg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoTax liability is going to be the same no matter what regarding your investment return (ceteris paribus).  What does change is your tax liability regarding mortgage interest deduction (however small).permalinksavecontextfull commentsLost Decade Watch  by  spaceghotiin  Economics[+]EventualCyborg -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoStimulating domestic consumer demand doesn't take jobs from other countries.How does a non-stimulative economic policy "take jobs from other countries"?permalinksavecontextfull commentsLost Decade Watch  by  spaceghotiin  Economics[+]EventualCyborg 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoIf you're short on your rent and I give you $100 and you pay me back that $100 in a year, did I not provide you with aid?  Repayment out of future surpluses doesn't negate the stimulative effect.By your reasoning, we didn't have any stimulative spending as that money will, eventually, be taxed and returned to government coffers.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLost Decade Watch  by  spaceghotiin  Economics[+]EventualCyborg 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoYou forgot about TARP, that little $700B stimulus bill signed by GWB. And the bailouts.  And Cash for Clunkers.  And several other stimulus packages.  ARRA wasn't the only stimulus package.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLost Decade Watch  by  spaceghotiin  Economics[+]EventualCyborg 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoTurkey is also an emerging market economy (who, by the way, has a GDP of nearly $700B, not $300B), which helped buoy their recovery, pressure that a developed nation isn't fortunate enough to have available.  You still haven't answered my question - where's the math that satiates that discrepancy?  How much stimulus need we pump into the economy before Dr. Krugman deems it acceptable?  20% of GDP?  50%? 100%?  permalinksavecontextfull commentsLost Decade Watch  by  spaceghotiin  Economics[+]EventualCyborg 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoThose numbers are budget deficits as a percentage of GDP.

You can just deposit the money in the new year.  You'll pay taxes on it this year, but it'll be deducted from your taxable income next year, so as long as you stay in the same marginal tax bracket, you'll come out even.permalinksavecontextfull commentsManaging Finances as a Married Couple  by  photosciin  personalfinance[+]EventualCyborg 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 5 points6 points7 points 2 days agoWe've been married 4.5 years and this is also the way we do it.  Any purchase over $100 is discussed beforehand (besides things like groceries), and we reach an agreement.  Neither of us are compulsive spenders, though, and our tastes for luxuries is low enough that we live well within our means without laying out too detailed of a budget.permalinksavecontextfull commentsChristmas bonus, deposit to old 401K account?  by  snakattakin  personalfinance[+]EventualCyborg 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 5 points6 points7 points 2 days agoYour IRA and Roth IRA share the contribution limit, so you cannot put any more money into your Traditional IRA tax-free if you already contribute $5k to you Roth.  http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000230988permalinksavecontextfull comments[ProTip] You are probably calculating cost of living vs salary differences incorrectly.  by  Cheesejaguarin  personalfinance[+]EventualCyborg 12 points13 points14 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 12 points13 points14 points 2 days agoWord to others: Your free time is just as valuable as your working time.From an economics perspective, it's actually more valuable.  If you valued your hourly compensation more than your free time, you would spend your free time engaging in economic pursuits in your career instead of whatever else you spend your time doing.  Instead, nearly everyone puts in some standard and personally acceptable amount of hours at work and "clocks out".permalinksavecontextfull comments[ProTip] You are probably calculating cost of living vs salary differences incorrectly.  by  Cheesejaguarin  personalfinance[+]EventualCyborg 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]EventualCyborg 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoThere is always risk. You can't escape it.You can mitigate it with diversification...Your results may vary, though.  As a Mechanical Engineer, my pay doesn't change much no matter where I live.

We announced #2's impending entry into our lives during my wife's birthday dinner with all the parents by dressing up our daughter in one of those "I'm going to be a BIG SISTER!" shirts.She ran around in the damned thing for 45 minutes without anyone noticing a thing.  When we finally sat down for dinner and my mother-in-law covered up the shirt with her bib, I had to speak up and ask them to look at what was written on the shirt...  _permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
