This includes image macros, comics, info-graphics and most diagrams. Text (e.g. a URL) serving to credit the original author is exempt.No gore or porn. NSFW content must be tagged.No personal information. This includes anything hosted on Facebook's servers, as they can be traced to the original account holder. Stalking & harassment will not be tolerated.No solicitation of votes (including "cake day" posts), posts with their sole purpose being to communicate with another redditor, or [FIXED] posts. DAE posts go in /r/DoesAnybodyElse. "Fixed" posts should be added as a comment to the original image.Submissions must link directly to a specific image file or to an image hosting website with minimal ads. We do not allow blog hosting of images ("blogspam"), but links to albums on image hosting websites are okay. URL shorteners are prohibited.No animated images. Please submit them to /r/gif, /r/gifs, or /r/reactiongifs instead.If your submission appears to be filtered but definitely meets the above rules, please send us a message with a link to the comments section of your post (not a direct link to the image). Don't delete it  as that just makes the filter hate you! If you come across any rule violations,  please report the submission or  message the mods and one of us will remove it!Please also try to come up with original post titles. Submissions that use certain clichs/memes will be automatically tagged with a warning.LinksIf your post doesn't meet the above rules, consider submitting it on one of these other subreddits:Comics/r/comics/r/webcomics/r/vertical/r/f7u12/r/ragenovels/r/AdviceAtheists/r/comicbookartImage macrosScreenshots/text/r/lolcats/r/screenshots/r/AdviceAnimals/r/desktops/r/Demotivational/r/facepalm (Facebook)/r/reactiongifs/r/DesktopDetectiveWallpaperAnimals/r/wallpaper/r/aww/r/wallpapers/r/catsThe SFWPorn Network/r/TrollingAnimals/r/deadpets/r/birdpics/r/foxesPhotographyUn-moderated pics/r/photography/r/AnythingGoesPics/r/photocritique/r/images/r/HDR/r/windowshots/r/PictureChallengeMiscNew reddits/r/misc/r/britpics/r/gifsImaginary Network/r/dataisbeautiful/r/thennnow/r/picrequests/r/SpecArt/r/doodles/r/IncredibleIndia ./r/timelinecovers/r/MemesIRL/r/OldSchoolCool/r/photoshopbattles/r/PastAndPresentPicsAlso check out http://irc.reddit.coma community for 4 yearsSubmit a linkto anything interesting: news article, blog entry, video, picture...message the moderatorsMODERATORSResilienceqgyh2krispykrackersBritishEnglishPolicemaxwellhillmastaandrewsmith1986Tbluejamt9000nullren...and 13 more 1000Well this is what consumed the first 10 minutes of work today [FIXED] (reddit.com)submitted 10 months ago by timeywhimey3 commentssharecancelsorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onloading...all 3 commentssorted by: bestbesttopnewhotcontroversialold[+]Hedges1 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago (0 children)[]Hedges1 0 points1 point2 points 9 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onFukin asom daypermalinksave[+]tjf0114 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago (0 children)[]tjf0114 0 points1 point2 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onreddit!permalinksave[+]Nicoletai0223 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]Nicoletai0223 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago????permalinksaveaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
