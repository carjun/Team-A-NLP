Then again, I'm no psychologist, but maybe if he knew the guy who cut into his back wouldn't be around to hurt him any more it may be slightly comforting.

Regardless of whether he signed the order or not, it was still said. He also said: "we will try to maintain as much flexibility as possible to accommodate the federal government's position on the amendment." And exactly what does the federal government still classify marijuana as? A schedule 1 narcotic. I would assume that accommodating the federal government means letting them just walk on in and start arresting people. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMarijuana officially legal in Colorado with stroke of governor's pen  by  jhenryf626in  news[+]dAtRhythmHawk 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]dAtRhythmHawk 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoEven so, it's not like kids dont smoke cigarettes or alcohol.

Im sick of this fucking bullshit. Over half of Colorado has voted for legalization of marijuana, yet, we still have the federal government saying no.
