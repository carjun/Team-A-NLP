If this Christian is to be believed then, yes, the gunman was just following orders and would be assured a golden throne. I have no problem with those who are religious, seeking comfort from their god. I do have a problem, however with blatant stupidity.permalinksavecontextfull comments"GOD must have needed 26 angels in heaven today!!!" -- inane comment about the horrific events, yesterday.  by  DumbledoresAtheistin  atheism[+]DumbledoresAtheist[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoArticle If you scroll to the comments, you'll see it's the first.

I would find absolutely no comfort in thinking that "god" sent a crazed gun toting madman to kill kindergartners, execution style, just because he wanted company on his cloud. permalinksavecontextfull comments4001"GOD must have needed 26 angels in heaven today!!!" -- inane comment about the horrific events, yesterday.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]DumbledoresAtheist 10 points11 points12 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 10 points11 points12 points 19 hours agoMy 7 year old and 11 year old just got home from school. I can't tell you the relief I felt just hearing their voices outside the door. My heart is breaking for those poor parents and family members and the entire community. I'm thankful beyond reason that my precious boys are safely home. Parents, hug your kids, kiss them, never stop telling them how important they are, how much you love them. Cherish every single second. ETA: I missed a word.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom. At least 27 dead, 14 children.  by  EthicalReasoningin  politics[+]DumbledoresAtheist 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours agoThe only concern my 7 year old had this morning before he went to school was whether he should wear his Santa hat. Nowhere in his mind would he ever think he wouldn't be safe at school, or even think about it at all. Those little kids, all of them, woke up, just like my boys, ate breakfast, got dressed and ready for a fun school day, probably making Christmas crafts as presents for mom and dad, listening to stories about Santa Claus, cookies and beautiful snowy fields with reindeer. Their parents sent their little ones on their way, never ever even thinking that something like this was remotely possible. I can't wait for my boys to get home. I'm going to hug and kiss them and never let go.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

I won't because I don't want to freak them out. Once they get home, however, I am going to hug them as tightly as I can, tell them how important they are and how much I love them and never take another second with them for granted. Time to bake, play Monopoly for hours, listen to music, dance around, be silly and enjoy them to the fullest extent possible.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoHa!

This is a tough, multi-layered, complicated subject but, if you and I can find common ground after all our backing and forthing, perhaps it's a sign of understanding and mutual acceptance from either culture.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months agoLook, I understand that this an emotionally charged issue for you and of course I can empathize. I also appreciate your question of how many Muslims do I know. I became very close to a dear man I had the pleasure to work with at a falafel joint in Santa Cruz, CA. He was Syrian, his uncle owned the restaurant. He told me of the many horrors happening in his home country and the pain he suffered in leaving his pregnant wife behind to make a decent living for them.Nearly every cent he made, he sent back to her. He confided in me his concern in raising his child in such a stifling society. He wanted his baby to be raised with freedoms, not religious indoctrination and controlled by fear and intolerance. Never once did my friend blame the west. He knew that the heart of oppression laid in those who granted themselves power. He, by the way, is only one example. I lived in a Muslim community in San Diego and loved my neighbors dearly.Also, when we lived in Austria, our kindest neighbors were a family of Turks. We frequently dined with them, our children played together, we shared our cultures and became fast friends.Next time, please, don't be so presumptuous.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat were the top 5 defining albums of your early teen years?  by  LifeFantasticin  Music[+]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoAgreed. Roger Waters' lyrical genius is second to none on this album.  I know "The Wall" completely overshadows it (and I do love "The Wall") but I really connected with "The Final Cut".  When it comes to Floyd, Rush, Queen, though, it's insanely difficult to chose one album over another. As I said, each band's catalogue was the soundtrack of my youth and throughout my adulthood.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat were the top 5 defining albums of your early teen years?  by  LifeFantasticin  Music[+]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoQueenQueen II2112 -- RushMeddle -- Pink FloydThe Final Cut -- Pink FloydI mentioned 2 Queen albums but their entire catalogue had a very important place in my heart and musical development as well as Rush & Pink Floyd but these were the top 5, at the time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago*(0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago*Umm, your scenario holds no water.  Under our occupation, they are free to practice whatever religion they want and hold elections.  Yes, I do think we should get out of Afghanistan, I don't believe we should police the world. However, they are under terrible oppression and, while it may seem fine and dandy to you, there are actually many Muslim men and women who do not want to live under Shari'a law. It's a complicated mess but you can't tell me the majority of educated Muslims believe radical Islam is correct. Quite frankly, I think your overactive imagination and desire to appear oh-so fucking politically correct has clouded your perception and veiled the truth.Again, western views did not create radical Islam. It was born to dehumanize, gain control and create power for misogynist, racist, backwards men.ETA: In proclaiming that it's Western viewpoints that started this violence and disgusting behavior, justifying it by grasping at the blame straws, you are as ignorant as the Imams using their people as puppets to create some dastardly radical Islamic utopia where only THEY have the right to speak.Also, keep in mind that the powers that be enforcing their radical beliefs need a scapegoat in order to attain more power over their countrymen. The western world is the scapegoat, our sex, free women, free thought, freedom of religion, music and education can all be made to seem evil, especially if someone wants to instill patriotism in order to control. Instead of rallying against their oppressors, they can rally against an imaginary enemy -- the western world.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoOk, so radical Islam forbids homosexuality, freedom of religion, women's rights, any music that is not religious, alcohol, co-ed parties, books and education outside of the doctrine because of the Western world imposing our views? Um, sorry, but radicals are just that for one purpose: Control.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months agoI absolutely appreciate that. Sadly, it seems, radical Islam does not share your views. I dislike religion as a whole but I appreciate intelligent debate. What's going on here seems to be heavy, oppressive indoctrination leading to panic and outrage. Education will squash such extremism. And, just to make myself clear, I believe that to be true of any religion, taken to radical beliefs.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months agoRight. Education is the key but how to tear down such an oppressive belief system and allow that education and enlightenment to flourish? It's far too complicated, the indoctrination so severely inflicted, I see no way out. The west will always, then, be an enemy to the Middle-East - even if we leave Radical Islam to its own devices and hightail it outta there.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoAlso, why did the movie make you see "red"? If you are strong in your faith, a crappy movie should not affect you one bit. permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months agoThank you for clearing that up. Sorry I misinterpreted. I see a lot of sarcasm and apologists. Nothing anyone can say can make me believe this madness is justified. Radical Islam needs to be abolished, forward thinking and education need to be upheld. Sadly, radical Islam, of course, does not allow any dissent and, through that, remains in power.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 1 point2 points3 points 3 months agoSo you feel this murdering and violence is justified? I do agree that countries who seem to enjoy living in oppression should be left to their own devices but I honestly believe radical Islam will only be appeased once the entire world lives under that same oppression. permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoI'm sorry.

Why get so embroiled over a stupid invisible sky god? Religion is the bane of the human race. It's the biggest cause for ignorance, the great divider, giving those who follow an "us and them" mentality. Have your faith, have your freedom to choose your faith but give me my right to think your faith is ridiculous.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtesters try to storm German, British embassies in Sudan  by  phondin  worldnews[+]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]DumbledoresAtheist 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoMuslims incited riots and murder over a cartoon.

The rioters are full of hate. The "peaceful" religion is full of hate. They have declared war by attacking embassies over a fucking bullshit movie. They have killed journalists for far lesser reasons. Lets call a spade a spade and stop trying to justify this horrific behavior.
