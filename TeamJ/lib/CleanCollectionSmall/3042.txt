Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes ago (0 children)[]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes agoI would love closure as well, but we have proved time and time again that  we cannot handle the media's attention on these kind of things. We have reporters asking kids horribly detailed questions, people wanting to see the shooter so they can make him famous for what he has done and then we have people arguing over gun laws. I just want to be able to hear the story, grieve for the families and when the time is right, be able to figure out to never allow this to happen again. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Not because he "deserved to", but at least he won't be able to absorb the media attention he doesn't fucking deserve. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI..don't know which subreddit this belongs in  by  h37s3min  breakingbad[+]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoSorry, it has already been posted and is on the front page.Cool clip though. permalinksavecontextfull comments6234I got a free cookie today at work (self.notinteresting)submitted 23 hours ago by TheDudePenguin to notinteresting1 commentsharecancelloading...(19/m)I don't know how to express my feelings to her  by  Yatagasaruin  relationship_advice[+]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoWhat kind of hints?

Because if if you are just friends, something still can happen to cause you to become less close. Just because you try to make a relationship work doesn't mean anything. But hey, if he doesn't want to, there is no reason to force him. I am very glad you took the risk. You just need to do your best to respect his boundaries and try to avoid thinking of him anymore. It is pretty impossible to do, but hopefully it will happen with time. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMe[18/m] and my girlfriend[17] are having issues  by  Trashaccounttin  relationship_advice[+]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoIf that is your gut feeling, then you may be. Give it some time, you may feel more okay toward her "annoyances" before you know it. But if she is only growing further away from you, that is when you should worry. permalinksavecontextfull comments(20/f) in a difficult marriage with (26/f), now dealing with attraction to (36/m).

It seems she will be a hard nut to crack, but you ever get her to go to counseling, she might change her ways.

When you ask your girlfriend what's so bad about texting or seeing F, is she normally defensive or offensive? Is there any key thing she always jumped to? My friend used to have issues hanging out with a old friend because her new girlfriend viewed her as a "slut". That kind of offensive shit is normally a red flag. Especially when the friend is a good person. permalinksavecontextfull comments(20/f) in a difficult marriage with (26/f), now dealing with attraction to (36/m).

When did that happen? I am very happy you tried to your part, but she has to the same. Do you feel like you are always the one blamed? That would explain it even more that you would be attracted to someone who doesn't blame you for being who you are :/ And no problem! I am here to help. permalinksavecontextfull comments[f18] My boyfriend [m18] is clingy and we disagree about things with sex. Advice?  by  Oulin  relationship_advice[+]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]TheDudePenguin 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoGood luck! Quiet people tend to spend more time thinking then the more social ones. ;D As long as he understands everything is for good intentions, he should be happy to explain to you what bothers him and how to fix it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy[20f] bf[24m] is confusing the hell out of me. Is it time to end it?  by  freshman30in  relationship_advice[+]TheDudePenguin 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]TheDudePenguin 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI understand your intentions and they are very sincere. But she loves you. You have understand she will break down and be upset when "best for my future plans" doesn't include her. You seem like a much more logical lover than her, and you have remember how she will approach this differently. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy[20f] bf[24m] is confusing the hell out of me.

I did not know you planned on leaving her from the beginning, if it was better for you. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy[20f] bf[24m] is confusing the hell out of me. Is it time to end it?  by  freshman30in  relationship_advice[+]TheDudePenguin 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]TheDudePenguin 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoAre you the boyfriend? She cares deeply about you, that's why she broke down everytime you showed that her. Did you expect her to be okay with you breaking up with you after being around you for so long? She is a young girl in her first relationship. Please decide what is important in your life. Do not keep her just because you want an "experience" with her. She loves you more than that. She cannot even imagine a world without you. I am sorry she didn't listen to you when you explained it to her, but you should have broken up with her if she views the relationship differently. Don't be nice to her and stay together just because you can. permalinksavecontextfull comments(20/f) in a difficult marriage with (26/f), now dealing with attraction to (36/m).
