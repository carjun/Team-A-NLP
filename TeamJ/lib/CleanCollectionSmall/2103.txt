Those poor children. Can you even imagine the horror that the teacher experienced, knowing what was happening?*Edit: They just interviewed a child (awful! why would they do that right now!?) who said they thought the gunshots was the sound of the custodian banging on something. I can't even imagine being a child and having NO IDEA what a gunshot sounds like... then just hearing hundreds of them. permalinksaveparent[+]happypolychaetes 201 points202 points203 points 23 hours ago (7 children)[]happypolychaetes 201 points202 points203 points 23 hours agoThat teacher is a goddamn hero. Such quick thinking under horrific circumstances.permalinksaveparent[+]jeremy203 24 points25 points26 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]jeremy203 24 points25 points26 points 21 hours agoEvery time I read about school shootings there always seems to be teachers being heroes. It's amazing how they act to protect the kids, even giving their lives for them sometimes..permalinksaveparent[+]emskem 22 points23 points24 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]emskem 22 points23 points24 points 21 hours agoTeaching a calling. The same type of person who works for shit pay to see a child succeed understands what might be asked of them everytime you practice this drill. permalinksaveparent[+]Inquisitive_Ender 16 points17 points18 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]Inquisitive_Ender 16 points17 points18 points 22 hours agoIt's drilled into our brains. After Columbine we started having "Mr. Red" drills twice a year every year just in case something like this happened at my school. It's horrible that she had to take action like this, but thankfully she was able to think and act that quickly to save more lives.permalinksaveparent[+]ProsithiusErvingMott 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (1 child)[]ProsithiusErvingMott 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoTell us more about "Mr. Red".permalinksaveparent[+]Inquisitive_Ender 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]Inquisitive_Ender 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoIt's just a generic code-name used for an intruder in the building. If there's time, an announcement will come over the loud speaker saying "Mr. Red is in the building" which means stop whatever you're doing, lock the door, turn out the lights and get your kids out of sight and far away from the door.If there's not enough time, aka someone just walks in and immediately starts shooting then it's more of a free for all to just react and lock yourself in.permalinksaveparent[+]Jasonrj 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (1 child)[]Jasonrj 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoThis teacher probably had a plan (my assumption). Maybe not, but I'll use it as an opportunity to say everyone should have such a plan. Escape routes, safe rooms, etc. for all your regular work places, homes, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]happypolychaetes 3 points4 points5 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]happypolychaetes 3 points4 points5 points 15 hours agoYeah they probably did. Still, having a plan and actually following through on a plan while in the middle of a crisis are two different things.permalinksaveparent[+]wishyouwerebeer 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (18 children)[]wishyouwerebeer 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoAs a child this was always my worst fear.  permalinksaveparent[+]KidCadaver 16 points17 points18 points 23 hours ago (8 children)[]KidCadaver 16 points17 points18 points 23 hours agoSame. I was just talking with a friend about the day they put up black paper on the door-windows of our middle school classrooms. It was right after Columbine. We then had monthly "lock-down" drills. Every time, I would imagine what it was like to die like that. I would always think "black paper and a locked door isn't going to stop someone if they want in."permalinksaveparent[+]Silver_kitty 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]Silver_kitty 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours agoWhen I was in elementary we had 5 or 6 legitimate "lockdown code red" moments. (Usually someone running from police was taking refuge in our school.) No one was ever injured during them, but I definitely had similar ideas. The person isn't going to be fooled that the classrooms are empty by hiding in the corners of our classrooms.permalinksaveparent[+]dslyecix 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]dslyecix 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours agoNo, but it stops them from shooting at you without getting in first.  It also stops them from knowing exactly how many people are in which rooms.permalinksaveparent[+]KidCadaver 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]KidCadaver 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoMy reasoning, when I was a kid, was that someone who was going to shoot up our school would probably be attending that school. Therefore, they would have a good idea about what corner the kids were hiding it and what classes were full at which time of day. I don't know - I had morbid thoughts about how I'd die when I was a kid :-\permalinksaveparent[+]synaesthetist 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours ago (3 children)[]synaesthetist 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours agoTeacher here. As the authority figure being asked to run lockdown drills in my classroom, I've made sure to always answer kid's questions about them as logically and simply as I can. To be honest, the best answer I've been able to come up with after three years is "It's basic duck and cover. We're not disappearing into thin air, but we're minimizing the target if someone was to come in. Basically we're buying time for the first responders to take down the shooter."I save the last sentence for the middle schoolers. Other than that, it's what I told all the kids who asked from K-8. If an older kid keeps up with it, I point out that the school needs to have some kind of policy to deal with an impossible situation, even if it's only helping a little.permalinksaveparent[+]KidCadaver 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (1 child)[]KidCadaver 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours agoThis is a good reply. When I was middle school-age (about 13 or 14 years ago? Geeze...) no one really talked about it. No teachers briefed us on what happened. Our parents assumed that responsibility. But, when we had lockdowns in school, we'd just be told "lockdown drill, get into the corner on the same wall the door is on so the window is facing away from you, put your hands over your heads and stay completely silent until an authority figure unlocks the door and comes in."So we'd sit in silence. That's when I'd start wondering how easy of a target I was and what it might feel like to be shot.permalinksaveparent[+]synaesthetist 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]synaesthetist 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoYeah, I had the same experiences as a kid which lead to me being a bit more vocal/honest as a teacher. I also worked in a school district where kids barely spent time with their parents, so it became more necessary to be honest with them as no one else would explain things. We would often joke that the district should have parenting classes as professional development.The flip side is that parents are so uninvolved that if you overstepped your boundaries, they never bothered to contact the school to complain. I'm pretty much a straight shooter when it comes to kids and they tend to respect that. I understand districts where teachers might need to be more careful when considering job security, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]corcyra 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (0 children)[]corcyra 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoGood for you! I believe adults should always tell the truth to children and explain what is happening, what is being done, and why, as simply as possible. It's the best remedy for fear and their best protection during emergencies of any kind because - among other things - it might help them protect themselves.permalinksaveparent[+]emmeline_grangerford 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]emmeline_grangerford 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours agoI'm guessing that I may be a few years older than you (I was a sophomore in high school when Columbine occurred) and your post and the ones that follow make me really sad. A lot of things scared me growing up, but the possibility that my school would be the scene of a mass shooting wasn't one of them. It just seems so wrong and sad to think about little kids being scared about their safety while in school. I'm sorry that was something that you had to spend your childhood worrying about. permalinksaveparent[+]windsostrange 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (6 children)[]windsostrange 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoAs a child this never even crossed my fucking mind./Canadian from the 80spermalinksaveparent[+]World-is-a-Vampire 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]World-is-a-Vampire 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoI started kindergarten in 1990 in the US (Arizona, specifically. Gun haven.) and it never crossed my mind either. I was more worried about a tornado ripping through the school, because, while they're extremely rare here, they're more common than school shootings.permalinksaveparent[+]antimushroom 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours ago (1 child)[]antimushroom 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours agoWas it absolutely necessary to make this comment? I'm not going to downvote you and I don't want to single you out specifically. There's just a lot of these comments about "Well I'm not American and blah blah blah..." today. Not disputing there may be a point, but it's sort of salting the wound and I guess I don't see the point.permalinksaveparent[+]frakking_you 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]frakking_you 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agobecause the above comments suggest the opposite. therefore presenting a counterpoint is a valid part of the discussion.clearly there has been a shift in what middleschoolersk-8's concern themselves with. however, even if they're drilling for shootings these days, I doubt many kids past or present really let it cross their minds that often. lots of kids drill for fire, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc. but you don't hear many children claim being whirled into the sky and impaled by shrapnel as their worst fear, either. the point being, that claiming a mass shooting to be an ever present fear of going to school is more than likely an emotional response rather than recollection based in fact. permalinksaveparent[+]Dinewiz 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]Dinewiz 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoAs an English kids from the 90s, neither it cross mine.permalinksaveparent[+]Drag_king 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]Drag_king 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoIt still happend though. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacrepermalinksaveparent[+]Dinewiz 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Dinewiz 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoWow, I did not know that. permalinksaveparent[+]frakking_you 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]frakking_you 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agobullshit.you feared a 20 year-old lunatic spraying down your class as a child?as a child, you couldn't even conceive of what that meant or how something like this would transpire.as a teenager, you would have feared a peer much more than a random person, if at all, based on what would have been in your recent memory (columbine). and it would have been a completely irrational fear, speaking probabilistically. more than likely it was an uncommon thought, and only stands out in retrospect if it crossed your mind at all due to current events.I was in HS when columbine happened, and even then, it was such a shocking freak occurrence, rational people didn't think there would be an outbreak of the trench coat mafia in schools around the nation. permalinksaveparent[+]Demontaco 7 points8 points9 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Demontaco 7 points8 points9 points 23 hours agoI can't even begin to imagine how messed up those kids are gonna feel, dealing with this at such a young age. Its got to be traumatizing.permalinksaveparent[+]el_fuego91 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]el_fuego91 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoFuck I'm 21 and I don't even know what a gun shot sounds like in real life. permalinksaveparent[+]Aederrex 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]Aederrex 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours agoMost people have no idea what gunshots sound like in real life, not even adults. Hearing unexpected gunfire, even if you know it's the neighbors shooting at birds or gophers (I grew up on a farm, it was an almost daily occurrence) is a butt-puckering experience. permalinksaveparent[+]corcyra 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (0 children)[]corcyra 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoIn Switzerland - in the mountains - one can hear gunfire frequently when the military have their practice sessions. When they use machine guns, on the other hand...that's a really nasty sound. permalinksaveparent[+]routari 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]routari 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours agoWhy interview a child now?

Actually, it might have even been said in an interview! I'm sure a quick Google will help you find the quote.
