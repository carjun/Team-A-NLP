Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Liberator22 9 points10 points11 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Liberator22 9 points10 points11 points 23 hours agoI have some inside information on what went down in the school.  I live and go to school in the district and know the parent of a 3rd grader who goes to Sandy Hook.  The shooter was apparently with his mother who was a kindergarten teacher.  He killed her and killed some of the five year olds in the class. The second sick bastard I don't have much info on, but roomers around town say he/ she was dressed as a nun.  Some real The Town shit right there so I don't know how true it is. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Liberator22 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Liberator22 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoI live in that school district and go to the largest public school in the state.  I don't even know where to start when it comes to protecting schools from these sick minded murderers.  A good friend of mine has a sister who goes to Sandy Hook.  She is in third grade and heard the whole thing. What kind of person would subject such young children to such violence.  With over 600 kids; their lives may never be the same.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFeeling a little anti-pandora today  by  zachlee2in  AdviceAnimals[+]Liberator22 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]Liberator22 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoaddblockplus will get rid of the pop ups in pandora and youtubepermalinksavecontextfull commentsI think I found the perfect shirt.
