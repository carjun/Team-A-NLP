I know when we burieed my grand uncle there was a special funeral fund set aside by our tribal govt. that severely limited what they would pay for. It was I think about $1500. Even with his veterans death benefit from the military($200) the cost of his funeral was still over $2000. Total with everything was about $5000. Luckily he had prepaid so out of pocket for us it was a couple hundred. A few years ago there was a mall shooting in Salt Lake (Trolley Square Shooting). I do believe that friends and family had set up fundraising efforts for the families there too. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]foufymaus 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]foufymaus 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours agoI was thinking perhaps opening an account at a major bank with a local branch. I think uS bank has one there. Contact the branch manager tell him what's happening and why its opened. Have a local redditor and the manager contact area funeral homes I think there's only one there. Talk to the director there have him send bills to the bank. What need to be there is a trusted local liaison. To do the foot work between the bank and the funeral homes. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

But what do y'all think about establishing a fund at a local bank to help out with funeral costs. Because no parent should ever have to worry about burial costs especially in a situation like this so close to a major holiday. permalinksavecontextfull commentsRedditors who have legally died (heart attacks, etc.), what was it like?  by  Kmarteein  AskReddit[+]foufymaus 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]foufymaus 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoEar rocks suck! permalinksavecontextfull commentsRedditors who have legally died (heart attacks, etc.), what was it like?  by  Kmarteein  AskReddit[+]foufymaus 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]foufymaus 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoyes! vague description and a cookiepermalinksavecontextfull commentsRedditors who have legally died (heart attacks, etc.), what was it like?  by  Kmarteein  AskReddit[+]foufymaus 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]foufymaus 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoExactly!

I have been to a cardiologist and since my bp tends to run on the low normal side, I tend to have brief moments of syncopy (fainting). Definitely not liking the whole not good feeling parts. I faint usually if there's pain, like if I stub my toe or have monthly cramps sometimes it's caused by a change of position like from lying down to standing or from sitting to standing. Yup, fainting sucks and now I'm on a bp med tht help keeps me on an even keel. My average bp runs about 110/60 but last week when I had the flu it measured at 100/58 with a heartrate of 99. Tl;dr feels faint often because of low blood pressure. permalinksavecontextfull commentsUnique gift ideas to send my friend from Utah?  by  r4rthrowaway79in  Utah[+]foufymaus 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]foufymaus 1 point2 points3 points 13 days agoIn the Price museum they once sold a replica utah raptor clawpermalinksavecontextfull commentsUnique gift ideas to send my friend from Utah?  by  r4rthrowaway79in  Utah[+]foufymaus 2 points3 points4 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]foufymaus 2 points3 points4 points 13 days agoAt one time i saw a "petrified" snowball in a tourist shop.

The moment they were school aged they were taken away from their families and sent to boarding schools. Imagine you being six or seven years old and some white people come to your home and take you from your parents. If you're a parent imagine people taking your son or daughter away from you and you have no way of stopping them.
