Just wow.  by  Uncoolioin  standupshots[+]Sengura 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Sengura 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoBeing "productive" is more of a subjective matter. What do you consider being "productive"? Doing the laundry, taking out the trash, cleaning, writing a book, walking the dog, inventing the cure for cancer, volunteering at a kennel, making a chair, starting world war 2, mowing the lawn, getting a hard achievement in CoD, helping a woman with her groceries.Those can technically all be considered being productive. It's all a matter of what YOU think being productive is. To some, walking the dog and doing the laundry isn't really even on their radar because if they don't sign a treaty their country could go to war. For others getting that achievement doesn't matter because the lawn needs to be mowed, etc. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFish caught in fence during Hurricane Sandy  by  ccimsin  pics[+]Sengura 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Sengura 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoLet's count the fish!One.Two.Three.Four.Five.That's five fish!

If you go back far enough even people who made great impacts in society today (good or bad) like Einstein. Newton, Genghis, Hitler, Alexander etc will be forgotten eventually.What I'm trying to say is, do what makes you happy. Who gives a shit if others consider it a waste of time. Life is extremely short, enjoy it doing things that bring you happiness (so long as it's not at the expense of other people's happiness).permalinksavecontextfull commentsDefinitely didn't see that coming...  by  Phaque1285in  WTF[+]Sengura 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Sengura 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoIt looks like he's farming negative karma...

ANY gun of any kind wouldn't provide the necessary bullet velocity to penetrate something that is indestructible.Technically the bullet could be going at the speed of light and still not have the velocity to penetrate something that is impenetrable.

That may or may not be true (not going to argue unstoppable force vs. unmovable object), but no way will a standard .45 cartridge provide the appropriate bullet velocity for it to pierce through the Adamantium plating. The bullet would have simply bounced off the plating and both the plating and the bullet would be unscratched.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the biggest movie plot hole you have ever seen?  by  kickster777in  AskReddit[+]Sengura 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Sengura 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoAlso, they can't get through locked wooden basement doors.Apparently locked wooden doors are their achilles heel.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWalking into an empty classroom one morning, when...  by  whatthefuckmanseriouin  funny[+]Sengura 66 points67 points68 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]Sengura 66 points67 points68 points 2 days ago*The thing with college profs is that they aren't necessarily teachers by trade. They are usually established at their profession and come in later with an abundance of real life experience as well as book knowledge. They may be great at their trade, that doesn't necessarily mean they are great teachers. Just because someone is intelligent and know all there is to know about a subject, doesn't mean they automatically possess the ability to teach someone else. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
