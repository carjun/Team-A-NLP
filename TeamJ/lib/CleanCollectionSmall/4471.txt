Google News Blog: Aboutskip to main  |      skip to sidebarAbout11:58 AMAbout Google NewsGoogle News is a computer-generated news site that aggregates headlines from news sources worldwide, groups similar stories together and displays them according to each reader's personalized interests.Traditionally, news readers first pick a publication and then look for headlines that interest them. We do things a little differently, with the goal of offering our readers more personalized options and a wider variety of perspectives from which to choose. On Google News we offer links to several articles on every story, so you can first decide what subject interests you and then select which publishers accounts of each story youd like to read. Click on the headline that interests you and you'll go directly to the site which published that story.Our articles are selected and ranked by computers that evaluate, among other things, how often and on what sites a story appears online. We also rank based on certain characteristics of news content such as freshness, location, relevance and diversity. As a result, stories are sorted without regard to political viewpoint or ideology and you can choose from a wide variety of perspectives on any given story. We'll continue to improve Google News by adding sources, fine-tuning our technology and providing Google News to readers in evenmore regions.FeaturesPersonalized news:No one can read all the news thats published every day, so why not set up your page to show you the stories that best represent your interests?Learn more.Alerts:You can sign up to receive weekly, daily or as-it-happens email alerts on any topic that interests you.Learn more.News for your mobile phone:If you have a mobile data plan, you can access a special version of Google News right from your mobile phone.Learn more.Feeds:You can receive updates of various sections of Google News or Google News search results by subscribing to RSS or Atom feeds in your favorite feed reader.Learn more.News archive search:Search and explore information from historical archives dating back over 200 years.Learn more.More InformationLook for more information, find answers to your questions, and send us suggestions in ourHelp Centerpages.If you're a news publisher, look for answers to your questions and useful tools in our sectionHelp for Publishers.PermalinkLinks to this postHomeGoogle News Site FeedArchivesArchivesDecember 2012 (1)October 2012 (1)September 2012 (2)May 2012 (1)March 2012 (1)January 2012 (2)November 2011 (2)October 2011 (3)September 2011 (2)August 2011 (3)July 2011 (2)June 2011 (1)May 2011 (4)April 2011 (3)February 2011 (1)November 2010 (2)October 2010 (2)September 2010 (1)August 2010 (1)July 2010 (1)June 2010 (3)May 2010 (1)April 2010 (3)February 2010 (2)January 2010 (2)December 2009 (5)November 2009 (5)September 2009 (4)August 2009 (4)July 2009 (2)June 2009 (2)May 2009 (3)April 2009 (3)March 2009 (4)February 2009 (3)January 2009 (2)November 2008 (2)October 2008 (3)September 2008 (7)August 2008 (5)June 2008 (2)May 2008 (5)April 2008 (3)March 2008 (3)February 2008 (4)January 2008 (1)December 2007 (4)November 2007 (4)October 2007 (3)September 2007 (3)August 2007 (5)July 2007 (3)June 2007 (2)Subscribe to receive posts via emailEmail:Visit this groupPost Categoriesannouncements(30)currently in the news(13)features(43)help for publishers(21)languages and editions(13)looking backward(7)FollowersMore Blogs from GoogleVisit our  directory for more information about Google blogs.Recent posts from more Google blogsMore From GoogleGoogle NewsNews AlertsWeb AlertsSearchMore...We Love FeedbackTo discuss this blog please visit the Google News Help ForumGoogle Blog is powered by Blogger.
