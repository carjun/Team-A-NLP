How else are you suppose to move the weight without "squatting" it and NOT using your lower back with your hips higher?  by  Xenooin  Fitness[+]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago*(0 children)[]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago*I do the same thing but with 2 books. Haters gon hate, but in the end the height of the bar from the floor is arbitrary anyway.Edit: Ha. I just measured my discs and it seems they're 10cm smaller than they should be according to olympic standards. So actually with books I've been unknowingly using around the correct height. Maybe 5cm more or so.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMark Rippetoe and others say not to start too low on deadlifts so the exercise doesn't become a squat. How else are you suppose to move the weight without "squatting" it and NOT using your lower back with your hips higher?  by  Xenooin  Fitness[+]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes agoMy thighs are always parallel with the ground at the start of the deadlift. This is the only way I can keep a non arched lower back because I have short hamstrings. Is this wrong? Does it matter that much? My back is still obviously doing a lot of the work, I can tell. permalinksavecontextfull commentsUK Rejects Opt-out Porn Filter  by  malheureusementin  technology[+]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes agoThat's the same problem I have. I don't even look at porn on my phone lol. That's why I have a laptop with a decent sized screen. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFrankie Boyle donates 50,000 to help Guantanamo inmate sue MI6  by  eenieboyin  unitedkingdom[+]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes agoThe problem I had is that his Mock The Week material was exactly the same as his stand up shows material.

Makes no fucking sense. If I was gay I'd be happy to not be allowed to marry since there's the whole civil partnership which grants all the same rights anyway. Fuck your religious ceremony. permalinksavecontextfull commentsEgyptians Vote on Islamist-Backed Constitution - "At one point in our history, Cleopatra, a woman, ruled Egypt. Now you have a constitution that makes women not even 2nd-class but 3rd-class citizens. This constitution is tailored for one specific group (the Muslim Brotherhood). It's a shame."  by  anutensilin  worldnews[+]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWell the arab spring sure was a clusterfuck.

For the first 5 or so months SS/SL was good and I saw good gains. Since then I've just been trying all different routines until I find one I like and I can do consistently. permalinksavecontextfull commentsUK Rejects Opt-out Porn Filter  by  malheureusementin  technology[+]Frankeh 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoThis is extremely unsurprising. That said, my phone won't let me go on porn because it has an opt out filter that needs a credit card to be unlocked. I don't own a credit card.

Sarcasm usually means you're actually saying the opposite of what you're literally saying. So he was saying 'London isn't the only city in the UK' with his post. That reply doesn't make sense when the message he was replying to was:It's a shame that the other cities of the UK can't show as impressive a skyline as thatIt's off topic, if anything. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm from Newtown and I have something to say to the world.  by  Notmyrealredditsn1in  politics[+]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoThe USA needs its own leveson inquiry. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCity of London, 2007 vs 2012  by  brubeckin  unitedkingdom[+]Frankeh 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour agoThat's not what he said at all.

Made his excuses quickly to go to the bathroom then his bro came out of the bathroom fucked the chick for a bit and then they did the bathroom switch again. Pretty sure that was some rape, but as they say what they don't know doesn't hurt.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRear lat spread after 2 solid years if bodybuilding.  by  ellamasin  bodybuilding[+]Frankeh 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours agoOi mate, I checked my workings and it seems you're mad. permalinksavecontextfull commentsRear lat spread after 2 solid years if bodybuilding.  by  ellamasin  bodybuilding[+]Frankeh 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours agoloosepermalinksavecontextfull commentsIf I start off on mostly machine's will I still get stronger?  by  cma1993in  Fitness[+]Frankeh 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours agoTo be fair, are you sure you weren't just using the machines incorrectly. At the end of the day, resistance is resistance. There's differences in form on machines but it's probably not as big a deal as it's made out to be. Be honest, were you doing any kind of linear progression when using the machines? Probably not. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf I start off on mostly machine's will I still get stronger?  by  cma1993in  Fitness[+]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoJust start with the barbell on its own. It looks silly but when you're adding 2.5kg (5lb) per workout you soon get to a respectable non embarrassing weight.

It's because of the extreme amount of damage a bullet did. I'd rather not go into shock and feel the pain because at least that means there's likely less damage actually being done. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
