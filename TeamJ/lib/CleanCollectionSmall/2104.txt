I want to stay loyal in my marriage, but it feels so difficult [33M / 20F]  by  BigRed79in  relationships[+]happypolychaetes 81 points82 points83 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]happypolychaetes 81 points82 points83 points 1 day agoI didn't run off and cheat for no reasonno one put a gun to your head and forced you to cheat, dude. It was 100% your own fault. There may have been aspects of your relationship that made it easier for you to justify cheating, but in the end it was still your choice. I know it sucks to hear, but it's true.And I say this as someone who strayed in a previous relationship when things weren't going well. I tried to make excuses for myself for months, but the cold hard truth is that it was my fuckup and I needed to take some goddamn responsibility for my own actions. Realizing that was really hard. Probably the hardest thing I've ever done. That deep, visceral feeling of self loathing once you realize what you truly did is horrendous. But taking responsibility was what made it possible for me to start learning from my mistake and changing a lot of things about my thought processes and mindset on relationships.If you want this marriage to work, you must do this. You must realize that it was YOUR fault and it is YOUR problem to fix, not hers. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe downside of watching Game of Thrones Blu-Ray in glorious 1080p High Definition, is that you end up noticing things you're not supposed to notice, and that were not noticeable before.

Like, I love her natural eyebrows, but whatever they did to them in the show often looked really weird. It looked like they powdered them or something? It just made it really obvious that she was not a natural platinum blonde, and kept pulling me out of the immersion every time I saw them.I think they looked better in the first season actually. The second season they looked...grayish.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]happypolychaetes 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]happypolychaetes 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoSorry...I'm not a huge porn buff...

For some reason food descriptions in stories always provide a huge sense of realism that other descriptions don't.

If she can't function in school, she'll just fail and what's the point of wasting money and time doing that? I was in the same boat as OP (and you, apparently) two years ago. I dropped out. It was the best decision I ever made. My future isn't even remotely dark; on the contrary, being out of school made me able to take steps towards recovery. And I do have a job (not a shitty one either).Purely anecdotal, I know. But so is your comment, so I guess we cancel each other out. ;) OP needs to do what is best for her, and it sure as hell sounds like school is NOT that right now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm a chronically lonely, painfully shy, clinically depressed girl in college, and my depression is making it so I might flunk out of college just because I find it so difficult to keep going to my classes. Any advice?  by  shortbussin  TwoXChromosomes[+]happypolychaetes 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]happypolychaetes 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agofirst you sayno, it isn't a flaw in chemistryand then you sayPsychologists don't know what causes depressionSo...there could be a chemical component (and I am pretty convinced that there is). You're right that depression can be complicated, and is a hotly debated topic in the scientific world, but saying "no it's not a chemical problem" tends to reinforce the idea that depression is your own fault, that you're worthless because you can't make yourself feel better, etc. The chemistry in your brain is very, very complex and delicate, so it seems logical that if it gets messed up, it will negatively affect you, resulting in issues such as depression.There are things that help and work. There sure are, and medicine is one of those things. There isn't really a reason to discourage OP from seeking medical help.forgive me if I misunderstood your comment. I was depressed for years and antidepressants were what did the most to make me better, plus depression runs like crazy in my family, so I have a hard time believing there is no chemical component in depression for anyone ever.permalinksavecontextfull comments[ASOS](Artwork of the scene at the Twins)  by  blackjacksandhookersin  gameofthrones[+]happypolychaetes 44 points45 points46 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]happypolychaetes 44 points45 points46 points 2 days ago*ASOS:'(edit for spoiler tag just in casepermalinksavecontextfull commentsLeigh Butler's spoiler-free comments on AMoL  by  philosophyguruin  WoT[+]happypolychaetes 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]happypolychaetes 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoMy first thought was it had something to do with braid tugging, or folding arms under breasts, or some other endlessly repeated phrase throughout the series.
