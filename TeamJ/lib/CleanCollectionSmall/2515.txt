Much easier to "control" weapons. Not to mention their people are far more "peaceful" and law abiding than Americans. America has far more violent crime than any other country, be it shootings, rape, beatings, etc etc. It's not a gun issue, it's a people issue.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

When min wage jumps higher than inflation it causes artificial price increases. Study economics...minimum wage is largely political and has far less to do with economics.

They want their computer/phone/gps/whatever to turn on and work when the push the on switch. 90% of users don't upgrade software, don't add things on, don't need it to do certain things and have no problem with just buying the next Apple iOS or Microsoft licensed printer.

A lot of companies are trying to burn through as much "profit" as possible before the end of the year because of all the taxes coming through (here in the US) next year.

If you stop working and jump into school for two years you will have a big gap in work history. In my experience (having done exactly this) it made things much harder to get a job upon exiting school. Had I continued working and just climbed the ladder I would be in a better place than I am now. At some point, experience outweighs a degree. I would strongly encourage you to find work immediately. It's easier than saying "Well in my job two and a half years ago..." and trying to make that relevant to today. You are going to be a much more attractive applicant straight out of the .mil than you would after taking years off. As it was said in another post, educate on your own time/pace and good on ya if you find an employer that will fund said education.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI just heard someone call a samsang galaxy tab 7.7 an iPad knock off.

Seriously, we live in a computer based world and unless you're out picking lettuce or something you need to know more than "basic" computer skills. I run into the same problems at my place of work.
