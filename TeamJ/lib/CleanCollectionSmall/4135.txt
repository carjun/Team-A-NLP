The Bourne Legacy; Raoul Silva could be an Avenger; The Hunger Games's Katniss.There's a scene in Skyfall (don't worry, this is not a plot spoiler) in which a bunch of guys in a helicopter are approaching an isolated farmhouse. The helicopter has been fitted with loudspeakers, which are blasting this song: ''Boom, boom, boom, boom. Gonna shoot you right down.''The song was written and recorded in 1961 by  American bluesman John Lee Hooker, but instead of Hooker's version, the helicopter is playing a version recorded in 1964 by Eric Burdon and the Animals.Why wouldn't the filmmakers have used the original? Because the Animals are British (Eric was born in Newcastle upon Tyne) and Skyfall is, above all else, a promotional vehicle for everything British. When you see the film, you readily understand why the Queen agreed to promote it by doing her own skyfall into the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games.Skyfall has two messages: 1. British is best; and 2. Trust your secret services, because they know what you need. It's precisely the opposite of the message in the Jason Bourne movies, which is to follow your conscience and choose your friends carefully, because your government is lying to you.James Bond is powered by patriotism - unquestioning adherence to anything his bosses deem necessary to protect the realm. James may be a naughty boy, but in the end he does what mummy wants. At the heart of the movie is authoritarianism.Jason Bourne is powered by paranoia - deep suspicion that his bosses are torturing and killing their own citizens to conceal their overzealous incompetence. Bourne was trained to follow orders, but now he just wants to be left alone. At the heart of the series is individualism.If they existed in the same universe, James Bond would be sent to terminate Jason Bourne when the CIA tells MI6 he's gone rogue.The Bourne Legacy made $13 million at the Australian box office this year - a third of what Skyfall is likely to make. That might suggest audiences are more impressed by the authoritarian argument than by the individualist argument. But if you look at the most successful films of 2012, you find that Bond is the odd one out: 1. The Avengers, $53 million; 2. The Dark Knight Rises, $43m; 3. Skyfall, likely to make $39m; 4. Ted, $35m; 5. The Hunger Games, $31m.Bourne's legacy is more powerful than Bond's, it turns out; four of the top five flicks celebrate free spirits.In The Hunger Games, a totalitarian government has decreed that districts that tried to assert their independence must be punished by sacrificing their children in gladiatorial contests. It's the same scenario as in the original Star Wars trilogy - rebel planets resisting a suffocating central authority (Darth Vader was James Bond until he decided, at the last minute, to follow his conscience and question the authority of the Emperor).In the trilogy that culminated in The Dark Knight Rises, Bruce Wayne decides to become a lone vigilante because the authorities are cowardly or corrupted. He would be the sort of troublemaker M would order Bond to kill.In The Avengers, the bureaucrats of the World Security Council try unsuccessfully to control Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who, in turn, tries to control the assorted superheroes who reluctantly band together to protect the planet.The co-writer and director ofThe Avengers, Joss Whedon, emphasised the anarchism in outlining the plot: ''It makes no sense, it's ridiculous. There's a thunder god, there's a green id giant rage monster, there's Captain America from the '40s, there's Tony Stark, who definitely doesn't get along with anybody. Ultimately, these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community - and finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously, this will be expressed through punching, but it will be the heart of the film.''James Bond could never join the Avengers. He'd keep waiting for his mummy to tell him who to shoot. Bond villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) would be a much more suitable candidate.
