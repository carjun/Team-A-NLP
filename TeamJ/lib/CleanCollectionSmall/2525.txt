Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 35 minutes ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 35 minutes agoA couple of the incidents included in this data are non-school, but remove those and it shows a similar split between US shootings and international: http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0777958.html. Not sure if this was the data set de Rosa was citing or not, but it shows the same trend.Almost any news article that you read about school shootings cites the US's heavily elevated rate over the rest of the world. This isn't a big secret.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKetoing in NYC  by  mzdmin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoKeto is really easy in NYC, IMO. First, like everyone else said, don't eat in Times Square. Not only is most of the food bad and overpriced, but it's the kind of chain restaurants that stuff everything with carbs and make this diet difficult.One of the main reasons that I think keto is so easy in NYC is because most restaurants are used to dealing with fussy New Yorkers, so asking for substitutions and changes is usually met with little to no resistance - whatever you're asking for, they've heard it before. Also, so many New Yorkers are weight-conscious that many places already offer gluten-free menus and lots of veggie sides for substitution if you ask. Make sure you eat in places that people who live here actually eat and you'll have little problem - the only issues I ever run into are when I'm in touristy areas.If you want a burger, Shake Shack and Bare Burger are both delicious, have multiple locations around the city and will do a lettuce wrap with no fuss. Also, go to Katz's! Best pastrami ever, and they give you a ton. Just toss the bread and dip the meat in mustard. Sandwiches also come with a bowl of pickles on the side, so add a diet cream soda and you're good to go. It's a New York institution that also happens to be keto friendly! (If you don't make it all the way down to Houston Street, you can try Carnegie Deli, which is more convenient to the midtown tourist stuff.)Also, Manhattan is full of wine bars, which are full of meat and cheese plates. I had a particularly excellent three-course dinner at Wine 30 in midtown last month, all keto-friendly.Is there any particular kind of meal you're looking for? Frankie's in the West Village is full of keto-friendly Italian, believe it or not.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]pbamandaNYC 56 points57 points58 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 56 points57 points58 points 1 hour agoIn the period of time since Columbine, there've been 31 school shootings in the US and 14 in every other country in the world, combined, according to Anthony de Rosa from Reuters. You can call them rare if it makes you feel better, but relative to every other civilized society on Earth (and also the uncivilized ones), they're not, even when you adjust for population size.Guns are a complicated issue all around, as is mental health care in the US and how it plays into these issues, but those are the numbers.permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuick question: I see people talking about having a hard time getting in even 1,000 calories a day because they feel so full. Is this common in keto or is that up to the individual? If it's because of keto, how long did it take you to reach this state?  by  Fleshgodin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours agoThe first week or so, I was hungry all the time, which is common. Your body still wants you to fill it with lots of carbs at that point, because that's what it's used to. That steadily decreased over time until I was at the 4-6 week point, at which point it was rare that I felt any hunger at all throughout the day. That's still true, except I do get a little hungry during shark week. Fucking hormones.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFor NYC keto-ers, Panera's got a keto-friendly hidden menu at select Manhattan locations!  by  steenacakezin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoWOO 86TH STREET.

My friends in the industry have been easily the most supportive of anybody I know. I work on the editorial side, though - maybe the dynamic is different? Half the fashion people I know already claim not to eat gluten, so it's not a huge logical hop to keto. And my coworkers eat candy, but they never tease me with it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDoes keto dieting make your body less tolerant to prescription drugs?  by  jonathanp63in  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoI don't know about prescription drug interactions, but a common side effect of keto is increased ability to focus. I get my work done for the day noticeably easier since I started keto, and I wasn't even that easily distracted to begin with.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI've lost 7 pounds so far on Keto and I feel great but I still have almost 100 pounds to go. Seeing this (Xpost from r/twoxchromosomes) is discouraging me from continuing. Thoughts? Advice from people who lost that much weight?  by  peanutrutterin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThis was really great to hear. I want to lose about 110 total, and I've been a little concerned about loose skin. I'm young, though, and 40 lbs of that has only been around for six months to a year, so I'm hoping that if I keep up with my water, coconut oil my stomach (that's where I gain most of my weight) every night and weight train once I get a bit smaller, I won't have overwhelming issues with it. I don't really care about the stretch marks.I figure that I never had any problems with letting people see me naked when I was really fat, so I doubt the amount of loose skin I end up with will be any more shameful. I tend not to lose weight in my boobs, so here's hoping they stay basically where they are.If all else fails, I'll use my Christmas bonus after I lose the weight for a tummy tuck, but I'm hopeful it won't be necessary.permalinksavecontextfull comments[NS...Fail I guess?] Stuck for about 2-3 months and came to a sudden, and grim, realization.  by  sanpilouin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoYour water sounds good, but adding a good multivitamin/multimineral couldn't hurt, or adding in more offal. I've never tracked it super closely, but just from my own observation, I lose more steadily when I remember to take my supplements. (I take a multi, Vitamin D, a potassium/magnesium combo and a couple of coconut oil/fiber capsules.)Hoping the best for you, dude. I've seen other posters around here report long stalls, though, so try and tough it out mentally for as long as you can.permalinksavecontextfull comments[NS...Fail I guess?] Stuck for about 2-3 months and came to a sudden, and grim, realization.  by  sanpilouin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoHow is your vitamin/water intake?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy oh why did I tell my friends I'm doing keto??  by  shango266in  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 19 points20 points21 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 19 points20 points21 points 2 days agoI think you have to sort of walk people into the idea gently - it's contrary to everything that most people think they know about what's "healthy," and they mean well when they warn you against keto. At first, I just told people that I wasn't eating carbs because they mess with my blood sugar and give me some mild stomach problems (which is part of the truth). People don't question stuff like that, mostly.As my weight loss started to become evident, people asked more detailed questions, but by then, they were already curious in a positive way because of the results sitting right in front of them. Not only that, but by then, I was comfortable enough with the benefits of keto to explain it in a way that sounds healthy. If you go in, guns blazing, with heavy cream and bacon, people automatically resist.Admittedly, I probably also benefit from the fact that I live in NYC and work in fashion, where everyone is always "not eating" something and people are receptive to anything that seems to be working, no matter whether it fits the conventional wisdom or not. To a group of people who consider week-long juice fasts to be totally normal, nothing sounds that weird.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow much weight have we lost as a whole community?  by  Lydi-uhin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago26 for me!permalinksavecontextfull commentsDelicious low carb tortillas from Trader Joes, thought I'd share my "bread" fix  by  Tirriouin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoHuh, those aren't as bad as I thought they were going to be, and I can even pronounce most of the ingredients. Good find, seems worth having a package around.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEnjoy a good keto salad? Meet your new best friend.  by  pbamandaNYCin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoYou can, but a really good chopped salad is chopped in the bowl, with dressing, so that you get a fine chop and everything mixed perfectly. I think it'd take a lot of patience to cut up a bunch of dry lettuce that small. This does it all together in like 20 seconds with no mess.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEnjoy a good keto salad? Meet your new best friend.  by  pbamandaNYCin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC[S] 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC[S] 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoIt is basically that. I'm seriously deficient when it comes to salad, for some reason. I'm a good cook other than that, I swear.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's better: fasting, or eating carbs?  by  TeaPotPiein  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoI probably would have fasted as long as I could stand it, and if I made it to dinner, I would have eaten the toppings off of a piece or two of pizza.Hearing this story makes me appreciate where I live - lots of delivery options that can be ordered online or via phone app, plus bodegas where you can get basics - meat, cheese, etc. - within a very short walk. Makes me feel a little better about the awful rent and terrible apartments!permalinksavecontextfull commentsEnjoy a good keto salad? Meet your new best friend.  by  pbamandaNYCin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI really like a good caesar with chicken and bacon, but I never make salads at home because I always make a mess trying to get them all chopped up and mixed. Sometimes I order a chopped salad as takeout, but they're so overpriced. I figured there had to be an easier way to accomplish the perfect salad mix at home, so I went to Bed, Bath and Beyond this weekend to see if they had a tool to make it easier. And they did!This thing is awesome - it does everything I couldn't do with two knives, and it does it without knocking all the lettuce out of my bowl. Perfect mix, perfectly sized bites, it even cut through the leftover bacon-wrapped chicken bites I threw in at lunch today. Way quicker than cooking at lunch and I felt like I was eating takeout! permalinksavecontextfull comments19123Enjoy a good keto salad? Meet your new best friend. (amazon.com)submitted 3 days ago by pbamandaNYC to keto5 commentssharecancelloading...Does anyone else consider Keto to be 'fun'?  by  H4Xv2in  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoI think it's totally fun. Like everyone else mentioned, trying new recipes is great, but I especially like that there are so many things I get to eat that people think are bad for you or that they try to avoid - butter, red meat, bacon, cheese, heavy cream. Keto food is fucking delicious! I like feeling like I'm indulging while also losing weight. It's amazing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is better (psychologically speaking): Weighing yourself daily or weekly?  by  juliefaasin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoOnce shark week starts, I start dropping water weight, so I'm always happy to weigh myself once that happens. I was stalled out at 240-243 for a week and a half before the end of last week, now I'm 235.0. And shark week is still going! I'm 2.5 months in and the data I gained from weighing every morning for those first two months made this short stall very easy to weather, psychologically. That's why I weigh every morning - to detect patterns and find out how things affect my weightloss. You can't do that effectively without a good data set!permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is better (psychologically speaking): Weighing yourself daily or weekly?  by  juliefaasin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 3 points4 points5 points 4 days agoI do it every morning. It's helped me understand how my weight loss is connected to my hormonal cycle, which means that when I stall for a week and a half before my period, I don't sweat it - I know I'll drop five pounds after a day or two of shark week. During that stall period, I don't weigh as diligently because I know what the scale will say. For me, weighing regularly is actually quite calming.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat foods did you assume were Keto, but it turns out they are NOT?  by  PaulaDeensDieticianin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 9 points10 points11 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 9 points10 points11 points 4 days agoYou can have them, but only in small quantities.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHorrible indigestion?  by  Dipthongin  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 3 points4 points5 points 4 days agoSounds like keto flu - ride it out, it'll end soon. Some people have terrible adaptation experiences, I was lucky and was just a little foggy for a few days. Drink some brother, put some heavy cream in your coffee. I've also never had the weird mouth taste or bad breath, although my urine did change a little bit before I upped my water intake. Get some ketostix if you're interested in checking your ketosis status.The heartburn is a bit weird, though - I had terrible heartburn for years, but it ended within 24 hours of starting keto and hasn't come back.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some unexpected surprises of Keto?  by  deeptimein  keto[+]pbamandaNYC 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]pbamandaNYC 4 points5 points6 points 4 days agoI never thought I would be the person who sometimes forgets to eat or who can skip a meal and not turn into a grouchy, headache-y monster. I also don't need meals to be traditionally meal-like to be psycologically satisfying; before keto, if I didn't have a very full sit-down experience, I felt cheated. Now I just don't care.Keto has also dramatically reduced my cravings for Diet Coke. Now I drink one can a day (when I get up - I'm not a coffee person), sometimes a second can with dinner. I used to drink twice that.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
