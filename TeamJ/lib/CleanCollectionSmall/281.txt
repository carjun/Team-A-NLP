J. Paul Vance told reporters at a news conference. The gunman was not voluntarily let into the school, Vance said. He forced his way in.Vance did not name the gunman, who has been identified by other law enforcement sources as Adam Lanza, 20, who lived in town with his mother, Nancy.PHOTOS: Connecticut school shootingSources have said that Lanza began his spree by killing his mother and then driving to Sandy Hook Elementary School several miles away. At the school, those sources said, he fired two handguns, killing 20 children and six adults before killing himself.The investigation at the school and at a secondary crime scene, the familys home, is continuing as authorities seek answers to the massacre that has shocked this small western Connecticut town, the nation and the world.The tender age of the victims, between 5 and 10 years old, and the violence of their deaths, has led to an outpouring of condolences, some from as far away as Australia and some as close as a neighbors tears at memorial services that began Friday night and will continue Saturday.FULL COVERAGE: Connecticut school shootingThe motive remains a mystery, but it is one authorities said they hope to determine.The police searches "did produce some very good evidence in this investigation that our investigators can use to explain how -- and more importantly -- why this occurred," Vance said."Were hopeful it will paint a complete picture of how and why this incident occurred, he added.Other law enforcement sources said it appeared Adam Lanza was quite disturbed by the 2009 divorce of his parents, Peter and Nancy. Ryan Lanza, who was questioned on Friday, told investigators that his younger brother had behavioral issues such as autism. Nancy Lanza did not work at the school, but may have been a volunteer there, sources said.After shooting Nancy in the face or head area, according to these sources, Lanza then drove her Honda to the school. He parked in the fire lane in front of the main entrance, wasting no time to get inside the building.He left a Bushmaster .223 rifle in the back seat, and took the two handguns -- a Glock 9-millimeter and a Sig Sauer semiautomatic -- inside. He was dressed in black camouflage and had Ryans ID on him.The front door to the school was locked, and he either smashed the glass or shot it open. Investigators are not yet exactly sure because the police responding to the scene later smashed every door to get in too, sources said.One woman was wounded in the attack. At the news conference, Vance said she was doing well and expected her to be a key witness.Vance also said police were withholding some details, pending the completion of the investigation of the scenes, which could take at least one more day and possibly more. The bodies of the victims have been transported to the medical examiners office where efforts to determine the causes of death were continuing, though identifications have been completed.The medical examiners office was still working on putting together a complete list of the victims. Those identifications could be publicly available at a later briefing on Saturday, Vance said.While officials worked their way through the grim details of the investigation and its aftermath, Newtown struggled to come to grips with the tragedy, barely a day old. Saturday was cold December day typical of New England. Warmth was in much-needed demand, especially at the Sandy Hook Diner on Main Street.It is Msgr. Robert Weiss' habit to have breakfast there every morning.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Times12next|  single pageComments3Comments (7)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQmetallurgicalgoddess at 10:23 AM December 15, 2012                Condolences to the families, friends, spouses, neighbors whose loved ones were murdered by an evil coward.naught moses at 10:21 AM December 15, 2012                The increasingly common school shooter profile:A bullied and unprotected child himself (often as abused at home as well as at school), he sees his own "horrible" and shaming image in small children. The sight of them triggers the unprocessed memories and the terror and self-hatred attached to those memories. ("I should have been able to defend myself.")He becomes increasingly shameful, paranoid and delusional. He needs to feel empowered and capable of defending himself against "monsters everywhere!" He gets guns and ammo. He sees "school" as "hell." He has to do something about it. He kills the little mirrors of himself, and then, he kills... himself.There is plenty being done about schoolyard bullying these days. But those already damaged by it are all over the place. (And so are automatic weapons.)contraryjim at 10:10 AM December 15, 2012                Is it normal to lock schools? How do they handle the influx of children coming to school? do they have keys or are there guards? do teachers have keys? what is the security program?Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
