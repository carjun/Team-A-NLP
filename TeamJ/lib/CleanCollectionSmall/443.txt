GANNETT)Story HighlightsAs I watched the news of the tragic shooting -- I was reminded for my reasons.A year ago, a friend's child died in his sleep. I realized soon enough that there was nothing one could say to a parent facing such loss that approached the magnitude of the situation. But I could do one thing. I could make sure that the last words I said to my own three children at night were "I love you." No matter what happened in their sleep, I would at least know I'd said that.  It is not always an easy vow to keep, especially as the months went by and the shock that drove my initial motivation faded a bit. "Stop hitting your brother! I love you." Or after being summoned for the third time with the news flash that some child is not yet asleep, "Close your eyes. Just keep them closed. Hey! Get back in your bed. I love you." Or more commonly, "If I have to come up here one more time there will be big trouble!" Storm into hall. Pause. Shout back into the room: "I love you." It sounds ridiculous, sometimes, to be saying "I love you" as I'm slamming the door. But as I watched the news of the tragic shooting in Newtown, Conn. -- a horror unleashed on as idyllic sounding a place as Sandy Hook Elementary School -- I was reminded for my reasons. On Friday, parents like me dropped off children as smiling and innocent and mischievous as my 5-year-old. They waved goodbye in the carpool line or walked them to the bus stop. Then they never saw their children alive again. Thankfully, most of us do reunite, after school and after sleep. The routine nature of small separations makes us not think about them too much. As time goes by, the shock of Newtown will likewise fade. The arguments over gun control will come and go and for most people this story will recede to another unpleasant but not frequently dredged up memory. In the days after Sept. 11, it seemed the news could never be about anything else. Within a few months, it was.  That is human nature. We are a species blessedly capable of coping and those not intimately linked to a tragedy soon revert to the status quo. That's why it's important in the midst of a shock like Newtown -- knowing this tendency about ourselves -- to stop and think. What would you do differently knowing that any goodbye could be the last one? Would you say goodbye or good night more consciously? Would you send a "Kiss!" text message as you're turning off the cell phone on your plane? Morbid, perhaps. But as I realized in that sudden death a year ago, there will be a last parting from all the people we love someday, and in the carnage this week is a reminder: that a separation will only be a few hours is a comfort you are not guaranteed. It never hurts to say "I love you."
