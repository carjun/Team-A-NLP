This doesn't look like a momentary loss of sanity to me.permalinksave[+]ladut 110 points111 points112 points 23 hours ago (18 children)[]ladut 110 points111 points112 points 23 hours agoNo, he was clearly very mentally disturbed.permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 14 points15 points16 points 23 hours ago (12 children)[]reddixiecup 14 points15 points16 points 23 hours agoYes, but that doesn't mean he couldn't have been planning this thing for days or longer. Mentally disturbed doesn't mean he just snapped.permalinksaveparent[+]ladut 27 points28 points29 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]ladut 27 points28 points29 points 23 hours agoI was agreeing with you.permalinksaveparent[+]HeroicGomez 3 points4 points5 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 3 points4 points5 points 20 hours agoYou can be mentally disturbed and plan something like this.You can also be mentally disturbed without being medically insane. People lose it in the face of great personal stress and their anger can consume them, driving them to do terrible things.permalinksaveparent[+]am5437435 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (9 children)[]am5437435 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoNo, but it doesn't mean it wasn't the product of a diseased or delusional mind.  Real "EVIL" is rare.permalinksaveparent[+]MSCaptainMonkeyPants 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (2 children)[]MSCaptainMonkeyPants 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoI would definitely say this is real "EVIL"permalinksaveparent[+]am5437435 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago (1 child)[]am5437435 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours agoThat's the tricky thing about evil.  Much of the stuff we initially react to as manifestations of real evil are nothing of the sort.I can't say that's the case at this point for this atrocity, but it seems to be the product of mental illness rather than evil (even if it doesn't rise to the point of an "insanity defence" in the law).Another example of something that bears a striking resemblance to pure and real evil but is nothing of the sort is what happened in Colorado earlier this year.permalinksaveparent[+]MSCaptainMonkeyPants 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]MSCaptainMonkeyPants 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agoI dunno, if murdering your mother and innocent children in cold blood is not evil, then i don't know what is. Personally, even though i am a social worker devoted to helping people with mental health and disability issues, i do not believe that having mental illness and being evil are mutually exclusive. For example, Hitler. permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup  comment score below threshold (5 children)[]reddixiecup -6 points-5 points-4 points 22 hours agoI'm sure this guy had some mix of depression and other mental illnesses. I'm also guessing he had big time mommy issues and possibly was abused as a child. The psychotherapist being killed to me directs misdiagnoses or being labelled a liar at some point by someone in therapy. CBS quoted a neighbour of the family saying the shooter and his brother as "troubled", so there is something.permalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You -5 points-4 points-3 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]iGotChubs4You -5 points-4 points-3 points 21 hours agoThis is why people consider psychology a psuedoscience.permalinksaveparent[+]am5437435 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]am5437435 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours agoIdiots consider psychology a pseudoscience. permalinksaveparent[+]FatZombieMama -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago (2 children)[]FatZombieMama -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours agoHe was developmentally disabled, they're reporting now.permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoIs that the neighbor's report or a confirmed report? If it's the neighbor's quote that could mean anything.permalinksaveparent[+]FatZombieMama 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]FatZombieMama 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoApparently the brother (whose facebook got publicized) said it to friends online, and one reported it out. Or so I heard.permalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours ago (4 children)[]iGotChubs4You 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours agoYou dont know that.  Jesus christ everytime somebody does this everybody just slaps 'oh ues obviouslu mentally ill' down and calls it a day.permalinksaveparent[+]corghi 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (2 children)[]corghi 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoOkay, then what is it? A mentally stable person would open fire in an elementary school? K.permalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (1 child)[]iGotChubs4You 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoWe shouldnt rule that out.permalinksaveparent[+]corghi 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]corghi 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoI agree to an extent: to not assume. However, you have to be mentally troubled to kill children. Whatever business happened between family, why do little ones have to pay?permalinksaveparent[+]ladut 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]ladut 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoThey may not have a defined mental illness, but no person in a right state of mind would go on a killing spree. Call them delusional, temporarily insane, enraged, whatever you want, but whatever they are isn't healthy or normal; and it should be addressed before 26 people die.permalinksaveparent[+]errorsix 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]errorsix 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours agoWhere did you hear about the execution style thing?permalinksaveparent[+]cordoroy 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]cordoroy 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago"Child victims were just 5-10 years old. CBS says they were killed execution-style. 2nd suspect in custody, not clear yet if he was involved."permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoI'm not sure if it's been "confirmed", I know just as much as everyone else. Not trying to sound like I'm an insider or anything.permalinksaveparent[+]Sargentrock 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Sargentrock 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours agoI believe his mother is one of the dead at the school--apparently it was her class where most of the children were killed as well.permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoIt was her house three doors down apparently, looks like he killed her before entering the school.permalinksaveparent[+]LedZeppelin18 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]LedZeppelin18 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoI'm interested to know the shooter's motivations for committing such a heinous act. Apparently, his mother used to teach at the school, and he probably attended it. And the psychotherapist's death is definitely a major indicator that this guy had some serious psychological problems, which obviously weren't resolved soon enough.permalinksaveparent[+]melicious23 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]melicious23 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoSources?permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]reddixiecup 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoThe news. Just wrapping up what's been said then adding my view.permalinksaveparent[+]epooka 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]epooka 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoI haven't seen the execution style detail anywhere yet. permalinksaveparent[+]obviousoctopus 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]obviousoctopus 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoWhat pain or suffering could cause someone to do such a thing? What madness could breed such isolation, anger and hate?permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoChild abuse, depression, mental disorders (bipolar, schizophrenia, multiple personalities, a disconnect from reality of some kind, etc.), paranoia, psychopathy, or even wanting to have others feel his pain before he ended it. There's a million things it could be right now, but I'd guess it's a combination of some of the stuff I just listed. permalinksaveparent[+]FatZombieMama 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]FatZombieMama 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoAlso they're saying he was developmentally disabled.permalinksaveparent[+]LotsOfMaps 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]LotsOfMaps 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoYeah, sounds like a psychopath with mommy issues that wanted to get one over on her in the most horrifying way possible, while becoming internationally notoriouspermalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI'm not sure he wanted infamy, especially if he did infact take his own life. Killers who want notoriety generally want to be alive to bask in the glory of their crimes, especially in non-death sentence states.permalinksaveparent[+]Sn1pe 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]Sn1pe 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoI wonder if he had some bad blood with the principal, the pyschotherapist, and his mother. I'm still not getting why he killed the kids. Why?permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]reddixiecup 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoApparently he killed everyone in her room. Looks like he just killed everyone. There are at least 3 separate crime scenes so far: the school, the mother's house and another New Jersey house (plus another possible location in the gunman's home if that's not the NJ house). It looks like it's a Texas clock tower situation: get as many people as he can before he goes out.permalinksaveparent[+]FatZombieMama 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]FatZombieMama 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoAND his GF is missing.permalinksaveparent[+]drunkenfaggot 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]drunkenfaggot 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoW.

That.is.so.disturbing....... Just the mental imagine. Ugh, evil at it's core.  permalinksaveparent[+]FunkyLove69 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]FunkyLove69 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoThese psychos always take the easy way out of the consequences for the evil they just committed. Fucking cowards.permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]reddixiecup 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoHe shot them and then himself.
