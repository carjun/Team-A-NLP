Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Phiiseverywhere 42 points43 points44 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Phiiseverywhere 42 points43 points44 points 2 hours agoI don't know what I am (extremist or reasonable) But I'm def. not one to say elementary students should be armed. I will put at least some of the blame of this at the feet of the media though. The sensationalizing of the mall shooting in Oregon. The plastering of the shooters face all over the news only incites more people who have serious mental issues to go out and do the same. Im against outright banning, the fact that police weren't around to stop this tells you everything you need to know about relying on their protection. There should be more over site into the mental faculties of people purchasing firearms though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood 9mm for an X-mas present?  by  ZCT511in  guns[+]Phiiseverywhere 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Phiiseverywhere 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoWalther PPQ if you can find one...permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat foods did you assume were Keto, but it turns out they are NOT?  by  PaulaDeensDieticianin  keto[+]Phiiseverywhere 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Phiiseverywhere 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agojust make your own... put it in a bottle and voila... permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you could only have 3 guns.

Sadly, law enforcement officers cannot be everywhere at once, and I refuse to ever be put into a position where I cannot readily defend myself or my family. I dont ever go out looking for trouble, because I have seen what shooting someone can do. I carry, but I hope I never have to use it. Whats better than having a safety net that is never used?permalinksavecontextfull commentsSecond Amendment Rights and Private Property  by  dances_with_minionsin  PoliticalDiscussion[+]Phiiseverywhere -1 points0 points1 point 10 days ago (0 children)[]Phiiseverywhere -1 points0 points1 point 10 days agoI'm all for gun rights (im a CCW holder)... but I am concerned that someone as paranoid as you is carrying... Please, don't take it upon yourself to hurt anyone.

I know that when I carry, I go out of my way to avoid confrontational situations because I know that if I put myself into that situation then 9 times out of 10 its going to end badly. Even rednecks and hillbillies I know wouldn't do this. They may not have the university education but a lot of them have pretty good common sense regardless of what you see on COPS.permalinksavecontextfull comments"Handguns do not enhance our safety.

We should be looking at why people want to take someones life, and treating those people. Banning stuff does only one thing. It creates a black market and causes even more violence. Mexico and the current drug war there is a big example of this.Edit: spellingpermalinksavecontextfull comments"Handguns do not enhance our safety.

If you look at Glasgow and what has happened there, you would see that it isn't ludicrous at all. If someone wants to murder someone, they are going to do it... regardless of the tool. If it is a gun, a bat, a car, a knife, or a bomb. permalinksavecontextfull comments"Handguns do not enhance our safety.

A gun is nothing without the finger to pull the trigger. Instead of wasting all this money on anti gun legislation I would like to see that money spent on things like mental health study, or a study on our violent society and how to combat that. Getting rid of guns would fail just as badly as our current prohibition of drugs like marijuana. permalinksavecontextfull comments"Handguns do not enhance our safety.

My point is, it makes no difference what tool is used in killing someone. Its the person who wields it that is doing the killing, not the tool. Its an unfortunate truth, but getting rid of guns does nothing to solve the problem. If anything, it puts law abiding citizens at greater risk, because lets face it, police do not prevent crime, they respond to it. permalinksavecontextfull comments"Handguns do not enhance our safety.

Most of the murders there were committed with knives, not guns. It goes to show you that, if a person wants to kill someone, they will kill them, regardless of what tool they use. Blaming someones death on the tool used to kill them, is like blaming bad spelling on your pencil. permalinksavecontextfull commentsLook... I'm all for gun rights, but am I alone in thinking that all these people on YouTube walking around with a camera while they open carry hoping for a police confrontation where they can be assholes and cite state/federal statutes are making the rest of us look like pricks?  by  JCoxRocksin  guns[+]Phiiseverywhere 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]Phiiseverywhere 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoI agree with you wholeheartedly. I would rather an officer just engage an open carrier with conversation if nothing more than to try and determine the carriers mental state. That, in my opinion is just a LEO actually doing their jobs... Too often police are reactionary to violent crime (which is precisely the reason I carry a firearm) If they want to engage an open carrier in respectful, polite conversation to try and determine someones mental state then I am all for that. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAs requested, my Katana pictures.

As others here have said... the furniture looks really iffy. The guys over at SwordForum.com would be able to help out more. Honestly though, without seeing the blade itself, up close you probably couldn't be 100% but the furniture is pretty suspect. One piece of advice, don't swing it around. I was once at an Iaido Taikai in Kyoto and saw someone impaled with a blade that hadn't been thoroughly checked.
