(Doug Hyun/TBS )Word has it the sitcom genre is primed for a big comeback this fall, but if the first episode of TBSs Thursday night sitcom Men at Work is any indication of what lies ahead, then they can keep it. This woefully flat riff on modern manhood might be cleverly sprinkled with derogatory references to Dane Cook, fake-tan whorange skin color and other assorted modern afflictions, but youd swear it had been discovered in a box of old VHS cassettes marked miscellaneous.Danny Masterson  formerly of That 70s Show, resurfacing here in this 90s show, which is nevertheless a 10s show  stars as Milo, a writer who has just been dumped by his girlfriend.Hes got three solid bros to lean on for support: a sharp-witted smoothie (Michael Cassidy), an overconfident lothario (James Lesure) and a neurotic accountant (Adam Busch). Tonight, one of the guys tells Milo,we take your new, single penis out for a test drive. The laughter is so badly canned, itll give you botulism.Collectively, the four men are derived from a hundred other canceled sitcoms about men being men while trying to navigate the single life. The only discernible difference is that these guys are on a cable network, so their language can be a tad more randy. Which means any word you want to use for breasts, besides breasts, is fine.In what I consider a sad display of sitcom laziness, the men in Men at Work all work together at a magazine. Yep, a magazine, with, like, pages that need to be proofed and pictures that are taken with Nikons. Just like (Suddenly) Susan and many, many other make-believe citizens of sitcomville did before them. Couldnt the Men at Work writers at least have dreamed up a relevant workplace? What if these men were employed by, I dunno, a Groupon-like copywriting sweatshop?What if they didnt reside in the usual giant loft apartments with $3,000 sectional sofas that sitcom urbanites always have? What if the table for four wasnt always available at their usual corner diner whenever they need it?Its as if everyone behind Men at Work missed a recent evolution in TV comedy. They never saw Scrubs, Community, Cougar Town, Happy Endings or Modern Family  shows that have made watching multicamera, laugh-track sitcoms almost unbearable for us thinkin people. Even if old-school sitcom is their preferred format, then it seems they also missed How I Met Your Mother or, especially, The Big Bang Theory, which has a whole lot more to tell us about the warpy minds of todays men. Youd think the only television the makers of Men at Work have seen lately include half a season of Entourage and a whole lot of Two and a Half Men reruns.Stranger still, the pilot episode has a creepy age-avoidance issue. Are Milo and his friends supposed to be 25-ish and just starting out in life? Thirty and sensing despair? Thirty-five and simply regressive? Forty and holding? The actors average out to a ripe 34, but what their characters worry and stress about  How can I learn to talk dirty in bed? How can I get over my ex-girlfriend?  completes a loop of uninspired redundancy. Men at Work(30 minutes) premieres Thursday at 10 p.m. on TBS.Personal PostEmailTumblrRedditStumbleuponDiggDeliciousFEATURED ARTICLES2013 Honda Accord: A napping giant awakensHeat is on South Korean rapper Psy for anti-American rapHow To: Convert a fireplace to natural gasMore:2014 Chevrolet Cruze Diesel PreviewNuts & Bolts: 2013 Honda Accord SportChris Christies big problemA Muslim Brotherhood leader on bin Laden, Israel and Egypts electionsWashington Post endorsement: Four more years for President Obama2013 Ford Escape, Fusion Recalled For Fire RiskLoading...Commentswashingtonpost.com 2012 The Washington PostTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySubmissings and Discussion PolicyAd ChoicesIndex by DateIndex by Keyword
