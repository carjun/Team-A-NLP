Most gun crime is gang related. Mass shootings account for about  50 murders per year in the US, out of 12,000 murders. So mass shootings account for 0.4% of murders.Addressing 0.4% of gun crime makes no real sense. What we should address is reason for the majority of gun crime that no one talks about. No one talks about it when black people kill other black people by the thousands in cities like Chicago.Murders are at the lowest rate they've been in American history. We just have a much better way to hear about them fast in the past 20 years.Anyways, if you want to have a conversation about gun laws, I'm all ears.permalinksaveparent[+]Oatybar 20 points21 points22 points 1 hour ago (5 children)[]Oatybar 20 points21 points22 points 1 hour agoI'm amazed that the talk after these events is always about guns and rarely about mental illness. permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 21 points22 points23 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 21 points22 points23 points 1 hour agoI have a feeling that America's health care system is more at blame than America's gun culture.If we had a different culture, one that was more caring, and took care of people's health, and didn't make fun of people with mental illnesses, didn't ostracize them, I think we'd be in a much better place.So many people are afraid of seeking mental health care because they don't want to be labeled as "crazy". It sucks.permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 4 points5 points6 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)[]Cylinsier 4 points5 points6 points 59 minutes agoThe sooner people start to recognize and accept this, the sooner we will start to actually solve the problem.  Shootings like this are just one branch on the tree of consequences of mental health stigmatization in our society.  The culture around it needs to change.  It's still difficult for a lot of people to get insurance that will cover mental health, even through employers, for example.  That's just unacceptable.  permalinksaveparent[+]Yossarian33 -1 points0 points1 point 44 minutes ago (0 children)[]Yossarian33 -1 points0 points1 point 44 minutes agoBut providing health care to everyone doesn't seem to be very popular among gun enthusiasts who are often right-leaning. Personal liberty logic leads to believing that these people deserve to be ill and deserve to take care of it themselves, and that good people who aren't ill shouldn't be forced to pay taxes to help the mentally ill.Even in Canada, mental health is just brushed off to the side.permalinksaveparent[+]soline 0 points1 point2 points 43 minutes ago (0 children)[]soline 0 points1 point2 points 43 minutes agoSometimes they are not mentally ill.

No one reports it.Edit: just to give some stats, the FBI says that there were 14,000 murders in 2011.1800 were stabbed to death. No one talks about the "knife culture" in the US.800 people were killed with fists last year, no one talks about "fisting culture" wait a minute. Anyways. http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-713,000 people were stabbed in the UK last year, why doesn't anyone talk about the UKs horrible crime rate.

Maybe its their knifing culture.NHS data suggests there were 4,490 people admitted to English hospitals in 2011/12 due to assault by a sharp object.No need to make stuff up. Also we've had one school shooting/rampage in the UK, ever and the guy should never have been allowed handguns in the first place as he should have failed the background check.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 48 minutes ago (5 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 48 minutes agoI was going from this: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/14000-knife-victims-a-year-860857.htmlWasn't making things up.permalinksaveparent[+]Tokukachi 1 point2 points3 points 44 minutes ago (4 children)[]Tokukachi 1 point2 points3 points 44 minutes agoAhh ok, Well you did say last year, hence why I was calling BS, but for 2007/08 you are correct :)permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 44 minutes ago (3 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 44 minutes agoThat's great news.

I'd much rather be shot in the chest with a 9mm than stabbed in the chest with a chef's knife.Knives are more concealable than guns, they're quieter, and they're very deadly.The best defense against guns and knives is to run as fast as you can. permalinksaveparent[+]beatyatoit 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]beatyatoit 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agocan't calm down.  I have a two yr old son and this shit is incomprehensible.  Yes knives are deadly but to insinuate that they are as deadly as guns in terms of the number of people you can kill quickly and indiscriminately is ludicrous.  btw the kid and adults who died as a result of this shooters random firing don't give a damn about the fact that 70% of shooting victims survive   permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]Butthole_Scientist 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoGuns are obviously easier to kill people with than knifes, no argument from me there.permalinksaveparent[+]Arnold_Horshack 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Arnold_Horshack 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoAlso guns distance the shooter from the violence, it is just a trigger pull, as opposed to actually stabbing somebody...permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoYou can get killed so fast with a knife.  Knives are pretty scary, it does not take much to understand how to use one.

If, as I suspect, guns are significantly more effective at killing and severely wounding people than knives, then it would make sense to focus more on the more dangerous weapon type.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes agoThe survival rate for people shot with handguns is about 70%.I'm not sure what it is for stabbings.permalinksaveparent[+]xChrisk 1 point2 points3 points 55 minutes ago (1 child)[]xChrisk 1 point2 points3 points 55 minutes agoI'm not interested in arguing with you about something that neither of us has the ability to fix. However, I think it should be pointed out that you stated in the parent comment that there are "about 12,000" murders annually. This is not accurate.You've also linked to a table that supposedly supports your claim of an abundance of knife murders in this country. However, the table actually shows 67.7% of murders involve firearms and only 13.4% of murders involve knives. Moreover, that's not what the term "Gun Culture" even refers to.Perhaps I'm just missing your sarcasm.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes agoAh, sorry.

It's just a whole lot easier to kill more people.  All some people want is reasonable laws to regulate them. No one needs an assault rifle to shoot a fucking deer, and your hand gun isn't going to protect you against a government with tanks and F15s.Oh, and in the U.K. there were 39 gun deaths last year.  39 - do you really fucking believe if they had more guns there would be fewer deaths?permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 47 seconds ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 47 seconds agoNo one has been killed with a legally owned assault rifle, ever.permalinksaveparent[+]coolhand83 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]coolhand83 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoBecause it's not as bad as you make it sound? 13,000 GBH and ABH offences involving a sharp object which would include bottles, glasses, keys, syringes etc... and of that there were 214 homicides.  The homicide rate by Knives or cutting instruments in the USA for 2000-2008 was 13%, For the same period in the UK it was less than 7%   (Page 69)The homicide rate in the USA is nearly 4 times what it is in the UK, and the rate for gun related deaths is 9 (per 100,000) for the USA and for the UK it's 0.22 per 100,000. Maybe it's their murder culture?

The shooters do not think of themselves as terrorists, but the public reacts to them as if they are. There are gang shootings on the 11pm news every night, and I don't notice much, because I'm not in the "bad" part of town, and I'm not in a gang. There are domestic shootings on the news all the time, and I don't notice much, because my spouse is mentally healthy and we have a good relationship. A shooting in a school or movie theater really rattles us because it seems random, and it makes people afraid to just be out and about. You are of course correct about the statistics, but I think the idea of anyone becoming a victim in the "safe" part of town while doing normal things and without apparent motive is really harming the emotional state of our country.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoYep.

People who intend on killing are going to kill regardless. Sometimes guns do make it easier and increase the amount of damage a single person could have done otherwise however. I don't think people should lose their guns but more security would be nice. At the very least people shouldn't own automatic weapons or if they do they should have extensive background testing and mental health evaluations. permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 56 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 56 minutes agopeople shouldn't own automatic weapons or if they do they should have extensive background testingThat has been the standard in the US since 1934... Machine guns were restricted heavily after that period, and effectively banned in 1986. (Hughes amendment) Also, no legally purchased machine gun or automatic weapon has been used in any murders in over 20 years, with a total of 2 murders with legally purchased automatic weapons since 1934.Americans can still buy automatic weapons that were created before 1986, but a tax of $200 must be paid, and 9-14 months waiting period for extensive background checking, and the guns themselves cost $10,000 or more.permalinksaveparent[+]xole 1 point2 points3 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)[]xole 1 point2 points3 points 56 minutes agoGang violence is mostly against other gang members.

Look at Chicago's gun laws and rate of gun homicide. But don't make this an Obama thing. People were bitching about their gun rights way before him. It'd be impossible to take away guns.

It's what happened in 1973.There is apparently a correlation between abortion and crime rate. Legalizing abortion means that fewer children of lesser means and/or less capable parents, which means that there are fewer children at higher risk of becoming criminals, which means a lower crime rate in general. With Roe v. Wade being decided in 1973, you only start to see the impact in the early 1990s, when those aborted embryos would have become late teens/early twenties.It's one of the stories in Freakonomics (the first one). If you have Netflix, there's a documentary version of Freakonomics on there which covers the abortion/crime rate correlation.The tl;dr of it is that a few states legalized abortion a few years prior to Roe v. Wade, and the drop in crime correlates with those earlier legalizations, whereas everywhere else correlates with the SCOTUS decision.Wikipedia has a long article on it as well.permalinksaveparent[+]Faltriwall 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes ago (0 children)[]Faltriwall 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes ago... the ultimate in pre-crime...  *I'm not sure if I'm joking...permalinksaveparent[+]glass_daggers 0 points1 point2 points 36 minutes ago (0 children)[]glass_daggers 0 points1 point2 points 36 minutes agoSuper Nintendopermalinksaveparent[+]ahalenia 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]ahalenia 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoThat's all violent crime; doesn't distinguish shootings or school shootings.

They would not be laws that would add on a small amount of time for using guns in a crime such as murder -- I agree these laws are mostly useless in the US, and they don't make a whole lot of sense in any case.The new guns laws would be systemic in nature -- regulating the sale of guns far more tightly, regulating the type of guns it is legal to sell/possess, etc. -- i.e. they would be supply-side not demand-side (to borrow the term), and act to decrease the number of guns in circulation, not act as a personal deterrent against using guns.permalinksaveparent[+]shootx 1 point2 points3 points 42 minutes ago (9 children)[]shootx 1 point2 points3 points 42 minutes agoIn most states there are actually extremely tight laws preventing you from getting a gun..

Compare that to this. I'm not going to do the statistics as I have an exam in the morning, but it seems quite clear to me. permalinksaveparentload more comments(2 replies)[+]montyjack 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]montyjack 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoIt's plenty appropriate, just like any time.  It's acceptable for both pro and anti gun advocates to discuss gun laws.permalinksaveparent[+]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoI guess this would be another one of those times where it would be inappropriate to talk about gun laws.You would be correct.The important topic is the motive of the shooter. Guns or no guns, someone made the active choice to walk into a school and kill people. What led that person to decide this was a good idea?permalinksaveparent[+]xoites -1 points0 points1 point 38 minutes ago (1 child)[]xoites -1 points0 points1 point 38 minutes agoI can just imagine how horrible it would have been had he walked in there with a knife or a hammer.

Tomorrow, the media won't even be covering the children anymore. They will be focused on the shooter. We NEED to stop covering the shooter. Don't show their photo, don't show their name. That is how we make the biggest impact.permalinksaveparent[+]xoites 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes ago (3 children)[]xoites 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes agoI am sure the shooter's only thoughts were, "I could be famous!"permalinksaveparent[+]whubbard[] 0 points1 point2 points 38 minutes ago (2 children)[]whubbard[] 0 points1 point2 points 38 minutes agoWell, they accept they will be infamous, but known.

I live in a 3rd world country that has gun laws, but are not enforced very efficiently, as you can imagine.  Mass shootings like these don't happen.It has to do with the social structure of your country.  It's very easy to become lonely and miserable in America.  I can tell.permalinksaveparent[+]xoites 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]xoites 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoIt's very easy to become lonely and miserable in America.That i can certainly agree withpermalinksaveparent[+]MightyYetGentle 1 point2 points3 points 6 minutes ago*(2 children)[]MightyYetGentle 1 point2 points3 points 6 minutes ago*We need a revolution in gun technology if all these fucks  have to have their boom-sticks.

Too cowardly to give whoever your using it against any way to defend themselves.
