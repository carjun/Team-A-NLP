They were told that by FBI agents. The State police have been absolutely quiet on details. I can understand the anger at the media, but the federal agent who leaked the name is the one who truly deserves the blame. permalinksaveparent[+]Kastro187420 9 points10 points11 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]Kastro187420 9 points10 points11 points 22 hours agoHave a non-gawker link?
