They greeted members of her family with applause and condolences as they exited the airport.Another group of fans gathered at an impromptu altar in front of Rivera's mother's home in Lakewood.A hearse ferried Rivera's body through dark streets, escorted by at least three police cruisers, to All Souls Mortuary, according to CNN affiliate KCAL.The singer was killed Sunday when the plane she was aboard plummeted from 28,000 feet, Mexico's transportation secretary said. The private jet crashed in a mountainous area 9,000 feet above sea level.The remains of Rivera's publicist and the plane's co-pilot have also been identified, said Jorge Domene, a spokesman for Mexico's Nuevo Leon state.The cause of the crash is under investigation.Two lawsuits against the company that owns the jet accuse the firm of lying about its links to a businessman convicted of falsifying maintenance records.Rivera had left a letter for her loved ones and gave instructions to her sister Rosie regarding the circumstances under which it should be read, her brother Pedro Jr. told CNN en Espaol on Wednesday.He said the letter stipulated that she did not want to be cremated, as the family had originally planned to do, and that the authorities should hand over her remains to her siblings."Jenni always had advisers who helped her to work and to make things right," he said. "She prepared a letter about a month, month and a half ago."He added that funeral plans had not been finalized but that a memorial would probably be held in Mexico.The accident report will not be ready for nine months to a year, the secretary of communications and transportation said.Rivera, 43, is mourned by millions of fans.She and six others were thought to be aboard the plane, which lost contact with air traffic controllers soon after takeoff.Known as "La Diva de la Banda" or the Diva of Banda Music, Rivera was a musical powerhouse with her Spanish-language performances of regional Mexican corridos, or ballads. For fans, the nickname captured her powerful voice and personal strength.In recent years, she had been working to break into the English-language U.S. market and was reportedly on the verge of a crossover with a sitcom inspired by the success of "I Love Jenni," a Spanish-language reality TV show on Telemundo's mun2 network.Rivera sold 15 million records, according to Billboard, and had recently won two Billboard Music Awards, including favorite Mexican music female artist.In October, People en Espaol added her to its list of the 25 most powerful women.CNN's Nelson Quinones contributed to this report0Comments PrintEmailMore sharingWe recommendFrom around the webPart of complete coverage on CNN RecommendsSyrian refugee count far from truthupdated 7:15 AM EST, Fri December 14, 2012The U.N. reports that half a million Syrians have registered as refugees, but a Red Cross worker says the true figure is far higher.Syrian refugees on the runupdated 12:00 PM EST, Fri December 14, 2012It's raining on the camp, and water is seeping into the unheated tents.Will China head to the moon in 2013?updated 10:35 PM EST, Thu December 13, 2012Tensions with the U.S., the push to clean corruption and plans to land on the moon are trends to watch next year, writes Kristie Lu Stout.Photos: The women of PakistanKaye Martindale and Geoff Brokate traveled through Pakistan for eight months photographing local women, including Malala Yousafzai.Inside Syria's underground TVupdated 6:20 AM EST, Thu December 13, 2012Amid the constant chaos of flying bullets, a new underground television channel has become a must-see for residents of Aleppo, Syria.One small step for Kim Jong Unupdated 5:05 PM EST, Thu December 13, 2012North Korea's successful launch of a satellite is a major feat, but it is not a serious military threat to other nations, Joe Cirincione writes.
