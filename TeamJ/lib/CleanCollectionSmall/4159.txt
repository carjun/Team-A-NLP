WELCOME TO /knittit! PLEASE DO: Read the sidebar before posting. It matters. Upvote valuable content, so it moves higher up the page where more knitters can see it. Report misuse to the mods - and message us why. Share what you love, learn, know, need. HELP US STAY VIBRANT. PLEASE DON'T:Post memes without considering this first.Downvote knitting styles not to your taste, that's not how it works. Link directly to your own for-profit sites or blogs. We're not here to build your traffic, karma, or cash flow. If you want to ask something: I can't decide what I want to knit!...have you browsed Ravelry? I know what I want, I just need a pattern!...did you search Ravelry?Um, I don't know how to knit yet?...KnittingHelp and Garnstudio are where lots of us go to get started or unstuck. I know the basics, now I've got this geeky question on an esoteric issue......"Ahh, so! Techknitter is thataway-->.But, but, socks!"...one favorite beginner sock pattern here,...Silver's lovely complete sock class here OK, I got all that, but I still want your opinions!  Cool! Goodness knows we got'em!But first do a key-word search for similar threads -examples: "Stockinette+curl", "beginner+video", "holes+why?"  If someone recently asked the same question, you won't get much response. Or we might get cranky. If you want to show something:Can I show you something I made?Sure! Sharing and feedback are why we're here.Always include pattern info with an FO post (we're just going to ask anyway) and don't be surprised if you get both compliments and suggestions. Text posts are always better -- what did you learn? What was easy, hard, surprising? If you post a pic and nothing else, we might think you're just after karma.Can I show you something I'm selling?You can show it to us, but don't try to sell it to us. The difference is subtle but important." We're happy to give you feedback and support on a commercial endeavor. Test-drive your site layout? Help you decide pricing? Sure. But remember, we're here as fellow makers, not buyers and sellers. Please don't attempt to use /knittit to increase your sales or profit.What about my blog? Blogs are nice, but conversationwith fellow knitters is nicer. Tell us in your own words what you're up to and include the blog link within the text. Direct links are often yanked by the spam filter and don't tend to generate much discussion anyway. Please don't attempt to use /knittit to increase your traffic.If you want to start something: I have an idea for a group project -- is it ok to just post it?Absolutely! This is the true heart of what reddit isabout -- content is entirely user-generated. Anyone can use /knittit for any worthy endeavor that's not for personal gain. Want to start a charity project or KAL? Make a post and see who signs on, then head over to the Ravelry group since threads there don't "age-off" the front page. Message the mods if you want a link on the sidebar.Speaking of spam filters, what happened to my post? The spam filter sometimes gets a little moody.If your perfectly legit post isn't showing up, message the mods and we'll fish it back out. !@#$% everything about this!...though swearing at our knitting is a therapeutic and time-honored tradition, many of our regulars open the front page in front of small children and picky bosses. Let's keep the saltier stuff out of the titles, shall we? Then let loose all we want inside the post?
