What more could I ask for? lolCheck out Bookers conversation with Stewart about leading a city-on-the-comeback like Newark, his participation in the SNAP challenge of living on food assistance for a week, dealings with Gov. Chris Christie, and a few other topics.Cory gets it!

Jan Brewer, probably the least favorite governor Ive covered on PJM, is here to let you know that shes not above running for a third term. Its unclear on what merits she thinks she deserves a third try. But, whatever.That gives the people of Arizona ample time to pack their sh*t, call the movers, and high-tail it out of the state if she is serious. Ask questions later people!Her support of SB 1070 alone makes her a terrible leader all by itself. This is the bill that she signed into law making it a crime for illegal immigrants to be in Arizona. It would have also allowed any person suspected of being illegal to be stopped for questioning. Well, the Supreme Court struck down most of the law. But, Jan was right out front supporting it before they sat her down.In addition, her disrespect of President Obama, bumbling responses about her job qualifications, and chewing out reporters for asking simple questions have all made me more than tired of seeing her run Arizona. I dont even live in the state and I want her gone.The people of Arizona need to have a long talk with Jesus if they re-elect that woman. Im gonna believe that they dont love themselves if it happens.Continue ReadingNorth Korea Gets Ballsy With New Rocket LaunchPosted on 12.

And water is wet.The nation launched its second long-range missile this year off of its western coast. The rocket is said to have passed over Japan and much of the East China Sea and is expected to land east of thePhilippines.Officials from North Korea say that the missile is supposed to put a satellite into space. However, several countries in the international community offered an immediate side-eye to that. They believe that NoKo is testing its long-range missile capabilities  you know, to blow up countries and people if the need ever arose for them. [insert sarcasm]South Korea and Japan are not happy with the rocket launch. The latter country put its military on alert. South Korea, which shares the Korean Peninsula with the North, stays on alert everyday because the two countries are still technically in a war from the Korean War days.The first rocket launch of this year, in April, ended with the rocket exploding and breaking up over the sea only minutes after taking off.Expect to hear more members of the international community publicly bash North Koreas bold move. Not too much they can do about it, though, since NoKo is such a closed-off nation.How North Korea barely has electricity but can launch rockets is beyond me.Continue ReadingMichigan Lawmakers Shove Through Right to Work Bill Amid ProtestsPosted on 11. Dec, 2012 by  Stevie.138670http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prunejuicemedia.com%2F2012%2Fmichigan-lawmakers-shove-through-right-to-work-bill-amid-protests%2FMichigan+Lawmakers+Shove+Through+%27Right+to+Work%27+Bill+Amid+Protests2012-12-12+02%3A05%3A30Steviehttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.prunejuicemedia.com%2F%3Fp%3D13867(Photo by AP)Michigan lawmakers know that some people in their state are about to revolt at any given second.I could be exaggerating a bit, but thats the feeling that came out of Lansing on Tuesday. Controversial Right to Work legislation was forced through the states House of Representatives without a committee hearing or public input.Both opponents and supporters were closely watching two bills  one dealing with public sector employees and the other for those in the private sector. The measures passed 58-51 for the public sector bill. The other had a 58-52 total in favor of change. Six Republicans joined the entire body of Democratic lawmakers in opposing the bill, but their efforts were not enough.Crowds outside the state Capitol were at record levels. Police estimated that 12,500 people descended on Lansing to voice their opinions either for or against the union bills.Many may wonder how and why this new law in Michigan is so important all of a sudden. Well, the legislation was forced through by Republican legislators and signed by Gov. Rick Snyder on Tuesday. Snyder is also a Republican.Also, remember that Michigan is the birthplace of the union movement. Estimates say that there are over 700,000 union members in the state. The auto industry was born there and has been employing union members for decades. Michigan is the mothership of the union movement being dealt a major blow to the institution that has defined its employment base.The Right to Work legislation will take effect around March 2013. It will then be illegal for unions to force people into membership through payments. Union supporters view this as enabling freeloaders  people who they view as getting union benefits without paying the price. It is also viewed as another attempt to weaken union workers, as has been tried in other Midwestern states.Now that the people and Democratic lawmakers are riled up against the newly-passed legislation, I wonder how they will repeal it. Doesnt look like many Republican legislators will budge on it.Michigan is now the 24th state to have Right to Work laws in place. Its a pretty sad day for organized labor in the state.Continue ReadingCory Booker Eyes New Jersey Gubernatorial Or Senate RunPosted on 10. Dec, 2012 by  Stevie.138580http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prunejuicemedia.com%2F2012%2Fcory-booker-eyes-new-jersey-gubernatorial-or-senate-run%2FCory+Booker+Eyes+New+Jersey+Gubernatorial+Or+Senate+Run2012-12-10+21%3A42%3A59Steviehttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.prunejuicemedia.com%2F%3Fp%3D13858(Photo by Getty Images)Popular Newark, New Jersey Mayor Cory Booker has his sights set on one of two new political positions, and Im totally here for it.Rumors are circling that Booker could challenge his states Gov. Chris Christie in 2014. Or, even better, he could try for a U.S. Senate run in the same year for the current seat held by Democrat Frank Lautenberg. In the case of Christie, people are saying that he may try to run for president which would create a vacancy anyway (if thats true).Either position would work well for Bookers rising star. No one believed that he was only destined to be Newarks mayor and thats it. I mean, he has appeared on Oprahs Next Chapter and is a regular on NBCs Meet the Press. Not a lot of mayors are getting that kind of heavy press, especially in from a small(er) city like Newark.Im a Cory Booker fan. Point blank period. Its rare you find someone thats as genuine as he is about SERVICE to the community. He tweets residents, shovels snow, checks on seniors, and even rescued one of his constituents from a burning building.Most recently, he is finishing up a seven-day challenge of living within the restrictions of the federal governments Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Hes trying to call attention to potential cuts that would be made to the program if the federal governments fiscal cliff situation is not resolved by December 31.Booker says he should be ready to announce his intentions for a gubernatorial bid within the next 10 days. Ill be waiting***ANSWER IN THE COMMENTS SECTION BELOW:What do you think about Cory Booker seeking higher office? Which position should he go for?Continue Reading Older Entries Keep Up With Prune Juice MediaPolitics / Current EventsElection 2012International AffairsWTF Moments2012 Voter InfoSocial IssuesPJM on YouTubeMiscellaneousFriday FunnyMedia ThoughtsOff TopicPhoto of the DayQuote of the DayAbout Prune Juice MediaBlogrollMediaAdvertise With UsSend Us An EmailPopularCommentsTagsMichelle Obama Appears at the Kids' Choice Awards (PHOTOS)Herman Cain Says Obama Is Not a "Real Black Man"Discussion - Mississippi Teens Charged With Racial KillingRick Perry Leased Former "Niggerhead" Ranch in TX911 EMERGENCY - Harold Ford, Jr. Needs a Barber!!!Meet Arnold Schwarzenegger's Jump-offSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas Likes a Good Threesomeybl: These priorities, but truth is we ain't no be...Vernon Hamilton: It has been said that this issue has been resolve ...click here: Great post.
