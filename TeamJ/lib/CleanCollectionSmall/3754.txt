After taking over a 3-13 club on January 11, 1999, Reid has been simply masterful in turning the Eagles into one of the NFL's elite teams.  In 2008, Reid became the 37th head coach in NFL history to reach the 100-win plateau with a 27-14 victory over the Falcons on Oct. 28. In addition, he became the 22nd coach to win 100 games with one franchise and the 17th coach to reach the century mark in wins during his first stint as a head coach.  Reid is the 18th coach in NFL history to remain with this original team for 10-or-more years, and since 1990, is one of five first-time head coaches to do so: Reid (since 1999), Fisher (since 1994), Brian Billick (1999-2007 with Balitmore), Bill Cowher (1992-2006 with Pittsburgh), and Dennis Green (1992-2001 with Minnesota).  "What Andy Reid has done is remarkable," Hall of Fame coach Marv Levy said, "especially in light of the salary cap and free agency and the inability to maintain continuity. What I like most about him is he's level headed. It doesn't concern him who gets the credit. He's not concerned with puffery. His teams are sound fundamentally, and most important, he picked a great coaching staff for them. I admire the man."  In 2006, Reid overcame a 5-6 start and the loss of two of their most explosive players in quarterback Donovan McNabb and defensive end Jevon Kearse in leading the team to season-ending, five-game win streak to capture the NFC East division championship.  The 2004 Eagles clinched the NFC East title with five games remaining in the regular season and the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs after a 13-1 start. Along the way, Reid passed Greasy Neale (66) for the most wins in franchise history. The Eagles earned their first trip to the Super Bowl since 1980 after defeating Atlanta in the NFC Championship game.  In 2003, the Eagles overcame a 0-2 start and a slew of injuries to post their second consecutive 12-win season. During that season, Reid registered his 50th career win (in his 81st game) to become the fastest coach in team history to reach that milestone. A year earlier, Reid was the overwhelming choice as the NFL's coach of the year as the Eagles thrived without the services of McNabb to still capture home field advantage in the NFC playoffs.  After a 5-11 mark in his first season, Reid led the 2000 Eagles to the greatest turnaround in franchise history, finishing 2nd in the NFC East at 11-5 and earning a trip to the NFC Divisional Playoffs. For his efforts, Reid was named the NFL's coach of the year by the Maxwell Football Club, The Sporting News, and Football Digest.  His vision, his dedication, his passion, and his organizational skills are impeccable. For those reasons he was promoted to head coach/executive VP of football operations on May 8, 2001.  Eagles Chairman/CEO Jeffrey Lurie said, "I've always said, he's like a CEO on the field. He understands the big picture and the short-term picture. You have to always balance the two. Disciplined. Prepared. Smart. It's an awfully good combination.  "Andy has intellectual capital. He has no ego. To him, it's all about building team community. He's comfortable with himself. He's not paranoid, worried about what others think or report. He's genuine and people follow that."  Reid came to the Eagles after spending seven seasons as an assistant coach with Green Bay under Mike Holmgren. During that span, the Packers reached the playoffs six times and defeated New England in Super Bowl XXXI.  "Everyone who works with him and plays for him knows exactly where he is coming from," said team president Joe Banner. "We wanted someone with a strong set of convictions and who wasn't going to be affected by ups and downs and public pressure."  Climbing the Coaching Ladder:Reid enjoyed a two-year stint as the Packers quarterbacks coach, working with Brett Favre from 1997-98. Reid took over that role after Marty Mornhinweg departed to become San Francisco's offensive coordinator under Steve Mariucci, the original quarterbacks coach on Holmgren's staff.  In 1997, Green Bay won its 2nd straight NFC crown and Favre garnered league MVP honors for the third consecutive season. Prior to tutoring Green Bay's quarterbacks, Reid oversaw the tight ends, while assisting offensive line coach Tom Lovat. Under Reid's watch, Mark Chmura and Keith Jackson earned trips to the Pro Bowl.  It was in his first years with Green Bay that Holmgren urged Reid to learn the entire offensive system, not just the roles of the offensive line and tight ends. "It was his curiosity, the questions he would ask, his note taking," said Holmgren. "He was just a sponge."  In fact, Holmgren placed the "supervisory" tag on Reid in 1996 to prevent NFL clubs from hiring him as anything other than a head coach unless given permission.  A tackle and guard at Brigham Young University from 1979-81, Reid entered the coaching ranks as a graduate assistant under LaVell Edwards in 1982. It was at BYU that Reid met and worked with Holmgren, who served as the quarterbacks coach.  Reid next moved to San Francisco State in 1983 and helped them lead the nation in passing and total offense three consecutive years (1983-85). He went on to develop quality offensive lines at Northern Arizona, Texas-El Paso, and Missouri.  Personal:Born Andrew Walter Reid in Los Angeles on March 19, 1958, Reid has an older brother, Reginald. Raised not far from Dodger Stadium, Reid was a devoted fan of both the Dodgers and Rams (Merlin Olsen and Deacon Jones in particular). He went on to attend John Marshall High School in LA and Glendale (CA) Junior College (where he was inducted into that school's Hall of Fame in 2003) before matriculating to Brigham Young University where he earned both a bachelor's degree in physical education and a master's degree in professional leadership in physical education and athletics.  As a player at BYU, Reid was also a columnist for the Provo Daily Herald. "I had my own little column," said Reid, who once longed to be a writer for Sports Illustrated. "I loved Jim Murray (a long-time columnist with the Los Angeles Times). I wrote one of these cutesy deals, trying to write like Jim. (laughing) The editors took it easy on me. I enjoyed writing. I still do. I keep a journal to this day. It's a great release."  It was at a physical education class at BYU that Reid met the woman who would become his wife, Tammy. "What attracted me to him more than anything was his character. He's just a really good guy, very honorable and very conscientious." Reid converted to the Mormon faith in 1979 which Tammy and her family had practiced.
