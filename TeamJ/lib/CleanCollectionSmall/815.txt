Gasp! He's an English major! I can haz mocha latte? Har har har. Luckily, I also managed to snatch a journalism minor while I was in college and got a job as a journalist. While the news is a rather enjoyable venture, I'd much rather be an author. Still working on that though. I guess I could still come up with the plot and create storyboards for any potential cartoons I create one day. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you had the chance to go back to college and get a diploma, what program would you choose?  by  looking-for-educatioin  AskReddit[+]Newshole 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]Newshole 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agoAnimation. I wanted to be a cartoonist so badly when I was younger. But the closest Art Institute only wanted realism in my portfolio. Dammit, if I wanted realistic things, I'd take a blasted picture of it. Let me put my own spin on what I see!And it was too expensive to pursue. permalinksavecontextfull comments3123I love this little girl's reaction to seeing Santa (i.imgur.com)submitted 14 hours ago by Newshole to picscommentsharecancelloading...Shooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours agoJournalist here as well. There's nothing inherently wrong with interviewing people if they want to be interviewed.But your personal ethics do come into play with what to ask. Many other reporters that I see and work with just have no off switch. Personally, I don't think I'd be approaching kids for an interview. I can't source them anyway. Parents though, are fair.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy NASL4 Photo Album.

But I added a little backstory to my feelings about it for fun.I'd be a little miffed if I didn't get anything from someone, but I gotta be honest: I had a lot of fun stalking my secret Santa, figuring out what they would have liked and finally shipping it today. I had a smile across my face when I left the post office. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFor my Secret Santa, I just got your message saying you sent your present.  by  GoddamnMuffinManin  secretsanta[+]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoThere's no substance in that! I personally like the mystery and wonder of who has me. I prefer to think its some benevolent person watching my moves on reddit, trying to figure me out. Although, there is a clue that someone is watching, waiting and most definitely judging when your gray box has a date beneath it, which is the last time your secret Santa viewed your details. Mine apparently hasn't looked since Nov. 26. Also, this is my first time participating and it never crossed my mind to say howdy. I never sent my secret Santa a message until today to let them know their package was on the way. But my secret Santa has yet to send me a message either. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFor my Secret Santa, I just got your message saying you sent your present.  by  GoddamnMuffinManin  secretsanta[+]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoDon't get down. I'm in the same boat. And until literally just today, my match was in the boat with us too, but I sent out my secret Santa's item earlier. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the best news you've gotten in 2012?  by  Faranyain  AskReddit[+]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoI got a bite from an employer today.

I never even considered using it for that. And to think, I was going to buy a stand from ThinkGeek just the other night to prop my phone on.Thanks pal, you just saved me $4 + shipping. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSPIKE'S VGAs REVEALS DARK SOULS II!!!!!!!!  by  deadroninin  darksouls[+]Newshole 7 points8 points9 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 7 points8 points9 points 7 days agoHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGpermalinksavecontextfull commentsIntroducing Liquid`Dota 2!  by  tree-huggerin  DotA2[+]Newshole 10 points11 points12 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 10 points11 points12 points 7 days agoI'm the same here, just been playing Dota 2 for a bit longer.

While I grew up with the SNES and loved all of the games I played on it (Secret of Mana is one of my favorite games of all time), it wasn't until I played Phantasy Star Online for Dreamcast and later on GameCube that I absolutely fell in love with it as a hobby.I got them very shortly after launch, and since I'm 25 now, I was around 12 or 13 when video games became my main go-to source of entertainment.PSO was astonishing and I've still to this day never found a game that could compete with it. At its core, PSO is a basic, shallow, violent scavenger hunt. But I loved it and still do. Maybe its sentiment? My love for PSO may stem from having met two of my best friends on that game more than a decade ago; two friends whom I still keep in contact with and visit every few months.It's hard to say for sure why I love PSO, but its without a doubt the first game that made me play for hours on end and want to keep playing more and more games. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCelebrity guests on Miiverse  by  1338h4xin  wiiu[+]Newshole 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoYeah I saw that one on there too.

I'm about halfway done with the game, or so I thought. Pretty excited that I still have 50 stages (Holy crap!) left before I beat it. And the challenges! Good god do they live up to that name. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan watch "Some" live streams on WiiU  by  elitespyin  wiiu[+]Newshole 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoThat's so weird to me.

Most of the time, Grubby shows masterful play. But sometimes, he makes the silliest mistakes. It's so frustrating. But fuck me that was a good tournament. Sting deserved the win.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust got a Wii U, and it is getting lots of errors during the update. Is this normal?  by  trumpeterbuizelin  wiiu[+]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 23 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 23 days agoExactly this. I lost connection about six times during the firmware update and just continued trying it out. It saves progress so you don't lose much time besides restarting it. Make sure, however, that when you're INSTALLING the update that the console doesn't lose power. That's how they get bricked. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are your small complaints about the system and or its apps?  by  feedjoecakein  wiiu[+]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 23 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 23 days agoI don't know the names for the icons just by appearance. As such, I find myself having to click and open everything hoping I get it right. I wish I could hold the stylus down on an icon and its name would pop up, letting me know what I'm about to open. permalinksavecontextfull comments100 characters too short?  by  DarkOnyx7in  wiiu[+]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 24 days ago (0 children)[]Newshole 1 point2 points3 points 24 days ago140 would be the sweet spot. Mainly because it acts a ton like twitter already and people are used to how that works. 100 does seem a bit limiting. As is the tiny little status you can set for yourself on your friends list. Its like, 20? permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
