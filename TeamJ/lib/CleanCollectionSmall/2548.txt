And not just because of shootings.  permalinksaveparent[+]ac3raven -1 points0 points1 point 45 minutes ago (3 children)[]ac3raven -1 points0 points1 point 45 minutes agoYou can have the best mental healthcare in the universe and you'd still see events like this shooting.permalinksaveparent[+]benlew 3 points4 points5 points 28 minutes ago (2 children)[]benlew 3 points4 points5 points 28 minutes agoI disagree. In almost all cases, people who do things like this have a mental illness.  Adequate mental healthcare can identify those problems, work to solve them, and protect the public from people who are dangerous.permalinksaveparent[+]ac3raven 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (1 child)[]ac3raven 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoIt can do this for 100% of humans?  Unlikely.  In can prevent 100% of school shootings?  Unlikely.permalinksaveparent[+]benlew 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]benlew 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoYou said the best mental healthcare in the universe. I believe it could.  Especially with new technology, a greater understanding of the human brain, better brain scans, and better drugs to keep chemical levels in the brain normal. The portion of those with mental illnesses that actually act on them in this manner is extremely tiny. If everyone was medically treated as well as possible then I believe shootings could be prevented.permalinksaveparent[+]Gorillaz_Noodle  comment score below threshold (2 children)[]Gorillaz_Noodle -6 points-5 points-4 points 36 minutes agoIt's not a rare answer.We have good mental health care, it's just that people with mental health problems aren't going.permalinksaveparent[+]Mewshimyo 10 points11 points12 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]Mewshimyo 10 points11 points12 points 23 minutes agoWe have good mental health care available if you can afford it.  When certain psych drugs are nearly 10 grand a year, and regular psych visits are 100+ dollars in a rural (cheap) area, many of the people most affected by mental illness simply can't afford to go.Also, there's a huge stigma attached to being mentally ill, speaking from experience on it.  It's one of the few things where you can still be 'legitimately' discriminated on, even though it's illegal.We need to make psych screening more available, and make psych services more affordable.permalinksaveparent[+]cardiomegaly 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]cardiomegaly 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes agoWe have good mental health care, it's just that people with mental health problems aren't going.What are you basing this off? Please cite something.I don't have any actual data or literature, but I have talked to practicing psychiatrists and social workers who have said the exact opposite. permalinksaveparent[+]gobeavs1 29 points30 points31 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]gobeavs1 29 points30 points31 points 1 hour agoThis is the answer. permalinksaveparent[+]dkinmn 3 points4 points5 points 19 minutes ago (1 child)[]dkinmn 3 points4 points5 points 19 minutes agoI disagree. It isn't the services, it's that friends and family for not openly advocate for them when there is someone who needs one. Mental health services are available. It's that crazies don't use them. You can have all the programs and spend all of the money in the world, but if the people who need them aren't going it doesn't do a hell of a lot of good. permalinksaveparent[+]gobeavs1 2 points3 points4 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]gobeavs1 2 points3 points4 points 10 minutes agoEarly identification of warning signs is part of it but it still boils down to stigma and access to mental health and general healthcare services. permalinksaveparent[+]HeroicGomez -1 points0 points1 point 56 minutes ago (1 child)[]HeroicGomez -1 points0 points1 point 56 minutes agoWay more complicated than that, or availability of guns.permalinksaveparent[+]Only_A_Username -2 points-1 points0 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]Only_A_Username -2 points-1 points0 points 13 minutes agoBut we need guns to protect our chil... oh wait. I know that was blunt, and cold, but I live near there, friends of mine have been effected by this, and I just need to let out some steam.None of this has been directed at you, like I said, just being angry and feeling helpless. permalinksaveparent[+]samsterlicious 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes ago (0 children)[]samsterlicious 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes agoservices meant to make people conform and assimilate with the masses. just another brick in the wall. hope we can all learn from this tragedy. RIP kidspermalinksaveparent[+]busted_up_chiffarobe 1 point2 points3 points 37 minutes ago (0 children)[]busted_up_chiffarobe 1 point2 points3 points 37 minutes agoThis, and also societal stress, IMHO caused by increased awareness/media coverage/projection of bad news, the economic downturn, job loss, loss of hope, and general breakdown of respect and societal values. All of which can push someone who may be in need of help over the edge. permalinksaveparent[+]gDAnother 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]gDAnother 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes agocombined with easy access to guns, yes.permalinksaveparent[+]newtothelyte 1 point2 points3 points 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]newtothelyte 1 point2 points3 points 29 minutes agoNot only that but diminishing mental health service as well.

Just because a rifle is hard to conceal doesn't mean its any less lethal.permalinksaveparent[+]Solkre -1 points0 points1 point 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]Solkre -1 points0 points1 point 25 minutes agoNo, this is obviously just a gun control issue! </retard>permalinksaveparent[+]holzy444 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]holzy444 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes agooh god, if only it was that simple permalinksaveparent[+]Whipfather 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]Whipfather 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes agoExactly.permalinksaveparent[+]yetanotherpoop 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (0 children)[]yetanotherpoop 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoAs someone who was in a mental health center for a suicide attempt, you are totally correct. There were people there with a bevy of different mental issues and some of them who didn't have families had no place to go. So when they were discharged, they were sent to a homeless shelter. A FUCKING HOMELESS SHELTER!! Just to lay on a cot and be there. They were thrown away like trash because they have a chemical imbalance that they have no control over? it is really so sad to see this and the judgement from others too. Being called crazy hurts. it isn't like we can control depression or turn it off. But you are right, a lot of it is mental health. A lot is educating the staff too because they were discharging people who I did NOT think should be discharged. I mean, they needed to be in a safe environment to them and to others. permalinksaveparent[+]xafimrev 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]xafimrev 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoAnd people demonizing people who are mentally ill as evil as you will no doubt find in this thread and in the media over the next couple of weeks.permalinksaveparent[+]WideLight 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes ago (0 children)[]WideLight 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes agoIsolation, even though we live so close together.  Anomie, I think, is the appropriate term.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist -2 points-1 points0 points 54 minutes ago (1 child)[]Butthole_Scientist -2 points-1 points0 points 54 minutes agoIs there something about our society that creates mentally disturbed and violent people? What is it? Social isolation? Genetics? permalinksaveparent[+]elevatedmovemENT 12 points13 points14 points 31 minutes ago (0 children)[]elevatedmovemENT 12 points13 points14 points 31 minutes agoWhen the American Dream is used as a benchmark rather than a motivator, and it causes unhealthy individuals to feel slighted when they aren't getting what they deem to be their just dues.  When others use their freedom to isolate and intimidate.  When teachers (or anyone) are unable to discipline children (or anyone) who take it too far and teach them that actions have repercussions.  When we are a reactionary society brought about by sterilization and analysis over preemptive pro-community society  brought about by interaction and common sense.It's a myriad of thing and we've almost lawyered ourselves into a corner.  We don't need legislation, or increased security at schools, or armed guards or concealed Carry permits for schools, which is what the media will focus on. Instead, we need community, and inclusion rather than competition and isolation.  permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
