I will put at least some of the blame of this at the feet of the media though. The sensationalizing of the mall shooting in Oregon. The plastering of the shooters face all over the news only incites more people who have serious mental issues to go out and do the same. Im against outright banning, the fact that police weren't around to stop this tells you everything you need to know about relying on their protection. There should be more over site into the mental faculties of people purchasing firearms though.permalinksaveparent[+]egonil 5 points6 points7 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)[]egonil 5 points6 points7 points 56 minutes agoPeople rely too heavily on the police.  The police are under no obligation to protect you.  The big problem that is causing this is a violent culture and a serious lack of mental health outreach.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 13 minutes agoNo obligation? I'm not 100% on that.  But it is true that people rely too heavily, police can't be everywhere at once.I think violent culture and l lack of support for these people is the issuepermalinksaveparent[+]tomdarch 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]tomdarch 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour agoIt's absurd that this person claimed that anyone is saying that elementary school students should be running around with guns.  In reality, certain people have been saying that all the teachers should be running around with guns all the time in order to "prevent" these school shootings.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes agoTo me forcing teachers to carry would be a little extreme, (but they have a point)However I think the teachers that want to, and can legally and responsible should be allowed to defend themselves and their studentspermalinksaveparent[+]weric91 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]weric91 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes agoHow about police in schools. We need more of them. When seconds count police are just minutes away. permalinksaveparent[+]jotch 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (0 children)[]jotch 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoWhen I was 10 years old I knew how to take my rifle apart, clean it, and put it back together. I knew the ethics surrounding the use of my firearm. I knew how to shoot it, I knew how to inspect it. I knew how to handle it in public.This shooter clearly did none of those things because his parents never exposed him to firearms and he never learned the ethics that go along them. He could also just be a severely sick individual who the system failed. Blaming guns is a hotshot answer and all it does is add to the media attention that this shooter was looking to achieve.permalinksaveparent[+]adams551 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (0 children)[]adams551 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoIt's nearly always twenty somethings. They've not had time to grow up, to experience life and have children of their own or to have committed the inevitable crime that will make ease of gun access hard to begin with. In all honesty as someone who leans more toward gun rights I would be in full support of a ban on high capacity anything being sold to anyone under 30. Give the crazy time to come out before allowing easy access.permalinksaveparent[+]horsesemen 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)[]horsesemen 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes agoTo be honest, I've felt like the media has been uncharacteristically classy with the Colorado shooter. They gave him exactly zero exposure. It makes me wonder a bit if that request wasn't handed down from on high, like from the President or something.permalinksaveparent[+]heliosdiem 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]heliosdiem 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agopolice weren't around to stop this tells you everything you need to know about relying on their protection.As a country, haven't we systematically cut back on many police jobs and coverage? Especially in the wake of recession and local/state  government bankruptcies. I know they dismantled my small town's police department to save money, and now the state police take forty-five minutes to an hour to respond to a call.permalinksaveparent[+]I3addog -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 hour ago (21 children)[]I3addog -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 hour agoForty percent of guns are sold without any background checks. Good place to start ?permalinksaveparent[+]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoBack that up please.  You can not buy a firearm from an FFL without a NICS check.    That's the law, sorry, but no way around that. Also, Felons are not allowed to buy guns, so if they get them, then it's illegal, so making private sale illegal is not going to stop them from buying anything, as they were breaking the law before hand anyway. permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoI think it's taking into account private sales... which I agree banning wouldn't do anything but make it harder for law abiding citizens to buy/sell used guns.Felons who want them will pay, and every man has his pricepermalinksaveparent[+]tajmaballs 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes ago (0 children)[]tajmaballs 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes agoHint:  You are perfectly able to buy firearms from nonlicensees without an NICS check.permalinksaveparent[+]Phiiseverywhere -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (5 children)[]Phiiseverywhere -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoI live in a state with background checks and have no problem with them whatsoever. permalinksaveparent[+]I3addog -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 hour ago (4 children)[]I3addog -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 hour agoGo to a gun show, chances are the state you live in allow sellers at gun shows to sell without background checks.permalinksaveparent[+]mapachethegreat 4 points5 points6 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)[]mapachethegreat 4 points5 points6 points 56 minutes agoMost sales at gun shows are by dealers (holders of a federal firearms license) who must perform the check as per federal law. Sales by other individuals don't require a check, and these can happen anywhere, not just at gun shows. That said, people tend to be careful to whom they sell a gun, since you may not sell to someone you suspect may not legally be able to own or buy one.permalinksaveparent[+]endlessmilk 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]endlessmilk 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoI won't sell a gun to anyone without a permit to purchase or a ccw, even if it's a long gun. permalinksaveparent[+]dougbdl 0 points1 point2 points 46 minutes ago (1 child)[]dougbdl 0 points1 point2 points 46 minutes agoIf there is one place with no background checks, then there is essentially no background checks. Fuck the NRA.permalinksaveparent[+]I3addog -2 points-1 points0 points 37 minutes ago (0 children)[]I3addog -2 points-1 points0 points 37 minutes agoIt's called the Gun Show loophole. Here's a quote from one of the columbine shooters. "If we can save up about $200 real quick...we can go to the next gun show and find a private dealer and buy ourselves some bad-ass AB-10 machine pistols."- Columbine killer Eric Harris, who was 17 years old at the time The 1994 Brady Act introduced an essential law enforcement tool to help keep guns out of the hands of criminals:  background checks.*google guns sold without background checkspermalinksaveparent[+]ogenrwot 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (9 children)[]ogenrwot 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoSource please.

This is just some guy quoting a 15 year old survey that wasn't named or cited.permalinksaveparent[+]rocketvat -2 points-1 points0 points 13 minutes ago*(2 children)[]rocketvat -2 points-1 points0 points 13 minutes ago*While politifact's reputation isn't exactly perfect it's a little more than just "some guy" saying it.  They looked into it and said it was pretty much true, even if they couldn't pin down an exact figure (due to regulations preventing such an accounting).  If you don't want to believe it that's fine, but there's more to it than you're pretending.permalinksaveparent[+]new_math 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (1 child)[]new_math 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes agoFor creditability's sake, I am a statistics graduate from Rice (world ranked research institution). From an academic perspective it is completely unacceptable to use a 15 year old unnamed source without even knowing the exact numbers from the unnamed source. If you presented this before someone in an academic setting and knew nothing about the source you would literally be asked to sit down. If you want to cite a statistic you need sources, transparent methodology, and reasons why the statistic is relevant with respect to any differences between the study and what it's being applied towards.permalinksaveparent[+]rocketvat 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]rocketvat 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoWe aren't in an academic setting.  It's a discussion on the internet and I didn't even make the claim.  Just trying to help out.Point is it's not an "absurd" claim.  permalinksaveparent[+]hydrogenous 1 point2 points3 points 37 minutes ago (2 children)[]hydrogenous 1 point2 points3 points 37 minutes agoBloomberg quotes are not objective.
