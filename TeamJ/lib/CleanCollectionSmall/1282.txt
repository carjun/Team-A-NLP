See More another child's eye view, we hear from the children inside that school, and this evening it's 9-year-old ethan and 9-year-old ben, twins brothers, in different parts of the school when the shots rang out. Everyone thought that it was an animal. When we heard gunshots, we all huddled into my teacher's office. Everybody was quiet. When the policeman came in to get us, he told us to close our eyes and do this. And run. And just go out. When I went to the fire department, when I didn't see ethan, I was like, oh, my god, what happened to my brother? Is he okay? When I finally found ethan, i was very, very relieved and we stuck together. As you can see there from their story, they put their hands on their shoulders. Their teachers and school staff did all of the right things here. Sandy hook elementary school is ranked as one of the best schools in the country. It leads the question if it can happen here, what can it be done to stop it from happening at this school and every other school across the country? Reporter: The newton school district decided to spend 10 times more on security training for staff this year according to budget documents. Measures that did not prevent an unthinkable attack but training that may have limited the damage. We practiced it, and they knew what to do, and you just think about protecting the kids, and just doing the right thing. Reporter: Clerk mary ann jacob says she had been drilled to send the kids in the library to a back closet between bookshelves, an emergency plan developed in advance. You have to have a certain amount of fire drills, and evacuation drills, and a certain amount of lockdown drills, so the kids know the routine, and the teachers know the routine, and everyone has a spot in the room where they are supposed to go. Reporter: New to the plan this year at sandy hook elementary a letter to parents telling them no more open campus, even for them. Installation of a security camera above the front entry door. Picture i.D. If you are not recognized. Security measures recommended for all schools and used nationwide as the gold standard in safety. Sounds as though the school had security measures at the door, that they had staff that we were trained with lock-down procedures, and in some cases, staff who stepped in front of a bullet perhaps to protect a child's life. We can do our best to prevent incidents, we have to do our best to be prepared to manage those incidents. Unfortunately, tragedies still occur. Safety experts say that this is not the week for parents to be frightened for sending their kids back to school. Every school in the country will be looking at their security plans this week. It's the future they need to worry about. 0Comment on this videoABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSshows:GMAGMA LIVE!GMA Recipes GMA Concert SeriesWorld NewsWorld News with David MuirNightline20/20Most Fascinating People Primetime NightlineDiane Sawyer SpecialsPrimetimeThis WeekWhat Would You Do?World News NowABC News NowPlaylist:World News: 12/14/12World News: 12/13/12World News: 12/12/12World News: 12/11/12World News: 12/10/12Person of the WeekWorld News ReportsWorld News ExtraHome > Video > World News > World News ReportsConnecticut Shooting Tragedy:  The VictimsConnecticut Shooting Tragedy:  The VictimsFamilies trying to comfort one another in a community that lost so many innocent lives.Connecticut Shooting Tragedy:  The InvestigationConnecticut Shooting Tragedy:  The InvestigationA fuller picture of what happened in the gunman's rampage is emerging.Connecticut Shooting Tragedy:  The ShooterConnecticut Shooting Tragedy:  The ShooterInvestigators trying to understand why he targeted such young school children.Connecticut Shooting Tragedy:  Two Brothers' Escape Connecticut Shooting Tragedy:  Two Brothers' Escape The story of two brave brothers and how they escaped to safety.Connecticut Shooting Tragedy:  Remembering the VictimsConnecticut Shooting Tragedy:  Remembering the VictimsThe beloved principal, her tweets and the hero teachers.Concussion Keeps Clinton From Testifying on BenghaziConcussion Keeps Clinton From Testifying on BenghaziHillary Clinton recovering after she fainted; will postpone Libya testimony.Connecticut Shooting Tragedy:  Looking for HopeConnecticut Shooting Tragedy:  Looking for HopeA community struggling with shock and grief still finds strength and a glimmer of hope.Newtown, Connecticut Shooting: 27 Killed, Gunman DeadNewtown, Connecticut Shooting: 27 Killed, Gunman DeadChris Cuomo has the latest details from Sandy Hook Elementary School.Connecticut Shooting: Teacher Kaitlin Roig Protected Her StudentsConnecticut Shooting: Teacher Kaitlin Roig Protected Her StudentsTeacher rushed 15 small children into the bathroom as shots rang out.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Speaking to Children About the TragedySandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Speaking to Children About the TragedyDr. Richard Besser offers advice on how to explain news, images of shooting to kids.Connecticut Shooting: Sandy Hook Teachers' Reactions to GunshotsConnecticut Shooting: Sandy Hook Teachers' Reactions to GunshotsAmy Robach on how teachers hurried to save student's lives.Connecticut Shooting: Survivors Offer Firsthand Accounts of TragedyConnecticut Shooting: Survivors Offer Firsthand Accounts of TragedyDan Harris discusses the day's violent events with those who lived through it.1 of 5 | Next External links are provided for reference purposes.
