With that group of 10 people playing games for 24 hours, we raised $2,740 for our local hospitals. Together, Extra Life participants raised over $1.2 million to help kids. This year we'd like to go much bigger.What is Extra Life?The Extra Life marathon works a lot like other charity marathons. People sign up and get their friends and family to sponsor them to raise funding towards a cause. But instead of running or biking a marathon, we play a marathon of games for 24 hours.Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a non-profit international organization that treats sick kids, regardless of a family's ability to pay. CMN is a very reputable charity program, and has been rated highly [charitynavigator.org] by evaluating agencies.How to participateTo join, go to extra-life.org/team/reddit (or another team of your choosing) and click "Join This Team". During the sign-up you will choose which CMN Hospital you will be raising money for. Follow that up by spreading the word and asking friends and family to sponsor you for the marathon. Also, visit /r/ExtraLife to chat with your fellow teammates.On October 20th at 8AM your local time, sit down (or stand, if you're into that) and play games for 24 hours. You can play anything you like, be it console, PC, board games, or tabletop. Play from your home, or meetup with others. If that specific day and time doesn't work, you're welcome to marathon when it is convenient for you.We'll also be live streaming from the reddit office during the event. Take a peek at our hallowed dungeon while watching us fight off sleep and otherwise embarrass ourselves.As a thank you for participating, any member of team reddit that raises over $100 will receive 2 months of reddit gold for free. Any team member raising more than $300 will get a free reddit t-shirt of their choosing.How to donateTo donate simply choose a player from the team roster and click "Support Me!". Please note that each member chooses the specific hospital that he or she is raising money for.Further InfoAbout Extra LifeExtra Life FAQAbout CMN HospitalsTeam reddit/r/ExtraLifereddit office livestreamdiscuss this post on redditNewer PostOlder PostHomethe reddit blogKeep up with the latest development updates, community announcements, and general reddit tomfoolery.Blog Archive2012(30)          December(1)          November(1)          October(1)September(3)Join us to play games and heal kids - Extra Life 2...reddit Dedicated Day of Service (rDDoS)  This Sat...Internet 2012 Bus Tour - A Campaign to Promote the...
