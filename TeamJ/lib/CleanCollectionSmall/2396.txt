I moved here (Bangor) from Albuquerque, New Mexico, i've never felt threatened or scared in the slightest ANYWHERE at Any time here in Bangor, perhaps living out west has skewed my vision but to be honest I think people here just dont understand.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Cliff Bleszinski, Design Director at Epic Games.

Actually answered the real questions, I hope you finish this IAMA up answering the real, hard hitting questions like they do, dont make this fluffy, to be honest you ARE being compared to other devs now.My question: Why havent you all focused on fixing the lag beyond anything else? Gears remains the laggiest, most hit or miss and bullet sponging game i've ever played, its beyond halo, cod, battlefield ect.. Why cant you solidify the lag and the sponging? The game isnt even big compared to battlefield in size and scale.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJuggalos.

The difference though is if im in my industrial gear I expect people to look at me weird and treat me differently, most jugglo's i've met "want to fit" in despite dressing up in something society views as silly.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPlanetside 2 - Bigots, homophones, racists, anti-semites and general jerks not welcome.  by  j_smedleyin  Planetside[+]FlyingRock 2 points3 points4 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]FlyingRock 2 points3 points4 points 3 months agoUh, This has been happening in very MMO since forever, even RuneScape back in the day would ban you for being any of the above stated if you where caught..

(Maine USA)  by  FlyingRockin  legaladvice[+]FlyingRock[S] 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]FlyingRock[S] 0 points1 point2 points 4 months agoFirst I just want to say my girlfriend Did give me permission to post all this here, so im not going behind her back or anything. Her and the family friend ( well more now deceased relatives friend) are going to contact a lawyer about this next week, i'm mostly here to get ideas and to help calm her nerves/hoping people can show her what she'll more or less expect.When it comes to her sisters father, I know hes not allowed to live anywhere near her sister and it was a bad situation, I don't know much beyond that but I wouldnt really give out that information even if I did. i'm not entirely sure why she got a temporary POA (well the reasoning behind her mom giving it to her) I can ask later today but I believe it more or less has to do with school and her mother at that point in time not wanting to be a mother, as far as her family goes its pretty much what little family they do have refuse to take care of her sister even though they where happy to take in her brothers (who where found without being fed for three days) currently her mom lives in a trailer/mobile home in a state she actually doesnt have a warrant, with a very shady character and has told my girlfriend she wont give POA to anyone ever again without further explanation (I heard both ends of the phone call, very loud woman) oh and Yes they have been in DFACS care, also lived in a youth shelter for a while as well.permalinksavecontextfull comments15012unusual power of attorney situation involving a minor.

Did you start by hosting a small at home server and then work your way up into managing servers or did you "happen into" the job?
