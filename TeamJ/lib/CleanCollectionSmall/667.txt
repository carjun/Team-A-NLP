But I hope it is a little comforting to know that so many people are thinking of you and praying for you. A friend of mine has been mentored by you in the past and is grief-struck. By extension, this tragedy feels closer, more real. Love to you and all the families.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate ChrissCalmdownMix's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate ChrissCalmdownMix's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserShawna Hamilton                3 hours agoMy deepest sympathy to you and your family.
