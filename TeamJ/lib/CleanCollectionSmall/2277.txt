That's ludicrous to automatically dismiss his actions because of supposed vindication - And even if it was, would you rather he has stayed silent in the face of wrongdoing? permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre there any good mom and pop/local restaurants in the Fort Myers area that's not too expensive?  by  Mighty_Morphinin  SWFL[+]b0neshaker 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]b0neshaker 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoCc:Iguana Mia (Texmex)Siam Hut (Thai)Sakuras (Japanese sushi and hibachi...

It really does not matter who reported her, it is the fact her obscene overvalued salary is paid for by students whom in the end are paying a liar. You don't fucking lie about your credentials much less a private institution - Lying is a testament of character and doing it so freely and shamelessly in a professional setting is wholly unacceptable, period. If she was so good at her job before she would not have needed to tell a very big lie to her employer. Dishonesty is ugly and the ex did the right thing to expose her - To discredit his just action is a form of acceptance of the woman's wrongdoing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsU of M social media director resigns after allegations that she lied about receiving her bachelor's degree surface on Reddit  by  SAT0725in  news[+]b0neshaker 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]b0neshaker 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoConsidering she lied and got a 100k a year job for SOCIAL MEDIA, I think it was warranted.
