They reported originally the older brother, now they're saying the younger. One report says the shooter had his older brother's ID, and that led to the confusion. Which, if he was really 20, yeah, he probably had a fake ID using his brother's info ...

My assignments included ghostwriting hockey columns for Mike Keenan and conducting his AOL chats (me on the phone with him, asking questions readers submitted, then typing in answers as him). Every time we talked, he found an excuse to drool over Trevor Linden and yell about something at random.So at this point, who would you say is the NHL coach most likely to go off on a fantastic rant during an interview?permalinksavecontextfull comments"Although the average car's oil change interval is around 7,800 miles, and as high as 20,000 miles in some cars, this wasteful cycle continues largely because the automotive service industry continues to preach the 3,000-mile gospel as a way to keep the service bays busy."  by  barcelonaKIZin  Frugal[+]shatterly 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]shatterly 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThis article is two years old.

Honestly, I like working in higher ed: It's not the grind of standard newswriting, you get a good variety of people/topics to deal with, and if I'm going to "sell" something with my writing, I prefer it be something I believe in ... and while I know there's a lot of debate about whether a college education is worth the money, etc., I do believe in the value of the institutions I've worked for. That's a good feeling. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI got reddit gold and have no idea what it does!  by  shatterlyin  secretsanta[+]shatterly[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]shatterly[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI will!

As someone who moved from journalism to working in higher ed, the change in benefits package was dramatic. At publishing companies, the retirement packages were more like "we'll contribute 2% after one year if you contribute 8% for two years."permalinksavecontextfull commentsI often get called cheap and and get told to "spend my moldy money". Here's where I am today...  by  throwdatawayplz1in  Frugal[+]shatterly 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]shatterly 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoEspecially if it's a public university, that's probably true on salary. But I've worked at several universities that have had fantastic benefits packages. I know of no private company that offers a retirement plan where they contribute 14% of my salary while I don't have to contribute anything. Also, there are usually tuition benefits for the employee, spouse and children that can really add up.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Jn Gnarr, Mayor of Reykjavk. AMA.  by  Fridarflugain  IAmA[+]shatterly 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]shatterly 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoNew Hampshire: The border with Massachusetts is the most populated part of the state--it's pretty much a far suburb of Boston. Biggest city is Manchester (pop. 110,000). Second largest is Nashua (89,000). The capital, Concord, is farther north and less than 45,000 people. I lived in what is technically the smallest city in NH (determined by the form of local government): Franklin, with about 7,000 folks.In comparison, Vermont's largest city, Burlington (up north right next to Canada, pretty close to Montreal) is only the size of Concord NH. South Burlington adds another 17,000 people to that "metro area." The capital of VT, Montpelier, has less than 8,000.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Jn Gnarr, Mayor of Reykjavk.

I spent those three years in New England, including driving in and out of Boston 3-4 times a week.Drivers in Massachusetts and Connecticut are terrifyingly angry and aggressive. Gridlock in Boston has left me in tears when it's taken more than an hour to travel 8 miles on the Mass Pike. Or you get stuck in a tunnel. Ugh.That said, I have NEVER in my life seen so many people run red lights as I have since I got back to Utah. Like, the light has been red for 30 seconds and they DON'T EVEN SLOW DOWN. It's amazing. I commute to Salt Lake from Ogden, and the other day on 89 a person ran a red light pulling off a side street to turn left--with traffic coming straight at them at 60 mph. The car in front of me missed them by a couple feet at best. The mind, it boggles.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the most ridiculous thing someone has ever tried to convince you is true?

My husband made a batch of brownies (years ago when we lived in Boulder, go figure) and I ate half of one while home alone. Even knowing they were pot brownies, and being quite familiar with smoking it, that half a brownie hit me HARD, as others here have described. I spent half an hour worried that I was truly losing my mind, then another three hours listening to music and dancing because that was the one thing that made me forget the scary feeling. Some people also just don't do well with pot. Even smoking, I've had the whole way-too-high "I'm going to forget to breath, so I'm going to die" panic reaction. If I felt like that for absolutely no reason I could think of, yeah, I'd probably end up in the hospital.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone want to learn to make your own hard cider for the holidays?  by  notdeadyetbobin  ogden[+]shatterly 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*(0 children)[]shatterly 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*My husband and I might be up for this.
