Yes Rob Parker sounded like an ass, but he didn't actually call RGIII a "cornball brother" ( what's the exact definition of this anyway), but was more wondering out loud if he was one. I know it's a small difference, but when I read the title I assumed Parker had actually called him what I'm assuming is the equivalent to an Uncle Tom, and that's not exactly what he did.permalinksavecontextfull comments"The Angels have shown interest in R.A.

The offensive production from the Mets outfield last year was atrocious. You're right, Bourjous isn't that good, but he can run, play solid defense, and is certainly an upgrade over Torres. He's good enough to be an every day starter in the NL. Trumbo could hit in the middle of the lineup and give us some power from the corner outfield. I don't like trading Dickey away, but the Mets do have decent depth at pitching and need more outfield production.permalinksavecontextfull comments(Spoilers all) who was the most important figure in the history of the world?  by  Toaaliiin  asoiaf[+]Ace_of_Diamonds 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Ace_of_Diamonds 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoYeah, Aegon truly is a legend, but unlike some mythic individuals such as Bran the Builder and Lann the Clever, he was around relatively recently. The history of Westeros is very long, and Aegon conquered all of Westeros only 300 years before the events of GoT. Of course something about him were exaggerated, but every child in Westros knows the story of the Field of Fire, or his anointment in Oldtown, or Torrhen Stark, the first King of Winter to kneel. Every General after him idolized him. I would say emulated, but no one else really had Dragons... I liked Tywin's line in the show at Harrenhall about how Aegon "changed everything" by bringing dragons. Dany has made numerous reference to conquering all of Westeros exactly like he did, and Varys claims Aegon ( Blackfyre?) VI will do the same thing, everyone wants to just be mentioned in the same sentence as him. And then there's how much he accomplished in such a short time is really remarkable. Consolidating all the Kingdoms ( excluding Dorne), building Kings Landing, creating the office of Hand of the King ( stole that from the wiki haha) He completely changed the world. Yes he had Dragons which must have helped immensely, but I seriously doubt a lesser man would have accomplished half the things he did, dragons or not.permalinksavecontextfull comments(Spoilers all) who was the most important figure in the history of the world?  by  Toaaliiin  asoiaf[+]Ace_of_Diamonds 35 points36 points37 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]Ace_of_Diamonds 35 points36 points37 points 1 day ago*Aegon the Conqueror probably. Almost singlehandedly ( Yes his sisters were very important but he was the Leader of the House Targaryan at the time of the invasion), he changed the face of Westeros. His conquest had serious implications for the Free Cities, as well as Slavers Bay. Nothing was the same after Westeros was united under one King.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen someone is coughing nonstop on the other side of the library.  by  Ace_of_Diamondsin  AdviceAnimals[+]Ace_of_Diamonds[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Ace_of_Diamonds[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoWell murder seemed a tad excessive in this case...permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the most ridiculous thing someone has ever tried to convince you is true?

I would have loved to see him get absolutely leveled by one of them. Either player would have been completely justified too. Fans can't come onto the field like that, it's incredibly dangerous, and the players have no idea what the fan is doing there. For all they know, he could have some sort of weapon hidden on him. Pretty disgraceful act by the fan. I hope he gets banned for life.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJoe Hart stopping a fan running towards Rio Ferdinand.  by  Reflex2011in  soccer[+]Ace_of_Diamonds 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]Ace_of_Diamonds 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoNot sure what the fan planned to do...Joe Hart and Rio Ferdinand are both huge guys.

With no girls and most of your time scheduled, kids did a lot of drugs. One bright group of kids decides it's a good idea to order some Xanax from Pakistan of all places because it was " really cheap". They get the pills,  each take a couple after class and go about their business. About 20 minutes later, they're all passed out randomly around the campus. Turns out they got sent roofies instead of Xanax.Tl;dr A bunch of kids at my school accidentally roofied themselves.Edit: Grammarpermalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
