Police also found .223 shell casings. Lanza was wearing a bullet-proof vest.The shooter's mother, 52-year-old Nancy Lanza, had five weapons registered to her, including a Glock, a Sig Sauer, and a Bushmaster rifle.Police said the Glock, the Sig Sauer and the Bushmaster at the school appeared to be registered to a family member. Authorities are currently completing their checks to see which weapons were used in the slayings, to whom they were registered and how they were obtained.Federal agents are canvassing area gun ranges and gun stories to see if Adam Lanza had visited them for any reason.The Glock and Sig Sauer are popular with law enforcement officers and the military, and are quickly and easily reloaded.Click Here for the Blotter Homepage.
