But we do know that he killed with the guns he cradled in his hands. ... Firearms violence in parts of the U.S. is now more lethal, in population-adjusted terms, than in many theaters of insurgent violence. ... It takea no great deductive genius to understand the link: a violent individual with a gun will be more able to kill, and can kill more people, than a violent individual without a gun. Elsewhere in the world, tighter gun laws have been shown to save lives."Adelle Chua,Manila Standard Today: "The coverage trumped other reports involving children  the continuing crisis in Syria, for instance, the destruction caused by (typhoon) Pablo in Mindanao, and the death of Afghan children who wandered off into a land mine while gathering firewood. Perhaps the world has become desensitized. ...  What happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School is indeed a tragedy. But it is no more of a tragedy than the deaths of other children all over the world from causes ranging from hunger, disaster, disease to both systemic and random violence."The (London) Guardian, editorial: "In any other country, a shooting spree of the sort that took place in Newtown would set off a serious public debate. That's what happened after Dunblane in the United Kingdom ...  and after Anders Behring Breivik's killings in Norway. Nothing like this is now possible in the polarized gun culture of America, where law and politics have been unable to respond to such events for at least 20 years. That is why President Obama's very mild call this weekend for 'meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this' was regarded as so unusual."A.R. Modak,Arab News: "With guns being a prominent feature in American popular culture, the gratuitous display of violence in today's films, needs serious introspection  and could be cited as the single most important factor for the gung-ho behavior among U.S. youths (and adults)!"Sarah Britten,Mail and Guardian, South Africa:  "Why do we care so much about Americans and their guns? ...  We are not directly affected by U.S. gun laws; we aren't even indirectly affected. And our own gun violence figures are much worse. ...  Yet we spend considerable time and energy arguing over it. ...  Why? ...  The gun control debate speaks to the kind of society I and most of the people I interact with online wish to live in: kind, fair, socially liberal. It's not one a lot of South Africans actually do get to experience on a day-to-day basis, but that doesn't mean we can't dream about it. And that ...  is why we care so very much about Americans and their guns."Ira Sharkansky,The Jerusalem Post: "Keeping guns out of the hands of an enthusiast who passes all the tests, but has a relative on the border of something dangerous  as in the case of Nancy Lanza (mother of the shooter)  may be beyond the range of what can be implemented in a society that balances public safety with personal privacy. ...  Individual Americans have fewer ways to cope than do policymkakers concerned about the big picture. ...  Unless regulation moves far beyond where it has been to date, staying away from guns may be impossible in a population that has already acquired almost one gun for every resident."In addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.More Stories:This story is part of Columnists' OpinionsMichael Bloomberg: 6 ways to stop gun madnessOpinionline: Is Sandy Hook the tipping point?Column: Our Newtown is 'shaken to the core'            {                "assetid": "1779565",                "aws": "news/opinion",                "aws_id": "news_opinion",                "blogname": "",                "contenttype": "story pages ",                 "seotitle": "Sandy-hook-world-reaction",                "seotitletag": "Opinionline: Sandy Hook shooting reverberates worldwide",                "ssts": "opinion",                "taxonomykeywords":"Columnists' Opinions",                "templatename": "stories/default",                "topic":"columnists-opinions",                "videoincluded":"no",                "basePageType":"story"            }        Comment Join the Nation's ConversationTo find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQsShare                             Opinionline: Sandy Hook shooting reverberates worldwide                        ShareEmailPost to FacebookOr share on: TwitterGoogle+LinkedInOpinionline: Sandy Hook shooting reverberates worldwide on USAToday.com: http://usat.ly/RE45JiCancelSendPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
