Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]nachochease 51 points52 points53 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]nachochease 51 points52 points53 points 25 minutes agoSoon there will be the usual debate between the pro-gun crowd and the anti-gun people, and in the end nothing will change.  But can we all just agree that mental health services need a drastic improvement in the U.S. so that fewer mentally unstable people are wandering around without access to any treatment?  I cannot believe any sane person could commit such an atrocity.At the very least some sort of psychological testing to make sure that people are in good mental health before they're allowed to purchase a firearm.  It would never be 100% foolproof, but if one mass shooting such as this could be prevented, it would be worth it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

You get a job doing long haul and you can go for days without talking to a soul.  If that's a bit much, driving for a more local company still gives you lots of time to yourself.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPolice foil plot to murder and castrate Justin Bieber with 'bounty set at $2,500 per testicle'  by  theanswermancanin  entertainment[+]nachochease 36 points37 points38 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]nachochease 36 points37 points38 points 1 day agoWe're talking about an eighteen year old kid whose music is primarily aimed at 9-13 year old girls.  Do I like or listen to his music?  Of course not, but that doesn't mean that I think he should be tortured and murdered.  Why all the hate for Bieber?  If you don't like his music, change the station.These people plotting against him are only looking to make themselves famous at the expense of this kids life.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGraph: How Canada's internet costs stack up internationally  by  bopolloin  canada[+]nachochease 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]nachochease 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThere are a lot of people living in rural areas outside of the GTA who don't even have the option of DSL, much less the speeds you're talking about.  Their only option is Satellite, and currently Xplornet is charging $89.99 for (up to) 10Mbps and a bandwidth cap of 60GB, and that's their best plan.I honestly think that a lot of rural Canadians get forgotten because quite frankly they have very limited internet access and low data caps, so they only use the internet for keeping in touch with friends and family.  As a result they don't have much of a voice on forums like these.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRegulator gets a blast from the public over 36-month cellphone contracts  by  smacksawin  canada[+]nachochease 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoWhy should Canadian cell providers be able to gouge customers for an extra year on their contracts?  Just because they're Canadian doesn't give them a licence to rip us off.  No one's saying they can't make money, only that the prices they charge and length of contracts should be comparable to other countries.  If cell companies in the U.S. and other parts of the world can make a tidy profit from two year contracts, then why can't the Canadian telcos?  The answer: we're being screwed.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood Guy Gabe  by  pmasherin  gaming[+]nachochease 10 points11 points12 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 10 points11 points12 points 5 days agoIt's the tenth anniversary of the Spike VGA's, hence the award for the best game over the last ten years.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRegulator gets a blast from the public over 36-month cellphone contracts  by  smacksawin  canada[+]nachochease 4 points5 points6 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 4 points5 points6 points 6 days agoI really wish this had been made public before now.  I would have loved to give the CRTC my two cents.  Why is the media only reporting on these consultations after they have closed?  27.4 million wireless subscribers in Canada and only around 500 people had their voices heard.FYI: there is a second round of public consultations in February, after the CRTC draws up its "national code".  Hopefully we can get this to the front page of Reddit so as many Canadians can have their voice heard as possible.  If the CRTC doesn't know it already, they made to be made aware that we're sick of being screwed over by the big telcos.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRegulator gets a blast from the public over 36-month cellphone contracts  by  smacksawin  canada[+]nachochease 3 points4 points5 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 3 points4 points5 points 6 days agoThe bitching is because we're one of the only countries in the world where there even are three year contracts.  In order to get the latest phones fully subsidized, customers have no choice but to sign up for a three year term, which is ridiculous.  Why should Canadians have to sign up for longer term contracts than those from other countries?  The batteries in most phones will barely hold a charge after three years.Yes, you can just buy the phone, but the point is we shouldn't have to.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAm I wrong to think Melky looks like an absolute steal after what we saw at the winter meetings?  by  HW_Plainviewin  Torontobluejays[+]nachochease 3 points4 points5 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 3 points4 points5 points 7 days agoA massive steal.  Just look at what the Yankees have offered Kevin Youkilis - 12 million on a one year contract.  Youkilis hit .235 last year with 19 HR and is 33 years old.  Melky is 28, hit .346 with 11 HR in 113 games (plus 13 steals, Youkilis had none).  Even if Melky's average drops 50 points, it's still an excellent deal for the Jays, heck it's not a bad deal if his average drops 75 points to .271.  Great pickup by AA.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTeaser Trailer for 'Star Trek Into Darkness' Released  by  MrStevenRichterin  movies[+]nachochease 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 1 point2 points3 points 8 days agoEmilie De Ravin:http://imgur.com/nyGn3,jwypCpermalinksavecontextfull commentsTELUS halves download/upload limits for all customers, starting on February 1st 2013  by  pfakin  canada[+]nachochease 98 points99 points100 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 98 points99 points100 points 10 days agoThis is a perfect example of the non-competitive bullshit we have to put up with.  Where's the CRTC in this?  Isn't it part of their job to ensure a competitive marketplace?This is nothing but a move to slow down Netflix's growth so people are forced to remain with Telus.  I hope people switch away from Telus in droves to show the big telcos that we're not sheep who are willing to pay top dollar for garbage service.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBlue Jays claim Eli Whiteside, becomes 4th catcher  by  MethoxyEthanein  Torontobluejays[+]nachochease 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoI really hope they don't trade Arencibia.  The guys got power, is solid defensively, is a good teammate and is only 26 to boot.  I know he's got good trade value, but he's by far the best catcher the Jays have, so why not hold onto him?  Unless some team is really going to overpay to get him, I'd keep Arencibia a Blue Jay.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI don't see a goddamn Ferrari  by  Smokey95in  funny[+]nachochease 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoIn Canada, a 25 pack of brand name smokes is $11.  A lot of people buy the cheap brands in a 20 pack, which still runs around 9 bucks.  And we've had those prices for at least the last five years.  The high prices serve a dual purpose, to discourage people (especially teenagers) from smoking in the first place, and secondly the taxes help pay for the healthcare costs of smoking related illnesses.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHomeless Man Says Hes Grateful for Boots but Hes Barefoot Again  by  Libertateain  offbeat[+]nachochease 23 points24 points25 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 23 points24 points25 points 11 days agoNot really surprising.  Most of the people living on the street have mental health problems, and this guy has figured out that no shoes = more panhandling tips.  I mean let's face it, you could likely go to a thrift store and buy a pair of shoes for a couple of bucks, which would easily be within this guys budget.  You just can't save some people from themselves.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey, everyone  by  ohmonsieurin  apathy[+]nachochease 1 point2 points3 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 1 point2 points3 points 11 days agomehpermalinksavecontextfull commentsMika Zibanejad Scouting Report: Opinions please :)  by  Klattnaztyin  OttawaSenators[+]nachochease 2 points3 points4 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 2 points3 points4 points 11 days agoBottom line with Zibanejad, he's a center, and the Sens are set at center with Spezza, Turris, and Zack Smith.  As far as putting him on the wing, right now Silfverburg is way ahead of Zibanejad, (see AHL numbers) and Mark Stone might be ahead of him on the depth chart as well.  I seriously doubt that he would have made the Sens this year, and we'll see going forward, but his 1 goal in sixteen AHL games so far and a plus/minus of -3 isn't anywhere near good enough to make me think he's ever going to be a top NHLer.  Not unless he drastically improves.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo you're saying that if I pay $20 a month I can have unlimited access to this level of journalism?  by  digitalashin  canada[+]nachochease 12 points13 points14 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 12 points13 points14 points 15 days agoWho is paying 20 bucks a month?  Use Chrome, open a new incognito window, and you get access to ten articles.  Want another ten articles?  Open a new incognito window.  Pretty simple.  And you can still log in and comment on articles if you wish, although you'll have to log in everytime you open a new incognito window.Or if you prefer, you can download the NotScripts extension for Chrome as well, which does essentially the same thing.The real farce is that Sun Media (Toronto Sun, Ottawa Sun etc..) is soon going to have their own paywall.  Yesterday they had a hard hitting article on what they thought of Kate Middleton's new hairstyle.  Yes Really.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadian government under international pressure to pass controversial Internet surveillance bill  by  davidreiss666in  canada[+]nachochease 3 points4 points5 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 3 points4 points5 points 16 days agoJoin and donate to http://openmedia.ca They are really fighting for a free and open internet for Canadians, and they've got enough members and media attention that Telus recently invited them to a meeting about consumer complaints regarding cell phone service in Canada.**I am not affiliated with openmedia in any way, I just really believe they're doing a really good public service.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTold I look miserable  by  misterzdin  socialanxiety[+]nachochease 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease 1 point2 points3 points 17 days agoAs far as loosening up around people, smile, smile, smile (without looking insane, if possible).  Especially at a bar, people are there to have a good time, and if you're looking depressed, like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders, people are probably going to avoid you.I'd also strongly advise against smoking weed, it just holds you back, and makes you more paranoid and less confident.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToronto Mayor Rob Ford removed from office for violating conflict of interest act  by  nachocheasein  canada[+]nachochease[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]nachochease[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoWere the other mayors you mentioned ever forcibly removed from office because of a criminal conviction?  Nope.  That's not to say they weren't corrupt, but they weren't so arrogant as to think they could blatantly break the rules and get away with it.And I know enough about municipal politics to know that Rob Ford has been one of the worst mayors the city of Toronto has ever seen.
