Now what?  by  dementiapatient567in  learnprogramming[+]grub5000 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]grub5000 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoJust an FYI, I believe Minecraft was written in Java which is a memory managed language, not entirely unlike C#. I learned most of what I know about programming in C#. It really is a beginner friendly language. The ties into the XNA framework would also be useful to a game developer I imagine. I recommend starting with C#, especially since you can still manually managed memory if you require it laterEdit: Actually I'm not sure about that last partpermalinksavecontextfull commentsAm I the only one who knows practically no lyrics to songs due to focusing on the instrumentation?  by  sonetlumierein  WeAreTheMusicMakers[+]grub5000 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]grub5000 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoOh yeah it's definitely some sort of processing disorder (there's a wiki page for something called Auditory Processing Disorder which sounds somewhat plausible). I can sometimes focus on one sound at a time yes. I find it much easier with music (trivial), but focusing on the vocals doesn't usually make them easier to understand. Focusing on one source of sound in a group conversation is less effective (I suspect because the source changes so frequently in a conversation).permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

That test where they put the headphones on you and play a whole bunch of different frequencies to see if you can hear them. I can hear them all. I seem to struggle most when there are several sounds at the same time. So group conversations are hard, I can rarely understand all the lyrics in a song, if the bar music is even remotely listenable then it's hard to understand what my friends are saying and of course clubs are a nightmare. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIFU by beating up a special needs kid.  by  MyMegaGamein  tifu[+]grub5000 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]grub5000 3 points4 points5 points 3 days agoYou've clearly never been to Glasgow mate :Ppermalinksavecontextfull commentsTIFU by beating up a special needs kid.  by  MyMegaGamein  tifu[+]grub5000 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]grub5000 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoIf OP was being attacked, that time to confirm could've been extremely damagingpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the technical reason why Windows needs to readjust my volume settings every time I plug in a keyboard or mouse?  by  hitlerwasrightin  techsupport[+]grub5000 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]grub5000 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoMy Windows 8 PC isn't doing it for my MX518 or my shitty compaq PS2 keyboard.Maybe OP's keyboard has audio ports on it?Edit: And for the record, I have the communication feature enabled for skype etcpermalinksavecontextfull commentsHelp spread the word please.
