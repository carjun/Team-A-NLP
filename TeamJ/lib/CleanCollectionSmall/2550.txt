And not just because of shootings.  permalinksaveparent[+]ac3raven -1 points0 points1 point 45 minutes ago (3 children)[]ac3raven -1 points0 points1 point 45 minutes agoYou can have the best mental healthcare in the universe and you'd still see events like this shooting.permalinksaveparent[+]benlew 3 points4 points5 points 29 minutes ago (2 children)[]benlew 3 points4 points5 points 29 minutes agoI disagree. In almost all cases, people who do things like this have a mental illness.  Adequate mental healthcare can identify those problems, work to solve them, and protect the public from people who are dangerous.permalinksaveparent[+]ac3raven 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (1 child)[]ac3raven 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoIt can do this for 100% of humans?  Unlikely.  In can prevent 100% of school shootings?  Unlikely.permalinksaveparent[+]benlew 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]benlew 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoYou said the best mental healthcare in the universe. I believe it could.  Especially with new technology, a greater understanding of the human brain, better brain scans, and better drugs to keep chemical levels in the brain normal. The portion of those with mental illnesses that actually act on them in this manner is extremely tiny. If everyone was medically treated as well as possible then I believe shootings could be prevented.permalinksaveparent[+]Gorillaz_Noodle  comment score below threshold (2 children)[]Gorillaz_Noodle -6 points-5 points-4 points 36 minutes agoIt's not a rare answer.We have good mental health care, it's just that people with mental health problems aren't going.permalinksaveparent[+]Mewshimyo 9 points10 points11 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]Mewshimyo 9 points10 points11 points 23 minutes agoWe have good mental health care available if you can afford it.  When certain psych drugs are nearly 10 grand a year, and regular psych visits are 100+ dollars in a rural (cheap) area, many of the people most affected by mental illness simply can't afford to go.Also, there's a huge stigma attached to being mentally ill, speaking from experience on it.  It's one of the few things where you can still be 'legitimately' discriminated on, even though it's illegal.We need to make psych screening more available, and make psych services more affordable.permalinksaveparent[+]cardiomegaly 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]cardiomegaly 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes agoWe have good mental health care, it's just that people with mental health problems aren't going.What are you basing this off? Please cite something.I don't have any actual data or literature, but I have talked to practicing psychiatrists and social workers who have said the exact opposite. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
