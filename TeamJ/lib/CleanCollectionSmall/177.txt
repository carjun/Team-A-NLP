He then took his own life. Earlier, he killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, at their home in Newtown, the Associated Press reported.The killing of so many, so young, shook the nation and thrust a rural suburb of 27,000 people  60 miles from New York and 2 hours from Boston  into the grim company of Littleton, Colo., site of the 1999 Columbine massacre, and the Blacksburg campus of Virginia Tech, where a gunman killed 32 in 2007.Theres a feeling of isolation from tragedies like this, in this place, said James Dietter, 26, a Newtown native, who attended Sandy Hook Elementary as a child. Im coming to terms with the fact that this is gone. And this tragedy will define this town from now on.A tearful President Obama offered condolences to a nation anguished by another mass shooting, as he has done each time after the 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, which killed 13; the 2011 assassination attempt on US Representative Gabrielle Giffords, which killed six; and last Julys cinema shootings in Aurora, Colo., which killed 12.The majority of those who died today were children. beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, said the president, who paused and struggled to get through his short statement at the White House. I know theres not a parent in America who doesnt feel the same overwhelming grief that I do.The president, who has not made gun control a central part of his agenda, suggested that may now change. Were going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics, he said.In Newtown, Governor Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut met privately with parents who had sent their children to school in the morning, never to see them again.Evil visited this community today, the governor told reporters. And its too early to speak of recovery, but each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that Connecticut  were all in this together. Well do whatever we can to overcome this event.Details on the shooter and how he carried out the crime were slow to emerge Friday night. Police offered no theory for what might have motivated the attack. The Associated Press reported that Lanzas brother, Ryan, 24, who was mistakenly reported by some news agencies as the shooter on Friday, was cooperating with police.Adam Lanza was born in Kingston, N.H., just north of Haverhill, Mass.Law enforcement officials told the New York Times that Lanza had grown up in Newtown, and he was remembered by high school classmates as smart, introverted, and nervous. Some said they believed he suffered from Aspergers syndrome.James Champion, Lanzas uncle, stood outside his home in Kingston Friday night and said he still did not know what had happened in Newtown and did not want to comment. Champion is the brother of Lanzas mother.Ken and Donna Kowalski, neighbors to the school serving kindergarten through-fourth grade in the village of Sandy Hook, said in an interview that they heard shots, a dozen or so, and within seconds the schools fire alarm went off.Then the police arrived, blaring sirens from what seemed like every direction.Minutes after that, parents cars came flying down the road, said Ken. Some parked in the middle of the street.Terrified parents ran toward the school.Susan Harris, 61, said her sister, Barbara Halstead, a secretary at the main office at the elementary school, made a number of calls over the loudspeaker warning everyone. Halstead and a school nurse then hid from the shooter in a closet, she said.A 9-year-old student told The New York Times he was in the gymnasium when he heard really loud bangs.The boy, speaking with his father at his side outside the school, said, We thought that someone was knocking something over. And we heard yelling, and we heard gunshots. We heard lots of gunshots. We heard someone say, Put your hands up. I heard, Dont shoot. We had to go into the closet in the gym. Then someone came and told us to run down the hallway. There were police at every door. There were lots of people crying and screaming.Continued...Globe correspondents Zachary T.
