Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten.[91] In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) "with good humour" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, in fact, setting down a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend.[91] At the time, Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, caused by her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFor all of you trying to reorder to get your phone faster: How many of you are trying this method and failing?  by  rxmxshin  nexus4[+]tatch 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]tatch 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours agoMe too, my status changed from Pending to Pre-ordered yesterday.
