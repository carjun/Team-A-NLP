Maybe he's a complete psychopath. An action like this can never, ever be justified. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

What did they do to deserve this? I feel for their poor families and everyone who has been involved in this tragedy. So, so sad.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

They could have in fact been of sound mind and some time later something clicked that set them off. Its a very tough and tragic situation. So unfortunate that this sort of loss could happen to anyone.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]sohanlon07 -9 points-8 points-7 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]sohanlon07 -9 points-8 points-7 points 1 hour agoMy word. No doubt there will be a tirade of news in the aftermath abut tightening gun control. I only wish incidents like this would give governments around the world a push to re-evaluate their laws. Just making it that little bit tougher to buy a gun could make all the difference. Not that I have an issue with people owning guns; I don't. Anything in the wrong hands can become dangerous for others. I have absolutely no issue with responsible, safe people owning a weapon.permalinksavecontextfull comments"THEN"  by  thisissamsaxtonin  comics[+]sohanlon07 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (0 children)[]sohanlon07 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoBeautifully executed.

Everyone said that the old guy who does the dishes was crazy, but I always thought he was nice... until he handed me these and said 'Merry Christmas' (There's a Starbucks right across us)  by  CAROandtheJETTSin  WTF[+]sohanlon07 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]sohanlon07 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoIf humorous notes like this were passed to me in work now and again I feel it would really brighten up my place of employment. I say embrace it and look forward to the next gem he gives you. If he has mental issues, give him some time, converse with him, get to know him. He may just want someone to talk to. If it turns out to be a prank, plot how you will prank him back. That will certainly make work fun and I bet if he is a prankster he will enjoy being pranked. Don't however assume the guy is crazy as that term can be used too negatively these days.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust started working at a sandwich shop a month ago.

There will be no physical activities involved; so we don't need to worry about STD testing and in house locations as that service will not be offered to clients. Employee security is a difficult one. I would of course want security people on the payroll at all times but the best way to call one into a situation when needed is still something I am thinking about. Screening Clients is another tough one. Ideally some sort of criminal record check would be needed but I would need to research the legality of such checks being carried out by a company. Talent security would hopefully, but not necessarily, be something that might be a tad easier in this climate. I would hope to use standard recruitment techniques via employment agencies and maybe some sort of Internet advertising campaign. Marketing is a tough one. A client base could probably be built up by advertising through less reputable sites like erotic internet sites and magazines, however this would give the impression that something more than simply an escort is on offer which is not an impression I want to give.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday is the 10 year anniversary of the release of Nemesis.
