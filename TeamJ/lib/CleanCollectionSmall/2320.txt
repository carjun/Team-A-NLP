Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]tigerjane 11 points12 points13 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 11 points12 points13 points 1 hour agoThis is so sad. It makes me want to cry. I don't usually cuss, but seriously what the fuck? Why would someone go to an elementary school? That is so messed up. Those poor kids. As a college student, I couldn't imagine going through something like this...I can't even fathom what these poor kids went through and will be going through in the future.  Now I'm worried that there might be a copy cat shooter. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGetting To Know You...  by  tigerjanein  mizzou[+]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThat's what I figured but wasn't sure!

AMA.  by  PixarPetein  IAmA[+]tigerjane 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoOh the part in Toy Story where the little girl has Jessie and then eventually grows up and abandons her. OMG SO SAD! It reminded me of myself because when I was younger my entire room was done in horses, so I guess I kind of saw myself in that girl and felt bad for all the toys I ignored. :( permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone Interested in Having an Unofficial Club?  by  tigerjanein  mizzou[+]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoBut...but...I'm not a terrible person! permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone Interested in Having an Unofficial Club?  by  tigerjanein  mizzou[+]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThat is a good idea! permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone Interested in Having an Unofficial Club?  by  tigerjanein  mizzou[+]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoOh...well then....that sounds kinda scary! permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone Interested in Having an Unofficial Club?  by  tigerjanein  mizzou[+]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI also think different board games and things would be fun! My family doesn't really like playing board games, but I love it!! And yeah, that is a good idea to repost after break. I guess I didn't think about it since I live off campus and will be here all winter break. Forgot about the majority of people who won't be here.

I just don't think I'm cut out for that type of work. permalinksavecontextfull comments15111213Anyone Interested in Having an Unofficial Club?

It makes it way easier to break down the food I think. I was just eating pizza and drinking soda a few minutes ago and had to take multiple drinks while eating the crust because it was kind of tough. I feel like it grosses people out, but I still do it with just about every meal. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDAE feel the urge to take a dump while looking for a book in a library?  by  Basukikuin  DoesAnybodyElse[+]tigerjane 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoSame. The same thing happens if I am outside like in the woods or something by myself. I think it just has to do with being in a quiet, relaxed, and isolated environment. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDAE sneeze upon feelings of sexual arousal?  by  thebigsneezein  DoesAnybodyElse[+]tigerjane 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoNo! But I always sneeze when I go outside and it's really sunny out. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDAE, when taking a test, skip around rather than take it in numerical order?  by  n311goin  DoesAnybodyElse[+]tigerjane 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoNo, I never do this. If it is a scantron test I am afraid that I will screw up the bubbles and throw everything off. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy roommate the other day  by  CaptinSexyin  AdviceAnimals[+]tigerjane -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoI did this one time. I usually ride my bike to school and there was literally a frickin hurricane outside. I was just like NOPE! Going back to bed. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThey must be so proud...  by  pushtheboxesin  AdviceAnimals[+]tigerjane 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoI had the hardest time picking out my major. Finally I settled on psychology. I know I will probably have a hard time finding a job without getting a more advanced degree and it sucks, but I am not interested in doing nursing or anything like that. If I was good at science/math I would have loved to do engineering. But that's just not the cards I was handed. I am very jealous of all of the science majors and engineers on here. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI've missed the last few weeks, give me a break.  by  mirpsin  AdviceAnimals[+]tigerjane 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoThat has to smell horrible. I hope you kept it in a garage or something. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThey must be so proud...  by  pushtheboxesin  AdviceAnimals[+]tigerjane 11 points12 points13 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 11 points12 points13 points 2 days agoI go to a large public school in Missouri and my tuition is about $7,000 per year. I went to community college for two years for free (school scholarship program) which has saved me tons! But when all is said and done I will probably be $20,000 in debt from the other two years with interest.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBeing an insecure guy..  by  johnnycash527in  AdviceAnimals[+]tigerjane 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tigerjane 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoWell, at least you're honest.But, have you ever thought about how they might know they look weird or ugly and are extremely self conscious about it? And therefore they know that people are staring at them because they are ugly which will only make them feel worse about it? permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
