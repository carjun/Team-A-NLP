Just fuck it all to hell.All of it, sources added.Im sorry, but fuck it, I cant handle thisI just cant handle it anymore, said Deborah McEllis, who added that no, no, no, no, no, this isnt happening, this cant be real. Seriously, what the hell is this? Whats even going on anymore? Why do things like this keep happening?Continued McEllis, before covering her face with her hands, Why?Despairing sources confirmed that the gunman, armed with a semiautomatic assault riflea fucking combat rifle, Jesuswalked into a classroom full of goddamned children where his mother was a teacher and, good God, if this is what the world is becoming, then how about we just pack it in and fucking give up, because this is no way to live.I mean, honestly, all 315 million Americans confirmed.Well, I suppose we have to try to pick up the pieces and make some sort of sense of this tragedy andyou know what? Fuck it, I cant do this, said Connecticut resident Michael Zaleski, his remarks understandable given the circumstances, because, holy shit, what else can one say? Im sorry, but I cant fucking do this. Can you? Can anyone?Witnesses said the gunman fired at least 100 rounds during his deadly rampage, which, according to children in the schoolgoddamnit, how? How? Twenty children. Dead. In a fucking school.No. No, no, no.I just feel so [why does it even matter what this person said when no words can bring 20 dead kids back to life?] said some person who, just like everyone else, is completely unable to process or handle any of this. Its awful. Just too awful to bear.Americans reported feelings of overwhelming disgust with whatever abhorrent bastard did this and with the world at large for ever allowing it to happen, as well as with politicians, with the NRA, and above all with their own pathetic goddamn selves, sitting in front of a fucking computer instead of doing fucking anything to help anyoneChrist, as if that were even fucking possible, as if anyone could change what happened, as if the same fucking bullshit isnt going to keep happening again and again and fucking again before people finally decide its time to change the way we live, so whats the point? What the hell is the goddamned point?I said Tom Miller, 27, after reading an article about the tragedy online. I just he added.At press timescrew it, theres nothing else to say.More News  'The Hobbit' To Feature 53-Minute-Long Scene Of Bilbo Baggins Trying To Figure Out What To PackNews in BriefReport: It Okay To Spend Rest Of Day Curled In Fetal Position Under DeskNews in BriefRight To Own Handheld Device That Shoots Deadly Metal Pellets At High Speed Worth All Of ThisRecent News                     McDonald's Prints Calorie Count Right Onto Meat                    12.14.12                    'The Hobbit' To Feature 53-Minute-Long Scene Of Bilbo Baggins Trying To Figure Out What To Pack                    12.13.12                    Man Who Will Die In Great Eastern Seaboard Flood Of 2023 Preparing For Mayan Apocalypse                    12.13.12                    Kim Jong-Un's Wife Escapes North Korea In Long-Range Missile                    12.12.12                    Guys With Boring Jobs Really Hitting It Off A Few Rows Back On Airplane                    12.11.12                    Study Finds Millennial Generation Stays On Phone With Parents Throughout Entire Day                    12.11.12                    Toddler Leaders Call For Increased Duck Visibility                    12.11.12                    The Onion's Plan For Solving The Fiscal Cliff Crisis                    12.10.12PreviousNext[x] Click to close Copyright 2012, Onion, Inc.
