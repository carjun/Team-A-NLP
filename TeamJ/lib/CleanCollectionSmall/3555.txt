Dan Malloy tells NBC's David Gregory what he's learned about the school shootings.By M. Alex Johnson, NBC NewsUpdated at 2:01 p.m. ET: An explanation still hasn't emerged for why a man killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School, but it does appear that he attended the school as a youngster, Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy told NBC News on Sunday.Follow @NBCNewsUSAdam Lanza, 20, shot his mother multiple times in the headin her home before driving to the school in her car and killing 20 children and six adults in two classrooms Friday in Newtown, Conn., authorities said Sunday. The gunman then shot himself in the head as emergency crews arrived at the scene."He attended there  that's what I'm led to believe," said Malloy, who declined to answer whether any documented evidence had been uncovered that Lanza might have been mentally disturbed.Advertise | AdChoices The children  12 girls and eight boys  were all 6 or 7 years old, H. WayneCarver, the state medical examiner, said Saturday. Some were shot as many as 11 times, Carver said.Authorities were reviewing a computer they found at the home of Lanza's mother, Nancy, for possible leads on the gunman's motive, NBC News' Pete Williams reported.Conn. shooting suspect Adam Lanza's father: 'We too are asking why'Lanza's parents were divorced, and he lived with his mother, who home-schooled for part of his childhood, Malloy said.Connecticut school shooter was 'very nervous around people'"He had a very troubled life," Malloy said. "He never seemed to be a good fit. ...It was a very difficult time for him and his mother.NBC News' Pete Williams updates with new information on the Connecticut school shootings.Authorities wouldn't go into details during a briefing for reporters Sunday morning, but investigators told NBC News that they believe Lanza killed his mother, an avid gun enthusiast, with her own gun. He then took three of her weapons with him as he drove to the school in her car.To bypass security, Lanza smashed in a window, they said. He shot and killed Principal Dawn Hochsprung, 47, and Mary Sherlach, 56, a school psychologist, before proceeding to a classroom, where he found the door locked.Follow @MAlexJohnsonSo he moved on to a second classroom, where he killed everyone he found, before doing the same in a third classroom, investigators believe. He then shot himself.Watch US News crime videos on NBCNews.comAlthough he was carrying three weapons, he used only one of them in all of the school killings  a Bushmaster .223-caliber assault-style rifle similar to the one used by the snipers who terrorized the Washington, D.C., area in 2002. It was purchased legally, they said.Authorities haven't said how Nancy Lanza stored the weapons.Marsha Lanza, Nancy Lanza's sister-in-law and Adam Lanza's aunt, said there was a good reason for a divorced woman who grew up with guns to have them in the house: self-defense."She lived alone.

I'm a single ( divorced ) female living alone ( and have for 18 yrs )  and was a single mother all that time AND grew up w/a wingnut father who was in law enforcement and had a frigging arsenal in the house but I sure the hell don't have one in mine. I own ONE gun.... a Jennings .22 caliber which my father gave me for "self defense"...not that something that small  would even be able to do anything but "wing" someone.   I keep it in a drawer next to my bed .. UNLOADED but w/the clip.. JUST IN CASE.  Even so.. if someone WANTS to kill you... they're going to.   Most victims of gun crimes are KILLED w/their OWN guns or a gun kept by someone in the family.  Here's a few statistics :#1.  A gun in the home increases the chances of being killed by one 72%.#2.  Guns in the home are responsible for the majority of children who are killed by firearms.#3.  A gun in the home is 22x more likely to be used in a suicide, homicide or accident than to be used  in self-defense.#4. A gun in the home TRIPLES the chance of homicide.#5. A gun in the home increases the chances of suicide FIVEFOLD.#6.  An abused woman is 6x more likely to be MURDERED if there is a gun in the home.Guns should be regulated STRICTLY.  There is NO other "purpose" for a gun than to KILL.  There should be a MANDATORY waiting period while a thorough FBI background check and a full psychiatric evaluation are done.  THEN... the owner should be fingerprinted / photo ID'd,  and the rest should proceed the same as when you are issued a driver's license :A)  A written test on gun knowledge and procedure.B)  A "demonstrated proper use" test at a range w/a qualified/licensed instructor just like when you take your road test.  FAIL ANY of these... NO LICENSE, NO GUN OWNERSHIP.  People should have to be tested every couple of years to have their "license to own and operate a gun (deadly weapon)"  renewed and to be re-tested.C).   A person should be held legally responsible for ANY crime / accident, etc committed w/that person's gun.D).  ALL gun owners should have to prove that they have a gun safe or someplace where their gun is kept locked and secured away from others.E)  Just because we have a misinterpreted "right" to own a gun ( not really... the 2nd Amendment was  STRICTLY meant to arm PRIVATE MILITIAS..... NOT individual citizens ) there should still be a LIMIT on what KIND of guns and HOW MANY.   People should be able to own ONE  handgun for self defense and say one rifle for hunting if they engage in such a disgusting psychopathic activity.F)  ALL "assault" and "automatic" weapons should be BANNED.G)  All guns would be LICENSED individually and there for a record kept on file of EACH and EVERY gun owner as to what guns they own and how many they own ( serial #s etc )H)  The sale of ammunition should be strictly controlled and limited and each sale recorded and reported.13 votes#1.11 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 1:09 PM ESTConcerned School CounselorThere is indeed no excused for this tragedy which has impacted so many lives, children, parents, teachers, educators, politicians, etc. I am however concerned that the conversation is deviating from many other important aspects. The influential and powerful media is diverting this so important conversation by spearheading the political agenda. Aspects as such as the current state of our educational system that, believe it or not, has major contribution on the creation of these perpetrators, actual human beings who have become a product of a dysfunctional educational system.

A guy who lived in a neighborhood in Ohio went off the deep end 1 day in 2011 & took 2 handguns & walked up & down his street executing his neighbors.He killed 6 people in the first 5 minutes! It took police 10 minutes to arrive after the 1st 911 call. By then he had killed several more people.  The first responding officer was able to take the shooter out.There were 18 calls to 911 during those 10 minutes.

Theres no one standard for these types of laws, but (roughly speaking) these are laws that allow for people with mental illness to be forcibly treated BEFORE they commit a serious crime. Whereas previous legal standards held that the mentally ill cannot be institutionalized or medicated until they harm someone or themselves, or until they express an immediate intent to do so, AOT laws (again, roughly speaking) allow for preventative institutionalization or forced medication (I highly recommend reading the data cited in the link I provided in this paragraph, especially regarding what is known as first episode psychosis).AOT laws vary state-by-state, and often bear the name of a person murdered by an untreated mentally ill person (Kendras Law in New York, Lauras Law in California, etc.).Earlier this year, Connecticut considered passing an AOT law (and a weak one, at that), and it failed, due to protests from civil liberties groups.http://www.cga.ct.gov/2012/JUDdata/Tmy/2012SB-00452-R000329-David%20McGuire-%20ACLU-TMY.PDF3 votes#1.16 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 2:37 PM ESTJohn B-463946Talk about festishizing guns and gun violence. I walked through a Wal Mart in south Arkansas last night, down the toy isle. There were all kinds of "toy" guns, fantasy guns from movies and games, and BB guns/pistols lining the aisles for kids to see and gun-packing Dads and Moms to buy for their impressionable young children. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that kids are indoctrinated into gun culture and violence from a very young age. Around this area, it's not unusual to hear people bragging about taking matters into their own hands instead of calling on police to handle matters. I'd be afraid to be in a place where someone was attempting a mass shooting. In this area, I'd be more likely to be killed in crossfire from all the self-identified "first responders" and their legally held guns.1 vote#1.17 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 2:41 PM ESTPhantomBeastHere are The Hard Facts of Prevention: When a firearm is purchased at an arms store there is the NICS national clearing center form for people buying firearms to Answer and Fill Out to ensure they are sane enough to own and handle a firearm. BUT in that form There Is NOT THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION: Are You Or ANYONE in YOUR HOUSEHOLD Mentally Impaired or receiving psychiatric therapy or afflicted with a personality abnormality AND/OR DISORDER.

I don't know if how thorough the checks are.  It's also probable that she had at least some guns before she was aware of the mental illness.  Also, different states have different policies.  Some states do a good job where others basically hand them to anyone with ID.  And this is only the legal purchases.  There are obviously many illegal purchases. We also need to do a better job handling people with emotional problems.  These people are willing to die, so it's very difficult to stop them from taking others with them.  We need to find a way to recognize those who need the help and make sure they see a positive future for themselves.  Without a sense of hope for the future they don't see where it makes any sense to go on.Until we get a handle on these things we are going to continue seeing things like this.1 vote#1.20 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 3:00 PM ESTWillardsEtchASketchIt's one thing to go and shoot the ones that make your life hell.It's another thing to shoot innocent 6 years old children that NEVER made his life hell and had NO IDEA WHO THE HELL he was.

States are already strapped for cash.  I know you (and I) would say it's better than having a massacre like this happen, but in reality are the schools really going to put those costs out there when there is still a very small chance this would ever happen at their school.  And don't forget the added cost of insuring these weapons.  3)  There is the risk a child could find one of the guns if a teacher isn't responsible with it, or a teacher could snap in a fit of rage and use it.  I'm not against allowing citizens to be armed, but I don't think we should necessarily arm the teachers.  I wouldn't be too comfortable knowing my daughter's teacher was armed.  But I would definately be open to having a couple specific people in the school be licensed and trained to carry a weapon.#2.2 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 3:11 PM ESTFreedom4EveryoneWas he gay?

Home protection/defense is certainly one of them. Any knowledgeable firearms person will tell you the best gun for home defense is a single shot, double barrel, or pump shotgun with the shortest barrel legal. It is short range, only needs to be pointed in approximately the right direction, and not likely to penetrate a wall and accidentally kill someone in the next room or across the street. Assault style semi auto weapons are totally unnecessary and do nothing but fulfill someones need for power or ego. Are they fun to shoot, you bet, is that reason enough to make them legal for the average citizen to own, NO.1 vote#5.8 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 3:14 PM ESTLA99999Florida, thank you for your honest and sensible comment.  I myself wouldn't be comfortable having a gun in my home.  I am not against owning them though.  But we need to use common sense about it.  The second amendment doesn't guarantee the right to own whatever weapons they can come out with.  It only guarantees your right to bear arms. And just the fact that some people enjoy something doesn't mean they should have the right to do it.  Some people may think it's fun to burn kittens, or raise dogs for fighting.  It doesn't mean it's ok to do so.#5.9 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 3:31 PM ESTBrilliant AdviceThis guy looks like a far gone kid. His mother wasn't with it either.

All we need are a bunch of copycats. How about some others.  Does the NRA buy votes? Sure, same way the unions, large corporations, special interest groups galor.  Thats the problem with the USA.  your vote counts to put whoever in office.  Once they get their, they listen to the lobbyists from the special interest groups.  Unions, NRA, banking, dont forget green energy and all the tarp money wasted,  just to name a few.  Your vote counts your opinion is worth about what you write on this page, nothing.And dont forget the liberals pushed to let all the people out of the mental institutions in the 60's as most could be medicated at home.  Well that worked well.  They have even come back and said they made a slight mistake. Civil rights of the mentally deranged. The govt can regulate guns all they want.  Wont work. Same way the govt regulates illegal drugs.  Ok, marijuana is becoming legal. That still leaves, crack, heroin, extasy, meth, cocaine to be brought over by the "mules".  Ban guns and the "mules" will bring them also.  And only the bad guys will be armed. Now a ban on assault rifles, I could live with.  Go to your local gun store and for $2250 you can buy a 50 cal sniper rifle.    #10.2 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 3:15 PM ESTAdvertise | AdChoices rachel-3673200Sometimes people are just born broken, as this Adam seems to have been.

We as a society understand where the moral line is when we say a statement - and this is a rough statement, but - throwing babies against the wall is wrong. Would these types of violent games in an individual that is struggling to understand what is right and wrong, would this type of video game push them pass this moral line?Plus, some of these games are played online with other people and is that connection that might cause an individual who is struggling with right or wrong, would that let them believe it would be ok to step across this line?Could this argument be used to suggest that teaching a child how to shoot guns with this same disorder do the same thing?
