Bloomberg said on NBCs Meet The Press. This should be his number one agenda. Hes president of the United States. And if he does nothing during his second term, something like 48,000 Americans will be killed with illegal guns.Bloomberg, an outspoken gun control advocate who launched a super PAC earlier this year that supported candidates who had advocated for gun control, said he believes Obama couldsuccessfullyspearhead legislation in Congress.Nobody questions the Second Amendments right to bear arms. But we dont think the founding fathers had the idea that every man, woman and child could carry an assault weapon. And I think the president, through his leadership, could get a bill like that through Congress. But at least hes got to try. Thats his job,Bloombergsaid.Reacting on Friday to the deadly Connecticut shooting in which a gunman used as semiautomatic weapon to kill 20 children and six adults at a school, Obama called formeaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, but did not get intospecifics.Bloomberg offered policy recommendationsfor the president on Sunday, including enforcing existing laws moreaggressively.Theres a number of things that the president can do and a number of things that Congress can do, he said. And therere a number of things that you and I can do as voters. What the president can do is number one, through executive action, he can order his agencies to to enforce the laws more aggressively.Bloomberg continued: I think theres something like 77,000  people whove been accused of lying when they applied for a gun permit. Weve only prosecuted 77 of them. The president can introduce legislation  even if it doesnt get passed. The president campaigned back  in 2008  on a bill that would  prohibit assault weapons. Weve got to really question whether military-style weapons with big magazines belong on the streets of America in this day and age.Meet The Press Executive Producer Betsy Fischer Martin tweeted Sunday morning that the show reached out to gun-rights advocates in the Senate, but none were willing to appear on the program.We reached out to ALL 31 pro-gun rights Sens in the new Congress to invite them to share their views on@meetthepress- NO takers, she tweeted.TAGSgun control, Sunday shows  PREVIOUS NEXT  Lieberman: Restore assault weapons ban, start national commission on mass violenceBy Sean SullivanDecember 16, 2012Feinstein will introduce assault weapons ban in SenateBy Sean SullivanDecember 16, 2012The Post Most:Politics
