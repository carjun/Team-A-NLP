Just in case you aren't American, I'd like to point out that America is more than twice the size of the entire European Union.  These shootings are actually quite rare.permalinksaveparent[+]pbamandaNYC 55 points56 points57 points 1 hour ago (25 children)[]pbamandaNYC 55 points56 points57 points 1 hour agoIn the period of time since Columbine, there've been 31 school shootings in the US and 14 in every other country in the world, combined, according to Anthony de Rosa from Reuters. You can call them rare if it makes you feel better, but relative to every other civilized society on Earth (and also the uncivilized ones), they're not, even when you adjust for population size.Guns are a complicated issue all around, as is mental health care in the US and how it plays into these issues, but those are the numbers.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 9 points10 points11 points 1 hour ago (20 children)[]StrahansToothGap 9 points10 points11 points 1 hour agosource?permalinksaveparent[+]cyclicamp 3 points4 points5 points 53 minutes ago (3 children)[]cyclicamp 3 points4 points5 points 53 minutes agoAfter searching "Anthony de Rosa school shootings Reuters," the first result here leads one to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which has a comprehensive listing of U.S. school shootings.  Unable to confirm international numbers but first-glance sources such as Wikipedia and CNN summary articles circumstantially back it up.And in the rare cases where people actually cite something, you can do this yourself too.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes ago (2 children)[]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes agoI understand that.  I'm reading a bunch of things during this right now, and if someone is presenting information, I just simply asked if they can point to a source since they've apparently already done the investigation.  I don't think that is so terrible.  I am self-sufficient, but I am also smart enough to not do work that's already done.  Technically, everything on reddit you can investigate yourself.  It's convenient when people bring it to you though.  permalinksaveparent[+]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (1 child)[]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoI apologize for being short.  Usually when I see someone typing "source" and nothing else they're doing it to express disbelief, and seeing it in response to a post with a citation seemed lazy since most of the work was done at that point.In other words, I was not expecting it to mean something rational like "Could you please expand upon that citation with a link?" since in all my time here it hadn't before.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes agoCool.  Not a problem at all.  And, you are right, I probably should have expanded on what I meant instead of saying 'source' without context like an ass.  Regardless, I enjoy an actual educational exchange with another redditor in which we can admit our faults. permalinksaveparent[+]rocketvat 9 points10 points11 points 1 hour ago (9 children)[]rocketvat 9 points10 points11 points 1 hour agoaccording to Anthony de Rosa from Reuters. permalinksaveparent[+]IsaacLeibniz -5 points-4 points-3 points 50 minutes ago (8 children)[]IsaacLeibniz -5 points-4 points-3 points 50 minutes agoAccording to the science journal "Nature" aliens have been found and exist in our solar system.See how that works?permalinksaveparent[+]rocketvat 2 points3 points4 points 48 minutes ago (7 children)[]rocketvat 2 points3 points4 points 48 minutes agoYou're a guy on the internet and he's from Reuters?

Someone listed an article that quoted a guy saying something from Reuters (the news agency).  Someone else asked for a source for the thing; the source was the guy from Reuters.  I quoted the part of the paragraph that said the guy from Reuters said the thing.

Not sure if this was the data set de Rosa was citing or not, but it shows the same trend.Almost any news article that you read about school shootings cites the US's heavily elevated rate over the rest of the world. This isn't a big secret.permalinksaveparent[+]derrick81787 -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]derrick81787 -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 hour agoI second StrahansToothGap's request for a source.Additionally, I consider other ways of meeting a violent death to be just as bad as being shot to death.  If your numbers turn out to be true, and hypothetically, there were 2 mass stabbings in the US but 50 mass stabbings in the other countries, then I would think that the US comes out on top here.  However, things like that are not taken into consideration with the numbers that you present.permalinksaveparent[+]Stooby 1 point2 points3 points 49 minutes ago (0 children)[]Stooby 1 point2 points3 points 49 minutes agoI think I would rather have a mass stabber than a mass shooter.

The only useful measurement of 'size' in this case is population, and the United States has a much, much smaller population than the European Union. 310 million vs 500 million people, respectively.Please adjust your perceptions.permalinksaveparent[+]derrick81787 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (6 children)[]derrick81787 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoThat is a useful measurement but not the only useful measurement.  A larger physical size implies different cultures and different circumstances.  Just lumping the entire United States into one broad generalization is very similar to blaming the entire EU for problems that rarely pop up in certain areas of certain member countries.It's much more complicated than justThere are so many fucking shootings in America. permalinksaveparent[+]DV1312 13 points14 points15 points 1 hour ago (5 children)[]DV1312 13 points14 points15 points 1 hour agoA larger physical size implies different cultures and different circumstancesDo you mean that Europe is culturally more homogenic than the US?

Interesting. But I don't think that there is any empirical evidence that shows that people in the US shoot each other because of that.permalinksaveparent[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 50 seconds ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 50 seconds agoI'm saying that it's a cultural issue, not necessarily a culture war, though.  It's a problem with these particular areas and these particular people, not with everybody everywhere in the USA.  There are large swaths of the US where there has never been a single mass shooting.  I just think that the issue is a lot more complicated than what people here want to make it.permalinksaveparent[+]Groke 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]Groke 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoEurope has, according to Wikipedia, had 22 notable school shootings, while USA has 122.Europe has more than twice as many people as the US.permalinksaveparent[+]searine 0 points1 point2 points 34 minutes ago (2 children)[]searine 0 points1 point2 points 34 minutes agoWere you reading that on the English wikipedia?Talk about selection bias...permalinksaveparent[+]Groke 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes ago (1 child)[]Groke 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes agoShow me a source that says that Europe has twice as many school shootings as the US, and I'll happily admit that I'm wrong.I'm saying twice as many, since Europe has twice as many inhabitants.You wont even come close to Americas number.Also, the English Wikipedia are also for Australia, Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand and Canada.

You can already see how people are insulting me and putting words in my mouth, though.It's basically impossible to do a one-to-one comparison to Europe.  Compared to particular EU member countries, the US has a larger population and more cultural and economic diversity.  Compared to the entire EU, the US has a smaller population.My point is that all of the people who love to say "We've had X number of shootings in the UK/Germany while the US has had Y number of shootings," aren't comparing apples-to-apples.  My US to EU comparison isn't apples-to-apples either because no apples-to-apples comparison exists, but it's a different viewpoint which is just as valid as the other comparisons.As I said in another post, it's just not as simple as sayingThere are so many fucking shootings in America. People don't want to acknowledge that, though, and they would rather just insult me and downvote me for pointing that out.permalinksaveparent[+]SoleusRex 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoAre you seriously using geographic area as the basis for your comparison in "size" between the US and the EU?permalinksaveparent[+]whubbard[] 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]whubbard[] 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes agoExactly. More children will die today from cancer and car crashes. Tomorrow, the media won't even be covering the children anymore. They will be focused on the shooter. We NEED to stop covering the shooter. Don't show their photo, don't show their name. That is how we make the biggest impact.permalinksaveparent[+]ogenrwot -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]ogenrwot -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour agoThank you for bringing some sense into the conversation.permalinksaveparent[+]TerraAustralis 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]TerraAustralis 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoIt's no sense. The EU is has more people than America. permalinksaveparent[+]Robertej92 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (4 children)[]Robertej92 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agothe size of the country doesn't come in to it, population does and the EU is at about 500 million. But no matter what way you look at it the USA has a far higher rate of gun deaths than any of the other countries, e.g. in 2009 the UK with their 62 million population had 138 firearm fatalities, if you escalate that to USA population you can make that 750 deaths if you scale up to 150 (because I cba adding it up properly and my point still stands...) by comparison in the US in that year the US had 11,493 fatalities. It's ludicrous to suggest the reason we have less gun fatalities than you is because we're a smaller country, when the stats correlate with gun ownership. the UK and Norway had less than 250 deaths in 2009 between them, whereas the EUs most armed country France (3 million more people than the UK, 15 million more guns...) topped 2000 fatalities. Outside of the occasional nutter like Raoul Moat (most of these legally own guns, shocker!!) we very rarely have the kind of situation that the US has so often, there's a reason that two school shootings in recent memory are still held close to the thoughts of many Brits, they're incredibly rare because we have effective gun control. Before you mention the likes of Breivik and Merah, they were politically motivated and afaik also owned their guns legally. Seems to me that gun controls should be tightened there not loosened.. should also have much more stringent mental testspermalinksaveparent[+]derrick81787 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour agoSee, this is the problem with comparing the entire United States to specific European countries.  There are very few mass shootings in my particular state too, but guess what, my state is nothing like Connecticut and is 1,000 miles away from there.Size comes into it because a large size implies a large set of different cultures and circumstances.  Basically, like I said in a reply to someone else, it's much more complicated than the over-simplifiedThere are so many fucking shootings in America. that so many people like to express.permalinksaveparent[+]IsaacLeibniz 0 points1 point2 points 46 minutes ago (2 children)[]IsaacLeibniz 0 points1 point2 points 46 minutes agoThe UK is also an island.
