This, like all of the gun violence in the media, will be beat to death. Just like the Aurora shootings we will be hearing about it for weeks on weeks. Ask yourself this question, "Why are we seeing such a huge rise in mass shootings?" A few of you will say "It's the guns! We need to regulate the guns!" Some of you will say "It's time to ban guns!".But this my fellow redditors is not the answer. That is the same faulty logic that brings legislators to ban being homeless. Instead of treating the root cause of homelessness.Guns play an important role in our society, as they are our last defense against the government turning their guns on us. We should instead be talking about the root cause of mass shootings which has nothing to do with the tool being used.  I assure you, even if guns were banned, the killer would use an alternative weapon of violence.Notice how the media never speaks about the motivations of the killers, they only focus on their crime. My hypothesis is that they do this because the government itself is pushing for greater gun regulation. Thus they will ultimately use this opportunity, to cast guns as the root source of the issue.These events are indeed a tragedy, and my heart and soul weep for these poor children. But please open your minds long enough to give attention to the motivations of the killer. How can we find a solution if we never take the time to get to the bottom of it?edit:typospermalinksave[+]st3v3n 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (23 children)[]st3v3n 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoI just had a discussion with a friend about this, and I think the gun laws are out of date. The purpose was to protect yourself against the government, but that doesn't apply anymore. The government wouldn't use guns, they use words and media. In centuries past it was necessary because of the lack of worldwide media. But now, if the government ever turned on the US people, the world would have their back. The world would know.So I think the 2nd amendment needs to be revised. Tighter gun control. Several background checks and mental checks before you can buy a gun or something.permalinksaveparent[+]Goethe_ -3 points-2 points-1 points 21 hours ago (3 children)[]Goethe_ -3 points-2 points-1 points 21 hours agoCheck this out. permalinksaveparentload more comments(3 replies)[+]disaster4194 -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago (6 children)[]disaster4194 -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours agoI would also like to add that even if the government used guns? Do you honestly think that small arms will defend against the full might of the U.S armed forces? I mean, look at the resistance in Afghanistan and Iraq. They have no hope of ever overthrowing U.S. forces while we are there and that is just a fraction of the full U.S. military might. permalinksaveparentload more comments(6 replies)load more comments(12 replies)[+]watcher45 -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago (0 children)[]watcher45 -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours agovery well said, I agreepermalinksaveparent[+]phuhcue  comment score below threshold (5 children)[]phuhcue -6 points-5 points-4 points 21 hours agoGood luck getting this point across while these fuckers are in full on over-react/kneejerk mode. permalinksaveparentload more comments(5 replies)load more comments(12 replies)[+]zinspawn -3 points-2 points-1 points 19 hours ago (13 children)[]zinspawn -3 points-2 points-1 points 19 hours agoChina: Man without a gun tries to kill children. 0 dead.

However, since you opened the door I would argue that the question we, as a society, should be asking ourselves isn't how should we best restrict people being able to easily commit such crimes, but rather what makes one want to commit such a crime and how best should we address those causes and create a healthier society. Would banning guns do this? I'm not so sure, as your China example clearly shows. The problem isn't the tools available to individuals, but rather something else, something deeper.permalinksaveparentload more comments(10 replies)load more comments(2 replies)[+]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (33 children)[]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI'm sick of these people using utter tragedies such as this to further illogical gun arguments.

The idea that the Second Amendment, conceived of in an age of slow-loading muskets, somehow guarantees the right to a .233 caliber rifle is not only impossibly stupid, but also incredibly selfish and cowardly.

You can have had proper training and use the weapon in a mature and sensible fashion but then, one day, you lose your job, kids, home and temper. Then, that arsenal of weapons you have in your basement becomes a way of getting back at the world.Take away the legal gun equation and you have the scenario of an angry person having to phone around local criminals in the hope they have a weapon to sell them (providing, of course, they had those contacts to begin with). That could take hours if not days - would your temper last that long?

Anyone in this country can still buy drugs if they want. When the 18th amendment was in effect, people still purchased and consumed alcohol. In countries with bans on certain types of weapons, those weapons are still obtained. The difference is that instead of being obtained from legal, tracked sources, they're obtained from criminals. permalinksaveparent[+]OllieWillie 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago (3 children)[]OllieWillie 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours agoI get that, but drugs and alcohol can't be used by one persion to murder 20 people in the space of minutes.

Not every person who has a gun today would be able or interested in seeking one out on the black market.  It's not like the black market will have an online store.  It's not going to be impossible to get a gun by any stretch, but it'll be a little harder.Not to mention the high end guns.

Since the Columbine shootings in America there have been 31 mass shootings. permalinksaveload more comments(7 replies)[+]Blehgopie 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]Blehgopie 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoThis is one of those rare events that makes me question my opposition to the death penalty.permalinksaveload more comments(1 reply)[+]tnuts420 -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day ago (2 children)[]tnuts420 -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day agoITT: arguments about current gun laws, comments about how americans shoot up schools more than other countries, and maybe some information on the actual shooting if you scroll down far enoughpermalinksaveload more comments(2 replies)[+]cdankochik 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago*(22 children)[]cdankochik 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago*Im sorry to say this, but why are assault weapons legal?EDIT: I saw a picture on twitter of a weapon that was similar/same calibar, and looked like an assault rifle, just a general question, not a commentary on the FUCKING AWFUL events of today.EDIT2: This is not ment as a gotcha! question, but as a legitimate query, I dont live in USA, so I am asking to be educated as to what the benefit to society is for allowing weapons like the one I saw legalpermalinksave[+]EmpyreanSacrifice -5 points-4 points-3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]EmpyreanSacrifice -5 points-4 points-3 points 23 hours agoCause Murica'permalinksaveparentload more comments(1 reply)load more comments(20 replies)[+]epocson -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours ago*(1 child)[]epocson -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours ago*UPDATE VIA NBC NEWS - The shooter's Mother was an employee at the school and was found shot and dead at the school.

I may be naive but I don't walk down the streets in my home town at any point in the day wondering if I am going to get shot. I am sickened by this. You can never mentally put urself in "the killers" shoes. But my god, shoot ur own head off and be the end of it - why destroy 27 other families!? Kill 18 kids!? There unfortunately will be some people say how this killer must have had some serious shit going in and he "wasn't all there" but whatever. You don't go to an elementary school 11 days here Xmas and kill kids and adults! Fuck. And now the killer is dead and doesn't have to deal with their shitty life anymore. Those poor families. All of them. Friends. Loved ones. It's Christmas time. Not that any time of year is right for this but I think the American need to start reviewing their fire arms rights. This is never going to end as long as medical costs are so expensive there for people with mental issues, along with the power of being able to go and purchase a gun. This isn't the first time this happened. What about columbine? Or the batman movie at the theatre.. What is wrong with this world today!??? Call me a sucker for blabbing all this but I just wanted to vent somewhere. All in all - I am so sorry to those families.

Hence guns deterring gun crime.Well. I call fucking bullshit on that, again.

If there was 1 gun in the USA, do you think you'd be in danger? No of course not, the chances of you being affected would be less than winning the lottery. The same logic goes for if there's only 1000 guns, or 10000 guns. You're still safer than if there are hundreds of millions of guns, with basically no restrictions on who owns them.You could do a lot if your government took a full anti-gun stance. Firstly you massively stigmatise gun ownership with national campaigns. You ban buying and selling of all guns and ammunition to those who don't have a license, and you make licenses really really tight (farmers/rural hunters only and no handguns or automatics). You make gun possession without licence illegal and confiscate and fine any perpetrators. You then do an attractive amnesty, where you give people cash back for their guns.permalinksaveparentload more comments(2 replies)load more comments(53 replies)[+]watcher45  comment score below threshold (12 children)[]watcher45 -11 points-10 points-9 points 22 hours agothis is not a gun control issue, this is a mental health issue. More gun freedoms and better mental health care prevent situations like this, gun control only causes more situations like this because people cant defend themselves and criminal know this, they prey on those who cant fight back, so remember that when you espouse gun control and realize how misguided and ineffective that idea is. This is a mental health issue and needs to be treated as such, better mental health care would prevent this, so lets not let emotions overwhelm our reason, More Guns=Less Crime.permalinksaveload more comments(12 replies)[+]sch1490 10 points11 points12 points 23 hours ago (19 children)[]sch1490 10 points11 points12 points 23 hours agoReddit seems to have a vocal pro gun contingent on it.

How long can people insist that "people kill people," without acknowledging that guns, while not responsible, are necessary for abominations like this to occur? I'm so tired of the deflection of responsibility, the insistence that people will get them anyway, the idea that there are other options for killing large groups of people.You know what? Who cares. Guns. Make. It. Easier. To. Kill. Lots. Of. People. Nobody can argue that point and maintain any degree of intellectual honesty. I'm not saying they should be outlawed. My point is simple: we've reached the stage where anybody who denies that the easy availability of guns partially accounts for the fact that mass shootings are vastly more common here than anywhere else in the world is either willfully ignorant, delusional, or just plain lying to avoid having to address the impact that fact has on the gun-control debate.  It's like arguing cars don't make you go faster, putting your foot on the accelerator does.Please stop being disingenuous. Admit there's a problem. Work to solve it, while respecting the rights of gun owners, but stop denying that guns contribute to violence. It has reached the point where that is no longer a remotely credible argument.EDIT: Before anyone says "don't politicize this," it's impossible not to.  Avoiding the impact of mass killings on gun-control legislation is, by definition, political, as it delineates the borders of that debate.  The very act of not politicizing it--with the result that these abhorrent acts are not taken into account when evaluating the effect of guns on society--is political.  Gun violence and politics cannot be separated.  Not anymore.  EDIT #2: Why downvote instead of raising a counterpoint?  If you disagree, engage in discussion.  I'm not saying all guns should be banned.  I'm saying we need to look honestly at the effects of guns on society.  Part of that is that they make it easier to kill people.  That's not the end of the debate; it's simply a necessary element of the beginning.  EDIT #3: Every single opponent of gun control I've seen is quoting this thing about the guy in China who stabbed 22 people.  All 22 are injured.  Not dead.  This is, in fact, a perfect illustration of the effect that using guns has on this type of incident.  Regardless,  if that's the only significant counterexample, your argument is deeply, deeply flawed.permalinksave[+]Kastro187420 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (5 children)[]Kastro187420 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoLook, shit happens, and it sucks. But making the argument that we need more laws and more control over guns because people use them to kill others, is like saying we need more laws and more regulations for cars because people kill others with them on a daily basis.You see, what you DON'T hear about on the news is the numerous instances in which guns have SAVED the lives of people, and STOPPED instances like this. You don't hear that. Why? Because it doesn't make for good news. For every instance you hear about a mass shooting, there are numerous other instances in which someone saved lives with a gun.If your only argument for extra gun laws and control is because the media makes a huge deal about specific shootings, then it's a weak argument. You'd have a far different stance if the media spent their time showing all the various GOOD things guns have done for people instead of only focusing on the bad.permalinksaveparentload more comments(5 replies)load more comments(1 reply)[+]Overfl0w  comment score below threshold (18 children)[]Overfl0w -6 points-5 points-4 points 20 hours agoI've already reacted rather emotionally in this thread and been downvoted through the floor.

Are you hunting deer with assault rifles? They are designed for one purpose, and one purpose only - war.

That whole process should be more difficult.And yes, the black market exists...but the black market generally raises the prices on things exponentially, and carries with it the potential for being busted by undercover cops. Buying a black market gun would be akin to visiting a prostitute...it would be worrisome to even attempt it, because in many cases you would get the bait and switch and end up in jail.It's funny how many people I see defending assault rifles, but also crying the sob story about all the dead kids.

Males are responsible for most gun related violence and almost always the shooter in these heinous incidents. Edit: ok.. Maybe I am stupid. Why the downvotes when this is true?Edit 2: I am also male. Yet I see people assuming I am an anti-male. The point I am making is that attention to men should be focused. Perhaps in mental health and legalities. Not something asinine and impossible like sperm control? Wtf? Some of you are really dumb. Males are inarguably dominant in violence and also the most resistant to seek mental health.

What am I supposed to do? While my sympathies are with the victims and their families, it's not like I'm going to be attending any candlelight vigils. If I were more closely involved in the event, you can bet that I would be grieving and not at all in the mood for politics.But I'm not.It seems like the best use of my time would be to have a discussion about the various causes of these senseless acts of violence and how future policy could deter them going forward. And don't you dare accuse me of 'taking advantage of a tragedy' or 'dancing in the blood of the victims' to 'promote my own political ideology'. If you tried to guess my own views you would almost certainly be totally wrong.So, yes, give the victims and their families all the time they need to grieve, and let them be in peace. Yes, we need to watch out for the extremists who will genuinely attempt to twist this event to suit their purposes. And yes, we need to slap the media hard in the face for being so grotesquely sensationalistic. But how dare you mandate that we who are able not discuss the political implications of this tragedy.permalinksaveload more comments(7 replies)[+]srobison62 -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (0 children)[]srobison62 -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoSo from what i have heard Ryan lanza shot a parent at his (father) went to the school shot the principal, then went to his mothers classroom and began shooting.

He will have slipped through the cracks of our medical system because (before now) he hasn't "represented an obvious threat to himself or others"...which allows us not to pay money as taxpayers to get him the treatment he has needed for years.In the US, our mentally ill become homeless (the vast majority of the US homeless are mentally ill), go to jail, or die in the streets.He will have had legal access to guns and ammunition because his mental illness is A) not yet deemed a risk (see above), and/or B) state governments have a huge backlog of entering people with mental illness into the "no guns for you" databases -- again because it would cost a few tax dollars to finish this work and update these national databases.And the NRA, gun manufacturers, and their apologists will claim that "this is not the time to talk about gun control".If we covered every citizen with full health care (including mental illness) and kept guns away from the mentally ill, these kinds of mass shootings in the US would drop down to the levels seen elsewhere in the civilized world.But the NRA and gun manufacturers make a lot of money off of the fears of the very ignorant and gullible and American taxpayers don't yet want to treat mental illness as a problem society needs to address as a whole.All of this has been known for decades and therefore this post can be cut and pasted in its entirely the next time this happens...unfortunately.permalinksaveload more comments(2 replies)[+]the_codfather  comment score below threshold (2 children)[]the_codfather -8 points-7 points-6 points 23 hours agoDo Americans feel that it might be time to tighten gun control after this latest shooting?permalinksave[+]Benny0_o -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Benny0_o -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoNo, they think it's the time to increase the amount of gun access people have.

He's the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head at a massacre in Tucson, Arizona, in January 2011. Here's what he said:I just woke up in my hotel room in Beijing, China, to learn that another mass shooting has taken place - this time at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and the entire community of Newtown, CT. I just spoke to Gabby, and she sends her prayers from Tucson.As we mourn, we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right. This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws - and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America. This can no longer wait.permalinksaveload more comments(5 replies)[+][deleted] 20 hours ago (1 child)[][deleted] 20 hours ago[deleted]permalinksaveload more comments(1 reply)[+]hecklingheckler  comment score below threshold (1 child)[]hecklingheckler -13 points-12 points-11 points 20 hours agoScrew your second amendment America.

Update source: http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/storiesA gunman who opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, has been killed while several people were taken to local hospitals.  The shooting, which was reported around 9:40 a.m., had taken place in the main office of the school, leaving at least one person with multiple gunshot wounds. Authorities recovered 2 handguns from the scene and are still searching the school grounds. The incident prompted the evacuation of children to a nearby firehouse and the lock down of the entire district. State police sent SWAT team units, ambulances and other units to the school.For more summarized news, subscribe to the /r/SkimThat subredditpermalinksaveload more comments(1 reply)[+][deleted] 23 hours ago (1 child)[][deleted] 23 hours ago[deleted]permalinksaveload more comments(1 reply)[+]Deucy  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]Deucy -6 points-5 points-4 points 23 hours agoI'm speechless.

In 2006, there were 34 killings or attempted killings using firearms, compared to 69 with bladed weapons.  For comparison, in 2005, 10,100 people in the United States were killed with firearms.  Note that the US rate is the actual homicide rate and doesn't include attempted homicides like the Swiss rate mentioned above.The gun culture in Switzerland is completely different from the gun culture we have in America.  I'm not going to speculate on a reason for the lower crime rates (although lower poverty and, more importantly, access to mental health care will probably be major factors).  But I think it provides evidence for the notion that the guns themselves aren't the problem.Also if there are any Swiss Redditors reading this, I'd greatly appreciated if you could comment on on the overall gun culture in Switzerland or related things.permalinksaveload more comments(11 replies)[+]piratepixie 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (2 children)[]piratepixie 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoOne child dead.
