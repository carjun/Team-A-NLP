Speaking on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday, Sen. Feinstein was reacting to the recent horrific Connecticut school shooting on Friday, leading a growing chorus of politicians who are looking for stricter gun control measures."I'm going to introduce in the Senate, and the same bill will be introduced in the House -- a bill to ban assault weapons," said Feinstein.  Speaking on whether or not President Barack Obama would get behind such a bill, Feinstein said I believe he will.Feinstein offered no specific details on the proposed legislation other than that she had been working on a bill for about a year and it would look similar to a 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban that she co-authored on Capitol Hill. That particular bill was allowed to expire in 2004 and Feinstein feels that its clearly time to re-evaluate all options:VIDEO: Sen. Diane Feinstein on "Meet the Press"VIDEO: Sen. Diane Feinstein on "Meet the Press""We've tried to take my bill from '94 to 2004 and perfect it. We believe we have. We exempt over 900 specific weapons that will not fall under the bill," Feinstein said. "It will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession, not retroactively, but prospectively." She went on to say that her new bill, if passed, would ban the sale of gun clips containing more than 10 bullets.Feinstein joins many other senior politicians now requesting that gun control be the main talking point in Congress in early 2013.  Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a statement on Saturday:There has been a rash of these unbelievably horrible incidents, culminating in yesterdays shocking act in Newtown. I am hopeful that yesterdays unspeakable events will cause the nation to re-examine its position on guns, and allow us to come to a solution that still preserves the right to bear arms for law-abiding citizens, but makes it much harder for those who would do us harm to obtain firearms, said Schumer in his statement.Each prominent Senators remarks came within 48 hours of the tragic Newtown school shooting in which Adam Lanza reportedly used a Bushmaster .223 assault rifle to murder 26 people, including 20 children aged under 10.Suggested by the author:Gun control group files suit against Armslist.comBob Costas clarifies his gun control comments with Bill O'ReillyConnecticut School Shooting: 28 dead in shooting spree, including 20 childrenWhen real life horror eclipses the fictional kindPresident Obama travels to Connecticut to meet with the families of the victimsTweet0EmailPrintReport G.J.
