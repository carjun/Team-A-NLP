Rather than the usual comedic sketch, a children's choir appeared on camera and angelically sang Silent Night, with the touching refrain, "Sleep in heavenly peace."Then the members of the New York City Children's Chorus shouted out the NBC show's time-honored introduction: "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"It was the night's sole reference to the tragedy and struck just the right tone.Later, the chorus returned to join musical guest Paul McCartney in a rendition of his Wonderful Christmas Time.TweetEmailPrintShareLinkedInTumblrStumbleUponRedditDel.icio.usDiggAAView Comments|Share your thoughts More In LifestylesADVERTISEMENTMost PopularMost CommentedMore Headlines1Friday timeline: Events of Sandy Hook shooting2NASA to crash 2 probes into moon Monday3EDITORIAL: $500,000 raise after one year?
