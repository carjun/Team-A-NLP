However, the defender only managed to turn the ball over the bar from close range when extending his leg to get his toe to it.Carlton Cole also had a fierce effort repelled by Boaz Myhill in panicked fashion but in truth it was a dismal first half severely lacking in quality and invention and the break came as merciful relief.Thankfully, matters improved at the start of the second half and West Brom immediately put the visitors under pressure with a succession of corners. One such set-piece forced Reid into emergency action as he stuck out his leg, turning the ball onto the top of his own bar in a lucky escape.West Ham played their part too - Gary O'Neil curling a superb effort just wide of the upright - while the hosts continued to mount pressure, Zoltan Gera forcing Jaaskelainen into a fumble before the keeper recovered to save Long's looping follow-up and Morrison attempting a half-decent overhead kick.The Baggies were then only inches away from taking the lead when Brunt delivered a corner from the right and Morrison leapt superbly to power his header against the woodwork. Baggies boss Clarke was a picture of frustration on the sidelines.West Brom had a half-hearted appeal for a penalty when Cole handled in his own box and Brunt made a mess of a volley in a moment that was symptomatic of the game as a whole. However, the Baggies had to make do with a single point as they ended their run of defeats.MAN OF THE MATCHWinston Reid (West Ham): After such a poor game it had to be a defender and Reid made a number of important interventions for his side as well as helping to keep the clever Long quiet.PLAYER RATINGSWEST BROM: Myhill 6, Jones 6, McAuley 6, Olsson 6, Popov 5, Morrison 6, Mulumbu 5, Brunt 6, Gera 5, Odemwingie 6, Long 6.

I was at the match and as a west brom supporter i found the second half very exciting and we created loads of chances. i also imagine that west ham fans would have also found the second half exciting even though were under pressure and would be happy with the way their team defended and cancelled out everything the albion threw at them. just because there weren't loads of goals doesn't mean in was a boring gamev1/comments/context/5209de50-2fab-35f8-a532-c6fedee4dc6d/comment/1355683410272-e114ba56-4a3c-40fa-b27b-3943fa308c39Borat2 hours 10 minutes agoall teams in the pl scored yesterday but this lot couldn't score in a brothel with a fist full of dollars.v1/comments/context/5209de50-2fab-35f8-a532-c6fedee4dc6d/comment/1355689495882-9cbac033-e556-4fd0-bc9a-467f55b56c0bsimon29 minutes agoI am guessing most on here are not football fans...just plastic supporters....or tosers who are triyng to be funny... 0-0 poor shot count, borning... blah blah....defending and tatical awareness is a huge part in all top level football matches- WBA tried and tried but could not break the defence... first half wasnt too good, 2nd was a good half and I am a Hammer, and we defended perfectly......WBA will feel they should have buried us but they couldnt .....v1/comments/context/5209de50-2fab-35f8-a532-c6fedee4dc6d/comment/1355688607834-bbca11c0-2d39-4906-9624-8a000ab4a04fJade Murphy44 minutes ago6th in the premier league...joint 5th....... doesnt say much for the rest does it??????and wendy as for the yawnthorns you aint got a clue, best stick to the washing up!Boing Boingv1/comments/context/5209de50-2fab-35f8-a532-c6fedee4dc6d/comment/1355688275668-8919a1f5-330b-407e-93b1-982f6f326b9cno-one-is-no-one49 minutes agoTom Adams @Yahoo: You really are clueless.v1/comments/context/5209de50-2fab-35f8-a532-c6fedee4dc6d/comment/1355691104966-74fdbe83-90e1-4c33-8ffd-7c56ffe73299alfredo2 minutes 40 seconds agoBore draw . Now Wally Downes has been ejected by Uncle sam West ham will be a duller place . I sensed the Body language between the two was not great,when W.H. scored Wally celebrated by dancing a jig but dour (analysis) Sam merely brushed him off and carried on chewing his wrigleys .He is good at getting rid of people ,Robert Green ,Sam Baldock . Re the latter I remember Sam come on as a sub and being the liveliest player on the field and getting a couple of shots in  Sam appears at the post match interview and  criticises Sam for heading over the bar when nobody else had even been in the opponents half ,talk about giving someone a chance?v1/comments/context/5209de50-2fab-35f8-a532-c6fedee4dc6d/comment/1355689399105-12b1a639-7087-421c-8fd6-2d23b5ef29cfoh31 minutes agoPeople should give non-league football a try.
