It's funny how important 18 US children are vs tens of thousands of foreign children. Do you cry for them everyday? permalinksaveparent[+]happypolychaetes 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]happypolychaetes 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agoNot the time or place to bring this up, dude.permalinksaveparent[+]palealepizza 22 points23 points24 points 1 hour ago (8 children)[]palealepizza 22 points23 points24 points 1 hour agowhat else can they do until parents arrive? if they take them elsewhere, then parents won't know where to pick them up.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 21 points22 points23 points 1 hour ago (7 children)[]Savioritis 21 points22 points23 points 1 hour agoThey reported that they're moving them to a nearby fire station and informing parent who arrive to pick their children up there. My surprise wasn't from the actual going back to the classrooms, but the continuation of classwork. No one is going to be able to pay attention, student nor teacher.permalinksaveparent[+]fordry 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes ago (3 children)[]fordry 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes agowell, this is a different school being talked about...permalinksaveparent[+]sargeantb2 5 points6 points7 points 31 minutes ago (1 child)[]sargeantb2 5 points6 points7 points 31 minutes agoIn the same town where people there know at least the teachers if not the students at the school in question.  I know I wouldn't be able to focus.permalinksaveparent[+]Shovelbum26 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (0 children)[]Shovelbum26 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoI imagine the point is less to actually try to teach than to just keep the students from dwelling on what was happening, and try to distract those worried about family members or aquaitences that might have been in danger.  I'm not saying I agree, but I can at least see some reasoning to that line of thinking.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes agoI thought OP said he was pretty much next door?permalinksaveparent[+]mattmagician 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes ago (2 children)[]mattmagician 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes agoI think it's more to try to distract them, keep them occupied. Keep them from thinking and asking questions. permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 1 point2 points3 points 6 minutes ago (1 child)[]Savioritis 1 point2 points3 points 6 minutes agoTrue, but as OP reported, everyone is in a living hell there... There is no distraction big enough to calm thispermalinksaveparent[+]mattmagician 1 point2 points3 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]mattmagician 1 point2 points3 points 3 minutes agoOh, I agree. But just telling them to sit there and think about it, that'd be just as horrible. Especially at a young age, you have to try to seem like you're in control, even when you're not.permalinksaveparent[+]AmberHeartsDisney 8 points9 points10 points 42 minutes ago (3 children)[]AmberHeartsDisney 8 points9 points10 points 42 minutes agoThey might not want to freak the other kids out.....permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 2 points3 points4 points 31 minutes ago (1 child)[]Savioritis 2 points3 points4 points 31 minutes agoWhile I understand, I think it may be a bit late...permalinksaveparent[+]AmberHeartsDisney 3 points4 points5 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]AmberHeartsDisney 3 points4 points5 points 30 minutes agoSad no matter how you look at it.permalinksaveparent[+]Dmitri_Karamazov 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)[]Dmitri_Karamazov 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes agoYeah, because hearing that over 20 kids are dead where your little siblings (or friend's siblings) probably go won't freak you out at all.permalinksaveparent[+]EatATaco 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes ago (1 child)[]EatATaco 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes agoI was doing contracting for military applications during 9/11.  I remember someone in the elevator telling me a plane had hit the WTC.  When I got to my desk, I looked it up and it was right after the second plane hit.About 15 minutes later, they came on the PA and said "We are safe here.  Everyone return back to work."I packed up my shit and went home immediately.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoSmart man. I was in school when it happened.. Watched the second hit live while I was returning a book to the library. Had no idea what was going on until they locked down the school, turned out the lights and had everyone watching the T.V.permalinksaveparent[+]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes agoSame thing happened when there was a school shooting near my high school.  They did business as usual, but there were TVs on in all the classes and absolutely NOBODY was allowed to roam the halls.  Parents came because they wanted to pick their kids up and take them home, but they weren't allowing any non-students or faculty in the building and that made a little clusterfuck.Really, when it's not your actual school that has the incident, letting kids go home would do nothing but create undue chaos.permalinksaveparent[+]epicflyman 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes ago (1 child)[]epicflyman 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes agoYou'd be surprised. A few weeks back there was an armed robbery at my college. We were "notified" by email that the event occurred, the suspect was still at large, and to keep our eyes open.  Dem safety measures.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 20 minutes ago (0 children)[]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 20 minutes agoSame thing, but with a serial-rapist at my college. There were very nonchalant about it, most likely to keep fear and panic to a minimum. (One victim said it was because his parents were big-time funders)He got caught when he messed with the wrong chick, thankfully.permalinksaveparent[+]jilljuckhaven 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (1 child)[]jilljuckhaven 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoWhy the kids, man? They're just kindergarten kids. How could ....Why? Why, for fuck's sake? Why?I want to throttle the sonofabitch who did this, while screaming 'Why' at him the whole time.I cant stop crying. I cant stop weeping for those kids. For this world.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoThe 20-something year old gunner was "[torn] up" by police, so that's one down. they just reported they're questioning the believed second shooter...I think most of us here have been weeping for this world ever since we were old enough to understand it... It's things like this that make me want to go into psychology... To possibly stop someone from falling off that mental cliff and doing something like this.permalinksaveparent[+]BadGrammarOnPurpose 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (1 child)[]BadGrammarOnPurpose 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoJust say "What the fuck?"  Don't worry, nobody is going to yell at you.  You can curse on the internet.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agoI like saying dafuq :(permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
