A mass attack. Not one of the children died (although sadly 2 are quite seriously ill).Feel free to come at me with more arguments I can easily debunk.Please see the wood for the trees. Guns = gun crime.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

ZERO4) Guns don't protect people. See my above comment, and the fact a while bunch of kids just got murdered.Of course you can't get rid of every single gun - so what? If there was 1 gun in the USA, do you think you'd be in danger? No of course not, the chances of you being affected would be less than winning the lottery. The same logic goes for if there's only 1000 guns, or 10000 guns. You're still safer than if there are hundreds of millions of guns, with basically no restrictions on who owns them.You could do a lot if your government took a full anti-gun stance. Firstly you massively stigmatise gun ownership with national campaigns. You ban buying and selling of all guns and ammunition to those who don't have a license, and you make licenses really really tight (farmers/rural hunters only and no handguns or automatics). You make gun possession without licence illegal and confiscate and fine any perpetrators. You then do an attractive amnesty, where you give people cash back for their guns.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]lonelyinacrowd 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoWell, first you change the 2nd amendment. Then you ban companies from selling guns and ammunition. Then you make it illegal for people to carry guns (except cops). If you get caught with a gun, you get fined and the gun is confiscated. Then you do a massive series of anti-gun = anti-murder campaigns, that make people with guns seem like insecure dangerous idiots to stigmatise gun ownership, which enforces a positive anti-gun social reaction.Of course it's not going to change things over night. But a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. At the moment, the USA is walking blind and backwards.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]lonelyinacrowd -1 points0 points1 point 34 minutes ago*(0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd -1 points0 points1 point 34 minutes ago*I always get downvoted for being a pacifist anti-gun person. But can someone explain this to me. American pro-gunners (of which there seem to be very many), say that having guns is safer than not having guns - because it causes a bit of a standoff situation where "You don't fuck with me, and I won't fuck with you". Hence guns deterring gun crime.Well. I call fucking bullshit on that, again. Clearly, when you have people with guns and they target a place like a school where kids don't have guns to "protect themselves", the pro-gun for less-gun-crime argument is totally void. Unless of course you suggest we give elementary school kids weapons? Maybe just the odd scud missile?permalinksavecontextfull commentsThese are the Christians on my feed...

Most cameras >$30 will do a decent enough job if it's mounted on a tripod in a well-lit room, but getting nice warm audio will take a bit more. I'd recommend getting a nice condenser microphone, or something like a Zoom H4N. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy LEGO is the BEST Company in the World  by  iliekmusikin  videos[+]lonelyinacrowd 1 point2 points3 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd 1 point2 points3 points 14 days agoYes, ethical consumers.

Churchill asked, "Wasn't it awfully cold last night?" When told that yes, it had been one of the coldest winter nights in decades, he said, "Makes you proud to be British."permalinksavecontextfull commentsChanged my perspective  by  Texass440in  atheism[+]lonelyinacrowd 0 points1 point2 points 21 days ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd 0 points1 point2 points 21 days agoBecause social behaviour doesn't need to be based in some kind of deep meaningfulness. Just because there's no deeper purpose to the Universe doesn't mean I need to hate people.I treat people as equals. Because to me we're all equally insignificant. I have no right to interfere in people's lives. In my experience, the people who like to interfere in others' lives, are those who are driven by a perceived purpose.Existential nihilism strips back all the complex layers of teleology in society and exposes people to the cold hard nothingness. Once you've got to grips with that, the only thing is to move on and make the most of the fact that life is an experience you're not going to experience again, so you might as well make the most of it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHaving older siblings improves your likelihood of reaching adulthood, but decreases your chances of getting married and having children  by  lonelyinacrowdin  science[+]lonelyinacrowd[S] 0 points1 point2 points 21 days ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd[S] 0 points1 point2 points 21 days agoBut if you are going to make a point, try not to de-validate it by acting like an sanctimonious and ill-tempered child.permalinksavecontextfull commentsChanged my perspective  by  Texass440in  atheism[+]lonelyinacrowd -1 points0 points1 point 21 days ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd -1 points0 points1 point 21 days agoI think you may have missed the point. Many cast aspersions saying that existential nihilists inherently equal savages with no morals. And it's just not true. I was citing myself as an example, but the vast majority of nihilists are good ethical people as well. permalinksavecontextfull commentsChanged my perspective  by  Texass440in  atheism[+]lonelyinacrowd 13 points14 points15 points 21 days ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd 13 points14 points15 points 21 days agoThis is how I've thought about life since I reached puberty really. The philosophical construct is called existential nihilism. A lot of people criticise it, saying it causes people to go on murderous rampages etc because... hey! why shouldn't they if there's no meaning to life... I personally think that POV is total nonsense. To me, I love looking at the stars and imagining the sheer vastness of the Universe, and by contrast the tininess of myself and the Earth. I think there's a real beauty that we've got here through the culmination of almost infinite actions and reactions that I can only dream of understanding.It's amazing in the most absolute sense. And rather than go on a murderous rampage, I just try to love every minute of it, and encourage other people to do the same. Live and let live.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHaving older siblings improves your likelihood of reaching adulthood, but decreases your chances of getting married and having children  by  lonelyinacrowdin  science[+]lonelyinacrowd[S] 0 points1 point2 points 21 days ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd[S] 0 points1 point2 points 21 days agoBut if you are going to make a point, try not to de-validate it by acting like an sanctimonious and ill-tempered child.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHaving older siblings improves your likelihood of reaching adulthood, but decreases your chances of getting married and having children  by  lonelyinacrowdin  science[+]lonelyinacrowd[S] -1 points0 points1 point 22 days ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd[S] -1 points0 points1 point 22 days agoI'm not sure your point is actually valid in this particular circumstance, given this study is about evolutionary ecology, which doesn't change a great deal in 4-5 generations, not cultural patterns (which do).
