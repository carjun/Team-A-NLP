Instead, she says, focus on creating a "culture of caring" at schools."School shootings are just one symptom of a culture of despair in our schools," Klein said. "There's just a culture of hostility in their schools and different students react to it in different ways."Posted by Jamie Gumbrecht -- CNN Filed under: Issuesvideosoundoff (No Responses)Comments are closed.
