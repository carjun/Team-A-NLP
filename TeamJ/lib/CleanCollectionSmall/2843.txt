Mix in kosher salt and ground pepper.  I has to be cooked rare or medium rare.  If you make it right you dont need a bunch of stuff on it.  Just a little mustard.  If you want to "go crazy" add grilled onioins, aged sharp cheddar and bacon. permalinksavecontextfull comments5123Doctor Who Christmas specials: the real blockbusters? | Den of Geek (denofgeek.com)submitted 3 hours ago by Abscess2 to doctorwhocommentsharecancelloading...6012Brits Most Proud Of Doctor Who (femalefirst.co.uk)submitted 5 hours ago by Abscess2 to doctorwho2 commentssharecancelloading...7012KidsPost writer admits he was wrong on the Redskins (washingtonpost.com)submitted 10 hours ago by Abscess2 to Redskinscommentsharecancelloading...8012Josh Brent, Dallas Cowboy player accused in fatal car crash, had alcohol level twice the legal limit, report says - Crimesider - CBS News (cbsnews.com)submitted 10 hours ago by Abscess2 to Redskinscommentsharecancelloading...9012Washington Redskins: 10 Keys to Victory against the Browns | Bleacher Report (bleacherreport.com)submitted 10 hours ago by Abscess2 to Redskinscommentsharecancelloading...Robert Griffin III Will Make You Forget That Dan Snyder Is An Awful Person  by  diggroin  Redskins[+]Abscess2 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Abscess2 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours agoI doubt that..permalinksavecontextfull commentsD.C.
