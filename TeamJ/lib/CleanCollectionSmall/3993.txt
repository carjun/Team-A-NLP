So it was only fitting that at Wednesday's funeral for Barden, one of the young victims in the Sandy Hook massacre, dozens of firefighters joined the crowd of mourners. The New York firefighters were clad in dress blue uniforms, many with white gloves, at the Wednesday morning at funeral services for 7-year-old Daniel. Twenty children and six adults were killed Friday morning when a gunman, identified by police as Adam Lanza, invaded Sandy Hook Elementary School. The first-grader, frozen in time with a gap-toothed smile in a photo distributed by his family, was to be remembered in a morning service at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Newtown and then laid to rest. Firefighters gathered outside the red-brick church, standing silently alongside the black hearse as mourners filed in.

Yet when the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the results of its expansive investigation into why Wade Michael Page, 40, killed six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., its perspective on his motives consisted of four sentences. "The FBI investigation indicates Wade Michael Page acted alone and was not assisted in committing this violent crime killing six and wounding four other victims," the FBI's statement said in November. "No evidence was uncovered to conclude this attack was directed or facilitated by any white supremacist group. During the shooting at the temple, Page exchanged gunfire with two Oak Creek police officers seriously wounding one, before being shot by another officer, then turning his weapon on himself. There is also no evidence to suggest the attack was part of any ongoing threat to the Sikh community." WHO THEY WERE: Sikh temple shootingvictims The massacre at the...More...Authorities identify suspect, victims in Colorado shootingsBy Andrew Khouri Hours after getting out of jail on domestic violence charges, a Colorado man shot his way into a house and killed his ex-girlfriend, her sister and her sister's husband, authorities said. Then Daniel Sanchez took his own life, Weld County Sheriff John Cooke told reporters. Sanchez, 31, and Beatriz Cintora-Silva, 25, broke up a couple of months ago, Cooke said. According to a 911 tape, Cooke said it appeared that Sanchez had suspected Cintora-Silva of cheating on him and that the shootings stemmed from jealousy and domestic violence. Cintora-Silva had moved out of Sanchezs house in Longmont, Colo., and had been staying nearby with her sister, Maria Cintora-Silva, 22, and her sister's husband, Max Aguirre Ojeda, 32. All were killed in the early morning shooting. Sanchez had been arrested over the weekend on suspicion of kidnapping and assaulting Beatriz Cintora-Silva, Sgt. Tim Schwartz said. He was released on bond from Boulder County jail about 10 p.m. Monday, a few hours...More...2012 is tragic, but mass shootings not increasing, experts sayBy Matt PearceAs Howard B. Unruh barricaded himself in hishomeagainst the police -- after finally running out of ammunition -- he got a call from an assistant city editor at a local newspaper who had looked up his phone number. Why are you killing people? asked the editor, Philip W. Buxton. I dont know, Unruh replied. I cant answer that yet. Ill have to talk to you later. Im too busy now. It was 1949 in Camden, N.J., and Unruh had just killed 12 people and injured four others with a Luger pistol, including women and children. Although some indications suggest the American public has reached a breaking point after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting -- yet another tragic mass shooting in a particularly tragic year -- such attacks have long been a part of American history, and some experts say they are happening not much more often than usual. "There is one not-so-tiny flaw in all of these theories for the increase in mass...More...Two more funerals in Newtown; NRA responds to school  massacreBy Tina Susman and Michael Muskal                                          NEWTOWN, Conn. -- Two more of the children killed by a gunman who invaded a Connecticut elementary school were buried on Tuesday as officials released new details of the deadly spree that has reshaped the debate over gun control. The National Rifle Assn., which has been under pressure to comment on the Newtown shootings, broke its silence and issued a statement saying it was ready to offer its plans at a Friday news conference. We were shocked, saddened and heartbroken by the news of the horrific and senseless murders in Newtown, said the pro-gun rights lobbying group, which has repeatedly fought gun-control legislation on the national, state and local levels. The NRA is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again. PHOTOS:Mourning after the massacre Both funerals were held at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, which has been one of the centers for consoling the bereaved and for memorial services that began Friday...More...Utah sixth-grader brings gun to school, fearing another NewtownBy Andrew KhouriOn the first school day after the Newtown, Conn., shooting, an 11-year-old boy brought a gun to his Utah elementary school, apparently fearful a similar massacre could happen there, officials said Tuesday. Granite School District spokesman Ben Horsley said the sixth-grader at West Kearns Elementary School allegedly waved a .22-caliber handgun at three students Monday during a lunch recess. The students were on a soccer field at the time, he said. The student told police he brought the gun for protection in the wake of the Connecticut school shooting that left 20 first-graders dead, Horsley said. He wanted to defend himself and his friends, based on what hes seen on the news, Horsley said the boy told police. Around 3 p.m., a teacher was told the student had a gun and immediately grabbed the boy, Horsley said. The handgun was found in the students backpack and was unloaded, he said. The gun belonged to an extended family member that was temporarily staying at...More...Year in review: Heartbreak and heroes of 2012By Morgan Little2012 was a year marked by national tragedy -- the shootings in Newtown, Conn. and Aurora, Colo., the damage from Hurricane Sandy -- as well as instances of heroism and transcendence. The presidential election dominated headlines throughout 2012, with a number of candidates jockeying for position in the Republican primaries. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney came out on top, though he eventually lost to President Obama in the general election. The nation debated the "47%," "legitimate rape," who built it, and still, even with the election over, consensus remains rare in Washington, D.C. The killing of black teen Trayvon Martin by Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman riveted the nation, as did the Colorado movie-theater shootings and images in court of gunman James E. Holmes, his hair dyed orange. In December, the massacre of 20 young children and eight adults at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School made us weep. But it was also a year for heroes large and small --...More...'No, no, no': Harrowing 911 call, then 4 dead near Longmont, Colo.By Andrew Khouri Early Tuesday morning, a 911 dispatcher received a call from a Coloradohome. A woman gave an address near the town of Longmont in unincorporated Weld County. Then the dispatcher hears the female caller say, No, no, no. Then the dispatcher hears gunshots, Sgt. Tim Schwartz of the Weld County Sheriffs Office told the Los Angeles Times. Then, Schwartz said, A male gets on the phone and says he is going to kill himself. Another gunshot then rings out over the phone, he said. Inside the home, authorities found four dead, two women and two men. Investigators were still trying to confirm any relationships the dead might have had with one another and to establish a motive, Schwartz said. They are doing the search warrant now and trying to piece everything together. So it will take some time, he said. Schwartz would not say where the bodies were found, but said they were not all in the same place. Schwartz said neighbors were...More...'Puppies for Rent' business in Utah sparks criticismBy John M. GlionnaJenna Miller knows that too many students in her Utah college town suffer from theuniversity blues: too much work, too little time for the companionship that the familypetbackhomecould bring. Not to mention the fact that officials at Brigham Young University, which Miller attends, forbid pets living in the dorms in Provo. So Miller dreamed up a way for students to be able to hold and cuddle a puppy in their dorms -- at least for a few hours -- without breaking university rules. Her new venture is called "Puppies for Rent," and it has been warmly received by students, yet criticized by animal advocates who say it's harmful to the dogs. These young dogs need consistency and stability in their lives, Carl Arky, spokesman for the Humane Society of Utah, told the Los Angeles Times. Were very philosophically opposed to renting them out on so many levels. Under the rules, customers can reserve a young pooch for one or more hours, for a fee starting at $15...More...L.A. girls pay tribute in visit, but Newtown is a day of hearsesBy Tina SusmanRichard and Margarita Rosiak's two little girls woke up Tuesday with an unusual request for how the family from Downey, Calif., should spend their last day of vacation in New York City: They wanted to go to Newtown, Conn., to pay tribute to the 20 children killed in last week's elementary school rampage. "They got up really really early and said, 'Let's go up there and write something and say a prayer,'" said Richard Rosiak, an attorney, as he stood outside St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in central Newtown, about a 90-minute drive from the family's hotel in midtown Manhattan. As he spoke, 9-year-old Charlotte and 5-year-old Katie stood nearby, waiting to be taken to a store where they would buy drawing paper and other supplies to craft a personal card for the first-graders they never met but who have become so familiar to the world. PHOTOS: Shooting at Connecticut school Inside St. Rose, hundreds of mourners were attending a funeral for one of last Friday's victims, 6-year-old James...More...A search for normality as Newtown schools reopen after massacreBy Tina Susman and Michael MuskalNEWTOWN, Conn. -- Amid increased security, schools reopened here on Tuesday as this town searched for a road back to normality after last weeks massacre at a local elementary school. Funerals for the 20 first-graders and six adults killed Friday morning at Sandy Hook Elementary School will continue throughout the week. Two children were buried on Monday amid the cold and rain and two more funerals are scheduled for Tuesday. Sandy Hook remained closed, however, and will likely be shuttered for months as authorities continue their investigation into the shooting spree by Adam Lanza, 20, who killed himself after invading the school, opening fire on students and staff and then turning a gun on himself. The weapons Lanza used were legally owned by his mother, Nancy, who was the first of the 28 people who died from bullets that morning. Yellow school buses rumbled along roads Tuesday morning, some still dotted with makeshift memorials to those who were slain. Children laden with book...More...1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12Older Entries AdvertisementConnectRecommended on FacebookFollow @latimesYour HostsAs an editor and reporter, Michael Muskal has covered local, national, economic and foreign issues at three newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times.  @latimesmuskalMatt Pearce, a University of Missouri graduate, has previously written for the Kansas City Star, the Los Angeles Review of Books, The New Inquiry and The Pitch. @mattdpearceInfertility rates haven't changed much in yearsU.S. scraps 'otter-free zone' in SoCal watersTaking a look at the lunar rovers 40 years laterWhy is McElroy starting for the Jets?Most ViewedLatest NewsSandy Hook: Firefighters salute Daniel, 7; teacher has hero's honor12/19/2012, 9:42 a.m.So why is Greg McElroy, not Tim Tebow, starting for the Jets?12/19/2012, 9:37 a.m.GM to buy back stock from Treasury as U.S. plans bailout exit12/19/2012, 9:32 a.m.'The Voice' recap: Cassadee Pope wins Season 312/19/2012, 9:20 a.m.No standing for Ovation.
