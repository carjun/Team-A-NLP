Smyrna?  Sure...John's Creek?  Maybe...but Woodstock?  Come on, might as well call Rome the Atlanta area.  For all intents and purposes, the Atlanta area is really within the perimeter...so when someone says "Yeah, they have a drive through subway in the Atlanta area...", there's not a person in the room that is going to think you're talking about suburbs 20+ minutes outside of 285.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat happens when you go through Subway's drive-thru moments before closing time.  by  i_am_sadin  WTF[+]MonkeyManJohannon -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)[]MonkeyManJohannon -1 points0 points1 point 4 days agoNo, i just think it's funny that people talk about the "Atlanta area" but extend it out literally to the mountains, lol.  You can call it whatever you like, it just looks half retarded when someone asks where in Atlanta and someone replies "Oh, it's in Woodstock".permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat happens when you go through Subway's drive-thru moments before closing time.  by  i_am_sadin  WTF[+]MonkeyManJohannon -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)[]MonkeyManJohannon -1 points0 points1 point 4 days agoExactly what i was wondering...and please don't say "Oh, there's one near Macon, and one in Helen somewhere..." and refer to it as "Atlanta area", the Atlanta area is inside the perimeter.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat happens when you go through Subway's drive-thru moments before closing time.  by  i_am_sadin  WTF[+]MonkeyManJohannon 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]MonkeyManJohannon 2 points3 points4 points 4 days agoWoodstock isn't the Atlanta area...it's 20+ minutes outside of the perimeter.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat happens when you go through Subway's drive-thru moments before closing time.  by  i_am_sadin  WTF[+]MonkeyManJohannon 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]MonkeyManJohannon 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoWhere?

We search around and see this car sitting all alone in a parking lot...there was literally NOTHING in it but some old radar detector, some garbage and some old cassette tapes.  I looked at him and said "Lets go man..." but he wanted something, so he grabbed the radar detector and we started walking away.  About that time 5 police cars fly up on us and we just put our hands up and dropped to our knees.  The car turned out to be a "bait car" setup to be stolen, and the officers just laughed at us when they realized we took the old, broken radar detector.  They drove us home (after scaring us both for about an hour) and our parents laid into us for a little while...they were more embarrassed by us being idiots than the fact we broke into a car.permalinksavecontextfull comments25000Overly attached Emoji...
