His face has been on CNN and Fox News.  Anyone looking remotely like him or named Ryan Lanza anywhere on the East coast is in incredible danger right now.    This guy should be suing CNN and Fox News and whatever other networks shared the photo because his life could be seriously damaged from all of this.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I went up to accept a trophy for my team and someone snapped a picture and then blasted it out to all the competition and tagged me.   So everyone was commenting and "liking" it because we had won a trophy...but I was so moritified because it was pretty much the most unflattering (ok and I'm super fat) picture ever.I'm going to use THAT photo as my "before" as soon as I get further along, heh.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTo everyone who has lost even just one pound, I wish you my most sincere congratulations. I am curious: What made you guys start?  by  Trebiemanderin  loseit[+]princesskiki 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]princesskiki 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoIt was a combination of two things: 1) Watching all those food documentaries on Netflix and realizing just how fucked up the things I was shoveling into my mouth are  2) Discovering reddit and loseit.  I started 2 weeks after I started reading this forum.Currently I'm down 14 pounds and it took me 6 weeks to get here (31/f/6ft/275/261)  I've had MANY moments that SHOULD have gotten me started...but didnt.   One of my worst was when a group of friends decided to go skydiving.  I drove and it was 2 hours away.  When we got there, I learned that I was too fat (by a LOT) to go skydiving.  So I had to explain to my group of friends why I couldn't go...and either I had to sit there for the next 5 hours while they all went, or drive home by myself 2 hours and see if they could get another ride home.  That was just one of the most horrifying afternoons I've ever had.  Yet even that didn't push me over the edge and get me going.  Also OP I'm close to your height and I remember what I was like at the 200 pound mark.  Since we're both so tall...we can get away with that weight.  Sure we'd love to be skinnier but that amount of weight doesn't look THAT bad on us.  I look forward to the day when I'll be that weight again but just don't let yourself continue to think (like I did) that oh...my height lets me get away with this.  I don't need to worry about weight yet....  and then one day you wake up and you can't shop in any of the stores you love and are stuck with Lane Bryant which will make you feel really depressed.permalinksavecontextfull commentslonely and confusing weightloss  by  lookimaturtlein  loseit[+]princesskiki 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]princesskiki 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoWhat are your worries/fears/unhappy thoughts about?  Are they a body image issue or something else entirely?   I know that losing that much weight so fast is bound to come with other unpleasant side effects (like baggy skin) that can make some people feel just as bad about their looks as if they were fat.I haven't found a link between my weight and my happiness.  There were days when I was much prettier but crying on a weekly if not daily basis.   Now I'm at my fattest and while that makes me pretty darn upset...the rest of my life picks me up.  Some of my happiest moods are happening now when I'm near my highest weight ever.  I guess what I'm getting at is that weight doesn't seem to be MY (and thus maybe your) biggest contributor to your mood.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
