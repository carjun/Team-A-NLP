I generally had my Shepard nice to everyone in the crew and completely cutthroat out in the field or when he needed stuff to be done.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your useless talent?  by  IamSofaKingIttyin  AskReddit[+]knotswag 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]knotswag 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoI can play 5 instruments all pretty well. But I don't play them for anybody else and I never mention it to people I know in real life because I feel uncomfortable about it. It really feels like a waste cause music is meant to be heard.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I hope to be long but I monitor it very closely cause I think people that are skeptical about solar have credible points. Solar is hard to nail down and risky as all hell, but I think it's one of those things where you shouldn't be dissuaded from making money just because of that.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBee vs Flocker FT5 - Set 1 @ THE BROKENTIER SUITE - NEC XIII  by  121jigawattsin  MvC3[+]knotswag 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]knotswag 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoYou know when all is said and done, I'm shocked at how little attention Flocker gets in comparison to the other elite players.

No, that would be too easy. After Shepard's last visit to Tuchanka, rumors have passed through that there was an out and out brawl between a human and dozens of Krogans. All for a single smuggled toothbrush said to be worth above 6,000 credits-- it was trading for far above market value. This was because the Krogans, warlike as they were, had been aiming to modify the miniature mass effect fields that the toothbrush put out for deadlier purposes. They were calling it the "Maw Brusher." For them, it was a chance for riches. For Shepard, it was an opportunity to win Traynor's loyalty so if there was another suicide mission Traynor's survival chances would improve totally inexplicably. As Shepard hurled away the final Krogan, gasping for air and drenched with blood, biotics screaming in the sand-choked wind, and the toothbrush within reach and jutting out of one of the dunes like an ancient sword of legend... it was then that the communications fizzled to life. Joker was on the other end with these important words:"Hey, Commander? That's not the brand that Traynor likes."permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter watching myself on a video project I had to do for class...  by  canrememberin  AdviceAnimals[+]knotswag -3 points-2 points-1 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]knotswag -3 points-2 points-1 points 3 days agoI have some bad news. This will preclude you from any job opportunity and you likely will die alone and a virgin because of your unattractiveness. In fact if there was to be a genocide right now, you'd be the first to go. You'd be roped up with the rest of the uglies and made to stare at each other for hours on end, knowing that you're not any better-looking than the person in front of you, and eventually succumbing to lethal levels of low self-esteem. You'll be left to flounder about on the floor, twisting and muttering unintelligible nonsenses that no one will care about because you're unattractive.We call these poor people defeatists. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnti-Morrigan Tech Proof of Concept (Hulk/Sent) by KaneBlueriver  by  Veseriusin  MvC3[+]knotswag 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]knotswag 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoI completely agree.

I like Garrus/Kaidan or Liara because I run a Sentinel Shepard and they mesh well. Give Garrus a sniper rifle and he saves my ass when I'm in the middle of blasting away more times than not. If I was being honest I'd always go Garrus/Liara, but I felt like technically Liara wouldn't be seeing much combat because she's more valuable doing other things whereas Garrus/Kaidan both would be more suited to go on field missions.Typical being too invested in the game bullshit, but whatever.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMegaman X Street Fighter (So I guess no Megaman DLC for Marvel haha)  by  KrazFDin  MvC3[+]knotswag 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]knotswag 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoI'm fucking hype for this.

When some people say you should play "x," it's actually because they genuinely want to share something they liked and enjoyed with you.
