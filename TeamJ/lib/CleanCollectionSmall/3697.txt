The December 15 vote faced opposition from the start as the constituent assembly that penned the constitution was accused of being one sided. President Mohamed Morsi called out the military to ensure security in the run up to the elections on Saturday.  The constitution, if okayed, will be the first to come into effect since former President Hosni Mubaraks departure and would shape Egypts future for years to come. The Muslim Brotherhood and its allies have been pushing for the approval of the draft of constitution. On the other hand, the Egyptian opposition has been voicing their concern over the constitution, which they say is not inclusive of all views and only favors the Islamist regime.  Egyptian people appear to be in favor of the referendum, as high turnouts were noted today with an announcement that the ballot would be extended to a second day of voting in a weeks time. Some 51 million people are registered to vote in the referendum.  Commentators on the fate of the constitution have boiled it down to a vote between an Islamic or a secular state, as the constitution is increasingly being viewed as a means to usher in Islamic law or Sharia, which is predominant in the draft of constitution.  The main opposition party, the National Salvation Front, has been opposed to the draft of constitution and the referendum and said that all its supporters would be going to the ballot to vote against it. It also voiced concern about the manner in which the referendum is being conducted, saying in a statement, that it has "deep concern... over the number of irregularities and violations in the holding of the referendum, adding that there is a "clear desire for vote-rigging by the Muslim Brotherhood."  1 of 1               Members of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood including now-President Mohamed Morsi (3rdL) take part in a 2011 press conference      arkar is based in Seattle, Washington, United States of America,      and is an Anchor for Allvoices.Report CredibilityShare:Tweet    Credibility ReachGlobal ReachThis report's viewers come from the following                    countries:United States of America (98.6%)United Kingdom (0.2%)Canada (0.2%)Philippines (0.2%)12 other countries (0.7%)READ MORE:Egyptian constitutional referendum, referendum, Constitution, Egypt, ballotMore News From:Cairo : EgyptAdvertisementPost a CommentComments: 0Enter your comment belowAdd Your CommentSave ChangesCancelAdvertisementRelated Allvoices ContributionsEgyptian rights groups accuse Morsi of rigging in constitutional ...By: StephenManualSerious rigging allegations have been leveled against ruling Freedom and Justice Party of Egypt in the first phase of constitutional referendum.
