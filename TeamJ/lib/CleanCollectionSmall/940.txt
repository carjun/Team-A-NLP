This is the best response that I've seen yet.  Bravo.Here is a link to a Slate article about the Giffords shooting in Arizona that backs up one of your points:  http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2011/01/friendly_firearms.htmlan excerpt: But before we embrace Zamudio's brave intervention as proof of the value of being armed, let's hear the whole story. "I came out of that store, I clicked the safety off, and I was ready," he explained on Fox and Friends. "I had my hand on my gun. I had it in my jacket pocket here. And I came around the corner like this." Zamudio demonstrated how his shooting hand was wrapped around the weapon, poised to draw and fire. As he rounded the corner, he saw a man holding a gun. "And that's who I at first thought was the shooter," Zamudio recalled. "I told him to 'Drop it, drop it!' "But the man with the gun wasn't the shooter. He had wrested the gun away from the shooter. "Had you shot that guy, it would have been a big, fat mess," the interviewer pointed out.Zamudio agreed:I was very lucky. Honestly, it was a matter of seconds. Two, maybe three seconds between when I came through the doorway and when I was laying on top of [the real shooter], holding him down. So, I mean, in that short amount of time I made a lot of really big decisions really fast.  I was really lucky.permalinksavecontextfull comments4001"I didn't want gunshots to be the last thing they heard"...interview with the conn teacher (youtube.com)submitted 5 hours ago by Sargentrock to news1 commentsharecancelloading...Editorial comic 1-12-11: Guns vs Mental Health Care  by  z0mbiel0vein  politics[+]Sargentrock 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]Sargentrock 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours agoI have one, but thank you for your concern.

I work at a place where we had a customer going crazy and threatening us...repeatedly.  It went on for several months, before we finally had a cop stand up and do something about it.  He basically told us that if they arrest someone and there's any suspicion of mental problems then it means possibly up to a week with that person in and out of hospitals and most cops just dont want to go through the hassle---the system is broken in a LOT of ways right now.Fortunately he's in jail and (after two months) STILL being evaluated and will very likely be committed for serious mental illness..or so I've been told.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEditorial comic 1-12-11: Guns vs Mental Health Care  by  z0mbiel0vein  politics[+]Sargentrock -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours ago (0 children)[]Sargentrock -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours agoI see you're getting some down-votes for this, but I laughed pretty hard...and I really needed a good laugh today.

Somehow that really brings the immensity of this tragedy home.
