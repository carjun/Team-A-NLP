Think having each of them lined up one by one and shot in the back of the head (example).Edit: I should specify this is in terms of the actual killings taking place, rather than the motive or planning of the shooter.permalinksaveparent[+]Sn1pe 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Sn1pe 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoIsn't that like what the Norway shooter did?permalinksaveparent[+]Tokkay 8 points9 points10 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Tokkay 8 points9 points10 points 21 hours agoNo, maybe some of them got executed. Otherwise he just walked around on a very small island for an hour and a half or something. So sure, during that time it probably happened, but that wasnt the method he used.permalinksaveparent[+]deadundead 8 points9 points10 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]deadundead 8 points9 points10 points 22 hours agoProbably stood up against a wall, lined up all next to each other...  :(permalinksaveparent[+]PecanSoup 13 points14 points15 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]PecanSoup 13 points14 points15 points 22 hours agoLined up, probably on knees, with their head being the main target, close range. I really hope this isn't true. permalinksaveparent[+]dem358 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]dem358 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours agoNo, no, no. Oh my god, this is just getting worse and worse, I just called my nephew to talk to him after hearing about the news today (I don't live in the States and just heard about it). I am constantly scared that something is going to happen to him, I don't know what I would do or how I would live if anyone hurt him intentionally like this. Who the fuck does such a thing? I just don't get it.permalinksaveparent[+]Chicken_McNigger 29 points30 points31 points 22 hours ago*(7 children)[]Chicken_McNigger 29 points30 points31 points 22 hours ago*Guess where this guy came from? http://i.imgur.com/l9ru5.jpg [NSFW]permalinksaveparent[+]swicken 16 points17 points18 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]swicken 16 points17 points18 points 22 hours agoCreepy. Unless that photo is doctored I'd say there's a good chance it's related. 4chan really does house the refuse of the world. permalinksaveparent[+]sean_incali 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]sean_incali 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoThat's the picture picture of Columbine shooters (unless you're referring to the screencap, then it maybe shopped.)permalinksaveparent[+]Influenzed 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours ago (1 child)[]Influenzed 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours agoI'm calling bullshit, link me the thread.permalinksaveparent[+]Chicken_McNigger 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Chicken_McNigger 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoDo you not understand how 4chan works?
