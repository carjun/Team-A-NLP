But we do know the weapons Adam Lanza used to kill his victims came from her home. As new details emerge, the scope of the horror expands. Lanza apparently sprayed two classrooms at the school with relentless fire from a semi-automatic assault rifle. It was a massacre, and most of the victims were first-graders. Autopsies on the bodies of the children reveal that many, if not all, had been shot multiple times. "I only did seven of the autopsies," medical examiner Wayne Carver said. "The victims I had ranged from three to 11 wounds a piece, and I only saw two of them with close-range shooting." All Conn. shooting victims hit multiple timesConn. school shooter had 4 weaponsList of Conn. school shooting victims Investigators believe most of the bullets came from a Bushmaster .223 assault rifle. It was one of four guns Lanza took from the home he shared with his mother after he shot and killed her. Sources say he left one gun in his car and forced his way into the school carrying the assault rifle in his hands and two semi-automatic pistols in the dark military-style cargo pants he was wearing. Inside the school, he zeroed in on two classrooms, killing 20 children and six adults. One of them was the school principal, who sources say tried to stop the shooting by lunging at the gunman.  The spree ended when Lanza shot himself with one of the handguns. Police have yet to find any journal or detailed notes Lanza may have left behind explaining his horrific actions. But Lt. Paul Vance said clues to the possible motive have been recovered in multiple searches. "(We) did produce some very good evidence in this investigation that our investigators will be able to use and hopefully painting a complete picture as to how and more importantly why this occurred," Vance said.  It's not clear why Lanza targeted that elementary school. There were early reports on Friday that indicated his mother had been a teacher or an aide at Sandy Hook. Police have found no evidence she had any obvious connection to the school. Police are also checking on a different report that maybe Lanza had been involved in an argument with staffers at the school the day before the shooting. Police have not confirmed that. 36 PhotosVigils for Conn. school shooting victimsView the Full Gallery     2012 CBS Interactive Inc.

These homicides are concentrated in the neighborhoods of about a dozen major U.S. cities. Some of the most violent countries in the world allow no private firearms ownership. Countries that have stripped citizens of the gun rights in the last few decades now suffer from increased violent crime on the civilian population. Many of the countries gun banners point to as gun control examples exercise a tight control on many and all individual freedoms not just guns. I doubt if any of the gun banners would be happy living there once they got a taste of what limited freedom is all about. Many of these gun banner example countries are geographically small, have a common religion and/or little racial diversity etc. In other words a common bond that in many cases prevents individuals from acting out. I personally witnessed many events where a private citizen with a firearm used it to save his life and/or the lives of others. These were not isolated events, but are common everyday events. Most never make the media because they are deemed not to be newsworthy especially if not weapon was fired.In any gun ban the police are always allowed to the keep the guns/magazines that are taken from the private citizen. Why? As a retired LEO I can answer that question: Those firearms are the most effective for self-defense when you need to protect yourself and others. LEO's would not stand for these firearms/magazines to be taken from them.

Everyday thousands of pounds of illegal drugs enter the country "illegally" and people cross the border almost at will. Since we have been completely unable to stop drugs and people from entering the country, I fail to see how making guns illegal would change anything. The estimated total number of guns held by civilians in the United States is 270,000,000 , which makes it impossible to collect all of these weapons. A gun is a tool, like a car, or flashlight. There have been and always will be those people who are mentally diseased that choose to use a tool to harm others. The Bath disaster in Bath Township, MI, on May 18, 1927 which killed 38 elementary school children, two teachers, four other adults and the bomber himself. At least 58 people were injured. Most of the victims were children in the second to sixth grade attending the Bath Consolidated School. Their deaths constitute the deadliest mass murder in a school in U.S. history. NO FIREARMS WERE USED.

Crazy people will kill no matter what laws are put in place.                         by misterjags December 16, 2012 11:32 AM EST  The President should immediately call for a nation-wide ban on high capacity magazines. Institute a time-limited buy back program. No grandfathering. This would be a simple step in the right direction that should attract support from across the political spectrum.     Reply to this comment            by joelwisch2 December 16, 2012 11:28 AM EST  Lanza apparently sprayed two classrooms at the school with relentless fire from a semi-automatic assault rifle--------------------------------------You don't spray anything with a semi-automatic assault rifle. A Human Being doesn't spray anything with a semi-automatic assault rifle. It is a rifle that you pull the trigger on until it is empty. But in the end, there is nothing that can be said beyond a human that was not properly cared for used a common tool to murder little kids. But a human did the job, and just like using a car, or a knife, or any weapon, he extracted a terrible toll before he died. THAT is far more the issue than gun control, and as we watch all the major networks play programs that are deeply, horribly violent, maybe we can expect no less. In fact, if you do watch the incredibly violent Network Programing, THAT should be a reason for denying the possession of weapons of mass destruction.. such as a car, a semi-auto gun, a big knife and any dangerous chemicals.

Reply to this comment           by Esus927 December 16, 2012 11:33 AM EST  Actually, the story states that investigators believe that. Early reports are often incorrect, after all this person was first reported to be Ryan Lanza.                      by misterjags December 16, 2012 11:37 AM EST  Relevant statement by the medical examiner:http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/medical-examiner-sandy-hook-victims-shot-by-rifle/2012/12/15/78cf63e8-fe84-4f9b-ad20-5aff1e178c78_video.htmlAll of the children suffered multiple gunshot wounds caused by the Bushmaster assault rifle.                         by myprivateidaho December 16, 2012 11:15 AM EST  Long past time to arm and train teachers in the us of deadly force. This tragic event would have assuredly been cut short, and, "discipline" problems at school would likely cease.     Reply to this comment           by Esus927 December 16, 2012 11:31 AM EST  I see this type of comment often when tragedies like this happen, but the thing is is that I cannot recall a single instance of a civilian carrying a concealed weapon preventing a madman from unleashing evil... And your comment about school discipline is simply grotesque.                         by Sisa123 December 16, 2012 11:03 AM EST  This whole conversation about gun control will disappear once the dust settles. At least, that is what the NRA is hoping for. In some sense, their logic has served them well many times over. However, I have a feeling that this time is different. The pictures of those innocent children being slaughtered simply because a mad man had easy access to a high powered weapon cannot easily be forgotten.     Reply to this comment           by RexDiamond December 16, 2012 11:09 AM EST  Yes, because lower powered guns would have made all the difference. Do you propose that we make guns as hard to come by as drugs? You silly liberals and your little catch phrases.                         by Bendech December 16, 2012 10:58 AM EST  Semi automatic weapons are NOT "arms" under the second amendment. Just as a suit case nuclear weapons, hand grenades, tanks and RPG's are not considered "arms" under the second amendment. Semi automatic weapons belongs in the same class as chemicals weapons, plastic explosives and pipe bombs...they are Weapons of Mass Destruction.A Weapon of mass destruction is a weapon that can kill and bring significant harm to a large number of humans (and other life forms) and/or cause great damage to man-made structures (e.g. buildings), natural structures (e.g. mountains), or the biosphere in general.A semi automatic gun that can fire dozens of rounds of "exploding bullets"as fast as you can trigger pull the trigger fits that description. They are designed to kill masses of people in a short amount of time with little hope that the victims can escape injury. No serious mass murderer would ever think of going on a rampage without one.In 1790 when the second amendment was written "arms" were flintlock weapons that were highly inaccurate, limited in range and could fire no more than 2 or 3 rounds per minute...provided the shooter was an expert. Even in battle these flintlocks were useless after just one shot (after which a soldier with little time to reload had to rely solely on his bayonet.) The authors had no way of imagining that 250 years later those same flint locks would morph into weapons that even an amateur could use to fire a dozen deadly projectiles in a single second.Lanza sprayed two classrooms at the school with relentless fire from a semi-automatic assault rifle. That weapon of mass destruction killed 20 innocent children and 8 helpless adults IN Sandy Hook. There is no way that WMDs like these were meant to be protected under the original Second Amendment. Our forefathers were much smarter than to allow that to happen.     Reply to this comment           by MrLiterally December 16, 2012 11:28 AM EST  Well, you have some points. Obviously, some weapons have so much firepower, they tilt the balance too much in favor of one deranged individual. So, putting a cap on what kind of gun/mag. capacity, etc... on civilian-owned firearms might be one answer.However, if the purpose of an armed society is to keep government in check, then how can that work if government limits whether or not folks can be armed and with what.I, for one, think age limits is the answer, or at least part of it. Lots of these mass shooters seem to be young men in late teens or early 20's. Not all of them, but most of them seem to fit that. Maybe we need to enact a law requiring a person be 25 years or older to possess certain weapons (exempting police officers and military personnel, of course).                         by RexDiamond December 16, 2012 10:48 AM EST  This is the most agenda driven, inaccurate article I haveread regarding the shooting. An assault rifle is not semi automatic. You do not spray bullets with semi automatic weapons. Bob Orr is not reporting the news. Bob Orr is trying to get gun legislation passed. Bob Orr should not be considered a journalist.     Reply to this comment           by AndyBly December 16, 2012 11:12 AM EST  Yes, indeed. Here's another liberal site that calls it an assault rifle too: http://www.gunsamerica.com/Search.aspx?T=Bushmaster%20.223%20assault%20rifleDarn agenda driven gun sites!                      by AndyBly December 16, 2012 11:16 AM EST  Yes indeed.

Been watching Monty Python lately? Those kids weren't sprayed with bullets at a high powered rate of frequency. He only inflicted flesh wounds.Did you not think all we have to do is Google this weapon and find it advertised everywhere as an assault rifle?                         by Sisa123 December 16, 2012 10:44 AM EST  It is funny how the gun business wants to convince you that you solve violence by having more guns! You need a semi-automatic weapon to fight someone who has a semi-automatic weapon. It is like having a bigger gun than your neighbor in order to feel safe and while there is a lot of profit made by the gun business.     Reply to this comment           by RexDiamond December 16, 2012 10:58 AM EST  Do you have any idea how long semi automatic weapons have been around. Do you have any idea how many common guns are semi automatic? Do you even understand what semi automatic means?                     1 2 3 4 5 Next   See all 137 Comments     Add a comment     Subscribe to this comment thread by email  SUBMIT         Click here to add another comment.
