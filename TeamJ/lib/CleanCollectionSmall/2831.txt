Thoughts?  by  Parus_Major87in  saskatoon[+]bilateralchicken 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]bilateralchicken 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoJohn Gormley is just lickin' his chops over this one, I bet.I'm not overly religious. Never went to church as a kid, haven't really paid any thought to religion in general... But what a petty thing to complain about. "Christmas" while the name refers to "Christ's mass" isn't really even a "religious" holiday anymore. It's a family holiday. Some may choose to celebrate it in a religious manner, and that's fine, but really... Choosing a fight over this? Don't like it? Don't read it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsRyan Nugent-Hopkins named captain of Canadian junior team; Scott Harrington & Jonathan Huberdeau the alternates  by  kmadin  hockey[+]bilateralchicken 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]bilateralchicken 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours agoUnlikely, but what happens if the lockout ends between Christmas and New Years?

Don't be a fool.As to playing while negotiating? Hah. Yeah... Remember the 1994 season in baseball. They tried that. What happened? The MLBPA went on strike and killed the season and damaged the game of baseball for years to come. It took jacked up 'roid heads hitting balls 2 miles into the air to get the game of baseball back. Oh, who was the leader then? Donald Fehr. Hmm. It's pretty standard in professional sports that no CBA = Lockout, thanks to the MLBPA and 1994. It's happened in the NBA and NFL. Doing so puts all the leverage into the players hands. Why would any league want that?To play that card and to call me an idiot as actually kind of funny. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBarack Obama Urges NHL and NHLPA: "Do right by your fans"  by  kilocharleyin  hockey[+]bilateralchicken 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]bilateralchicken 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours agoThat's nice and all, but a bunch of Republican voting rich dudes aren't going to listen to Obama.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Jesse Spector, Sporting News national hockey writer, AMA  by  jessespectorin  hockey[+]bilateralchicken 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]bilateralchicken 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoDoes a shortened season help a team like, say, Edmonton sneak into the playoffs as an 8th seed?permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis isn't my car... but this is why I hate living in the Bible belt.  by  ameleafin  atheism[+]bilateralchicken 2 points3 points4 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]bilateralchicken 2 points3 points4 points 12 hours ago"That'll make 'em believe in god."permalinksavecontextfull commentsBettman, NHL already appear winners on paper  by  FullSharkAlligatorin  hockey[+]bilateralchicken 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]bilateralchicken 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoFuck em both.Fighting over dimes that they don't deserve.
