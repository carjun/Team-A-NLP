(Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images)Photos: Connecticut elementary school shooting gallery (41 photos)Investigators found "very good evidence" to help explain why a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on a Connecticut grammar school yesterday, police said this morning.Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, declined to elaborate on the whether the shooter left a note or other messages explaining why he forced his way into a Newtown, Conn., school. But police are continuing to comb through the crime scene."It is going to be a long and painstaking process," Vance said at a packed press conference shortly after 10 a.m. this morning.The names of the victims are expected to be released later today, as soon as the local medical examiner concludes his investigation, police said. The local school superintendant and other town officials are also expected to address the media.Vance said state police troopers have been assigned to each of the victims' families as dozens of reporters, photographers and camera crews arrived in Newtown to cover the aftermath of the tragedy."They have asked for you to please respect their privacy," Vance said.Police say the massacre began yesterday when Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old that some friends and neighbors say had a personality disorder, shot and killed his mother at her home. Then, Lanza went to Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown carrying at least two handguns.Lanza killed 26 people -- 20 children and six adults -- before shooting himself. It was the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history after the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre where 33 people died.Children at Sandy Hook Elementary hid under desks and in closets with their teachers during Lanza's shooting spree, according to witnesses. Some children were told to close their eyes as they were led from the building, to avoid seeing the carnage.Police briefly detained Ryan Lanza, Adam's older brother, at his home in Hoboken yesterday. In the confusion after the shooting, some media outlets and law enforcement officials identified Ryan Lanza as the shooter. Before he was led from his home in handcuffs, Ryan Lanza posted "IT WASN"T ME I WAS AT WORK IT WASN'T ME" on his Facebook page.Law enforcement sources told the Associated Press at least three guns were found at the shooting scene a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer pistol inside the school and a .223-caliber rifle in the back of a car. Lanza, who was 20, was too young to own guns under state law. But his mother had legally registered four weapons and his father legally owned two weapons, according to the Associated Press.As the story behind the shooting continued to unfold overnight, the quaint New England town filled will members of the news media. Newtown, located about 60 miles northeast of New York City, was clogged with vehicles this morning as news trucks and cars spilled over onto winding rural roads.Dozens of microphones covered the podium where local officials briefed the media on the tragedy in this morning's press conference.Meanwhile, residents of the community were bracing to hear the names of the victims as Newtown joined Columbine and Aurora on the list of towns that have become synonymous with mass shootings."Everyone here knows everyone else, as clich as it sounds," said Emily Nacewicz, 17, a student at Newtown High School."Even using the words Newtown and Columbine in the same sentence is gut wrenching," Nacewicz said. "My heart is broken. I can't digest this."Around the country, the shooting revived discussions of gun control and school security. Parents also worried about what to tell their young children as they prepare to return to school on Monday.Stories like this bring the worst of our fears to the surface, said Joe Colford, president of the New Jersey Association of School Psychologists and a member of the faculty at Georgian Court University in Lakewood.Follow @starledgerRelated StoriesReports: Gunman had altercation at school days before shootingConnecticut school shooting: Psychologist killed had family in South JerseyCopyright 2012 NJ.com.
