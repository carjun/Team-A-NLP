The massacre of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary school elicited horror and soul-searching around the world even as it raised more basic questions about why the gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, would have been driven to such a crime and how he chose his victims./ AP Photo/Mary Altaffer    Last Updated 1:33 p.m. ET The massacre of 26 children and adults at a Connecticut elementary school elicited horror and soul-searching around the world even as it raised more basic questions about why the gunman, a 20-year-old described as brilliant but remote, was driven to such a crime and how he chose his victims.Play VideoShooter's home offers clues to motivePlay VideoConn. school shooting hits home for CBS News correspondent Investigators were trying to learn more about Adam Lanza and questioned his older brother, who was not believed to have been involved in the rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary. Police shed no light on the motive for the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.A law enforcement source told CBS News that Adam Lanza had three weapons with him during the attack: Two handguns (a Sig Sauer and a Glock), and a Bushmaster .223 assault rifle; spent shells were found in the school. Those three weapons were registered to his mother. There was also a fourth weapon (a long gun) found in the car he drove to the school. In addition, the source told CBS News there were "a few" other weapons found at the mother's house. The registry of the weapon in the car and at the house are still be checked. The tracing of all the weapons - such as where and when they were purchased - is still being conducted. The Associated Press reports a Henry repeating rifle, an Enfield rifle and a shotgun were recovered. It was not clear exactly where those weapons were found.Lanza is believed to have suffered from a personality disorder and lived with his mother, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation. Lanza's aunt said her nephew was raised by kind, nurturing parents who would not have hesitated to seek mental help for him if he needed it.Marsha Lanza, of Crystal Lake, Ill., said she was close with Adam Lanza's mother, Nancy, and sent her a message on Facebook on Friday morning asking how she was doing. Nancy Lanza never responded.Marsha Lanza described Nancy Lanza as a good mother and kind-hearted.If her son had needed counseling, "Nancy wasn't one to deny reality," she told The Associated Press late Friday.Marsha Lanza said her husband saw Adam as recently as June and recalled nothing out of the ordinary about him.Asked at a news conference whether Lanza had left any emails or other writings that might explain the rampage, state police Lt. Paul Vance said investigators had found "very good evidence" and hoped it would answer questions about the gunman's motives. Vance would not elaborate.Officals also said that the suspect forced his way into the school; he was not let in voluntarily.The tragedy plunged the picturesque New England town of 27,000 people into mourning.

They are taking down decorations," said Jeannie Pasacreta, a psychologist who volunteered her services and was advising parents struggling with how to talk to their children.Lanza shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, drove to the school in her car with at least three of her guns, and opened fire in two classrooms around 9:30 a.m. Friday, law enforcement officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.A custodian ran through the halls, warning of a gunman, and someone switched on the intercom, perhaps saving many lives by letting them hear the chaos in the school office, a teacher said. Teachers locked their doors and ordered children to huddle in a corner, duck under their desks or hide in closets as shots reverberated through the building.The well-liked principal, Dawn Hochsprung, was believed to be among the dead. A woman who worked at the school was wounded.Maryann Jacob, a clerk in the school library, was in there with 18 fourth-graders when they heard a commotion and gunfire outside the room. She had the youngsters crawl into a storage room, and they locked the door and barricaded it with a file cabinet. There happened to be materials for coloring, "so we set them up with paper and crayons."After what she guessed was about an hour, officers came to the door and knocked, but those inside couldn't be sure it was the police."One of them slid his badge under the door, and they called and said, `It's OK, it's the police,"' she said.A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said investigators believe Lanza attended the school several years ago but appeared to have no recent connection to it. It was not clear whether he held a job.At least one parent said Lanza's mother was a substitute teacher at the school. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.       no previous page     next    1/2    2012 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Clearly, there was something terribly out of whack with this woman too.     reply        john92021 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  not you typical elementary school teacher, armed to the teeth.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  littleredtop says: Their motives and their choice of weapons is immaterial. The real issue here is why are the mentally disturbed not institutionalized?     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  jefflz-2009 says: The US is the most backward of nations when it comes to the obsession to own guns on the part of a minority and the unwillingness of the government to regulate access to these weapons. The Second Amendment does not guarantee the right to bear arms as is so often recited, rather it is clear that the Second amendment was written to prevent state governments from blocking ownership of guns for the purpose of forming militias. The Second Amendment was written when there was no US Army, or Navy. The Second Amendment was written in lieu of the creation a national defense force and we now have a powerful army, navy and air force. It is time for the US government to establish uniform and reasonable control of gun ownership on a nationwide basis. We cannot allow the gun lobby and the NRA continue to distort the Constitution for their own purposes. We cannot allow madmen continued access to weapons. This is no longer a question of liberal versus conservative. We must unify and prevent further slaughter of the innocent.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  nicoleleej says: Please sign the petition at white house dot gov in wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School Massacre to "Re-evaluate gun control laws: Have every gun owner re-register his firearm yearly like his vehicle." Re-registering firearms annually promotes responsibility in managing gun control. We need a hunting rifle, a powerful firearm and more bullets not an excess of guns.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  rodoftruth says: Of course the gun lovers will say "If only the children were armed..." Enough is enough!     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  One American says: CBS and the rest of the Leftist networks need to first start with their own soul-searching to find the motives of these deranged killers.When you look at the outrageously violent programming that CBS and the other networks provide EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK, and how the Leftist "news" networks sensationalize and glorify violence by endlessly live-covering tragedies, you can see where crazy people get their motives from.So much of what the Leftist networks like CBS put on the air is filled with the intention of modifying the behaviors of the viewers.Why would CBS be surprised that it really works?That's why they call it "programming".     reply        Landyn10 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Yes I'm sure it has nothing to do with out violent military state propagated by our military industrial complex and the banking system that funds it. Face it killing = money for the military industrial complex and military banking complex. Funding wars and violence has always been profitable and supply weaponry for wars and violence has as well. I'm not saying that people can't be conditioned, but that isn't the driving force behind violence. When violence = profit this is the natual evolution. Until we take a hard look at how wars and inequality affect our populace, we will be doomed to suffer the collateral damage that they inherently bring about.            dolmance-2009 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  The corporation known as CBS donated quite heavily to the Republican Party in both of the last two elections, which you wouldn't know watching Fox news, because people who watch that channel are less informed than people who watch no news at all. And that's been proven by independent studies, and you are a perfect example.               Add a Comment      Submit Comment          Click here to add another comment.
