Obama said. "If we're honest with ourselves, the answer's no. We're not doing enough, and we will have to change."PHOTOS: Shooting at Connecticut schoolObama remarks were a notable departure from similar speeches delivered in the wake of other tragedies, when he has made vague calls for increased conversation but has not promised action.Obama did not offer any specific policy proposal or clear legislative steps on Sunday. But his remarks suggested he would seek some gun-control measures.Are we prepared that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?" Obama asked, speaking above a table filled with white candles representing the victims.Obama arrived Sunday afternoon, stepping off Air Force One alone in a drizzling rain, an envoy from a grieving nation sent to lend small comfort to a devastated town.TRANSCRIPT: President Obama's remarksI am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depth of your sorrow. I can only hope that it helps for you to know that youre not alone in your grief. That our world too has been torn apart. All across this land of ours we have wept with you, Obama said. Newtown, you are not alone.The president met privately at Newtown High School with relatives of the dead and first responders before delivering remarks at the memorial service at the school. Hundreds of people awaited his arrival in the auditorium, trading hellos and hugs. Children, some wearing Sandy Hook School sweatshirts, clutched stuffed puppies handed out by the Red Cross for comfort. Tears flowed.The crowd came to its feet and applauded when a group of law enforcement officials entered the room.FULL COVERAGE: Shooting at Connecticut schoolTwenty children and six adults were killed Friday at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Shooter Adam Lanza, 20, also killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, at their home before blasting his way into the school, where he later killed himself. Investigators have been unable to explain a motive.That question was left Sunday to religious leaders, public officials and the president. Aides said Obama was the chief author of the speech he delivered in Newtown. He was still working on the text with a speechwriter as he flew north from Washington.Such presidential visits have become a grim routine for the nations mourner in chief. He has delivered speeches after several mass shootings during his term, including the 2009 shooting at Ft. Hood, Texas, the 2011 shooting outside a grocery store in Tucson and the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., in July.WHO THEY WERE: Shooting victimsThe speeches, part sorrowful sermon, part counseling session, have become so frequent they have taken on a pattern.The president often begins with a quote from the Bible. He notes his personal, emotional reaction to the tragedy -- often speaking as a parent. He names and honors the dead and tells a hopeful story, often of a survivor.Obama typically only nods to the policy issues that inevitably arise in the wake of such events -- mental health services, gun control, religious bias -- before finding a less divisive lesson to elevate.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Times12next|  single pageComments264Comments (264)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQRandal Colling at 8:42 PM December 18, 2012                Gun violence is awfull. But I can think of worse. Like Rwanda when close to 1million Hutus were slaughted with machettes in 1994. They had no guns to protect themselves. Pol Pot in Cambodia. The communists killed around 5MM who couldnt defend themselves. Joseph Stalin another progressive communist killed aprox 20MM. The Socail democrat Nazis killed 6MM. Look at N Korea, Venezuela etc etc etc. EVERY TIME a tirant does geocide the people are un-armed and have no way to protect themselves.....Couldn't happen here you say????CaptSkip at 5:08 PM December 18, 2012                Coming from Obama?You can keep your changehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvBmWOf8m0&feature=player_embedded#!maxxnsd at 2:47 PM December 18, 2012                Disinvestment.Back in the 80s when the world wanted to affect positive change in South Africa and end apartheid, a program of monetary warfare, aka disinvestment, was undertaken. Colleges, universities, municipalities and States refused to invest in Apartheid and divested themselves of any company doing business in South Africa.It is time for Americans to disinvest in the slaughter of our citizens.Beginning today, I ask all people  colleges, universities, unions, municipalities and States, to shed any investment they hold in the companies that manufacture weapons and/or ammunition.It is time to end the blood-shed. It is time to end the slaughter of innocents.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required. The Times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy.
