Postponing a release isn't enough to impact a culture that uses violence as entertainment. We are all responsible for the work we do, what we contribute to the world around us through our work. When will stars reject roles and stop making movies (and, yes, money) that contribute to making violence commonplace, or admirable, even heroic in our culture? (Yes, Suri, Daddy models men who shoot and kill.) When will movie companies stop making films (and, yes, money) that portray aggression and gun violence as an embedded part of life in the USA?Nan65: If releasing the Reacher film is not good for thehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Nan65/tom-cruises-jack-reacher-movie-premiere-postponed-in-wake-of-shooting_n_2306858_214122252.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

Are we talking Richard Burton here?  This is his kind of movie....he's an action movie star.   And as goofy as he is, he actually pulls off these rolls very nicely.  If you object to the violence then don't see the movie.  It's that simple.  We don't need any censorship more than personal choice.   And come on, filming movies that have violence doesnt make him a bad parent.  I'm a parent, and a police officer. I get involved in all sorts of violent confrontations for real, and by choice.
