Ron Paul sparks sensation at CA GOP convention, says media misreported Tea Party cheering on uninsured (VIDEO)CommentsComments(1)Comments()|E-mail| PrintLos Angeles  Presidential candidate Texas Rep. Ron Paul  followed by cheering crowds at the California State GOP convention today  saidthe media twisted the Tea Party reaction at the last presidential debate, and arguedthat the conservative position on health care is both Constitutionally sound and compassionate.We askedPaulafter his speech to the Lincoln Club whether health care or welfare are appropriate expenditures of the federal government. Follow the Constititution, he said repeatedly.And weasked if he thought it appropriate that,at the the last Tea Party debate,cheers and applausefollowed a question about an uninsured 30 year old man left to die in the streets.Heres our award-winning SFChronicle/SFGate Shaky Hand Productions capture of his answer:Paul is causing a sensation at the California Republican Party convention in Los Angeles, followed by hoards of chanting supporters as he makes his way around the JW Marriott at LA Live where 1,000 state party activists are convening in a three day meeting.The Texas Congressmanwas met by a parade of sign-bearing supporters on the street when he arrived at the hotel, and they have followed him adoringly around the venue. T-shirts on display proclaim the Ron Paul Revolution and Im voting for Peace.By contrast, Tea Party darling Michele Bachmanns reception Friday looked cool and anemic indeed  as was the general reaction to her keynote speech Friday night (with the exception of one or two applause lines about standing up for Israel.)No so, Paul, who was cheered at the Lincoln Club event. Andthe crowd around him is so raucous that Paul, a physician, was actually turned away from the conventions health care forum when he showed up with a chanting mob; a volunteer freaked out and barred the door, keeping him out.And even more interesting: long lines of mostly young people are snaking around the halls, signing up to register in the party and vote in todays California straw poll. We think we know who might come out ahead here.Posted By: Carla Marinucci(Email,Twitter) |Sep 17 at 10:52 amListed Under: Uncategorized | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0)Comments & Replies (1)Comments & Replies () : Post CommentPost CommentPost Comment  50s heartthrob Pat Boone revives golden oldie: Obama born in Kenya, a photoshopping fraud | Main |Republicans trying AGAIN to court Latinos.
