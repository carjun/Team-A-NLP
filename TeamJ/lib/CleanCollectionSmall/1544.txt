Completely disagreeing is another.The downvote button isn't a disagree button. It's a comment quality button, and past a certain threshold hides comments on default settings. It's a "I want to see less of this and want others to see less of this" button. Those who downvote comments just because they disagree with them are expressing a desire not to have views they disagree with seen i.e. are being closed minded and intellectually evasive.permalinksavecontextfull comments17 Things I Learned From Reading Every Last Word of The Economist's "The World in 2013" Issue  by  phileconomicusin  Foodforthought[+]douglasmacarthur 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoWasn't really "food for thought," though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Male Gaze and the Manic Pixie  by  marquis_of_chaosin  Foodforthought[+]douglasmacarthur 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 11 points12 points13 points 1 day agoIf you re-watch 500 Days of Summer, conscious of the unreliability of Toms character and perspective and questioning of his interpretations of events, you realize that Summer, while flawed, was never in herself really a Manic Pixie, nor did Tom own the rights to a relationship with her. She was only such a thing in Toms imagination and thus in ours."Re-watch"? Was the author not paying attention the first time she watched the movie? It was pretty clearly the theme that Tom was wrong to act like he "owned the rights to a relationship with her" and that the idea they were soul mates was just his own self-aggrandizing imagination.Good essay, though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho are you most similar to in Atlas Shrugged?  by  edwinherein  Objectivism[+]douglasmacarthur 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoI'd like to say I'm Eddie but I'm not sure I deserve to compare myself to him.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI hate Crosby, but this is sick.  by  OrangeAndBlackin  hockey[+]douglasmacarthur -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 day agoFair enough; I can respect that opinion.Unfortunately the people voting on my comment aren't as open-minded as you. = )permalinksavecontextfull commentsI hate Crosby, but this is sick.  by  OrangeAndBlackin  hockey[+]douglasmacarthur -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day agoThere is a difference in how players who the league actively markets are perceived versus those who are just great players.That's true. The way the NHL markets Crosby is a big factor in how many people dislike him. People get tired of the branding and like to be contrarian like that. But disliking something for being overmarketed is very different from "hating those who are extremely successful."permalinksavecontextfull commentsI hate Crosby, but this is sick.  by  OrangeAndBlackin  hockey[+]douglasmacarthur -11 points-10 points-9 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur -11 points-10 points-9 points 1 day agoMany people, especially those not that familiar with hockey and evaluating players pretty much by name recognition, act like he's far and away the best player in the world. He's not. I think there is definitely a good case that he is the best player in the world, but he shares the top teir with 5+ other players you can make the case for. We're in an era of high parity. People overrate him because of the hype that came with the high expectations when he was in junior and the marketing that's resulted, but he hasn't met those (albeit unfairly high) expectations.I'm not saying he isn't a really really great player. Just that he isn't the kind of transcendental, generational player a lot of people treat him as. permalinksavecontextfull commentsLet's Discuss UNO!  by  Garin2010in  greenday[+]douglasmacarthur 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI disliked: * How for some of the songs it took multiple listens before I really enjoyed them.I find that's the case with a lot of music.

Yeah, Crosby is one of the best hockey players in recent years. So are several guys. But we don't hate on them because they aren't whiny, smug, dirty, over-rated or over-marketed.I don't "hate" Crosby myself and I wasn't glad he was injured or anything but I'm definitely not a fan and there are reasons I'm not.The thing I don't get about Bieber hate is that he isnt marketed to the demographics that complain about him so why do they even hear his music or hear about him (aside via people complaining about him)? I have to see and hear about Crosby because I'm a hockey fan in general and I make it fun by being anti-Crosby. I'm ambivalent towards Bieber.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBarack Obama Urges NHL and NHLPA: "Do right by your fans"  by  kilocharleyin  hockey[+]douglasmacarthur 8 points9 points10 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 8 points9 points10 points 1 day agoi.e. This is Reddit, we're easily pandered-to water holders for the Democrats, so shut up or we'll put a dash beside the number above your comment.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBarack Obama Urges NHL and NHLPA: "Do right by your fans"  by  kilocharleyin  hockey[+]douglasmacarthur 12 points13 points14 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 12 points13 points14 points 1 day agoI shouldn't have to get involved.You... don't.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTuco on the other side of the law.  by  njensen7in  breakingbad[+]douglasmacarthur 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoSurrealpermalinksavecontextfull commentsDead Kennedys doing in right  by  Olgarin  firstworldanarchists[+]douglasmacarthur 26 points27 points28 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 26 points27 points28 points 1 day agoSo this is how /r/technology types were so brave before Reddit.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy Entire Green Day Collection  by  MilkMan87in  greenday[+]douglasmacarthur 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoYou're missing the International Superhits DVD with all their music videos it looks like.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLeft Turn  by  douglasmacarthurin  breakingbadcomics[+]douglasmacarthur[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoActually she's Walt's head resized, with junior's nose and I drew the eyes and ears myself, with the features other than the eyes proportionately smaller because she's a baby. I guess she looks more like Hank because Walt and Hank are both already basically bald guys with misshapen heads while she, like Hank, doesn't have a beard. Then I just drew the body and bow myself with the paint brush in MSP.I wish I had put more work into how Holly looks though. While the drawings are supposed to be incompetent looking but it'd be better if she had a black border on her body like everyone else, the black border on her head were better and the bow were more symmetrical/sharp looking. Maybe I'll make an "official"/improved Holly template for people to use and post it here in case they come to this thread to use mine.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL it has been 40 years to the day since a human being has walked on the Moon, the last time being on December 13, 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission.  by  TheCannonin  todayilearned[+]douglasmacarthur 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoEvery comment hides implications in snark therefore I'm wrong to call out the implications in this one?permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL it has been 40 years to the day since a human being has walked on the Moon, the last time being on December 13, 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission.  by  TheCannonin  todayilearned[+]douglasmacarthur 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago*screw communism we're gonna be better than them no good, cattle-rustlin' reds.

The entire space race, culminating in the manned moon landings, was a political statement. The true reason was simple: beat the Soviets at everything.The U.S. wanted to remain militarily and scientifically ahead of the genocidal dictatorship that had already expanded its empire considerably? How ridiculous! Those stupid red necks.If the Soviets had decided that the bottom of the ocean was where its at we would be having this coversation about how we never went back to the Marianas Trench.What gave you the impression that the moon was the U.S.'s target because the USSR thought that was "where its [sic] at"?People always forget this.This issue brought up all the time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL it has been 40 years to the day since a human being has walked on the Moon, the last time being on December 13, 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission.  by  TheCannonin  todayilearned[+]douglasmacarthur 18 points19 points20 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 18 points19 points20 points 2 days ago*Some citations of these commentaries about private conversations?permalinksavecontextfull commentsfyasko11 explains how a canvas with four dots in the corner is relevant art  by  Motivated_nullin  DepthHub[+]douglasmacarthur 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoIf I took the machinery from a made-obsolete print newspaper, spread it around a warehouse randomly, and pissed on it as food for thought in a "conversation" of what to do with printing presses now that we have the Internet, no one would give me a Ph.D in journalism let alone give me the esteem they give Ph.Ds in physics.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSometimes, when I visit the art museum at Stanford, I am inspired to become a successful artist  by  -Dezzyin  funny[+]douglasmacarthur 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]douglasmacarthur 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoArt is the only academic subject in which everyone assumes they know something about. You'd never find a non-physics major try to educate a physics student about physics.This is plain false. What about the political science, psychology, etc.? To the contrary, experts in the physical sciences are pretty unique in the esteem and taken-for-granted authority the public at large sees them with.Further, why should we assume that there being institutions that grant titles and salaries to people in a field proves those declared experts are effective and deserve that esteem? People grant it to physicists because they think that they've earned it. Have the academics that talk about art? I don't think so.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo, we'll fire up the fog machine and then we'll all run out of the fog onto the field.
