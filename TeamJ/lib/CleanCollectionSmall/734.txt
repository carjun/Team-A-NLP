I just heard reporters say that this killing just "set the standard for school killings. It used to be Columbine but that was just 12 kids" Just 12 kids? The standard for school shootingS? How are they allowed to fucking say these things? Even if it was just one death today it would be too much. permalinksave[+]Anglewings 31 points32 points33 points 20 hours ago*(1 child)[]Anglewings 31 points32 points33 points 20 hours ago*It's almost like they're challenging people to beat it.permalinksaveparent[+]strokesy -2 points-1 points0 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]strokesy -2 points-1 points0 points 20 hours agoThat is how it sounds but I definitively don't think that that is how they meant for it to come out. It is just a shame that it did sound like that. permalinksaveparent[+]abscondedhobo 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]abscondedhobo 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours agoPerhaps the reporters meant record? It would be rather difficult to come up with appropriate words in a situation like this, I imagine.permalinksaveparent[+]illgresi 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]illgresi 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours agoYes, I think what they meant to say was something like, "Remember how terrible Columbine was? What a huge impact it had on our society? And that was 12 kids, here we are looking at 20..."permalinksaveparent[+]ADMcD76 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]ADMcD76 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours agoThey're looking for ways to say things objectively and aren't able to think straight because of how horrible the situation is and therefore say incredibly stupid things.  I hope.  Perhaps they're just very callous, horrible people.permalinksaveparent[+]strokesy 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]strokesy 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoYou're right. They are in a tough spot. I am just reacting emotionally but it is such a senseless thing to say. I just am sad that I get the sense that some members of the media are licking their chops on what would otherwise be a slow news day :Spermalinksaveparent[+]PHM517 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]PHM517 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoNo shit.
