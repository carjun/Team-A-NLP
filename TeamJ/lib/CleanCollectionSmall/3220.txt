Andrew Cuomo Friday called for a "crackdown" on firearms following a mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, calling it "yet another senseless and horrific act of violence involving guns."Cuomo, a Democrat, said he hopes the shooting in Newtown, Conn., spurs action."We as a society must unify and, once and for all, crack down on the guns that have cost the lives of far too many innocent Americans," Cuomo said in a statement. "Let this terrible tragedy finally be the wake-up call for aggressive action and I pledge my full support in that effort."A total of 27 people -- including 18 children -- were killed Friday at Sandy Hook Elementary School.Gun-control advocates in New York State renewed calls for tighter gun laws, specifically those related to assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."I think there is still room for improvement in every state, even a state like New York, which has taken the gun laws very seriously over the years," said Jackie Hilly, executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence.Thomas King, president of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, said the victims' families should be given time to grieve."This happens any time that there is any kind of a shooting -- the gun-control forces come out and start pushing for more. There is never a tragedy they miss," King said. "Personally, I believe we should take a deep breath, see what happened, see what the final story is and let the people mourn."-----Gannett Albany Bureau staff writer Haley Viccaro contributed to this report.More Stories:This story is part of Connecticut School ShootingHeroism no surprise to those who knew slain principalList of victims in Conn. school massacreHorrific scene haunts first responder at shooting scene            {                "assetid": "1770499",                "aws": "news/national",                "aws_id": "news_national",                "blogname": "",                "contenttype": "story pages ",                 "seotitle": "School-shootings-reax-cuomo",                "seotitletag": "Cuomo calls for 'crackdown' on guns",                "ssts": "news/nation",                "taxonomykeywords":"Andrew Cuomo,Albany,Connecticut,New York,Connecticut School Shooting",                "templatename": "stories/default",                "topic":"connecticut-school-shooting",                "videoincluded":"no",                "basePageType":"story"            }        Comment Join the Nation's ConversationTo find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQsShare                             Cuomo calls for 'crackdown' on guns                        ShareEmailPost to FacebookOr share on: TwitterGoogle+LinkedInCuomo calls for 'crackdown' on guns on USAToday.com: http://usat.ly/RudrHBCancelSendPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
