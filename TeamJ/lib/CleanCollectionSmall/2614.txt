When will America change its gun laws?  by  champion_davein  self[+]Moultese -1 points0 points1 point 9 minutes ago (0 children)[]Moultese -1 points0 points1 point 9 minutes agoLet's say we live in a world without guns. It's nice. No one gets shot. So instead, these maniacs take out school children with katanas. Or say we live in a world without swords and guns. Then these maniacs take out kids by slinging giant rocks at them. You can see where I'm going with this. You can't get rid of violence just by making weapons illegal. The shooter(s) are fucked in the head, simple as that. No amount of gun control will stop crazy people from doing crazy things.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAt least 18 children killed in a school shooting today.

It's an issue of mental health.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI don't know what you're into, but I highly suggest listening to this album while high. It will blow your mind. Look up "Midnight City" then if you like that, check out the rest of the album.  by  1musicdudein  trees[+]Moultese 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]Moultese 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoSeriously one of my favorite albums of all time. Definitely in my Top 5.What's also great is to watch the music video trilogy for Midnight City, Reunion, and Wait.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDown at the Car Wash  by  callmeVeechin  Louisville[+]Moultese 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes ago (0 children)[]Moultese 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes agoThe touchless at the corner of Taylorsville and Breckenridge does a good job.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Moultese 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Moultese 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour agoI was actually in a safety meeting at work when this went down. The subject of the safety meeting was workplace shootings. We were watching this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VcSwejU2D0Kind of crazy that we were just discussing shootings and then this happens.

And yeah, Fitness19 is quite far away. I just go after work so it's not so much out of my way. But if there was something cheap in the Highlands, it'd be a lot more convenient for me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey guys, i got this idea:  by  Daftmachinein  movies[+]Moultese 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Moultese 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoI really dislike this idea. Sometimes it's good to leave well enough alone. The original movie is fantastic and doesn't need a reboot.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHighland Fitness  by  SixPathsofPeinin  Louisville[+]Moultese 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Moultese 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours agoA buddy of mine checked it out. Said it was pretty tiny and their free weight selection was limited. I wish there was a decent gym option around The Highlands. Urban Active in St. Matthews is probably your best bet, but I wasn't really a fan of the atmosphere there. I'm work out at Fitness 19 now and love it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny Information on early bird or souvenir ticket sales for 2013?  by  downvoteonlymanin  Lollapalooza[+]Moultese 1 point2 points3 points 6 hours ago (0 children)[]Moultese 1 point2 points3 points 6 hours agoBest advice.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre there any romantic comedies apart from Love Actually that are worth seeing?  by  m84min  movies[+]Moultese 2 points3 points4 points 6 hours ago (0 children)[]Moultese 2 points3 points4 points 6 hours agoI think The Holiday is actually a great rom-com.

I almost hit a guy running ON Cherokee Rd the other day. There was a nice, empty, car-free sidewalk 8 feet to his left. I understand that asphalt is softer than concrete, but come on man, that street is narrow enough without having to dodge runners.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone going to see The Hobbit tonight at stonybrook? :)  by  Adventuremormonin  Louisville[+]Moultese 2 points3 points4 points 6 hours ago (0 children)[]Moultese 2 points3 points4 points 6 hours agoYou can see it for $5.50 on Tuesdays at Stonybrook.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLouisville's "Hidden Gems"  by  SteveSnowin  Louisville[+]Moultese 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Moultese 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThe Baxter is my favorite burger to get in this city hands down.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCouples Photoshoot Locations?  by  CaptainSketchyin  Louisville[+]Moultese 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Moultese 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoOld Louisville, specifically the Central Park area, is kind of romantic.
