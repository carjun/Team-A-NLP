I'll never understand how or why something like this happens, and I don't even care to hear what wretched "motive" this was done under. There is no motive for inflicting this much harm.

Maybe our public schools are not a good place. I personally would never send a child to one. I am in no way justifying violence in any way, but maybe we need to look at the bigger picture.permalinksaveparent[+]MarshallBanana -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (1 child)[]MarshallBanana -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoYou want the bigger picture? I live in Finland. We have some of the highest-rated schools in the world. Our schools are definitely "good places".Still, this last decade, we've started getting American-style school shootings. We didn't use to have them. We have them now. But the schools are much the same as they've always been.What has changed, then? Handgun ownership has become much easier.permalinksaveparent[+]digitalmofo -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago (0 children)[]digitalmofo -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago"American style" school shootings don't usually happen with handguns. permalinksaveparent[+]Dog-Modernist -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Dog-Modernist -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours agoAmericans reap the benefits of Nazi medicine and Nazi technology crafted under the most horrific and undeniably "wrong" ethical situations. Similarly, maybe we can learn something from this irreversible event. Emotions play no part in this. Something this innately horrific goes beyond emotion and into a realm of pure logic.Those who are too effected by emotion, especially with no relation to these people, it's time for these people to remains silent while those who have logic speak and direct the correct methods of understanding. Those without IQ or logic must remain silent and stay out of the way. Words such as "disgust" and "hate" and "mean" and "angry" and "horrific" are more or less a sign that a person should be ushered out of the room. Hence the reason why the "news" should not be watched, as it is entirely driven by emotion and sensation. Follow a blog, talk amongst the respected.For it isn't increasing disgust for these marginalized, messed up people. It's actually finally extending a hand and asking, "what's wrong?" And paying attention. Because at core, they are only putting the suffering they are already experiencing into the world. They are projecting it onto everyone else, asking, "do you understand now?" These actions come from an extremely dark place.Until we can think this way, our society remains a devastating embarrassment. No surprise there. What these people are can only possibly develop out of this society.permalinksaveparent[+]Jodie_Sweetin  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]Jodie_Sweetin -8 points-7 points-6 points 1 day agoI don't think anyone's expecting you to care which motive it was done under.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
