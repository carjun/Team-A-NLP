When there was smoking, the air was filtered and exchanged much more than it is now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJustice Scalia: "If we cannot have moral feelings against homosexuality, can we have it against murder?"

Does it produce a correct answer? If yes, reward innovative thinking. I began to hate math beginning with geometry class when the prescribed steps to the answer became more important than getting the correct solution.
