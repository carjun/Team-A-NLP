Usually when I see someone typing "source" and nothing else they're doing it to express disbelief, and seeing it in response to a post with a citation seemed lazy since most of the work was done at that point.In other words, I was not expecting it to mean something rational like "Could you please expand upon that citation with a link?" since in all my time here it hadn't before.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJudge At Rapist's Sentencing: 'If Someone Doesn't Want To Have Sexual intercourse, The Body Shuts Down': LAist  by  planetzombiein  news[+]cyclicamp 0 points1 point2 points 26 minutes ago (0 children)[]cyclicamp 0 points1 point2 points 26 minutes agoOne of the most worrying things from those other articles is finding out he previously worked as prosecutor for the district's sex crimes unit.

Unable to confirm international numbers but first-glance sources such as Wikipedia and CNN summary articles circumstantially back it up.And in the rare cases where people actually cite something, you can do this yourself too.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy teacher claimed that her pencil sharpener is, "Possessed by Satan."

It would take a very long pencil, but what you see there could actually be due to mis-calibration of the grinding wheels.  Normally you would have the wheels pointing towards each other in a V fashion.  This is totally adjustable by the end-user however, as some users prefer a longer graphite tip.  What's happened in the photo would be an extreme, where the wheels are no longer touching towards the end, and allow the tip to continue unshaven.  So it's not complete bullshit until I reveal I'm obviously not in the pencil sharpening business and I'm making this up off the top of my head.  I'm assuming this sharpener is the electric style since those are typically the ones that have hollow space in the gearbox, which would allow a tip that long to continue to pass through the sharpener.  A hand crank sharpener would obviously stop the tip from proceeding once it hit the outside handle.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI made a gif for all your /r/hockey downvoting needs.  by  arise_chickenin  hockey[+]cyclicamp 9 points10 points11 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]cyclicamp 9 points10 points11 points 22 hours agoHey, according to the closest thing we have with the lockout the Islanders are tearing up the league behind stellar goaltending by Nabokov.

At that point, if you're familiar with the handheld device, it's pretty straight-forward.

So while I still disagree with fateswarm that it's a "major flaw" in the tip, it's always good practice with this tip (and basically any tip on here) to play it by ear to a certain degree.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLPT: At the end of an interview, the interview will always ask if you have any questions.

I have no idea at what point in the standoff the recording began, or what any of the previous events were, so it is difficult to say what a typically rational person might do in that situation.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, have you ever seen someone 'speak now' rather than forever holding their peace at a wedding?

I've seen many times where people say "if they do X, significantly worse thing Y will be next!" And then Y never comes because Y is obviously wrong.  It always stops somewhere because people are reasonably sane.  I'll be angry when X alone is enough to make me angry.I mean, yeah, I care that it's being censored.  I haven't used Google search in a while so I don't care as much (and don't quote me the "First they came for Google users, and I was silent..." line), but right now all it seems to me is they've tried to make their results not show porn whenever you search any query like they used to.  And the results are a little too overzealous in censoring.  For example, if you search certain explicit terms, you still get explicit results.  My bet is when you search something fairly explicit but with a lot of non-explicit results (something common like "blowjob"), it filters all the explicit results out and they didn't come up with a good way to negate this.  It's easier for me to assume incompetence before malice.  I can see the "big picture" but I can also lay back and see things develop for a couple hours while I bust jokes about missing vaginas.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCensorship: As of past two hours, Google images safesearch is MANDATORY for US IP's  by  shaqfan99in  WTF[+]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoYeah it takes a couple hours for things to hit #1.  It's there now, a mere 35 minutes after your post, after being posted in a more appropriate subreddit.  Even though the only evidence in the thread is a couple iffy screenshots from random people.  Also, many people like to make jokes.  And they hate being told what they can and can't joke about.  And hearing the opinion of "stop joking, pick up your pitchfork" for the 900th time is no more valid as hearing "let's talk about the vagina for a moment."And as far as any chilling possibilities, there's still always the option of not using their search engine.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
