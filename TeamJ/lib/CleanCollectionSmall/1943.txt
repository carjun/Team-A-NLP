But I wasn't sheltered either.  That's a pretty outlandish statement to make considering I'd say the vast amount of the population wasn't explained these things at such a young age and is dealing with the real world just fine.permalinksaveparent[+]RobbleDobble 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (2 children)[]RobbleDobble 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoNo, but you were exposed to death and violence and the realities of the world little by little.  Most of the children arent going to be noticibly effected by this event in the long run.These things happen in the world, the notion that it is somehow more horrific because it happened in our back yard is what i find rediculous.permalinksaveparent[+]ljackstar 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]ljackstar 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoIt only effects most people by a little when they see it on the newsShit changes when it happens to you in personpermalinksaveparent[+]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago*(0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago*The only thing I can recall ever happening as a child was a classmate who died of an asthma attack.  At the time, I was terrified I'd wake up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe (I was 8).  I didn't have asthma, nor any other health problems and to be honest, even now, I still think about this classmate every once in awhile.  How her parents must have felt and how she never really had a chance to live her life because she died when she was in 2nd grade.  I'm 24 now if that makes any difference, and I still think about her occasionally and how sad it was such a young, seemingly healthy kid just passed away.  However, as a child I didn't quite grasp the finality of the entire thing.  As an adult it just seems wrong and unfair.Now, not saying this is true in every case, but some of these children had bullets flying past them (there is one interview with a small child describing this), seeing their teachers shot (another interview) and quite honestly, I can't imagine having to explain this to a kid.  Nor can I imagine having to try to reason with a child's logic why a grown adult would walk into a school and shoot 20 kindergarteners for no reason.  Small children don't really understand  (I imagine the older kids do, those between the 3rd and 4th grade).  But how do you explain to a 5-6 year old what occurred if they ask questions?  You have to be honest, but there's no reason a kid that young should have to know about the messed up stuff that occurs in this world.  Spare them their childhood basically.EDIT:  I guess what I'm trying to say is that, yes we were exposed in small doses.  We had time to adjust to loss and the realities of life normally.  Small children thrown into this sort of reality (the sort that makes grown adults cry--because to be honest I did when I heard this news, and I know several others who did as well) are not really comparable circumstances in the slightest.  This is an extreme, traumatic event.  This is not a naturally occurring event or a frequently occurring event.  It is a random, sick act of violence that quite honestly is going to fuck up tons of children's lives permanently.
