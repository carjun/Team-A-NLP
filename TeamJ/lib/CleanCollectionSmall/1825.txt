You are quite handsome - all that hard work is paying off! I'm sure /r/malefashionadvice would have some tips for you.. Then you can go out and find a lovely lady (or whatever floats your boat).

There's plenty of info available on the google-fu about the dangers of this, but it is so gruesome I don't feel like doing so.I read an auto-biography of someone with severe bulimia. They had increased risk of esophageal cancer and heart attack. They were told by their doctors that if they proceeded to continue purging, the next purge could lead to a deadly heart attack. At age 30.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoodguy Plano Cop  by  irishamericanin  Dallas[+]omegaphora 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]omegaphora 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoScumbag Hurst PD: I had expired registration and inspection on my car.I was pulled over for going maybe 5-10 over the speed limit in a residential area. I explained to the cop that the car was previously in use by my ex (I know, I'm retarded), who completely ruined my car. I was driving to the county place to re-register, so I could re-inspect my car, so I could sell it (sold for $700 eventually). I was missing 1 paper so I had to go home to print it.In the passenger seat was documentation from the county, showing I had JUST BEEN THERE.I got 3 tickets. It cost $700.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat childhood dream or daily annoyance has technology failed to deliver on?  by  straydog1980in  AskReddit[+]omegaphora 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]omegaphora 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoAbsolutely not.

The smell will rinse away but the moisture won't. You will be soft as shit ALL day, never needing lotion again.

I put it in for 3 weeks and basically forget about it. I use the label from the pharmacy to remember the date to take it out, but other people use calendars and apps to remind themselves.Whenever it's time for sexytime, I take it out, rinse it, put it by the sink by my toothbrush. You can keep it out for 1hour, 3 max. I've heard of people "losing" it, I'm guessing if they have sex in a dark room, it can come out and get lost in the sheets. So I take mine out ahead of time. My partner and I also use condoms so we have double birth control. It's actually very stress relieving! I have basically no side effects from it. The cool thing is, because I put it in/take it out at the same date+time, I know the exact day of the week and almost the exact hour when my period will start!permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny ladies with IUD experience?  by  omgchocolatein  Health[+]omegaphora 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]omegaphora 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoI tried Paragard.The insertion was like nothing for me. I have had a vaginal birth, and I've also had a colposcopy, so there is my frame of reference.Unfortunately it caused severe cramps and severely heavy period. This was about 6mo post-partum, so maybe the first period are like that? I'm not sure. It then also contributed to a uterine infection, and treatment for that caused yeast infections.I had it removed and went to Nuvaring.I'm considering trying again though. My only reservation is that the strings had to be trimmed a few times, as my SO could feel them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI was getting ready for work and my daughter was very quiet.
