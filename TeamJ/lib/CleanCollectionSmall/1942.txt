I still recall having nightmares as a young child about dying in my sleep and such, or some mass murderer coming into my house and killing my family.  I remember watching it on TV and then it was in my head...and my child brain took over worrying about it.  Not really realizing that thing was fairly rare until I got so concerned I'd run to my parents and ask about it.Then again I'm a super liberal, atheist child of a republican, Roman Catholic upbringing.  I think I defy some sort of logic.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoYou know, my parents never talked to me about it either at the time.  But I was fine.  I was 13 and I got it.  I knew it was awful, I knew it was going to change the world forever, and I knew a lot of people had died and lost their loved ones.  At 13, I definitely understood it.  I remember not knowing entirely what a terrorist attack was--but that's mostly because I  never really had had such a thing occur in my lifetime that I remembered.  And then I knew.  I knew there were people that hated people so much they could do such an awful thing.  I still can't fathom the logic behind it, but I can understand how people's minds can be tricked and manipulated and so on as an adult.My parents never talked about it with me but honestly, I feel like it helped me as an adult in some ways.  I've learned now, how I can cope and deal with what life throws at me and how to bounce back from bad situations.  I've had a lot of shit go down in my life as a teen and I'm finally at a good point now where I've learned on my own healthy ways to deal with shit.  I probably needed a therapist too, tbh...so kudos to you for being proactive.  There's times where I wish I would have been in that regard but water under the bridge now lol.Best wishes to you :Dpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy does USA's lack of functioning mental health care take a back seat to gun regulation whenever there's a public shooting?  by  stickykeysmcgeein  AskReddit[+]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoWow wtf--also in Columbus OH and I was LUCKY to get out of the hospital here in 3-4 days.  Again think it had a lot to do with my insurance but it's super scary to think about how it pans out for those who aren't as fortunate as I am (and prior to "Obamacare" I would be just as SOL tbh)permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy does USA's lack of functioning mental health care take a back seat to gun regulation whenever there's a public shooting?  by  stickykeysmcgeein  AskReddit[+]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago*(0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago*Just saying, hospitalized for mental health at one point (severe depression and suicidal tendencies) and there were people in my ward who had been there for over a week if not more.  I don't know what sort of hospitals were releasing these people but even I needed clearance from my closest relatives and boyfriend I lived with at the time to be allowed out after 3 days.  And when I was released at 3 days the other people I had met in the ward were genuinely surprised I was going home sooner than a week.  One guy there had drank anti-freeze and had been there for two weeks at that point and a girl who hadn't spoken to her friends in weeks because they didn't allow cell phones--her friends didn't know wtf had happened to her.  There was one guy with dementia (who told me he was in the Hunger Games movie and his agent made him come to the psych ward more or less) who kept saying he was going home every day and kept bitching about the hospital but it was clear he wasn't quite all there.To be fair this was a fairly well-funded hospital on a major college campus.  I'm not sure if this makes a difference but I was also in the midwest.   (It also may have helped that my insurance was paying for everything.  I am very fortunately lucky in the fact that my mother works for a health insurance company and after the first day in the hospital my stay was entirely covered)But basically, I was just given medication and sent on my way after I had made arrangements with a doctor to continue filling my script, a therapist I would continue seeing and had verbal confirmation from those close with me I was stable enough to go home.  All this had to be confirmed with a social worker and then my doctor.  From there I was on my own, but when I left I generally felt I was fine and ready to deal with my issues without their help.I do feel like those with more severe issues aren't properly diagnosed or cared for though.  If these people can't keep up with their medication or have a caretaker willing to help with that, they're not going to get better.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago*(0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago*Same thing happened during 9/11.  I remember sitting in school (8 hours away) and children being pulled out of school during it.  I was in 8th grade at the time and my family actually lived in NYC at the time (and my aunt had worked in the towers at one point but I wasn't aware she no longer did when the event occurred).  I was worried for them and all my parents did was call to say they were safe, home and not to worry.  I was fine then.  However, kids with no connection to the event were being called home left and right all day.  Didn't make sense to me then or now.I can understand parents being worried about copycats though.  Psychologist always say that the way the media handles this sort of thing leads to copycats and I'm inclined to agree.  I'd be afraid--but you can't live your life in fear and you can't teach your kids to live their lives in fear.  Random acts of violence like this are rare and it's best to just live life as normal as possible.  Sadly, it always has to be a fear in the back of our minds now (same as getting into a major car accident anytime you drive), but it's nonsensical to base anything else in your life around it.EDIT:I actually intend to be a parent one day.  And I can't even fathom the loss these parents are feeling right now, however, you take just as much as a risk getting in your car every day as you do sending your kids to school.  It's a rare occurrence and unlikely to happen--but when it does happen no one expects it.The homeschooling thing is a short sighted, knee-jerk response.  Proven fact is that kids who are homeschooled don't learn the social skills they need later in life.  And it's generally more of a risk to fly on an airplane once a year than go to school everyday.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday, I figured I'd design something a little different.

How society is responsible for standing up and caring for those who are unable to care for themselves or those who lack someone willing to care for them in cases of children (this is probably where public education comes in to play tbh and that teachers should be responsible for teaching moral values and such if the parents are failing to do so as a public service).  This person was clearly very sick in the head at least.  And I read one article where the shooter was labeled as developmentally disabled (also in his early 20s which is generally prime time for mental illness to peak) so it's not like there was a surprise he had some sort of mental off balance.  Sadly, mental illness is tragically pushed to the side in this country (I know a psychiatrist from overseas--and he is often disgusted by the mental healthcare in the USA and can't believe the things that occur here).  Quite honestly, how was such a person able to obtain any sort of weapon outside of the generic kitchen knife? Long story short, society has a responsibility to care for these people.  We all know better, we have the means to care for them and support them and yet, in this country we don't.  The values are so askew here.  Too much about money and not enough about human life and well-being.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday, I figured I'd design something a little different.

He was sadly very, very mentally ill and not properly cared for.  The sick reality is he may have fared better in another country.  As disgusted as I am that he killed so many innocent children, I'm also sickened that such extreme mental illness went uncared for to this extent.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday, I figured I'd design something a little different.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 9 hours agoI definitely agree!  I'm sure even the parents aren't even in the best state of mind.  Probably so relieved just to have their children safe and sound all things considered that they don't even care about an interview.Tbh I was a bit floored by the child who said he saw bullets flying and smelled the smoke from the gun (is that a thing or is the kid exaggerating?) before a teacher pulled him into a room.  He just seemed so nonchalant about it.  Smiled while giving the interview.  Seemed to me the kid didn't really grasp the gravity of the situation.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours agoThere's actually a fairly decent article by the mother of one of the Columbine shooters  (http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/gayle-king-susan-klebold-mother-columbine-shooter-dylan/story?id=8809518#.UMw5uXcXERs).  Quite honestly,  seemed like the poor woman knew he was depressed but not to the point where he did what he did.Not only did she lose a son but she had an entire town blame her essentially for the loss of so many others.  It's hard to remember that the families of these shooters often suffer as well.  They lost a loved one and yes, it's hard to sympathize but often times love is blind and warning signs can be ignored.It's not parenting so much as the lack of awareness for mental health and affordable mental healthcare in this country.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

What's messed up is their parents seemingly having no care in the world at all about it.  Your child almost died...your kid heard gun shots...your child saw bullets flying past them...why are you letting some money grubbing journalist plaster their face all over the news?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago*(0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago*The only thing I can recall ever happening as a child was a classmate who died of an asthma attack.  At the time, I was terrified I'd wake up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe (I was 8).  I didn't have asthma, nor any other health problems and to be honest, even now, I still think about this classmate every once in awhile.  How her parents must have felt and how she never really had a chance to live her life because she died when she was in 2nd grade.  I'm 24 now if that makes any difference, and I still think about her occasionally and how sad it was such a young, seemingly healthy kid just passed away.  However, as a child I didn't quite grasp the finality of the entire thing.  As an adult it just seems wrong and unfair.Now, not saying this is true in every case, but some of these children had bullets flying past them (there is one interview with a small child describing this), seeing their teachers shot (another interview) and quite honestly, I can't imagine having to explain this to a kid.  Nor can I imagine having to try to reason with a child's logic why a grown adult would walk into a school and shoot 20 kindergarteners for no reason.  Small children don't really understand  (I imagine the older kids do, those between the 3rd and 4th grade).  But how do you explain to a 5-6 year old what occurred if they ask questions?  You have to be honest, but there's no reason a kid that young should have to know about the messed up stuff that occurs in this world.  Spare them their childhood basically.EDIT:  I guess what I'm trying to say is that, yes we were exposed in small doses.  We had time to adjust to loss and the realities of life normally.  Small children thrown into this sort of reality (the sort that makes grown adults cry--because to be honest I did when I heard this news, and I know several others who did as well) are not really comparable circumstances in the slightest.  This is an extreme, traumatic event.  This is not a naturally occurring event or a frequently occurring event.  It is a random, sick act of violence that quite honestly is going to fuck up tons of children's lives permanently.  If you can't recognize that then....wow.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

But I wasn't sheltered either.

I work there now and we change our delivery times accordingly.  Usually the manager changes it though--so maybe your management team just never bothered to increase delivery or carryout times?  I've had nights where I have to quote people over an hour and it shows up in our system.Nevertheless, even after telling someone their food won't be ready until 8, they show up 15 minutes early and get annoyed they have to wait the extra 15 minutes for their food.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsThank you, Ubisoft.

It should help with the oiliness.  Use mild shampoos.  And like I had said, dry shampoo--it does wonders.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThank you, Ubisoft.

Have really dry hair.Shampooing everyday can actually be harmful to your hair.  Dries it out cause its stripping natural oils from your hair.  Honestly, if I had hair that was a bit greasier I'd probably use dry shampoo on off days.

Everything we do, whether we like it or not is predetermined by some outside factor whether it's chemical, our upbringing, or our present life situation.For example, I get up and go to work every morning.  Now, in theory I guess I could choose not to go to work.  But can I really just NOT go to work?  No. Even in terms of attraction, you can't choose who you're attracted to.  It just happens.  You don't sit in a room filled with people and go, "I choose him to love!". We have the illusion of free choice but in reality it's not there.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
