I'm sure that the bar has it in writing somewhere that whoever's tab it is has the responsibility of keeping track of who put what drinks on it throughout the night or some bullshit, and they're the ones responsible for making sure it gets paid.Any bartenders know the accuracy of this sort of thing?

But it excites some little nostalgic part of some people, that wishes we could still enjoy our childhood shows.  It has the advantage of triggering that nostalgic part, but still being new at the same time.(Here's the part that answers your question): It's kind of a funny little in-crowd thing.  Everyone likes Game of Thrones, everyone thinks South Park is hilarious; someone saying they like Futurama or Family guy says almost nothing about them, because everyone likes those shows.  But saying you like a kids' show takes a pretty certain sense of humor, and finding someone else who shares that sense of humor give a bit of solidarity and gives you that inside-joke type feeling.And I think the reason it got so big on the internet is because the visuals lend themselves really well to macros and reaction gifs.  I don't really know any other way to say it than that; it makes for funny reaction pictures, and so it got a bit more popularity than it probably would have otherwise.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI took a train for the first time today.

The only places I've seen the bus systems viewed as "nice" are in college towns, and that's basically because it's the way that everyone gets around.  In other cities, it's basically just the people who can't afford cars; I'm sure most people who take those buses are nice people, but it's like the subway.  The creeps and lowlifes give it a bad name.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI took a train for the first time today. Left the station this morning, went across the state for a job interview for $14.

We could cut down the total number of cars out there, basically share a car between every four, five, maybe six light users, and that way everyone would share the load of maintaining those cars.The only issue I could see is liability in case of an accident, but I guess it would probably work the same as if a taxi driver is in an accident, right?permalinksavecontextfull commentsI took a train for the first time today.

For going into Chicago the amtrak would be great, it puts you right on Madison like two blocks from downtown and pretty central to all the tourist spots.  I guess my frustration was more with the Metra system.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI took a train for the first time today.

The idea is that each city has a stock of cars, and that each user pays a monthly fee, and that users can basically just request a ride at any point in time.  The car drives itself to your location, drops you off where you need to be, and goes on its way.  You schedule a drop-off and a pick-up to get you back home, you probably just pay by mileage, and you're set.  And your membership would get you access to cars wherever you go, so you're set when traveling too.I can see this being an issue for multiple reasons (getting enough investment to get it started, huge demands during rush hours, possible vandalism of the cars, etc) but if it could become a reality, I think it'd be pretty darn cool.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI took a train for the first time today.

Getting across town in my area, by taking a taxi, is between twelve and fifteen dollars, and it's about a fifteen or twenty mile span depending on your start and stop.  For fifteen bucks, I could take that trip five or six times in my car.  If they'd implement a decent bus program the city could probably help tons of people find jobs, and save a bunch on traffic messes, but they just have the PACE bus which doesn't really cover many areas that well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI took a train for the first time today.

It's a 3 hour drive home, and I can usually roundtrip it on about 2/3 a tank of gas (so, about $45). But to get to my hometown by train, I have to go via Chicago, wait for a transfer train, and get separate tickets for both trains.  It costs about $17 each way for the Amtrak part, and $8 each way for the Metra part, so it costs about $50 roundtrip, and can take anywhere between 4 and 7 hours each way depending on how the two train schedules line up.  Plus I can leave exactly when I want to, rather than saying "Well, I have the options of leaving at 7am, 1pm, or 9pm..."Honestly if they could expedite it a little better, I would probably take the train far more frequently; I hate driving for that long, I'd much rather catch a nap or mess with my phone or something.  But it's in such disarray that I don't see myself ever taking the train to get home again.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRod + Foot [NSFW]  by  GrundelLickerin  WTF[+]Carbon_Dirt 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Carbon_Dirt 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoEeeewww...permalinksavecontextfull commentsOnly in NYC  by  ThrobbingWetHolein  WTF[+]Carbon_Dirt 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Carbon_Dirt 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoGus!?permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]Carbon_Dirt 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Carbon_Dirt 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoBasically, the U.S.'s border policies make it relatively easy to sneak small items into the country.  This includes guns, and to some extent drugs.  The only way to stop that would be to do thorough inspections of all border-crossing vehicles, whether they're huge truckloads of things or just a family taking a road trip.  This would be seen as a huge invasion of privacy for the average family, so it doesn't happen; therefore, guns and drugs still make their way into the country.Obviously, a lot of guns in use do come from authorized dealers. Maybe they're bought under a fake name, or maybe someone steals it, or maybe someone who wants to make some money sells it and just says "oh, I lost it".  So if we did stop the majority of gun sales, it might keep a lot of guns off the streets, but not all of them, since they can also be brought in from across the border.The biggest thing, though, is the second amendment; the right to bear arms in self-defense.  The common argument says that "If we restrict gun sales, then law-abiding citizens won't have guns to defend themselves, but criminals will still have guns to attack with."permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am so fucking fed up with our news stations.  by  Luap_in  AdviceAnimals[+]Carbon_Dirt 23 points24 points25 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Carbon_Dirt 23 points24 points25 points 20 hours agoWas this you?permalinksavecontextfull commentsProbably wasn't meant to be funny.

This happens somewhat frequently with my fiancee and I, and I really appreciate that this is usually how the conversation goes.
