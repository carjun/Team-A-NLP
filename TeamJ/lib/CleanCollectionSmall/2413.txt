Both Team and building employees who have no say and get screwed equally.

Owners or NHLPA  by  ScottyDontKnowin  hockey[+]Sharkbait41 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Sharkbait41 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoMy favorite part of the Bettman presser was him saying n 2004 there was only 1 player signed to a deal that was six years or more and now there are 90. That's the GM's fault for offering those deals. Not the PA's faultpermalinksavecontextfull commentsDon Fehr derailed momentum from meetings?  by  TREDrunknin  hockey[+]Sharkbait41 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Sharkbait41 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoI do too. More disappointed than anything throughout this process. Both sides need new leadership after this fiasco to repair the underlying trust issuepermalinksavecontextfull commentsDon Fehr derailed momentum from meetings?  by  TREDrunknin  hockey[+]Sharkbait41 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Sharkbait41 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoI agree that they should take it. Fehr can advise them to not take the deal, thats why they pay him. But if they say we want to vote on this now, I highly doubt he would stand in the way. His method got them to where they were, the $300 mil make whole, but there had to be an end.On the flip side, you do need the top brass to finalize the deal, and if it is true that they were told that Fehr is a deal breaker, it makes it look like a setup to get them away from their counsel and get an agreement that may not be as rosy as it seems. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood read by LeBrun, "You've got to be kidding me"  by  TehBaconKingin  hockey[+]Sharkbait41 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Sharkbait41 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoNo worries!permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs there anyway that Bettman can be forced out and John Collins can take over?  by  BonoHitMyCarin  hockey[+]Sharkbait41 3 points4 points5 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Sharkbait41 3 points4 points5 points 7 days agoYes. The BOG has to vote him out. James Dolan tried a couple years ago to no avail.

He left the organization but was still credentialed to write for Islanders Point Blank. He made comments that the higher ups didn't like and they yanked his credentials. The New York based Professional Hockey Writers boycotted awards voting in protest. He writes for the Sports Business Journal and the New York Times. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood read by LeBrun, "You've got to be kidding me"  by  TehBaconKingin  hockey[+]Sharkbait41 5 points6 points7 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Sharkbait41 5 points6 points7 points 7 days agoNon mobile versionpermalinksavecontextfull commentsDon Fehr derailed momentum from meetings?  by  TREDrunknin  hockey[+]Sharkbait41 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Sharkbait41 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoJust what the NHL wants people to thinkpermalinksavecontextfull commentsTime to go, Mr. Commissioner  by  PutYouInYourPlacein  hockey[+]Sharkbait41 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Sharkbait41 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoThey dont respect each other, and therefore cant have any kind of civil discourse between them.
