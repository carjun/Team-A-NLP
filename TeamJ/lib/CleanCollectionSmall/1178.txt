Facts are still hard to come by and the story is evolving. But these things follow a pattern. I'm guessing there will definitely be a psychiatric conversation to be had.It is being reported right now that Adam's brother Ryan told police that his brother was autistic and had a personality disorder.

And the 'why' is that most people have no cheap or easy access to psychological care. And the 'why' is that mental health is stigmatized in this country to the point where we just ignore it and refuse to talk about it until its too late.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

Most of these school and public shootings recently have been carried out by individuals who had psychotic breaks or severe undiagnosed disorders. A conversation about mental health is a more productive national conversation to have than the one about gun laws. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

Because your mind is closed and you refuse to integrate new information into your worldview as science evolves and we learn more.What are you even doing on /r/science if you are so opposed to the scientific process? I simply feel really bad for people who go on this keto diet and destroy their health.No need to feel sorry for them. All existing scientific evidence is to the contrary of this statement. Just feel bad that you are unwilling to use your brain. I encourage you to do and BE better.Skepticism is healthy.

These 'crazy' people are just normal people. They aren't people that are well connected in criminal organizations and know how to find off-market weapons. There may be a few that persevere and succeed in that regard, but I absolutely believe that it would stop the majority of these incidents.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

I believe accidental deaths would far outnumber any lives saved.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]TOUGH_LOVE_GAL -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]TOUGH_LOVE_GAL -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoThat doesn't imply that they couldn't obtain guns illegally if they desired.Sure, but adding barriers to entry for mentally ill people HELPS. It's certainly more effective if they have to find a black market weapons dealer as opposed to going down to their local walmartIf weapons ownership wasn't a Constitutionally guaranteed right that might make sense...but it is. I'm unclear on how psychological testing as a pre-req to weapons ownership tramples on anybody's rights. Religions have to fill out paperwork and prove certain things about their structure to qualify for status of 'religion' (501-c3) with the government and it doesn't impede people's ability to worship. Press is not free to slander or libel. You can't yell 'fire' in a crowded space. There are limits to all of our freedoms in the interest of the general safety. And if I have to take a regular exam to drive my car, I'm not sure why I don't have to do the safe to operate a firearm. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

Obviously not. That's a different problem than the mass shootings that occurs when somebody snaps in the head.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.
