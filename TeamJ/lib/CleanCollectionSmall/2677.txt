You're avoiding the reality of what the gun laws would be. They would not be laws that would add on a small amount of time for using guns in a crime such as murder -- I agree these laws are mostly useless in the US, and they don't make a whole lot of sense in any case.The new guns laws would be systemic in nature -- regulating the sale of guns far more tightly, regulating the type of guns it is legal to sell/possess, etc. -- i.e. they would be supply-side not demand-side (to borrow the term), and act to decrease the number of guns in circulation, not act as a personal deterrent against using guns.permalinksaveparent[+]shootx 1 point2 points3 points 43 minutes ago (9 children)[]shootx 1 point2 points3 points 43 minutes agoIn most states there are actually extremely tight laws preventing you from getting a gun.. If you ever have had a criminal record... If you have psych issues...   I mean how much further can you go?  Someone extremely determined is just going to get a gun even if we make it illegal.. Look at marijuana... It's illegal to purchase yet how many Americans buy weed everyday.I'd say the law is fine as is.... Our mental health system could use a ton of work.  Especially on cost.permalinksaveparent[+]PacoBedejo 1 point2 points3 points 41 minutes ago (1 child)[]PacoBedejo 1 point2 points3 points 41 minutes agoI mean how much further can you go?Let's just make it so that you have to be a LEO or elected official. That way, we ensure that no sociopaths will ever have guns. /spermalinksaveparent[+]shootx 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]shootx 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoOh god what have you done!! Brace yourself, 2nd Ammendment knights are coming.permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes ago (2 children)[]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes agoI'd say the law is fine as is.... Our mental health system could use a ton of work. Especially on cost.I agree that there are various solutions, and this is a big one. A problem as it currently stands, as a practical matter, is that the same party that's for guns is also against increased mental health and social work related spending that might mitigate the fallout of having so many guns in circulation (not in every case, of course, but in many cases). I hope that such spending can come to be seen as a bipartisan issue.permalinksaveparent[+]shootx 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)[]shootx 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes agoAgreed. I feel our country is all too welcoming to a bully relationship to those who encounter mental health issues even if they are looking for help. I think a bipartisan approach to creating a separate system of care for mental health should be worked on.  The best option isn't to just be reactive and lock them up once a crime has been committed.Even if we disagree on that notion, I will re-emphasize that I 100% totally concur in that it is a current problem that could potentially reduce the number of tragedies like this.. While I'm sure nothing can 100% prevent them... Reduction is always a nice thing.permalinksaveparent[+]thenewaddition 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)[]thenewaddition 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes agoConservative philosophy on health care: personal responsibility.Conservative philosophy on gun violence: we need to take care of our mentally ill.Godfuckingdamnit.permalinksaveparent[+]mattgrande 0 points1 point2 points 19 minutes ago (1 child)[]mattgrande 0 points1 point2 points 19 minutes agoLook at marijuana...

Drugs are a terrible analogue for guns in terms of regulation.permalinksaveparent[+]shootx 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]shootx 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoI agree, it was a bad one, but I still stick to the belief that just because something is illegal does not mean it will be impossible to get.permalinksaveparent[+]IDontCareForCats 7 points8 points9 points 51 minutes ago (5 children)[]IDontCareForCats 7 points8 points9 points 51 minutes agoWhere there's a will, there's a way. Do you think the criminalization of drugs has stopped people from getting drugs?permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 3 points4 points5 points 46 minutes ago (2 children)[]alphafemto 3 points4 points5 points 46 minutes agoWell, an alternative is vastly increased social work spending and mental health spending (including subsidized in-patient care, reversing the catastrophic cuts of the Reagan era) to help mitigate the usage of these readily available firearms. I assume you're for that.permalinksaveparent[+]IDontCareForCats 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes ago (1 child)[]IDontCareForCats 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes agoI have a family member who works in the mental health field, so yeah, I'm all for improving these services.permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 2 points3 points4 points 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto 2 points3 points4 points 29 minutes agoCool. I think it has potential as a bipartisan effort to deal with some of this.permalinksaveparent[+]sharkiest 0 points1 point2 points 47 minutes ago (1 child)[]sharkiest 0 points1 point2 points 47 minutes agoUh, yeah, it has. Have you ever tried to buy drugs?

Yes I have, and it was fucking easy.  Criminalization makes things more expensive, but you can find anything you want if you're willing to spend a few hours looking for a way to get it.permalinksaveparent[+]Bama011 0 points1 point2 points 48 minutes ago (5 children)[]Bama011 0 points1 point2 points 48 minutes agoThe problem is, even if you completely banned selling guns, it would still be relatively easy for people to get guns if they really wanted to. permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 1 point2 points3 points 41 minutes ago (4 children)[]alphafemto 1 point2 points3 points 41 minutes agoThen increase spending for social and mental health related spending in this country, and fund it with taxes on gun-related products.permalinksaveparent[+]Joxemiarretxe 3 points4 points5 points 33 minutes ago (2 children)[]Joxemiarretxe 3 points4 points5 points 33 minutes agoGuy with twelve guns here, half of them "Assault rifles."Do it. I wouldn't mind paying an extra fifty dollars per gun purchased if it would get these sick fucks the help they need. permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 24 minutes ago (1 child)[]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 24 minutes agoIndeed. We should stop looking at pie-in-the-sky solutions to this problem that will run afoul of the 2nd amendment (hence them being pie-in-the-sky as a practical matter), and start fixing whatever underlying issues we can. And this should be bipartisan.permalinksaveparent[+]Joxemiarretxe 1 point2 points3 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]Joxemiarretxe 1 point2 points3 points 11 minutes agoMhm. And what gets me the most is that people like the NRA could easily advocate this and earn IRL upvotes, but are too damn stubborn, when really, it's the least we could do. I wouldn't say guns are the reason this happens, but they are absolutely the means. We already tax cheeseburgers in some places, we could do the same for guns-- within reason. permalinksaveparent[+]Bama011 0 points1 point2 points 31 minutes ago (0 children)[]Bama011 0 points1 point2 points 31 minutes agoI would be fine with that.  I agree that mental health is one of the biggest things that needs to be looked at. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
