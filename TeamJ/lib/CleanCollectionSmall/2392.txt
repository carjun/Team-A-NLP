Two people living up the road from one another complaining about effects from the SAME storm when one loses power and the other loses their HOME. I understand your point, but it's not an excuse which makes your complaint seem any less selfish or self-important.permalinksavecontextfull comments"This aerial photo shows burned-out homes in the Breezy Point section of the Queens borough New York after a fire on Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2012." Photo credit: Mike Groll / AP Photo  by  trot-trotin  sandy[+]anytinganyting -11 points-10 points-9 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]anytinganyting -11 points-10 points-9 points 1 month agoIf someone has the nerve to complain about lost power and food items while their neighbor down the block watched his home burn to the ground, I have no sympathy or respect for the selfish prick. And if you read my comment, it was specifically aimed toward people in my home town who are complaining while there are people down the block, around the corner, a few miles down, who have lost EVERYTHING. So if you are one of those, go ahead and complain and prove yourself selfish. If you are in an area that wasn't really affected as seriously and are complaining, well, you're kinda a whiny bitch, and you should take a look around and be thankful for what you still have. permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuick, before the power comes back up on the east coast.
