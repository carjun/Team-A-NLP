February 24, 2012CADesigns Hello iReport Team! Today was the first time since I joined that I have successfully logged on. I'm happy to be here and may discover that my biased opinions might get me into trouble, though once upon a time I hoped I'd be a true journalist.I really want to get involved with the discussion about Women's Rights with regard to their bodies. We all know what that discussion is about, actually. I'd like to broaden it to include Men's Rights with regard to their bodies, as well. I suppose this would be a commentary rather than a report. Let me know, please, if you, our management team, feel this could be something of interest. I think women would be very interested. Just my humble opinion, or in DECcie terms, jmho, folks.             February 25, 2012DouglasRay No wonder my song for Morning Express never got a listen.

I have a question related to a CNN interview with police Chief Don Hunter of Marcos Islands, Florida I saw this afternoon. Chief Hunter stated that he investigated a former Florida police officer that was the last one to see two Florida men, (one African-American, and the other Hispanic). He said that the investigation is still open with their sheriffs department. My question is why did he not turn the investigation over to the Feds since the two men are still missing, and the case involved police corruption? Maybe he can be asked this question during a future interview. Thank you.            April 9, 2012jennyce Hello to the Team!! I'm so excited about you guys are doing and how the team has been growing. It's good to see there are real people behind every story.

May 1, 2012Preston13 The team just keeps on growing            May 17, 2012811DOC  Greetings to the family that I now belong too. I go by the name "The Good Doctor" aka 'Doc'. As I look at the team of I-Reporters. I as well take Pride, in representing This Corporation. While using Tack & determination, I plan on being a strong 'sprocket' in the realm of reporting. I plead right Here and Now to respect and honor. Those who have came before me. Who's shoulders I now stand upon in my quest of Journalism. I have a superb team that will beat down the doors, and go where "we" are needed within this concrete jungle. Team Swaggas as they are called, will be an asset to CNN I-REPORTERS.  As you read this, we have been working on a story about a 'Big Corporation' since December. We may not win an Award but I can guarantee. After reading my article I am sure it will have the masses saying 'WOW-WEE'.We have been gathering Facts that are Concrete!!! Soon I will be pulling the trigger, That will surely cause Heads to roll,fingers to point & deceitfulness by words (snitching) so that they can get from behind the 8 ball In closing we look forward to building friendships.

June 6, 2012Shahmeer Hello All the CNN team.I was a news paper journalist in the Pakistan, and i was story maker but here in The Kingdom I am a full story facing modern slavery here in the kingdom with my Cheater sponsor....After arrival in the Kingdom what i lost what thing i got its a countless that i should write a book but simply i would like to share with you peoples i am facing troubles from my sponsor side since 4 years.As below just i am in the harassment. Please any Kind hearted help me to get my Passport+Iqama and my driving license from the sponsor......!!!To His HighnessI feel revered to discuss my sufferings that I have been facing since four years. I have been acted like a puppet in hands of my sponsor during the above mentioned span of time. Furthermore, I was unable to travel and missed lot of events that came to my life which includes ,death of my father, my family that suffered due to financial issues, looking forward I am pleased to have kind consideration from you to have an immediate action on merit about the cause that I have mentioned in supporting documents. My former sponsor Amhani Baeshin gave my passport to the representative Mahmood Saeed because I got a job under Mahmood Saeeds supervision. But having a problem in profession that was of watchman Mahmood Saeed was unable to have me under his influence. Then Mahmood Saeed advised me to change my profession in Iqama. Then being opined by some of my friends I came to Mr.Musleh Faisal Al Otaibi and requested him to help me out in changing my profession .He asked me to give SAR 6000.00 to him for implementing a change in Iqama. Afterwards without having any official documents from Amhani Baeshin (former Sponsor) in lieu of changing my profession he took me under the sponsorship of his mother. Then I beseech in front of him that, why you did so and on what grounds you took me under your mother sponsorship. Proscribing all my documents that abounds my passport and Iqama he forcefully ordered me to work for him as a taxi driver, I refused to do so but he threatened and projected me to do work as a driver, I started working with him and when the Iqama expiry period came near he took SAR 2800.00 from me as a Iqama renewal charges. Then I applied for my vacation and he refused then I bow before him to please give me vacation but once again he took my Iqama and license by force. Having bearing all this I contacted one of his friend Muhammad Al Shehri (policeman in Jama P.S) on the request of him he gave me Exit Re entry (vacation of 4 months).Spending those vacation in Pakistan and acknowledging the prevailing circumstance of unemployment and financial Crisis. I came back to Saudi Kingdom .I came to them and requested in a noble and decent demeanor that that please restore my sponsorship due to impairment in my health I am unable to continue it meanwhile I suffered from diseases like, High blood pressure, piles and diabetes. But still all my requests went off his ear .During driving taxi my profession on Iqama was watchman but I had LTV license. I got traffic fine approximately SAR 11000.00. Once again he asked me to arrange SAR 6000.00 in order. He will change my profession from watchman to general driver to avert from traffic fine. Having no way out I further paid him SAR 4500.00. Then he changed my profession from watchman to general driver .Bearing and tolerating all troubles I requested him to release me from his job. He refused and harassed me in his office. Reaching my limit, went for Justice in Labor Court .After filing a Sue against him he didnt appeared before the honorable Court in eight hearings consecutively . To fix my problem I decided to have a table talk with him. Then Mr.Kahlid Al Ghamdi called him for negotiation bringing the dispute between us on table.Mr.Kahlid Al Ghamdi contacted my sponsor and organized a meeting on the e17th Jan 2012 at sponsor office. The meeting was held between Mr Khalid and Mr Musleh the sponsor in my absence, the agreement was as follows.1.The sponsor will renew my Iqama and I will pay him amount,2.I am to withdraw the court cause against the sponsor; and3.I will give him the transfer paper in return from my passport.Following the agreement, I was asked to come into the office (as I was waiting in the car outside the office) and handed over SAR 6500.00 for Iqama renewal.The following day as per the agreement I withdrew the case from the Saudi Labor Court and submitted the withdrawal letter to the sponsor on the e18th Jan 2012. While I was there the sponsor asked me to pay SAR 1000.00 For additional coast related to Iqama renewal.After three weeks, the sponsor had renewed my Iqama, but has asked for SAR 1100.00 as additional expenses incurred. I visited his office on 15th Feb 2012 in anticipation of obtaining the passport and Iqama.At this meeting, the sponsor told me that I have to work for him as a Taxi Driver, I refused to work for him given his character and relationship history.The sponsor ask            June 14, 2012gloria1969 Love to hear from everyone on this site and happy to be one here, as i am new i am just reading your messages and stories.

October 24, 2012poovey Hello Team. I have a question that has been bugging me about the polls at this election time. How is it that Romney is so close to Obama in the polls when 98% of African Americans are for Obamana and around 95% of Hispanics are for Obama. That really does not add up. What percentages of what people group are they taking these numbers from? The poll numbers cannot be right by a long shot... If I am missing something please update me.

December 14, 2012Dustyguy The Marine in the Matamoros prisonI spent some time in that prison in 2009. Its one dangerous place. When I entered the prison, the guards took my wallet and my belt. Then turned me over to three inmates that took me to a building. Inside was a large open space with a metal picnic table in the center. They sat me down at the table. I had been told there was a rent charged for your cell in the prison and I was ready to barter with them on the amount of the rent. There were ten men standing around the table. One stood at the end of the table. He held a three foot long club in the shape of a cricket bat. On the face of the club was carved an image of Sant Muerto. (Death). I was 68 years old then. I told them I had a monthly check coming in and would give them what they needed per month for rent. The big guy with the club just laughed and started beating me with the club. I knew then, negotiations were over. Long story short, they didnt want a monthly payment. They wanted everything I owned and they wanted it now. The other guys started a line taking turns hitting me between the times the big guy hit me with the club. I put my hands on the table to try to stand but the big guys eyes lit up and I knew he was going to break my fingers with the club if I left my hands on the table. I quickly placed them back in my lap, remained seated and took the beating. I ended up giving them my pickup truck. They kept asking me for my family information. I kept telling them they were all dead. One of the guys beating me was a guard. He went back into the guard office and brought the big guy my wallet. He went thru it looking for any evidence of family members. Fortunately I didnt have anything in my wallet that he understood. Then I was escorted to the clinic. They kept me there until my wounds healed enough for me to be with the other inmates. The clinic is no safehouse. While in there, a young guy with a broken hip was my roommate. The cartel broke his hip when he checked in to the prison. While he was in the clinic they came into our room and beat him up pretty bad because he had lied about what he could pay. There are four categories of prisoners there. 1. The GULF cartel member. They are treated as returning heroes. If they have been injured, they are given a boy to wait on them hand and foot. They have a good life. Plenty of drugs, food and women. The womens prison is connected to the mens prison and the cartel members go in there anytime they want and have sex with any girl they want. The girls are really living in hell. I have a C/D made by a missionary that goes to the prison. It shows many of the inmates sharing their story as much as they can without getting into trouble with the cartel. Ok. Back to inmates. 2. Are inmates like me that can afford to pay for their cell. For the first month they continued to threaten me if I didnt give them more stuff but they started letting me roam around the prison yard and even gave me some shirts to wear. My cell was on the third floor of one of the buildings. I carried water up the stairs for flushing the toilet, showers and brushing my teeth etc. 3. The prisoners that couldnt pay anything or couldnt pay enough were beaten to a pulp. Then put in a cell full of other unfortunates. They slept on the floor with no room to move. During the day for around four days they were forced to walk like a duck in a circle in a small room. This damaged their nerves in their legs and when they finished the four days, their feet would flop out of control when they walked. I saw one guy that was hit over fifty times with the club. He was totally black and blue. Another guy had his jawbone split in two. The right side of his jaw sagged down . It was broken in the middle of his chin. He still managed to eat. I dont know how. 4. The members of other cartels were walking dead men. I watched them beat the guys while they brought them into the building. Across from my cell was an empty cell. Thats where they would torture the other cartel members to death. I had a blanket over my cell bars between my cell and their cell. I could still see them beating the guys and hear them scream in pain. My cell door was never locked and my big fear was they would pull me from my cell and finish me off in that cell too. I was careful not to let them catch me watching. After they kill the guy they would load him into a wheelchair and take him to the dump. Thats where they hide the bodies. I managed to contact my daughter and she paid $11,500 to bail me out. That was scary too. I was afraid the cartel would find out I lied to them about not having a family. When the American Consulate come to visit you, the cartel plants a few English speaking members near the window so they can hear what you tell the consulate. When they visited me I had a big black eye and bruises all over my face. The consulate lady asked Are you being mistreated? what do you think I said with the two cartel members standing out of                You must be logged in to post a comment.About the iReport Blog                            The latest and greatest on CNN iReport, brought to you by Team iReport.Blog Home @cnnireport on TwitterCategoriesStoriesCommunitySiteWeek in iReportRecent postsThe hoax that brought NASA to CNN iReport  iReporters demand justice over brutal Nigeria murders   Presenting your iReport local news teamBehind the scenes at HLN's Morning ExpressNo sex required for unfaithfulness to beginSharing your thoughts on election can be easy as 1, 2, 3Finding beauty in the chaos5 things we learned from the 'I Voted' challengeiReport and Superstorm Sandy: Tune in to CNN tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. ETYoung iReporter's NFL dream come trueMonthlyDecember 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 SubscribeiReport 101About |Blog Community Guidelines Meet the Team Terms of UseWe are Everywhere Facebook Twitter Tumblr FlickrGet Help StoryTelling Toolkit FAQs Contact Us Advertising ContactsTools How to post iReports CNN Mobile appsHomeVideoCNN TrendsU.S.WorldPoliticsJusticeEntertainmentTechHealthLivingTravelOpinioniReportMoneySports Tools & widgetsRSSPodcastsBlogsCNN mobileMy profileE-mail alertsCNN shopSite map  2012 Cable News Network.
