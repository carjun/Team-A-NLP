Are either good?  by  hop3lessin  truegaming[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoI don't like them except for true expansions.I understand the purpose of ala carte microtransactions and mini-DLC and I don't have any real ethical opposition to them; I just just want to be able to pay a flat fee to get access to a game as a holistic entity.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBest games targeted towards emotional stories?  by  Kitriain  truegaming[+]stormbeta 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours agoI really enjoyed Resonance.It's a retro-style point-and-click that was released earlier this year. There were some serious twists in the plot that I was impressed with.It's not the most emotional of games that I've played, but I wanted to put it out here since it's not a very well known game.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI believe that MMO's and achievements have ruined gaming for me.  by  Captain_Babyin  truegaming[+]stormbeta 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours agoI've learned that my tastes vary over time, and my appetite for some genres is very different than others.For example, I'm pretty much always in the mood to play a good point-and-click adventure game (and yes, these are still made, I can make recommendations if you're interested), but immersive 3D games I only like playing once in awhile, even if I play them obsessively for the period that I do play them.For example, I've had Dark Souls sitting around for ages, and people keep telling me to play it. At some point I'll be in the mood to play it, and I'll probably play through the whole thing in a week, but until them I'm just not interested.Meanwhile, I bought Deponia, Chaos on Deponia, and Primordia (all very recently released point-and-click adventure games) and played them all immediately despite being very busy with finals.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWe are the SimCity dev team from Maxis.

The game industry is a bit different though, because there's a lot more supply versus demand compared with the rest of the programming industry.Even if it were trivial to change jobs though, it may not be so easy to find a position you liked as much as the old one (assuming  that you'd have left for only the DRM disagreement).permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the one thing everyone seems to love that you hate?  by  Picture_me_thisin  aspergers[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoDrinking, smoking, pot, etc.I'm not talking about getting completely shitfaced, I don't really understand even minor use that much, unless it's for curiosity reasons.I hate losing mental clarity for almost any reason.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the one thing everyone seems to love that you hate?  by  Picture_me_thisin  aspergers[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoTo be fair, it works better than known alternatives in most cases (varies by industry).permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the one thing everyone seems to love that you hate?  by  Picture_me_thisin  aspergers[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoI don't know how you celebrate Christmas, but for me it means getting together with people I love and care about, sometimes exchanging presents and stories, and doing something special, like a three day ski trip.Definitely not mindless...permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the one thing everyone seems to love that you hate?  by  Picture_me_thisin  aspergers[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoAgreed.

Especially if it's something hard to get, handmade, a type of thing the other person doesn't know exists, or something they would want but don't want to spend the money on.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the one thing everyone seems to love that you hate?  by  Picture_me_thisin  aspergers[+]stormbeta 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours ago*(0 children)[]stormbeta 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours ago*I don't like watching sports, but some of them can be quite fun to participate in - and remember that not all sports are team sports or even competitive. For example, I love skiing by myself.Clothes can be made interesting, just look at things from a functional perspective instead of a cosmetic one =Ppermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the one thing everyone seems to love that you hate?  by  Picture_me_thisin  aspergers[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoI personally like meeting people. Not just anyone of course, but as I get better at social interactions I find that I can hold an interesting conversation with a wider range of people - and even if I never meet that person again, an interesting conversation or encounter is fun. And interesting conversations mean you have more to talk about, because we like to recount memorable experiences.For example, when I was in Portland over the summer, a chance conversation with a stranger led to me learning about Portland's Annual Naked Bike Ride, which I ended up participating in. In doing so, I gained a pretty neat conversation topic. I even brought it up in my favor during a job interview.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMistletoe Kissing Prank Would you smooch under the omnipresent mistletoe?

There are many ways to accomplish mass killings without guns, and I don't mean lesser weapons like knives.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPotentially fascinating AMA with SimCity dev team totally derailed by DRM circlejerk  by  jedi-diahin  circlebroke[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoBut... they could lose a sale without you resorting to piracy. And you could resort to piracy but still buy the game (i.e. just used a cracked copy of the game after paying for it).Not buying it because of DRM doesn't entitle you to pirate it...permalinksavecontextfull commentsLogic!  by  Madlibsluverin  aspergers[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoYou mean reason, not logic, and emotions are both logical and rational. There's no "instead of" going on. Think of emotions as brain signals and it makes a lot more sense. You don't control your emotions, you use other emotions in place of emotions that are problematic.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEntire 'The Hobbit' midnight screening let out an audible groan when 'The Host' trailer flashed the words 'Based on a book by Stephanie Meyer' on screen.  by  Sanchmoin  geek[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours agoMost of the time people are quiet in American theaters too.It really depends on what kind of theater it is, whether's an early showing, what part of the country you're in, etc.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEntire 'The Hobbit' midnight screening let out an audible groan when 'The Host' trailer flashed the words 'Based on a book by Stephanie Meyer' on screen.  by  Sanchmoin  geek[+]stormbeta 3 points4 points5 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 3 points4 points5 points 11 hours agoI can't speak for The Host as I've never read it.However, some of the hate Twilight gets is well-deserved. It's a book series that glorifies horrifyingly dysfunctional relationships as "romantic" - and it's targeted at teens.That's more than enough reason to criticize it loudly and frequently.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEntire 'The Hobbit' midnight screening let out an audible groan when 'The Host' trailer flashed the words 'Based on a book by Stephanie Meyer' on screen.  by  Sanchmoin  geek[+]stormbeta 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours agoRocky Horror's actually pretty funny as a play.

I'd be hard pressed to think of a real use case for using SVN over Git or Mercurial other than legacy projects / training overhead. Hell, if it's just a matter of moving over Git can import SVN history last I checked.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHas the iPhone peaked? Apples iPhone 4S seen outselling iPhone 5  by  gobble_gabblein  technology[+]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoYeah, but I'm pretty sure you couldn't replace it with an extra-large battery, which is what I was getting at. The only way to do it is to use a physically separate charge pack. Whereas my Galaxy Nexus, if I needed that kind of battery life, has several options for straight up replacing the battery with a larger battery.Several Android devices don't have user-serviceable batteries either, and not all of them allow SD-card slots. But at least some of them do.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHas the iPhone peaked?

There's multiple versions of the iMac, Mac Mini, Macbook, etc.My comment about "one" device only applies to the iPhone.The driver thing's never really been an issue for me. Then again I pretty much stick to ThinkPads for laptops, and I build my own PC for desktops.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
