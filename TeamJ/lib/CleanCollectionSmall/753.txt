We need to study to know how to be another person.  When we are doing a show, we know everything there is to know about our character.  Even if it's never mentioned in the show.  We know what makes our character tick, what makes her happy, what makes him sad, what sort of person she makes googly eyes at, what kind of food makes his mouth water... we become very intimately aware of our character and put an insane amount of work into making sure that absolutely everything we say makes sense.When the character says, "Alright." does he mean he's actually alright?  Is he feeling kind of shitty, but just saying that to be nice?  Is he being sarcastic?  Many times these sorts of choices aren't written into the script, so how two different people play the same character can be completely different.It's fascinating, it's difficult, it's heartbreaking, it's the worst profession in the world that gives you the best feeling when you finally get the chance to use your skills.  I would never recommend anybody get into it for a career, but I can't think of anything else that I would rather do.  Being an actor is like constantly being on an emotional rollercoaster and we have to be mentally and emotionally strong enough to handle all the shit that gets thrown at us.Plus, we have to be able to understand Shakespeare.  That's... pretty hard.permalinksavecontextfull commentsActors and actresses of Reddit, what are some of the biggest misconceptions people have about your profession?  by  thecynicroutein  AskReddit[+]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoNot generally.  A good actor should know when to turn it on and when to turn it off.  For incredibly emotional roles, sometimes the actors will gather afterwards and have a sort of cool-down session.  I played a suicidal girl in a small show once and it took so much out of me, however my friends and other actors were right there to pick me up afterwards and give the support I needed.You hear sometimes about actors going off the deep end, but when you can't differentiate between real life and what you're doing on stage, you're doing a pretty strange kind of acting that very few people can pull off successfully.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe downside of watching Game of Thrones Blu-Ray in glorious 1080p High Definition, is that you end up noticing things you're not supposed to notice, and that were not noticeable before.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]WadeK 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]WadeK 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoDo you think if he was walking down the street and someone said, "Dude, that's the guy who killed those kids" that nobody would assault him?  I think it's verbal abuse simply because they were separated by the internet.  Some of the comments that were made to this poor kid were absolutely terrifying and I have no doubt that he would be in physical danger if he were to meet any of the people who were harassing him.So yes.  I'm saying that mob mentality leads people to attack the innocent without doing research to make sure you're attacking the 'right' person.  When, in a group, we get whipped into a sort of 'blood frenzy', we turn pretty ignorant.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]WadeK 96 points97 points98 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]WadeK 96 points97 points98 points 22 hours agoReminds me of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.  When Marc Anthony incites an angry mob against Caesar's killers, they find some dude named Cinna.  This cat was just a poet, some poor artist bastard, but he had the same name as one of the senators, Cinna.The mob didn't care that he was the wrong Cinna and tore him to pieces for his name.Seems we haven't really changed much in five centuries.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWomen in martial arts  by  LunchOwlin  TwoXChromosomes[+]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoOh, sorry.  The classes I've done were a mix of BJJ and Muay Thai.  The one I was looking at was much the same.  I sometimes get them mixed up because when we rolled we would sometimes start standing and then have to knock the opponent down to start wrasslin'.I wouldn't want to wrestle a kid, either.  Waaay too easy to hurt someone younger and smaller than you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]WadeK 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoSame thing happened when there was a school shooting near my high school.  They did business as usual, but there were TVs on in all the classes and absolutely NOBODY was allowed to roam the halls.  Parents came because they wanted to pick their kids up and take them home, but they weren't allowing any non-students or faculty in the building and that made a little clusterfuck.Really, when it's not your actual school that has the incident, letting kids go home would do nothing but create undue chaos.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWomen in martial arts  by  LunchOwlin  TwoXChromosomes[+]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoYup, I went to a gym down the street from me and they were like, "Umm... you can join the kid's class if you want, it's mixed."  Like.. literal kids.  I'm not punching a kid in the face.I'm going to do a bit more research once work lightens up a bit, but for now I'm just going to be lazy.

We much fun of Engineers too.It mostly consists of us making robot voices and then saying, "System 32 error?  Ahh, art majors...

The US did it 60 years ago without modern technology.  by  boardatworkin  AskReddit[+]WadeK 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoBasically we invented them, so we have very intimate knowledge of how they work and are built.  Our scientists went to other countries with this knowledge, or other countries with comparable education came up with their own inventions.  Nobody is willing to defect to North Korea because they simply don't have anything to offer any scientists holding nuclear secrets.  Iran... might... but I was under the impression that they already had nukes from Russia.  Might be wrong on that, my middle-eastern cold-war knowledge is shakyPlus, you need to have access to some very specific materials.  We have pretty good tabs on who has uranium and plutonium and where it's going to.  Sometimes things slip through the radar, but it's rarer than you think.  North Korea is going to have a hell of a time acquiring some when absolutely everybody is against them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat professions would be the most valuable in an apocalyptic world?  by  lets_be_truantin  AskReddit[+]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoLots of people with engineering or similar degrees make fun of arts majors for picking 'useless' degrees.

No, I learned how to make GOURMET SHIT in a fire or home-built clay oven.  I'm also a bomb-diggity storyteller.

It's so much fun.  I'm pretty squirmy and flexible, so any time a guy tries to put me in a hold, I'm able to just wriggle my way out of it.  This stops them from 'going easy on me' because I'm a chick.  I ended up getting pretty good at it, though I never got to my goal of pinning the instructor.  :/Unfortunately, I just moved and I can't find a gym that teaches beginner to intermediate BJJ with mixed genders.  I really hated the 'all women' classes because they were really watered down.  I can roll with the boys, but I get stuck with the ladies' class which.... leaves much to be desired.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNetherlands to Cease Funding Jewish Broadcasting - Jewish community in Netherlands outraged by Cabinets plans to deny Jewish Broadcaster access to public broadcasting system.  by  brotherofbadulain  news[+]WadeK 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoReally, the fact that any religion gets government funding for a tv channel is pretty gross.

I go outside and there's giant robots all over the place, making my city their bitch.  Everyone's freaking out but I'm like, "Don't worry, bros, I got this."  Someone comes up and is like, "Wadek you bad.  Come pilot this robot and fight the evil ones to save the day."  So I do.Somehow it all ends in an awesome swordfight with the bad guys who may or may not have moustaches.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some products that people use incorrectly on a daily basis  by  Knight_Cameronin  AskReddit[+]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agocouldn't?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]WadeK 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoBut but but.... they stopped giving money to an organization that promotes breast health just because they also promote something that has nothing to do with them???That's like refusing to shop at Target because they also sell R rated movies.Dammit, I hate this world sometimes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Real North Korea Problem - While the world fears its missiles 250,000 innocents, one-third of them children, are being forced to do slave labor on starvation rations and are daily subjected to heinous torture and executions  by  dunkin45in  worldnews[+]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoCommunication between citizens or communication between military personnel?  And even if their is communication, is it between members of a younger generation who can put aside differences to discuss life or is it between people who are brainwashed to think, "Me good, you bad."I lived in China near the border of North Korea for a couple years and we would get some North Koreans in our town.  Actually, there was a whole neighborhood full of them.  Many came over to work for a couple of years, then went back.  I was told that many believe that the city they went to was purposefully built to be beautiful because the West wanted to fool the NK immigrants with propoganda.  Those who weren't tricked by the brainwashing usually opted to not return.  If they were forced to return, there's a chance they were thrown into jail.It's really a very different culture there.  Brainwashing is a hell of a drug.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Real North Korea Problem - While the world fears its missiles 250,000 innocents, one-third of them children, are being forced to do slave labor on starvation rations and are daily subjected to heinous torture and executions  by  dunkin45in  worldnews[+]WadeK 41 points42 points43 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]WadeK 41 points42 points43 points 1 day agoNo, assassination would only create a martyr.

When they go through school they are taught by their teachers, their parents, grandparents, etc, that this is how things always have been and how things always will be.  They honestly believe that Kim Jong Enter-Name-Here is the best leader because they have absolutely no way of knowing what the outside world is like.The Arab Spring movement relied HEAVILY on the internet and social media to spread the word and get the news out into the world.  Right now we're not even 100% sure what's going on in North Korea because word-of-mouth is the only thing we have, and it's rare that someone escapes to tell the tale.Their education system is brainwashing their people to the point where they likely don't know what the internet is, let alone how to harness its power to start an uprising.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]WadeK 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoSometimes you are told to buy multiple textbooks for a class, even though you only go through one.  Sometimes you're forced to buy a new edition, even though the old edition is just as good and contains the same information.Not all textbooks are useful.  I've also come to notice that the more expensive a book is, the less it will be used.  I got SO MUCH MORE information out of my $30 'complete works of Shakespeare' book than my $400 'history and analysis of Shakespeare' one.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]WadeK 22 points23 points24 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]WadeK 22 points23 points24 points 2 days agoWhy in the world would a charity organization need to be pro or anti choice?

You're going to suck at first.
