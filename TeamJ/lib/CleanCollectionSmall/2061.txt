How, exactly, is Mass Effect responsible for today's shooting?  by  superfiedmanin  gaming[+]KidCadaver 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]KidCadaver 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago... but, I thought parents needed to be responsible and not let their possibly-mentally-ill-children play violent games?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I feel really, really awful for the guy now. What an absolute shit-storm for him, especially if he's completely innocent and knew nothing about this.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]KidCadaver 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]KidCadaver 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours agoThis is a good reply. When I was middle school-age (about 13 or 14 years ago? Geeze...) no one really talked about it. No teachers briefed us on what happened. Our parents assumed that responsibility. But, when we had lockdowns in school, we'd just be told "lockdown drill, get into the corner on the same wall the door is on so the window is facing away from you, put your hands over your heads and stay completely silent until an authority figure unlocks the door and comes in."So we'd sit in silence. That's when I'd start wondering how easy of a target I was and what it might feel like to be shot.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Actually, it might have even been said in an interview! I'm sure a quick Google will help you find the quote.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]KidCadaver 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]KidCadaver 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoI totally understand. I also live in SoCal, in my 20's, no kids... and I've never reacted to a public disaster like this before. I'm in no way related to this, but I can't stop crying and feeling my heart tug with emotion.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]KidCadaver 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]KidCadaver 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoMy reasoning, when I was a kid, was that someone who was going to shoot up our school would probably be attending that school. Therefore, they would have a good idea about what corner the kids were hiding it and what classes were full at which time of day. I don't know - I had morbid thoughts about how I'd die when I was a kid :-\permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]KidCadaver 18 points19 points20 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]KidCadaver 18 points19 points20 points 23 hours agoSame. I was just talking with a friend about the day they put up black paper on the door-windows of our middle school classrooms. It was right after Columbine. We then had monthly "lock-down" drills. Every time, I would imagine what it was like to die like that. I would always think "black paper and a locked door isn't going to stop someone if they want in."permalinksavecontextfull commentsApparently cards against humanity WILL send you cards if you enter $0.00.

What kind of paper did you print it on? I'm cheap, so I want to use a cheap paper... but I also don't want to have crappy cards.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Those poor children. Can you even imagine the horror that the teacher experienced, knowing what was happening?*Edit: They just interviewed a child (awful! why would they do that right now!?) who said they thought the gunshots was the sound of the custodian banging on something. I can't even imagine being a child and having NO IDEA what a gunshot sounds like... then just hearing hundreds of them. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your useless talent?  by  IamSofaKingIttyin  AskReddit[+]KidCadaver 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]KidCadaver 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI know enough useless facts about Disneyland and its History to easily be considered employable as a tourguide for the company.

He played World of Warcraft with me for a long time and was constantly failing out of his college classes. One day his Facebook reads, "Just got a job!!" Fast forward a few months, "MY NEW JOB IS GREAT! I'VE MADE SO MUCH MONEY. I CAN GET ANY OF YOU A JOB IF YOU WANT IT. SERIOUSLY, I'M MAKING THOUSANDS. MESSAGE ME FOR INFO!"Vector. It is the ONLY thing he posts about now. He's gone off the deep end. "Hey guys! I'm partying with my Vector-peeps today!
