Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]tommyboy180 5 points6 points7 points 2 hours ago*(0 children)[]tommyboy180 5 points6 points7 points 2 hours ago*I wonder what would happen if a teacher had a concealed gun and shot in defense? Would the teacher get in trouble since guns are banned at elementary schools federally, even if their actions saved lives?Edit: Damn people. It's a fucking question.

Yes, I believe in his right to tell them off. He could have done it differently, however. I wish everyone would flex their rights. Unfortunately, in this country if you don't use the rights they are taken away. permalinksavecontextfull commentsA Kid at my University shows us how not to talk to cops.  by  Pezho405in  videos[+]tommyboy180 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]tommyboy180 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI can summarize my argument so that "passer by'ers" can read quickly:This guy is a douche, however, his words and actions are protected by the 1st amendment under this supreme court ruling. His verbal assault is also protected under that ruling. He may not be smart but the constitution allows him to say stupid shit and insult cops. permalinksavecontextfull comments15123Any hunters in the subreddit. I'm looking for information.

Well put. Just to play devil's advocate here for a moment...I didn't hear any fighting words. He disrespected them horribly and said some nasty things that would make anyone mad, however, he didn't say anything that was outside of what the 1st protects. The 1st does protect obscene words, such as curse words or even the middle finger. There are several cases of people cursing cops and flipping them the bird which resulted in a false arrest and later resulted in cases that prove the 1st protects that type of speech (and gestures). Verbal assault is also protected. The supreme court ruled that verbal assault is protected. Here is the case PDF warning. Here is what the supreme court says about verbal assault and terrible language: Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and  as it did here  inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. permalinksavecontextfull commentsA Kid at my University shows us how not to talk to cops.  by  Pezho405in  videos[+]tommyboy180 19 points20 points21 points 3 days ago*(0 children)[]tommyboy180 19 points20 points21 points 3 days ago*It's evident that everyone in this topic hates how this guy handled the situation. He handled this very poorly - that is a fact. However, please consider his 1st amendment rights to be a dick. Regardless of how much everyone here wanted to see the cops tase and no matter how much he was being a douche, our 1st amendment rights award us the option to behave like this. We live in a country that constitutionally protects this behavior. I don't agree with how he handled it, but he is within his rights to handle any situation like this. Disrespect, cursing, yelling, berating, verbally attacking, and saying "I love you" are all protected forms of speech. Please keep a balanced and open mind about topics like this. Thoughts?Edit: Downvote all you want but I'm not wrong. Here is a supreme court ruling that enforces verbal assault, obscene language, and even the middle finger are protected under the 1st: http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-751.pdfpermalinksavecontextfull commentsMen try to rob a Church's Chicken in Kansas City.
