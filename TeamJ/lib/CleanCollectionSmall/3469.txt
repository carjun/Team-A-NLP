December 18, 2012 (AP)Noah's twin, Arielle, who was assigned to a different classroom, survived the killing frenzy.At Jack Pinto's Christian service, hymns rang out from inside the funeral home, where the boy lay in an open casket. Jack was among the youngest members of a youth wrestling association in Newtown, and dozens of little boys turned up at the service in gray Newtown Wrestling T-shirts.Jack was a fan of New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz and was laid to rest in a Cruz jersey.Authorities say the man who killed the two boys and their classmates, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, shot his mother, Nancy, at their home and then took her car and some of her guns to the school, where he broke in and opened fire. A Connecticut official said the mother, a gun enthusiast who practiced at shooting ranges, was found dead in her pajamas in bed, shot four times in the head with a .22-caliber rifle.Lanza was wearing all black, with an olive-drab utility vest with lots of pockets, during the attack.As investigators worked to figure out what drove him to lash out with such fury  and why he singled out the school  federal agents said that he had fired guns at shooting ranges over the past several years but that there was no evidence he did so recently as practice for the rampage.APVeronika Pozner, right, arrives at a funeral...

Watch VideoSandy Hook Elementary Shooter: What Caused Shooting? Watch VideoDebora Seifert, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said both Lanza and his mother fired at shooting ranges, and also visited ranges together."We do not have any indication at this time that the shooter engaged in shooting activities in the past six months," Seifert said.Investigators have found no letters or diaries that could explain the attack.Whatever his motives, normalcy will be slow in revisiting Newtown. Classes were canceled district-wide Monday.Dan Capodicci, whose 10-year-old daughter attends the school at St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church, said he thinks it's time for her to get back to classes."It's the right thing to do. You have to send your kids back. But at the same time I'm worried," he said. "We need to get back to normal."The district has made plans to send surviving Sandy Hook students to Chalk Hill, a former middle school in the neighboring town of Monroe. Sandy Hook desks that will fit the small students are being taken there, empty since town schools consolidated last year, and tradesmen are donating their services to get the school ready within a matter of days.With Sandy Hook Elementary still designated a crime scene, state police Lt. Paul Vance said it could be months before police turn the school back over to the district.Lanza is believed to have used a Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle, a civilian version of the military's M-16. It is similar to the weapon used in a recent shopping mall shooting in Oregon and other deadly attacks around the U.S. Versions of the AR-15 were outlawed in this country under the 1994 assault weapons ban, but the law expired in 2004.Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management announced Tuesday it plans to sell its stake in Freedom Group, maker of the Bushmaster rifle, following the school shootings.Cerberus said in a statement Tuesday that it was deeply saddened by Friday's events, and that it will hire a financial adviser to help with the process of selling its Freedom Group interests.Previous Page1|2|3Next PageRelated Topics: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Catholicism, Christianity, Mark Warner, Mental Health, Michael Bloomberg, New York, U.S., Associated Press, Barack ObamaFollow @abcon Twitter, become a fan on FacebookComment & ContributeDo you have more information about this topic?
