Text SizePrintE-mailReprints The schools 436 surviving students will not return to Sandy Hook, Newtowns school superintendent announced Sunday. There will be no school Monday and perhaps not for the rest of the week; it will be a week of funerals in Newtown. The first is Monday, for 6-year-old Noah Pozner. Eight other funeral services were being planned at Newtowns St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church, where 10 of the 20 young victims were parishioners.When it is time for school again, the Sandy Hook students will attend an unused school in a neighboring town.Personal PostGraphicWhat if gunmakers funded mental health care instead of lobbying?

As dusk gave way to darkness after a cold, damp day of bottomless communal grief, hundreds of mourners of all ages slowly converged on Newtown High School for the service of remembrance. Among them was Kristen Rosengrant, with her young sons.As a mom, Ive been so upset, she said, waiting in line to get in. I dont think anything is going to help the families. But its nice to show concern.In the packed auditorium, Obama asked, Can we honestly say that were doing enough to keep our children, all of them, safe from harm? He added: Ive been reflecting on this the last few days, and if were honest with ourselves, the answers no. Weve not done enough. And well have to change.Without referring specifically to gun-control legislation, the president said he intends to engage my fellows citizens, from law enforcement to mental-health professionals to parents and educators in search of new ways to combat gun violence. Because what choice do we have? We cant accept events like this as routine.Although every mass shooting prompts a public discussion of gun control, the issue has been politically dormant for years, with elected officials who favor stricter regulations appearing reluctant to pursue a debate that they consider unwinnable.But the enormity of the Newtown shootings  the slaughter of 20 defenseless grade-schoolers, ages 6 and 7, and the countrys horrified, heartsick reaction  seems to be generating a louder-than-usual chorus of calls for tougher gun laws.Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) said Sunday that the time is right to reenact the federal ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2004. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) said Obama should push for such legislation now, while the nation stares aghast at the devastation wrought by a killer wielding a military-style rifle.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) vowed to introduce a bill to ban such weapons, and Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) told CBS Newss Bob Schieffer that the rampage seems to prove that his states strict gun laws are not strict enough. Obviously they didnt prevent this woman from acquiring that weapon and obviously allowed the son to come into possession of those, Malloy said. He added, When someone can use an assault weapon to enter a building ... [and] have clips of up to 30 rounds on a weapon that can almost instantaneously fire those, you have to start to question whether assault weapons should be allowed.Continued123Next PageEmailTumblrRedditStumbleuponDiggDeliciousDiscussion Policy | FAQ | About DiscussionsLoading...CommentsAdd your commentRead what others are sayingAbout BadgesSuperFan BadgeSuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.More about badges | Request a badgeCulture Connoisseur BadgeCulture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.More about badges | Request a badgeFact Checker BadgeFact Checkers contribute questions, information and facts to The Fact Checker.More about badges | Request a badgeWashingtologist BadgeWashingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.More about badges | Request a badgePost Writer BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.Post Forum BadgePost Forum members consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on politics, national and international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgeWeather Watcher BadgeWeather Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on climates and forecasts.More about badges | Request a badgeWorld Watcher BadgeWorld Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgePost Contributor BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post contributor.
