Dec 16 (Reuters) - The children who survivedFriday's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School will not haveto return to the scene of the massacre when school reopens laterthis week and instead will attend classes in a neighboringConnecticut town, Newtown school officials said on Sunday.It remains unclear when the 436 surviving students at SandyHook will return to class, but when they do it will be in anunused school about 7 miles (11 km) to the south in Monroe,Newtown School Superintendent Janet Robinson said."The Town of Monroe has graciously offered their Chalk HillSchool," Robinson said in a statement. "This facility, which iscurrently not being used, is in excellent condition and willaccommodate all of the Sandy Hill School students and staff."It is located just across the border from Newtown andshould be ready for occupancy in just a few days."All seven of Newtown's public schools, which serve more than5,100 students, as well as private schools in the district, willbe closed on Monday, school officials said late on Saturday.Officials were scrambling for ways to accommodate survivingstudents from what had been the town's largest elementaryschool, serving 5- to 10-year-olds in kindergarten throughfourth grade. The public school remains an active crime scene.A Newtown police officer expressed doubt the school couldever be used again."At this time it's too early to say. But I would find itvery difficult for them to do that. Certainly that's one of thethings they're going to have to look into," Lieutenant GeorgeSinko of the Newtown police said at a news conference on Sunday.Twenty Sandy Hook first graders were killed on Friday when a20-year-old man armed with an assault weapon and two hand gunsshot his way into the school and opened fire.Six adults, including the school principal, were also killedat the school. The gunman killed his mother and himself for atotal death toll of 28 people.In place of school on Monday, town officials said childrenwould be able to attend a day of recreational activities hostedby local sports organizations at the Newtown Youth Academy, aprivate athletic facility in town.All schools in the town other than Sandy Hook School willreopen on Tuesday.StocksMarketsTweet thisLink thisShare thisDigg thisEmailReprintsWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data.
