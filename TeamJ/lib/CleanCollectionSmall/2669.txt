It sucks.permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Cylinsier 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour agoThe sooner people start to recognize and accept this, the sooner we will start to actually solve the problem.  Shootings like this are just one branch on the tree of consequences of mental health stigmatization in our society.  The culture around it needs to change.  It's still difficult for a lot of people to get insurance that will cover mental health, even through employers, for example.  That's just unacceptable.  permalinksaveparent[+]Yossarian33 -1 points0 points1 point 45 minutes ago (0 children)[]Yossarian33 -1 points0 points1 point 45 minutes agoBut providing health care to everyone doesn't seem to be very popular among gun enthusiasts who are often right-leaning. Personal liberty logic leads to believing that these people deserve to be ill and deserve to take care of it themselves, and that good people who aren't ill shouldn't be forced to pay taxes to help the mentally ill.Even in Canada, mental health is just brushed off to the side.permalinksaveparent[+]soline 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes ago (0 children)[]soline 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes agoSometimes they are not mentally ill. I wouldn't call someone mentally ill if they know exactly what they are doing and why they did it. permalinksaveparent[+]MightyYetGentle 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)[]MightyYetGentle 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes agoMental illness is the cause, but the tools for murder are too easily accessible for the insane.
