Its much too late.Mass shootings across the U.S. in 2012 The Washington Post GRAPHIC | Two of the deadliest massacres happened this year, but 11 others also claimed lives.We have established a point of entry, Vance said, declining to elaborate. He was not let in voluntarily. ... [He] forced his way into the school.Vance said officials had successfully identified the victims of the shootings and notified their families. A local medical examiner was due to release the names of the victims later Saturday.News of Lanzas forced entry added another disturbing twist to the timeline of Fridays school shooting, the second worst in U.S. history. Authorities say 20-year-old Adam Lanza fatally shot his mother on Friday, drove her car to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, then killed 20 children, six adults and himself.Sandy Hooks principal, Dawn Hochsprung, had recently installed a new security system in which the school doors were kept locked all day starting at 9:30 a.m. Some parents and other officials initially speculated that the shooter likely was able to walk in unquestioned because school employees knew he was a teachers son. Authorities said that was not the case. It also remained unclear early Saturday whether Nancy Lanza, the shooters mother, was indeed a teacher at the school. Numerous reports on Friday, including those in The Washington Post, initially identified her as a kindergarten teacher there, but Newtown Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said there is no record that Nancy Lanza ever worked at the school, according to ABC News.A day after Fridays horrific shooting, this small New England town was wracked with grief.Monsignor Robert Weiss, of St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Newtown, led a packed vigil at the church Friday evening and had accompanied police to notify some families that their children would not be coming home. Many of the questions are just wondering what were the last moments of these peoples lives like? They were wondering did the child even know what was happening, were they afraid, did they see something coming? Weiss said in an interview early Saturday with NBC News. And of course no one can answer that question because there were no survivors, so these parents are left with those unanswered questions in addition to just why this had to happen, why to their child?Weiss also recalled the scene Friday at a local firehouse, where some parents exulted in being reunited with their children, while others slowly realized no such reunion would come. When they were taking the attendance and certain names were not called, most people were asked to go into a separate room, Weiss told NBC. Everyones heart just dropped. They knew something horrible had happened.He added, The emotions of yesterday were just absolutely overwhelming, and I dont know if the reality has really settled in yet.Continued12Next PageEmailTumblrRedditStumbleuponDiggDeliciousDiscussion Policy | FAQ | About DiscussionsLoading...CommentsAdd your commentRead what others are sayingAbout BadgesSuperFan BadgeSuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.More about badges | Request a badgeCulture Connoisseur BadgeCulture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.More about badges | Request a badgeFact Checker BadgeFact Checkers contribute questions, information and facts to The Fact Checker.More about badges | Request a badgeWashingtologist BadgeWashingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.More about badges | Request a badgePost Writer BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.Post Forum BadgePost Forum members consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on politics, national and international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgeWeather Watcher BadgeWeather Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on climates and forecasts.More about badges | Request a badgeWorld Watcher BadgeWorld Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgePost Contributor BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post contributor.
