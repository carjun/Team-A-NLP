People are afraid to seek treatment.It could get much worse if we start trying to put people on watch-lists that take away their rights if they have problems.  That will drive even more people away from treatment.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I took like 40 30-second exposures and didn't catch a single one, although I saw the biggest one of my life.  Eventually the clouds came in and my battery came close to dying. I need to get some spare batteries, I hate how I can't power it while taking pictures or while mounted on a tripod, those will definitely be features I'll be looking for on my next camera.permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: A bag of chips has air in it to prevent the product from damage, but when I leave a bag open, the chips go stale.

Subsequently, Section 124 of Public Law 111-88 gives the Secretary the discretionary authority to issue a SUP to DBOC for a period of 10 years, until 2022So, it would seem that the closure has been completely inevitable, it's just a matter of now or 10 years from now.  While 10 years is definitely significant, that really colors the whole affair.Here is that 2004 opinion from the Department of Interior Field Solicitor.And it's quite clear in its conclusion..Hence, the Park Service is mandated by the Wilderness Act, the Point Reyes Wilderness Act and its Management Policies to convert potential wilderness, i.e., the Johnson Oyster Company tract and the adjoining Estero, to wilderness status as soon as the non conforming use can be eliminated.Choosing to operate for another 10 years seems pretty clearly out of line with that mandate.  The National Park Service does not have the authority to lease the land they are in charge of to be used for these kinds of commercial operations.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDrake's Bay Sustainable Family-Run Oyster Farm Being Shut Down by NPA Appointed Official Salazar - Sign Petition to Reverse Decision - First Post  by  jiggleitalittlein  bayarea[+]frownyface 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]frownyface 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIs there anywhere that sort of information is officially available?

You setup passwordless ssh login using private keys, and then use rsync specifying ssh as the shell.  Ex:rsync -az -e ssh 'remoteusername@remotehostname:/mnt/seedbox/*.{avi,mkv,etc}' /local/path/you/want/em/atrsync is crazy flexible.  Its normal behavior is to only copy new/changed files, in case you were wondering.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJulian Assange to form Wikileaks Party, run for Australian Senate  by  XavMasterin  worldnews[+]frownyface 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]frownyface 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoSure, but that doesn't mean everything he does is because of his ego.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJulian Assange to form Wikileaks Party, run for Australian Senate  by  XavMasterin  worldnews[+]frownyface -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)[]frownyface -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoIt says a lot about his ego that he's even considering this.I don't think he's doing it for his ego, he's trying to make it clear he is a political prisoner.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMade something for you.  by  manch455in  doctorwho[+]frownyface 11 points12 points13 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]frownyface 11 points12 points13 points 2 days agoSame thing happened to me, and I only watched it once.
