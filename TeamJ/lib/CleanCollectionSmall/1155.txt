Girlfriend (22f) went crazy on me (24m) and cried for 2hrs, wants me to select other job.

(you said she knew you were applying overseas, even if you downplayed it.) either you could visit her when she's at home, or her family could come visit you for the holidays, or she could work this hard job for a year and then get better benefits later... I'm just saying, things work out if you want them to work out.  but it's totally all right to just want a clean end to the relationship and decide you don't want to do long-distance.  if it's not that crazy type of love that bears all things then maybe you'll meet her again in a few years or maybe you'll find someone else. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow long would you let someone pee on you for $300 a day?

She doesn't need his help (unless she's into that! then have at it, OP.) He just needs to clarify that there isn't some deep-seated issue or that she actually understands what masturbation is-- and the only time she's going to respond truthfully seems to be if she's caught right after the act.permalinksavecontextfull commentsYour thoughts/opinions/expressions on the Connecticut shooting?  by  code2mindin  AskReddit[+]piphyt 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]piphyt 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI'm the one who posted the original comment-- more people need to talk about it than just the NRA.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

You don't have to do it in a shameful way, just wait til she's finished and say "so you say you don't masturbate, but you do this a couple nights a week, can you clarify for me?"I would agree that it's not a big deal and that who cares if she says she doesn't but actually does on her own time... but you're in the bed with her!
