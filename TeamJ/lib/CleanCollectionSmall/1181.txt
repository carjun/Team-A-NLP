See More And that takes us to our chief investigative correspondent brian ross, trying to understand this young man and the troubles that led him to this hosht act. Brian? He was arnled with guns and went from on curety to infamilymy. He was known as someone who do not play well with others. The perp rater of the crime is dead. A little different. Unfortunately, what's in the mind of that shooter now, he's taking to the grave with him. Tonight, no one yet seems to be able to answer the question, why 20-year-old adam lanza, seen here in a photo provided to abc news from seven years ago, attacked the newtown elementary school. We will go backwards as far as we have to go and hopefully stumble on answers. Adam lanza was the child of an affluent connecticut town and a child of divorce. In morning, he first killed his mother, nancy. Family friends bash ka frey told jim avila the son was troubled and the family was demandsing of him. He was not connected. My son played with him when they were young. In her home, she was very particular. I just think she maybe had too high of a standard of something. Or focused too much for whatever reason. So was there conflict? Was there tension between the two of them? The parent and the child? I don't think so. The pants were divorced. The young man headed to the sandy hook elementary school wearing a bullet proof vest. Authorities say he was armed with a semiautoic assault rifle and two pistols. A relative says that adam was not well. The important thing, he did not just snap this morning and decide to act out violently. These crimes involve plans and strategizi strategizing. Why the attack on the children at the school. Most of them killed on the spot, according to authority. His mother, divorced three years ago and unemployed and worked as a teacher's aide at the school. The children, his mother may be the real focus on this, the anger and rage and resentment has built up over the years and he decided, I am been powerless all this time. So far, it's only a theory following a day on confusion. Starting with state and federal authorities wrongly identified the shooters a adam's brother, new york accountant. That led to him saying, I wasn't me. I was at work. It wasn't me. When ryan arrived at his home in hoboken, new jersey, police took him in for questioning. They spent the evening at a police stations a authorities seek fought he had any dwlad adam was trying to be violent. They are trying to say, yes, he said that, I thought he was joking. Couldn't believe that anyone would do that. I just ignored that. It's not known if adam lanza made any such threats. The end, he apparently killed himself after killing so many others. What they say is the outcome in cases like this one. They know when they go they with going to guy at the scene in the hanth ohe police or they kill themselves. Police know in horrifying detail what happened in the school but they don't know what happened inside the damaged mind and broken soul of adam lanza. 16View CommentsABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSshows:GMAGMA LIVE!GMA Recipes GMA Concert SeriesWorld NewsWorld News with David MuirNightline20/20Most Fascinating People Primetime NightlineDiane Sawyer SpecialsPrimetimeThis WeekWhat Would You Do?World News NowABC News NowPlaylist:20/20: 12/14/1220/20: 12/7/1220/20: 11/30/1220/20: 11/23/12The Real Dish on Restaurants20/20: 10/14/1105/29/09: Etan Patz20/20 Reports20/20 WebcastsHome > Video > 20/20 > 20/20: 12/14/12Watch the Full Episode'20/20' 12/14: Tragedy at the Elementary School: What Happened in Newtown, Conn.Tragedy at the Elementary School; Fallen Teacher's Story; Why Did Adam Lanza Snap?Tragedy at the Elementary School: What Happened in Newtown, Conn.Tragedy at the Elementary School: What Happened in Newtown, Conn.Part 1: The gunman, the hero teacher and other details of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.Why Did Adam Lanza Snap?Why Did Adam Lanza Snap?Part 2: Shooter was "a little bit different - kind of repressed."Tragedy at the Elementary School: Fallen Teacher's StoryTragedy at the Elementary School: Fallen Teacher's StoryPart 3: Teacher Vicki Soto's cousin tells ABC News' Chris Cuomo about her dedication to the end.Tragedy at the Elementary School: SurgeonsTragedy at the Elementary School: SurgeonsPart 4: As surgeons at Danbury Hospital treated the injured, they wondered why more weren't coming.Tragedy at the Elementary School: Clergy Help HealTragedy at the Elementary School: Clergy Help HealPart 5: Members of the clergy help to explain and help town recover after shootings.Tragedy at the Elementary School: Extraordinary SchoolTragedy at the Elementary School: Extraordinary SchoolPart 6: Before today, Sandy Hook Elementary was notable for all the right reasons.Tragedy at the Elementary School: Loss of InnocenceTragedy at the Elementary School: Loss of InnocencePart 7: Adam Lanza's bullets burst open the normally innocent world of children.Tragedy at the Elementary School: Social Media ReactsTragedy at the Elementary School: Social Media ReactsPart 8: Deborah Roberts looks at people's reactions online to the shooting.1 of 1External links are provided for reference purposes.
