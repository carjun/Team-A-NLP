Then again maybe I'm being too kind, perhaps blaming video games was inevitable. permalinksavecontextfull commentsA bunch of people on FB shared a vid of the GTA4 swingset glitch uploaded by the wrongly accused brother of the Connecticut shooter.

The guy uploaded a video of him and his friend playing with the glitch to his Facebook.Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN58iDVmL6YI'd also like to add that because Mass Effect was visible on his profile, the Mass Effect Facebook page was bombarded with all kinds of hateful comments from stupid uninformed people. If anyone by any chance has a screenshot of those comments I'd love to see them since they were taken down pretty quickly.permalinksavecontextfull comments491011A bunch of people on FB shared a vid of the GTA4 swingset glitch uploaded by the wrongly accused brother of the Connecticut shooter.

It has some repeats and remixes of songs from P4 but the originals are amazing.Yukiko's Theme for example.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is a good game for my wife and I to play together?  by  scirn308in  gaming[+]lolpancakeslol 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]lolpancakeslol 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours agoI second this. My fiancee and I played through this game together, twice. Playing with 2 makes the game slightly easier since you can bring each other back to life but it's still a good challenge. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat game are you most excited about for 2013?  by  lebigmermin  gaming[+]lolpancakeslol 4 points5 points6 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]lolpancakeslol 4 points5 points6 points 10 hours agoGTA5.

It was probably a move forced onto them by their Publisher, you think they don't fucking know that their fans hate that shit? Of course they do. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI feel like the Vita is receiving an unfair reputation. As a small time media creator, how do I draw people to the Vita?  by  BlueMaximain  Games[+]lolpancakeslol 4 points5 points6 points 10 hours ago*(0 children)[]lolpancakeslol 4 points5 points6 points 10 hours ago*Half the games for the handheld are either ports of older games or existing titles on other consoles. Where are the big killer apps for the PS Vita? Last I checked Black Ops and Assassins Creed were duds not even worth mentioning. You said people should have focused on Black Ops' multiplayer? Why? I could pop in Black Ops 2 on my 360 and play it immediately with a ton of people I know but I'm sure in some mystical land somewhere there exists a group of 8 friends who all own a PS Vita and Black Ops.There may be games but there certainly aren't any games that make you say "OMG I MUST GO OUT AND BUY A PS VITA!" I own a touch device, 2 consoles, an excellent gaming PC, a DS and a PSP. There is no room for a PS Vita for someone like me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat feature are you most wanting to appear in GTA V?  by  SuperMediumManin  Games[+]lolpancakeslol 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]lolpancakeslol 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours agoSome kind of same screen co-op.

We already played D2 for countless hours, I don't think anything else can come close to replicating that kind of magic. I tried Torchlight 2 and I got bored of it just as quickly which is what clued me in on this.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI feel like the Vita is receiving an unfair reputation.

But that doesn't mean shit unless you have the games to support it. Therein lies the problem, where are the games? permalinksavecontextfull commentsEnd of 2012 Discussions - Best platformer games  by  GamingBotin  Games[+]lolpancakeslol 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]lolpancakeslol 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoThey Bleed Pixels. Out of all the platformers I've played this year nothing felt quite as tight as this game did. I always felt like I was in 100% control of my character which is crucial for these kinds of games.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEnd of 2012 Discussions - Best platformer games  by  GamingBotin  Games[+]lolpancakeslol 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]lolpancakeslol 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoI'm tired of the music more than the graphical style.

When I played it with a gamepad I found myself dying more because I was fighting the controls instead of the game.I don't know what the problem is but I'm certainly not alone. I got 100% in SMB, beat Dark Souls and I'm one of those wackos who fights every boss in Blaster Master using only the grenades so my skills aren't the issue.permalinksavecontextfull commentsApologists step aside, there is no more excuses. 7 months later, Diablo 3 still hasn't released PvP.  by  Doomextremein  Games[+]lolpancakeslol 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]lolpancakeslol 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours agoI would trade PVP entirely if they'd fix the damn itemization. A few interesting legendaries doesn't make for an interesting game. It's supposed to be about the loot, why then does the loot suck?permalinksavecontextfull commentsMob mentality at its finest.
