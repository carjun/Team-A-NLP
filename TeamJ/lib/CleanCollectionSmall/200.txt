Journal News)Story HighlightsSchool districts in New York advise teachers to be aware of students' concernsBy law, every school in New York must have an emergency plan in placeSome schools plan to increase police patrols in wake of Connecticut shootingWESTCHESTER, N.Y.  Schools in the Lower Hudson Valley in New York are working to find a balance between frightening children with worries about their safety and being ready to offer comfort for the nervous.Parents, too, are walking a fine line between worries and confidence in their schools to handle a disaster like Friday's mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where a gunman killed 20 young students and six adults."Like many districts, we have emailed the parents about talking to the kids," said Brian Monahan, interim superintendent for Hendrick Hudson schools. "I have gotten a number of emails from parents. Nobody exactly knows what to do. I feel like we need to go back to doing what we do. Certainly, people will be aware, our faculty will be extra vigilant. But having the kids back in school is probably the right thing to do."New York State Education Commissioner John King sent an email to superintendents Friday advising school leaders to be alert for students or staff who might be struggling in the aftermath of the national tragedy."It is important in the coming days and weeks to listen to your students' concerns and reassure them when they ask questions, and encourage parents to do the same," King wrote. " I trust your judgment and wisdom to lead your staff and students through this difficult time."Across Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties, school administrators are calling on their professionals  counselors, social workers, psychologists  to stand ready to help if student or staff need to talk about the horror of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School."Over the next several days, there will be many questions relating to both the anxiety that may occur for children and for their parents," said a letter sent to Blind Brook community members by schools Superintendent William J. Stark. Every school in New York by law must have an emergency plan in place that spells out what needs to be done by everyone during an assault like the one that took place in Newtown. Most districts planned to review those procedures this week. Mount Vernon schools, for instance, does not have a formal no trespassing policy, and that needs to be addressed, said schools Superintendent Judith Johnson.MORE: Former school is prepped for Sandy Hook pupilsThe training and response by the staff at Sandy Hook Elementary got high marks by security professional Felix Carcano, chief executive  of the Paladin Center in Carmel, N.Y. The center trains professionals and laypeople on safety and security procedures."As a parent, you are always concerned," Carcano, the father of sons aged 6, 9 and 12, said. Making children safe, he said, needs more than just a plan. It needs strong communication between the different people who work in a school, from the custodians to the principal, and local law enforcement and emergency personnel.He also said that children and staff are safer if the details of the plan and the immediate rescue efforts remain unspecific to keep copycats from learning how to circumvent the safety measures. He faulted the media and some of his own safety professionals who he said  gave away too many details on the ways that children were saved from harm  Friday.John Carbone, a parent with children in the Nyack, N.Y., schools, said he felt comfortable with his district's response to the tragedy. Administrators sent out an email saying that counselors would be available when needed. He said he wasn't worried about sending his children to school Monday, adding, "we can't protect them forever."Some schools have asked for an extra police presence Monday and some police departments said they would be sending more cars to school neighborhoods to assure parents and community members that the children are being protected. Again, the idea is to comfort, not frighten, police said.North Salem schools was one of the districts to  ask for an increased police presence, said schools Superintendent Kenneth Freeston. "From what we now know, it is clear that familiarity with lockdown protocols saved lives in Newtown," he said in an email to residents.He said he had a special connection to the tragedy since he has lived in Newtown since 1988 and his now 25-year-old son attended the Newtown schools for 13 years.  Freeston was the assistant superintendent in the Newtown schools for several years."Mary Johnson started her career as a first-grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School," he said in the email. "With our closeness to the town and this terrible tragedy and with our experienced staff and administrators, we are able to apply a deep personal understanding of the effects of tragedies on young lives. We will be ready to support individual students who are having a particularly difficult time."Contributing: Jessica Bakeman of Gannett's Albany bureau.More Stories:            {                "assetid": "1774039",                "aws": "news/national",                "aws_id": "news_national",                "blogname": "",                "contenttype": "story pages ",                 "seotitle": "Security-ny-schools-connecticut-shooting",                "seotitletag": "Neighboring region's schools address security concerns",                "ssts": "news/nation",                "taxonomykeywords":"Hudson,Mount Vernon,Albany,Salem,Mount Vernon,Hudson,Albany,Mount Vernon,New York,Salem,Albany,Salem,Salem",                "templatename": "stories/default",                "topic":"hudson,mount-vernon,albany,salem,mount-vernon,hudson,albany,mount-vernon,new-york,salem,albany,salem,salem",                "videoincluded":"no",                "basePageType":"story"            }        Comment Join the Nation's ConversationTo find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQsShare                             Neighboring region's schools address security concerns                        ShareEmailPost to FacebookOr share on: TwitterGoogle+LinkedInNeighboring region's schools address security concerns on USAToday.com: http://usat.ly/RyPyibCancelSendPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
