No one gives a shit right now about your politics. I'm very, very political (if you must know what side, my comment history in the subs I frequent will tell you) on this issue and I'm not going to say a word about it. Why? Because I've seen people after such incidents crying, in real pain, and I know that they don't want to talk about politics right now. Give it 3 fucking days before you start saying what would have prevented this tragedy. 3 days, that's it, then we can duke out politics. For now, let people grieve, and shut the fuck up.I just wish I could tell this to the news media as well, but oh well.edit: yes, I realize 3 days is a completely arbitrary number and may be excessive to some. I was just throwing out a number. My only point was that you should give the families and the town to grieve, and your first thought when something tragic happens shouldn't be political, but rather it should be respect and empathy. permalinksave[+]WoohooOvertime 28 points29 points30 points 23 minutes ago (4 children)[]WoohooOvertime 28 points29 points30 points 23 minutes agohttp://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-december-10-2012/any-given-gun-day---bob-costas---fox-newsI suggest you watch this and consider an alternate point of view.For those who don't wish to watch, the point Stewart makes here is that someone in the US dies from gun related violence every single day. When, then, is it appropriate to finally have a political talk about guns? Three days from today, someone in a ghetto neighborhood is probably going to get shot up and die. By the arbitrary standards you've imposed here on when people can actually speak about gun control, is that person's life somehow worth less than those of the people lost in this tragedy?permalinksaveparent[+]merper -1 points0 points1 point 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]merper -1 points0 points1 point 8 minutes agoThree days from todayYou misspelled hours. permalinksaveparent[+]OHhokie1 -3 points-2 points-1 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 -3 points-2 points-1 points 13 minutes agoI think we can all agree that the trauma endured by the literally thousands of people immediately connected to this tragedy is a little different than a ganbanger in east LA getting shot. Tragedies of this scale happen very rarely, though still too much, and these tragedies are the ones I'm referring to, not every single shooting.Of course, don't take this to mean that every shooting is not tragic, but frankly, some tragic things are more tragic than others, and this is up there with Virginia Tech, Columbine, and the Aurora shootings as a tragic event that will literally traumatize an entire community. permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoI agree that our discussing gun control doesn't take away from also feel compassion for the victims. It is not as if we are calling up the families to get their statements. Of course our hearts go out to them. I disagree that we should let idiots in the ghetto determine what law abiding citizens do. I also feel sickos will find a way to harm others if they really wanted to. permalinksaveparent[+]dusters -2 points-1 points0 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]dusters -2 points-1 points0 points 3 minutes agoExcept your point is irrelevant. People are going to get guns whether or not they are illegal. Even if they cannot, then they will simply resort to explosives.permalinksaveparent[+]Liebhaben 11 points12 points13 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]Liebhaben 11 points12 points13 points 23 minutes agofucking no. when things happen you talk about them, you don't cast them to the side. We solve our problems, not cry that they happened because if we don't solve them, we'll keep on crying.(and by time everyone is done crying they forget and the cycle repeats).permalinksaveparent[+]glass_daggers 2 points3 points4 points 22 minutes ago (0 children)[]glass_daggers 2 points3 points4 points 22 minutes agoThere are 100 gun-related deaths in the country every day, we will never be 3 days removed from the fucking tragedy.permalinksaveparent[+]octowussy 1 point2 points3 points 22 minutes ago (0 children)[]octowussy 1 point2 points3 points 22 minutes agoWell said. There's a time and a place for real discussion (though those discussions never go anywhere), and this is most definitely not it.permalinksaveparent[+]xfcanadian 1 point2 points3 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]xfcanadian 1 point2 points3 points 21 minutes agoNo offense but anytime anything about gun control is brought up, you just get a lot of Americans screaming about freedom And nothing is ever done.  Although the violent crime rate is going down, it is still really high for a first world country. Even bringing health care and helping the poor would help, it isn't all about guns. permalinksaveparent[+]drivers9001 0 points1 point2 points 20 minutes ago (1 child)[]drivers9001 0 points1 point2 points 20 minutes agoYou're the first person I see bringing up the subject.permalinksaveparent[+]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes agoit's all over this thread and is the top comment in /r/worldnews. permalinksaveparent[+]frocarter 1 point2 points3 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]frocarter 1 point2 points3 points 15 minutes agoIt's not about politics, it's about caring that innocent people die.permalinksaveparent[+]LCDDFA 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]LCDDFA 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoWhat sucks is that the news media knows this. They KNOW they're being fucked up interviewing the kids like this and they know revealing all the information about the shooters is fucked and out of line but people (unfortunately I can't say I won't read it myself) are going to read it no matter how fucked up it is. I have faith that a lot of good people will come together and try and make the best of this unspeakable tragedy but it's beyond fucked no matter what happens nowpermalinksaveparent[+]i_donno 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]i_donno 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoIf that many people died from a defective elevator we'd be talking about elevator control.  eg inspections, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]CaesarBritannicus 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]CaesarBritannicus 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoIt's not about trumpeting "my politics", it's about the well-being of society. It's not like I get a fucking badge and hat if my political position prevails. What better time to talk about making a better society than when we see the worst of what we have? permalinksaveparent[+]lazydictionary 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (1 child)[]lazydictionary 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes agoWe didn't have this conversation after Aurora, or Oregon, or Wisconsin, or VT. When do we have it? These stories slip everyone's minds in a week or two. If not now, then never.permalinksaveparent[+]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoWe didn't have this conversation after Aurora, or Oregon, or Wisconsin, or VT.Are you serious? We most certainly had the conversation after every one of those shootings. Perhaps Congress didn't (there were bills debated after VT, at least), if that's what you mean, but the news certainly did.permalinksaveparent[+]CodeineBourbon 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]CodeineBourbon 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoNo. Now.If we'd had it, properly, after virginia tech.  When emotions were high enough, when people cared enough that something might have been done before gun advocates rallied, then maybe, do you think, these assholes wouldn't have been able to do what they did.permalinksaveparent[+]ninti 0 points1 point2 points 37 seconds ago (0 children)[]ninti 0 points1 point2 points 37 seconds agoFuck that. I am angry right now. Fucking angry as hell. Fuck the pro-gun killer supporters. This crime, like so many others, is on their fucking hands. 27 deaths, because of them. As a parent in this fucking brain-dead country, I have to worry about this, I have to see fellow parents crying over their children, I have to feel their pain in some part. Because of fucking guns and the fucking assholes who don't seem to give a shit about the hell they have inflicted because of their fucking mental disease of gun obsession. Fuck them.permalinksaveparent[+]djork 0 points1 point2 points 35 seconds ago (0 children)[]djork 0 points1 point2 points 35 seconds agoHow about this: can we put politics aside, and recognize BOTH the fact that 27 people are dead specifically from bullets delivered with fast-firing semi-automatic guns with large replaceable clips, carried by someone who probably obtained them easily and completely legally.If those facts upset people, then maybe there's a reason for the cognitive dissonance.permalinksaveparent[+]Requi3m 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes ago (9 children)[]Requi3m 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes agoNo one gives a shit right now about your politics.Well I care and I think it's a great time to discuss politics, because those 27 people are dead as a direct result of the laws of our government. If staff members were allowed to carry firearms this could have been stopped a lot sooner.If they don't want to talk politics they can stay out of this thread. You should know by now nothing is ever "too soon" on the internet.permalinksaveparent[+]PacoBedejo 3 points4 points5 points 12 minutes ago*(1 child)[]PacoBedejo 3 points4 points5 points 12 minutes ago*those 27 people are dead as a direct result of the laws of our Connecticut's government.I just wanted to clarify that in all cases within the US, gun-free school zones are a creation of state governments, as the federal government has no such law.permalinksaveparent[+]Hovsky 2 points3 points4 points 9 minutes ago (0 children)[]Hovsky 2 points3 points4 points 9 minutes agoAnymore.

This is why this isn't the time for a political discussion. Nobody is thinking straight because there's just been a tragedy, people are grieving, details are still unknown, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]OHhokie1 2 points3 points4 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]OHhokie1 2 points3 points4 points 11 minutes agoIt also could have been stopped if there was a police officer stationed at the school. Not every factor in preventing a shooting is related to gun control. Regardless, it's just too soon to get into politics. permalinksaveparent[+]holzy444 3 points4 points5 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]holzy444 3 points4 points5 points 15 minutes agoYeah because criminals follow the law. permalinksaveparent[+]hoopstick 2 points3 points4 points 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]hoopstick 2 points3 points4 points 19 minutes agoIf you want to talk politics, do it in /r/politics.

To me it just says, "I don't give a damn that these people are dead, I want to talk about how my politics were right and your's were wrong."The 3 days were arbitrary, and perhaps too long, but I'm just saying to the people in this thread now that are already bickering over this: just chill the fuck out for a bit.permalinksaveparent[+]watitdo 3 points4 points5 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]watitdo 3 points4 points5 points 11 minutes agoHow the fuck can you say that people don't care that people are dead?
