It is terrible, incomprehensible but Im going to tell you something  as we sit here at this very moment, you know it and I know it  there are liberals trying to find a way to blame this on conservatives or Republicans, Limbaugh told his audience.  As examples of past instances when such partisan blame game took place, Limbaugh named Hurricane Katrina, shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords as well as the shooting in Aurora this past summer. It may sound a little hard edged to say it, but Im telling you, there are elements of the mainstream media who are doing everything they can with their number one objective is to see if theres anything they can blame on conservative media or Republican policies or the Second Amendment, he added.

All the petitions had at least 200 signatures as of 4:30 p.m. EST, and one had garnered more than 5,000.The first petition called on the Obama administration to immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress, requesting legislation to change the way citizens obtain guns.Other topics focused primarily on starting a conversation about gun control. One request called for mental health to be declared a national emergency to prevent future shooting such as todays issue at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. and the shooting earlier this year at a movie theater in Aurora Colo.The mental health petition also said gun control needed to be discussed.One petition read:We ask that President Obama form a commission of appointed citizens to explore meaningful steps we as a nation can take to control and reduce gun violence. The commission would have a time limit to develop recommendations that would be forwarded to Congress for review and action.The petitions each have one month to accumulate 25,000 digital signatures in order to garner a formal response from the White House.Posted By: kyle.campbell@chron.com (Kyle Campbell)(Email) |Dec 14 at 1:29 pmListed Under: Congress, Connecticut, Obama, Sandy Hook elementary school, crime and punishment, gun control, shooting | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentMassacre reaction: Tearful Obama says nations hearts are broken; some Democrats push for gun controlComments|E-mail| Print[View the story "Reaction to the Connecticut school massacre" on Storify]Posted By: richard.dunham@chron.com (Richard Dunham)(Email) |Dec 14 at 12:40 pmListed Under: crime and punishment | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentLatest updates from the deadly shooting in Newtown, Connecticut (Updated)Comments|E-mail| Print[View the story "Images from the deadly shooting in Newtown, Connecticut" on Storify]Posted By: jana.kasperka@chron.com (Jana Kasperkevic)(Email) |Dec 14 at 12:24 pmListed Under: Connecticut, General, Newtown, Sandy Hook elementary school, gun control, shooting | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentThursday, December 13, 201211 ill-starred presidential picks, from Abe Fortas to Susan RiceComments|E-mail| PrintSusan Rice at the United Nations. (AP photo)Most presidential nominations to key government posts sail through the Senate with little debate and (occasionally these days) little delay.Not so with Susan Rice, President Obamas first choice to serve as Secretary of State in the presidents second term. Republicans had put Obama on notice that they would do everything they can  that means threatened filibuster  to block the United Nations ambassador from becoming the nations top diplomat. The proximate cause of their anger: Rices comments on Sunday TV shows about the Sept. 11 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya.Democratic loyalists have been outraged at what they consider the unfair attacks on an African American woman with impressive academic credentials.That debate will continue, but Rice wont be Secretary of State. She withdrew her name from consideration this afternoon.Rice joins a list of ill-starred presidential picks over the past half century. Some, like Rice, were never nominated. Some withdrew before Senate consideration. Others were rejected by the Senate.Rice joins this list of ten presidential choices who didnt end up with the job:Abe Fortas President Lyndon B. Johnsons choice to replace Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren was blocked by Republicans led by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond. Before the battle was over, Fortas had resigned his own court seat and the GOP ran out the clock on the Johnson administration, leaving new President Richard Nixon with a chance to shift the court to the right.G. Harrold Carswell and Clement Haynsworth.Nixons choice for Chief Justice, Warren Burger, won easy confirmation in 1969. But the Senate rejected two Nixon choices for the second high court vacancy: Clement Haynsworth of South Carolina and G. Harrold Carswell of Florida. Haynsworth was tarnished by accusations of being an unreconstructed segregationist and Carswell was accused of being both extreme and underqualified. Nebraska Republican Roman Hruska may have hammered the nail in Carswells political coffin when he defended him this way:Even if he were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, arent they, and a little chance? We cant have all Brandeises, Frankfurters and Cardozos.After the rejection of Haynsworth and Carswell, Nixon picked Minnesota judge Harry Blackmun, who was confirmed.Mildred LillieThe California appeals court judge might have become the first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Nixon in 1971 announced his intention to choose her to fill one of the vacancies created by the retirements of John Marshall Harlan and Hugo Black. But the American Bar Association deemed her unqualified. Nixon relented and nominated William Rehnquist (whom he once referred to as Renchberg) and Lewis Powell instead. Lillie, a Democrat, served as an appellate judge for 44 years until her death at age 87 in 2002.Robert BorkThe federal appeals court judge became a verb (to be borked) when President Reagan chose him for the Supreme Court in 1987. Liberal Democrat Ted Kennedy led the opposition, roaring these incendiary words:Robert Borks America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary isand is often the onlyprotector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.Bork was rejected by the Senate, 58-42.Douglas GinsburgReagans first choice to follow Bork was federal appellate Judge Anthony Kennedy of California, but Republican Sen. Jesse Helms threatened a filibuster to prevent the liberal Republican from reaching the Supreme Court. Not eager for a fight with the prominent conservative lawmaker, Reagan opted instead for former Harvard law professor and then-judge Douglas Ginsburg, saying Ginsburgs confirmation was vitally important to the fight against crime. Nine days later, Ginsburg asked Reagan to withdraw after admitting that he had violated the law by smoking pot. I have today asked President Reagan not to forward my nomination to the Supreme Court, a shell-shocked Ginsburg told reporters. Reagan then chose Kennedy for the high court.Zoe Baird and Kimba WoodBill Clintons first choice for Attorney General was withdrawn after Baird acknowledged she had failed to pay federal withholding taxes for a nanny who was in the U.S. illegally. The new presidents next pick, New York federal judge Kimba Wood, paid the required taxes on her nanny and broke no law  but the controversy over her employment of an illegal immigrant led to her withdrawal. Nannygate changed the vetting process for a generation of presidential nominees. Clinton eventually chose Janet Reno, a Florida prosecutor who never married and had no children.John BoltonThe fight over the feisty neo-conservatives nomination to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations was messy and prolonged. Bush picked Bolton, one of the architects of the Iraq War, in the spring of 2005, but Senate Democrats blocked his confirmation. Bush refused to back down and gave Bolton the job temporarily as a recess appointee. Boltons confirmation hopes were dashed by the 2006 midterm election setbacks suffered by Republicans. He eventually withdrew as a nominee.Harriet MiersGeorge W. Bushs White House counsel, his former personal lawyer and a close friend, was the victim of friendly fire. While Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid hailed her nomination, conservative Republicans said she was unqualified for the high court. Under heavy pressure from his partys right, Bush withdrew the Texas lawyers nomination. Her replacement was Samuel Alito, who has become a reliable conservative vote on the high court.Posted By: richard.dunham@chron.com (Richard Dunham)(Email) |Dec 13 at 2:18 pmListed Under: Abe Fortas, Clement Haynsworth, Douglas Ginsburg, Foreign policy, G.

Barbara Lee blames radical right on sinking Susan RiceComments|E-mail| PrintReaction is rolling in to UN Ambassador Susan Rice withdrawing her name from consideration for Secretary of State  and East Bay Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, for one, is ticked:I am profoundly  disappointed that Ambassador Rice, such a well qualified woman of color, would be denied the opportunity to become our next Secretary of State due to the baseless  and manufactured allegations of  the radical right.I have known and worked closely with Ambassador Susan Rice for many yearson many global issues.  From the genocide in Sudan to the ongoing violence in Syria, the humanitarian crisis in Haiti and the global HIV/AIDS crisis.  Ambassador Rice works each and every day to advance the highest ideals of our country and would have been an outstanding Secretary of State.Rep. Karen Bass, D-LA, said it is unfortunate Ambassador Rice had to make this decision in the face of such unfounded and unfair character attacks.  If judged fairly based solely on her qualifications for the job, she wouldve made an extraordinary Secretary of State.    Heres what Rice told NBCs Brian Williams tonight. (You can check out the complete interview at 10 p.m. Thursday on Rock Center with Brian Williams.)  Short answer: She felt like she was becoming a distraction to the Administrations priorities: Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyHeres the text of what Rice told Bri:Today, I made the decision that it was the best thing for our country, for the American people, that I not continue to be considered by the President for nomination of Secretary of State.  I didnt want to see a confirmation process that was very prolonged, very politicized, very distracting, and very disruptive because there are so many things we need to get done as a country, and the first several months of a second term presidents agenda is really the opportunity to get the crucial things done.  Were talking about comprehensive immigration reform, balanced deficit reduction, job creation  thats what matters.  And to the extent that my nomination could have delayed or distracted or deflected, or maybe even some of these priorities impossible to achieve, I didnt want that, and I much prefer to keep doing what Im doing which is a job I love at the United Nations.Heres President Obamas statement: Today, I spoke to Ambassador Susan Rice, and accepted her decision to remove her name from consideration for Secretary of State. For two decades, Susan has proven to be an extraordinarily capable, patriotic, and passionate public servant. As my Ambassador to the United Nations, she plays an indispensable role in advancing Americas interests. Already, she has secured international support for sanctions against Iran and North Korea, worked to protect the people of Libya, helped achieve an independent South Sudan, stood up for Israels security and legitimacy, and served as an advocate for UN reform and the human rights of all people. I am grateful that Susan will continue to serve as our Ambassador at the United Nations and a key member of my cabinet and national security team, carrying her work forward on all of these and other issues. I have every confidence that Susan has limitless capability to serve our country now and in the years to come, and know that I will continue to rely on her as an advisor and friend. While I deeply regret the unfair and misleading attacks on Susan Rice in recent weeks, her decision demonstrates the strength of her character, and an admirable commitment to rise above the politics of the moment to put our national interests first. The American people can be proud to have a public servant of her caliber and character representing our country.

Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, celebrated triumph Thursday as her Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act or CALM Act, took effect as of midnight, Her four-year crusade to enact the law banning loud commercials on TV began when she introduced the bill in 2008. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) led passage in the Senate. The law requires broadcast, cable, satellite and other video providers to hold the volume of commercials at the same level as regular TV programming. The Federal Communications Commission warns that it uses averages, so some commercials may still sound too loud. The agency said it will rely on consumers filing complaints to enforce the rules.Earsplitting television ads have jolted and annoyed viewers for decades, Eshoo said in a statement. With this new law, loud TV commercials that make consumers run for the mute button or change the channel altogether will be a thing of the past.Whitehouse said, While this is a small issue compared to the big challenges facing our nation, it is an unnecessary annoyance in the daily lives of many Americans, and Im glad to have done something about it.The law has the support of the National Association of Broadcasters. NAB chief Gordon Smith, former GOP Senator from Oregon (there is a good life after the Senate). Michael Powell (remember him?), head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association called the new law sensible and promised to continue to work closely with the FCC and the entire TV ecosystem to prevent loud commercials from being a disruption.Eshoos office said loud commercials have been a top consumer complaint to the FCC for decades and were listed as such in 21 of the FCCs 25 quarterly reports between 2002 and 2009. According to a 2009 Harris poll, almost 90 percent of TV viewers are bothered by high commercial volumes, prompting 41 percent of viewers to turn down the volume, 22 percent to mute the TV, and 17 percent to change the channel altogether. Prior to Eshoos legislation, the official FCC policy recommended that consumers mute commercials if they found them to be excessively strident.The CALM Act passed the Senate unanimously in 2010 and passed in the House passed in December 2010. Obama signed it into law that month, and the FCC took a year to issue a final rule last year, and gave the industry another year to implement them.

Mitt took home the hardware for his statement that Barack Obama sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China at the cost of American jobs, say the nonpartisan factcheckers at Politifact. They continue: It was a lie told in the critical state of Ohio in the final days of a close campaign  that Jeep was moving its U.S. production to China. It originated with a conservative blogger, who twisted an accurate news story into a falsehood. Then it picked up steam when the Drudge Report ran with it. Even though Jeeps parent company gave a quick and clear denial, Mitt Romney repeated it and his campaign turned it into a TV ad.And they stood by the claim, even as the media and the public expressed collective outrage against something so obviously false.People often say that politicians dont pay a price for deception, but this time was different: A flood of negative press coverage rained down on the Romney campaign, and he failed to turn the tide in Ohio, the most important state in the presidential election.Not only did Team Romney not back off the Lie, his turned it into a TV commercial: His lie is embarrassing, frankly, and it should be unsettling for the rest of the world,MSNBCs Rachel Maddow said after the Lie of the Year rolled out. Imagine Romney waking up in the Lincoln bedroom or whatever, checking his conservative Twitter feed and running with whatever he finds there.Posted By: jgarofoli@sfchronicle.com (Joe Garofoli)(Email) |Dec 12 at 5:32 pmListed Under: China, Chrysler, Jeep, Media and Politics, Mitt Romney, Presidential Election 2012 | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentPage 1 of 54012345102030...Last Politics BlogContact | AboutWelcome to the Politics blog.By Wyatt Buchanan, Michael Collier, Richard Dunham, Bob Egelko, Joe  Garofoli, Marisa Lagos, Carolyn Lochhead, Carla Marinucci, Read Biosadvertisement|your ad here RECENT ENTRIES Rush Limbaugh: Liberals already hatching a plan to blame Newtown shooting on conservatives, RepublicansThousands immediately petition White House to address gun control, mental healthMassacre reaction: Tearful Obama says nations hearts are broken; some Democrats push for gun controlLatest updates from the deadly shooting in Newtown, Connecticut (Updated)11 ill-starred presidential picks, from Abe Fortas to Susan RiceRep.
