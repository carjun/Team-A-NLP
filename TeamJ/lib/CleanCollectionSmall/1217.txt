Governments sometimes have to make some very difficult decisions," he said.He also said: "I think it's important that if we do have a referendum on our future with Europe it's got to be on the basis of not trying to outsmart UKIP or trying to ensure that we can bring the whole conservative party in one - it should be in the national interest." @YahooNewsUK on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook  Best of Yahoo!

Both are wasting billions that is needed for us, not some corrupt government in another country. To me this AID giveaway is a big scam. I am 50 now and as long as i remember they have had there hand out for money year in year out. The Charities that do good work yes, but the CEOs and bosses are all on the take. 90% or more of the money will NEVER get to the poorest people.       ........ We need a change from the same LIES, of one party to another set of LIES to the next.... I said less than a two months ago Lib/Dems were done. I said that the Tories will be second but that UKIP will be close in third. That one day they would win. that time is coming quicker than i thought.... Will Labour listen to the people ? Will the Tories listen ? Both will say they have, but both will be LYING.... You decide what party you want in.... The same... Or a change in the way the UK is heading.v1/comments/context/19b581e2-89af-3e1f-8787-e4bdbd8f50d0/comment/1355638863834-3fee7dd9-e208-4398-a91f-dc681f982edfGeoff14 hours agoI'm not at all suprised, this coalition's government style reminds me of the old story, What's a camel ?  a horse designed by a committee. I can and did foresee the rise of UKIP, if they, unlike the other parties, stick to their manifesto once in office they be in power for at least 2 terms.

The people of this country are sick and tired of listening to excuses about why we should remain in the 'Euro-communist' state.  We gave up most of our Commonwealth ties to join this rubbish, it's now time to return to those days.  It'll be tough at first as we lose some of our European customers, but it'll be worth it once the old links are re-established.v1/comments/context/19b581e2-89af-3e1f-8787-e4bdbd8f50d0/comment/1355638478808-88305d0f-bcb2-4ed3-8dff-63eea57f30feDADDYofYahooComments14 hours agoEu the biggest toilet, for money the Brit isles has ever known OUT OUT OUT!v1/comments/context/19b581e2-89af-3e1f-8787-e4bdbd8f50d0/comment/1355638478808-88305d0f-bcb2-4ed3-8dff-63eea57f30fe/reply/00016I000000000000000000000000-b88bdafd-a025-4994-b86b-e6068700ce5eCallan8 hours agoLol, DOYC is on nearly four hundred thumbs up, DB is doing well for DB, he has four thumbs up.

Any party that addresses these issues will sweep into power. Include education and welfare issues and stay in power for the foreseeable future.

We want to see a return to British values and have our identity back . We dont want a new multi-racial identity that Milliband bangs on about . Immigration must kept at the absolute minimum. We need to fulfill skill shortages through selective immigration , although that must be addressed internally through education .

Now that it has sunk in that whites are now officially a minority in the capital, and racial discrimination against white people is legal and encouraged, and Christianity is looked at with contempt in favour of muslims  ( i could go on and on). It can only get worse for us. How anyone could even consider voting for Labour is ridiculous. Blair the treacherous patronizing closet capitalist started all this, and Milliband would continue with it.  MorePost a commentYOU ON YAHOO!
