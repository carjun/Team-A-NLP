Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Softice4 11 points12 points13 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Softice4 11 points12 points13 points 19 hours ago[Updated at 6:51 p.m. ET] A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation says the three guns found at the shooting site were legally purchased by Nancy Lanza, the mother of the suspect in the shooting.According to the law enforcement official, the Glock and Sig Sauer handguns were found inside the school with the deceased gunman. The Bushmaster was found in a car outside the school. The official did not know if the car was registered to the gunman, to his mother or to someone else.The official echoed what other law enforcement officials have told CNN: That Adam Lanza was the suspected gunman, and that he died at the scene of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.
