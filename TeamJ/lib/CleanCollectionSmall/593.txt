Tomlin, 34, was the Minnesota Vikings' defensive coordinator in 2006 after spending the previous five seasons (2001-05) as defensive backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He replaced Cowher, who resigned after 15 seasons as the Steelers' head coach.  Prior to joining Tampa Bay, Tomlin spent two seasons as defensive backs coach at the University of Cincinnati (1999-00). Tomlin began his coaching career in 1995 as wide receivers coach at Virginia Military Institute. He coached defensive backs and special teams at Memphis in 1996, before moving on to Arkansas State, where he coached wide receivers in 1997 and defensive backs in 1998.  Under Tomlin's guidance, Minnesota led the NFL in stopping the run and ranked eighth in the league in total defense. At Tampa Bay, he helped the Buccaneers lead the NFL in pass defense in 2004 and rank third in 2003.  In 2002, Tomlin guided Tampa Bay's defensive backfield that led the NFL in pass defense and interceptions (31), while limiting opposing passers to a 48.4 rating and just 10 touchdowns en route to winning Super Bowl XXXVII. The Buccaneers ranked fifth in the NFL in pass defense and second in interceptions (28) in 2001, Tomlin's first season in Tampa Bay.  Born in Hampton, Va., Tomlin was a three-year starter at wide receiver for William & Mary and finished his playing career with 101 receptions for 2,053 yards and 20 touchdowns. He was a second-team All-Yankee Conference selection in 1994.
