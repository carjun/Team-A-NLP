At least 27 dead, 14 children.  by  EthicalReasoningin  politics[+]emskem 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]emskem 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoI can't do those drills without thinking about how fucked up it is. It's fine with the older kids but try explaining to a scared classroom 5-year-olds why you need to be veeeery veeeery quiet... Why someone they have never met would want to kill them... You just can't explain that. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom. At least 27 dead, 14 children.  by  EthicalReasoningin  politics[+]emskem 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]emskem 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoSome kids do panic and escape. It has served some well in the other shootings you can read about. That's the thing though-As a teacher, my responsibility is to ensure the safety of all students. I can't exactly keep a whole classroom of people safe and quietly escape the school. These procedures are designed to protect the most amount of people. What makes sense for one person, might not make sense for all. I hope you never have to find out exactly what you would do if your school was a part of a shooting. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom. At least 27 dead, 14 children.  by  EthicalReasoningin  politics[+]emskem 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]emskem 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoBecause a 5 year old is going to be terrified and some desks are going to visible from the windows, even the little window in the door. Better to bring all of them together, keep them calm and silent, accounted for and absolutely out of sight. I don't make the drills - I just run them and hope I never have to live it first hand. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

So you know the best spot without having to wonder about angles.

If the doors unlocked from someone trying the knob from the outside, you wouldn't have kids waiting for a classroom to be unlocked before class. You lock the door before you close it. The procedure has you pulling kids into the room, anyone in the hallway before you close that door anyways. It saved at least two children's lives who were being shot at in the hallway. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

If you have never been in lock down, this is exactly the proper procedure. You don't want to be out in the halls where the shooter has access, you want to close all the doors, stay away from the windows, stay quiet, low and controlled, so that there is no way a random shot will catch your child, no way to see the students from the door or windows.

I used to have a day of like, crying rage, and probably 9 more of being a touchy jerk and now I'm blue for a few days but she doesn't need to lure me with smarties around the house anymore. Us ladies over in /r/pcos /r/keto are pretty awesome :P Just saying. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWondering if any other lovely ladies feel the same way?  by  Copy_Thatin  actuallesbians[+]emskem 2 points3 points4 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]emskem 2 points3 points4 points 9 days agoHeya stranger! You just described my marriage. My wife is a fantastic, very patient and loving creature, which is great because my PCOS (hormone disorder) can turn me into a bit of a beast. She avoids me outright when I'm being wild, and this often means we take some time apart. Biologically, it can be hard to pin down exactly what is going on and a lot of you read (particularly by anyone who claims to be an evolutionary soci-biologist,) is going to be about assigning our values to what they ARE seeing biologically. So-Read with a grain of salt, always, and read it from people with a PhD beside their name, not a journalist who is writing about science. If you use google scholar, you'll get the actual articles. Because think about it-There isn't even a good biological explanation for how lesbianism works for many of us women. They have tracked down some genes that seem to correlate with male homosexuality, but so far I haven't seen much research towards women's homosexuality. The real question is-Is this a problem for your relationship? Are you looking for biology to validate or just explain? My wife and I both have hobbies we can indulge in together and separately, so it's easy for her at least to adapt to the changing landscape. It's nice to have some separateness to our lives. Also-Good luck on the insemination front! We join the TTC ranks soon as well. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTeacher denied position after permanent sub for 2 years. Teacher is heartbroken. Student response. Really cheer him up if this is shared.  by  ShoesForTractionin  news[+]emskem 2 points3 points4 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]emskem 2 points3 points4 points 9 days agoI'm trained as a teacher but this, this is exactly why I'm doing IT instead of teaching. It really doesn't matter what skill level you demonstrate in the classroom, hiring decisions often don't even take that into account. And they can't. The people who do the hiring, (the board to start and then the administration,) often look for who they can pay the least and teach the widest range of subjects. I miss teaching so hard. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHello, Progresspics.

It took less than a week for the dog to adapt and once the drugs were out of the system and the cone came off the dog went on like nothing happened.Dogs are fantastic at adapting.

However, a stern older lady doctor gave me some pretty great ways of looking at it. Lots of women have unexplained fertility issues and don't know about them before they try to have children. We (PCOS ladies) have a diagnosis and better than that, great, cheaply available treatments, (I'm looking at you clomid,) with some of the lowest rates of high risk multiples around, that we may not even ever have to access.Now is the time for action-learning and then deciding what works for you and your body. Charting is a good first step, figuring out if there IS a pattern to your period. Losing weight can be a another great stepping stone ( /r/keto ), as that has a huge impact on fertility for us. Learning about what medications work for you, and what ones you don't respond to. But you have time. You don't need to learn it today, you just need to know that the information, resources and sisters in arms (or in the case cysts) are out there ready to give advice and support. By the time you are ready to have a baby, you're going to further ahead than the women who blissfully think that they will go off the pill and get pregnant. You'll know yourself, your body, and how to treat it.And plenty of PCOS women have babies the old fashioned way-I'm a bonus baby that my mom was told she'd need to have drugs to have :) permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat do you call two lesbians on their periods?  by  deathbylifein  actuallesbians[+]emskem 4 points5 points6 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]emskem 4 points5 points6 points 15 days agoROCK HARD CONCRETE...
