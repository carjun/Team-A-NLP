Text SizePrintE-mailReprintsBy  Steve Vogel, Sari Horwitz and David A. Fahrenthold, Dec 15, 2012 01:00 AM ESTThe Washington Post NEWTOWN, Conn.--A shooting rampage in this small Connecticut town on Friday morning left 28 people dead, including 20 children killed inside their elementary school, authorities said.The dead included the suspected gunman, whom law enforcement sources identified as Adam Lanza, 20. Police said that Lanza first apparently killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, at the home they shared in Newtown. Then he drove in her car to Sandy Hook Elementary, the school at which Nancy Lanza taught kindergarten. Loading...CommentsWeigh InCorrections?Personal PostGallerySchool shooting in Newtown, Conn.:An official with knowledge of a shooting at a Connecticut elementary school says 27 people are dead, including 18 children.Updates from ConnecticutA look at the minute-by-minute updates as the shootings story unfolded: Confusion over suspected shooters identity; 20 children killed; Gun violence protest outside White House; President Obama  speaks on Newtown, Connecticut school shootingPresident Obama spoke at the White House,  wiping tears from his eyes as he addressed the mass shooting.I am ashamed to be an American Washington Post Staff LIVE BLOG | Todays shooting has elicited a flood of emotional tweets. Here are a few that stuck out.The worlds deadliest mass shootingsTIMELINE | Scroll through for information on some of the deadliest mass shootings around the world.In the car, authorities said, were three guns: a .223 caliber Bushmaster rifle and two pistols, a Sig Sauer and a Glock. At the school, authorities said, Adam Lanza shot and killed six adults  including the schools principal  and 20 children. They were shot in two different rooms of the school, police said.Police were called to the school after 9:35 a.m., and officers searched the classrooms for a shooter. When they found the gunman, however, he was dead by his own hand. No officer fired a shot.One other person was injured in the shooting, but survived.Fridays shooting became the second-deadliest in U.S. history, after the rampage that killed 32 students at the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, Va. It happened in a country that had grown darkly accustomed to public shootings: just five months before,  another gunman had killed 12 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in July.But the sheer scale of Fridays killing  and the nature of its victims, small children shot in the sanctuary of a school  deepened its horror, and unleashed a shaking kind of grief. President Obama, in one of his most emotional speeches as president, wiped away tears as he spoke about the shooting from the White Houses briefing room. Our hearts are broken today, Obama said. He promised meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, but did not say specifically what he might do.I know theres not a parent in America who doesnt feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between five and 10 years old, Obama paused, seemingly unable to continue for a few moments. They had their entire lives ahead of them  birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.Dorothy Hanson, who is the suspects grandmother and Nancy Lanzas mother, said in a brief phone interview Friday that she could not fathom the violence that ended their lives.I just cant cope with it right now, Hanson said through tears. She was my daughter, and a beautiful girl and I loved her. I just cant make any more comments than that right now.Among the dead was the schools principal, Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, according to law enforcement sources. Press reports said Hochsprung had been the schools principal since 2010, and had been a schools administrator for 12 years before that. Local news organizations reported that she was married, with two daughters and three stepdaughters.She was always enthusiastic, always smiling, always game to do anything, said Kristin Larson, a former secretary of the schools Parent-Teacher Association. In a phone interview, Larson choked up as she recalled Hochsprung hugging students at the start of the school year. She wanted them to do well in school, Larson said, but she also wanted them to have fun.Continued123Next PageEmailTumblrRedditStumbleuponDiggDeliciousDiscussion Policy | FAQ | About DiscussionsLoading...CommentsAdd your commentRead what others are sayingAbout BadgesSuperFan BadgeSuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.More about badges | Request a badgeCulture Connoisseur BadgeCulture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.More about badges | Request a badgeFact Checker BadgeFact Checkers contribute questions, information and facts to The Fact Checker.More about badges | Request a badgeWashingtologist BadgeWashingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.More about badges | Request a badgePost Writer BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.Post Forum BadgePost Forum members consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on politics, national and international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgeWeather Watcher BadgeWeather Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on climates and forecasts.More about badges | Request a badgeWorld Watcher BadgeWorld Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgePost Contributor BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post contributor.
