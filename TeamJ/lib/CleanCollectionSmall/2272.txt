Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 59 minutes agoThat's kinda the point I was trying to make, while 9/11 was significant, but distant. We, the students, were not focused on the lessons presented to us after that news had been delivered. I can only imagine how a hometown tragedy such as this has captured everyone in the town. I also understand the need to keep children there if parents are unavailable to get their kids from school, I guess the "return to normalcy" is the intended effect there.permalinksavecontextfull commentsArian Foster trying to avoid Rob Parker criticisms  by  thetwaddlerin  nfl[+]greatbawlsofire 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoDoes anyone else find irony in the most insightful comment about the Parker comment came from a guy named Arian?So glad he gets it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]greatbawlsofire 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour agoWe continued to have classes during 9/11/2001. Some teachers allowed us to view the coverage. Obviously, those students whose parents pulled them from school that day were allowed to go. The irony for me is that my AP US History teacher opted to not turn on the TV and lectured. No, I have no clue what the lecture was about.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow many Matts here are middle children?  by  boomerwangin  matt[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoYoungest of 2permalinksavecontextfull commentsPro Bowl worthy?  by  iamjoe84in  Tennesseetitans[+]greatbawlsofire 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoVerner and Kernpermalinksavecontextfull commentsJuking them Jets  by  t4ct1xin  battlefield3[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThose must be the New York Jets.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEveryone coming here from the /r/funny post... check in...  by  visavismeyouin  matt[+]greatbawlsofire 16 points17 points18 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 16 points17 points18 points 1 day agoMatt 5, standing by.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny other Matt's found another Matt on FB with their last name?  by  rex8499in  matt[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoSmith?permalinksavecontextfull commentsBecker's CPA review class  by  Tomriddin  Accounting[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoIn the short term? Sure, if you're hourly. If you're salaried, it doesn't really matter. Long term? When you factor in the potential earnings multiplier for passing the exam and the career opportunities it opens up down the road, the opportunity cost of not studying for the exam is much greater.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNeed some advice from Managers/Experienced Accountants  by  allstarballerin  Accounting[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI would agree with understep. A hiring manager may not see where you are leaving to seek greener pastures because your job is soul crushing. What's to stop you from leaving their firm when things get tough? I think they'd rather see someone who is motivated, yet willing to stick it out in the interim.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you do this on the six hundred year old gate... then fuck you (Krakow Poland)  by  likkin  pics[+]greatbawlsofire 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoUnfortunately, they feel like this is how they earn respect from those they look up to. They give up a lot of respect from the community to "get respect" from some gang members. Disappointing. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAT&T rolled out LTE today.

They want to lock in their capital gains at the current rate if they think the rates will go up. I'm not sure if that type of speculation would lead to that much market movement, but it seems like it could be at least one contributing factor.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTo the employed Nashvillians. What do you do?  by  frizzlefreshin  nashville[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoAccountant. It pays the bills so I keep showing up. I'd rather be flipping houses, but the capital barrier to entry is a little high and this really isn't the economic time to do it.I wanted to be paid well and I knew there were lots of accounting jobs and they started around 50k and lots of job security. I went to college for 6 years to be eligible to sit for the CPA exam. A professional certification is more important that just about anything (college degree included)in terms of getting a job. It basically says that a third party has vouched to you having a certain set of skills and knowledge, whereas a college degree doesn't vouch in specifics, it just says that you showed up, and completed the requirements, which vary from place to place and are usually not as stringent as the CPA, the Bar exam, etc.permalinksavecontextfull commentsthought this better belonged here: my super secret undercover USB flash drive (OC from r/pics)  by  phi303in  DIY[+]greatbawlsofire 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoDon't feel bad, I thought that too.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShitty renditions of famous paintings  by  Shitty_Watercolourin  pics[+]greatbawlsofire -1 points0 points1 point 7 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire -1 points0 points1 point 7 days agoI would love to have prints of some of these.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSerious question, why is our profession so infatuated with alcohol?  by  reknautin  Accounting[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoBetter watch it.

If you're a damn good accountant, nobody really cares what you do behind closed doors as long as it's not a significant risk to the firm. Just be smart about it and put yourself in a position to be able to show the firm you're more of an asset than a liability to them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSerious question, why is our profession so infatuated with alcohol?  by  reknautin  Accounting[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoThis. So much. We don't care if you don't drink. We don't care if you're vegan. We care if you're personable enough to be around for extended periods, intelligent enough to do the work assigned, and smart enough to not make the same mistakes over and over. Somehow I don't believe this is related strictly to accounting, it's more of a "life in the working world" thing. People like to be around people that are like them, and tend to self segregate as a result. It's not a bad thing, inherently, and typically within an office, you'll find multiple groups and find your fit. The important part is to talk about stuff you're interested in, and hopefully they will be too. Making that personal connection is so important, because we know we can teach you what you need to know, and how to do it the way we want it done. We can't, however, do that if we can't stand to be around you for more than 5 minutes at a time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMusic City Bowl Game/New Years Eve  by  K_Fredin  nashville[+]greatbawlsofire 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoI'm hoping to reach Diamond here in the next couple of weeks and then utilize the 48 hour room guarantee down there.

If so, book the Hilton downtown. It's a great value if you pay with points. There's also a new/nice Hampton Inn and Suites down there as well. You'll be right in the middle of everything and can walk/stumble home from the bars/stadium/restaurants/attractions.
