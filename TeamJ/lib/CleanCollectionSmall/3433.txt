See More And tonight, the conversation about assault weapons and gun violence is under way, as you know, brian. Every hour, three americans die from a gunshot wound. And consider this. Americans are 20 times more likely to be killed by a gun than citizens living in any other developed nation in this world. Last night, the president said we cannot tolerate what is happening, and today, a chorus of surprising voices joined a call for change. Here's abc's jake tapper. Reporter: Standing by the devastated families of sandy hook last night, the president pledged action to prevent more tragedies. To save future children. Because what choice do we have? Are we prepared to say such violent visited on our children year after year after year is some how the price of our freedom? Reporter: For the couple hundred people who marched from capitol hill to the local offices of the national rifle sew yags today, and for new york city michael bloomberg, standing with victims of gun violence, there is one issue to confront. Access to guns. This is just ridiculous. This is an outrage. We are killing each other. And we're the only industrialized country in the world doing it. Reporter: Proposals being pushed in congress include reinstating the ban of certain types of semia all maltic rifles which expired in 2004. And banning high capacity magazines. Even some gun stallworths, such as joe man chin, today sounded a bit more compromising. I don't know of anybody in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle. Reporter: White house officials say the president does not view this tragedy only through the lens of access to guns, but also with a focus on education, mental health and a violent popular culture. While the president has occasionally talked about gub control. Weapons that were designed for soldiers don't belong on our streets. Reporter: Action is a different matter. Can you name one thing the president has done in the last four years to help remove weapons of war from our streets? You know, there's no question, jake, that the scourge of gun violence is a problem that has not sufficiently been aggre addre addressed. Reporter: Inner words, no. Many americans turn to washington in their greech for answers what they can do, what society can do to prevent feature sandy hooks. They dud not hear any answers coming from the white house. 1View CommentABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSshows:GMAGMA LIVE!GMA Recipes GMA Concert SeriesWorld NewsWorld News with David MuirNightline20/20Most Fascinating People Primetime NightlineDiane Sawyer SpecialsPrimetimeThis WeekWhat Would You Do?World News NowABC News NowPlaylist:World News: 12/18/12World News: 12/17/12World News: 12/14/12World News: 12/13/12World News: 12/12/12Person of the WeekWorld News ReportsWorld News ExtraHome > Video > World News > World News ReportsCerberus Capital Management to Sell Investments in Gun MakerCerberus Capital Management to Sell Investments in Gun MakerChris Cuomo on the backlash against Bushmaster and assault weapons.Newtown, Connecticut Tries to Return to NormalNewtown, Connecticut Tries to Return to NormalDan Harris looks at the courage of young students returning to school.Fiscal Cliff Negotiations: Trying to Make a DealFiscal Cliff Negotiations: Trying to Make a DealJon Karl reviews current proposals and how they might affect American families.Christmas Travel Could Be Slowed by Winter StormChristmas Travel Could Be Slowed by Winter StormGinger Zee tracks the forecast weather as holiday approaches.The Aftermath of Gun ViolenceThe Aftermath of Gun ViolenceMatt Gutman meets doctors who deal with tragic shootings.Instant Index: Instagram Changes End User AgreementInstant Index: Instagram Changes End User AgreementDiane Sawyer reports the news stories that had people buzzing this week.Newtown, Connecticut Gets Support From Across AmericaNewtown, Connecticut Gets Support From Across AmericaAmy Robach on the many acts of kindness after the school shootings.Who Was Newtown Gunman Adam Lanza?Who Was Newtown Gunman Adam Lanza?Troubling picture of Connecticut mass murderer slowly emerges.A Message of Hope from Newtown, Conn.A Message of Hope from Newtown, Conn.Sandy Hook shooting survivors stay hopeful in wake of tragedy.The Reality of Raising a Troubled ChildThe Reality of Raising a Troubled ChildParents speak out about the issues that can go with raising a mentally ill child.President Obama Pledges Action to Prevent More TragediesPresident Obama Pledges Action to Prevent More TragediesA new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows 54 percent of Americans favor stricter gun control.Hillary Clinton Faints, Suffers ConcussionHillary Clinton Faints, Suffers ConcussionGovernment says secretary of state fainted from dehydration caused by a stomach virus.1 of 4 | Next External links are provided for reference purposes.
