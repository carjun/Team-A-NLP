I believe it could.  Especially with new technology, a greater understanding of the human brain, better brain scans, and better drugs to keep chemical levels in the brain normal. The portion of those with mental illnesses that actually act on them in this manner is extremely tiny. If everyone was medically treated as well as possible then I believe shootings could be prevented.permalinksaveparent[+]Gorillaz_Noodle  comment score below threshold (2 children)[]Gorillaz_Noodle -6 points-5 points-4 points 36 minutes agoIt's not a rare answer.We have good mental health care, it's just that people with mental health problems aren't going.permalinksaveparent[+]Mewshimyo 10 points11 points12 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]Mewshimyo 10 points11 points12 points 23 minutes agoWe have good mental health care available if you can afford it.  When certain psych drugs are nearly 10 grand a year, and regular psych visits are 100+ dollars in a rural (cheap) area, many of the people most affected by mental illness simply can't afford to go.Also, there's a huge stigma attached to being mentally ill, speaking from experience on it.  It's one of the few things where you can still be 'legitimately' discriminated on, even though it's illegal.We need to make psych screening more available, and make psych services more affordable.permalinksaveparent[+]cardiomegaly 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]cardiomegaly 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes agoWe have good mental health care, it's just that people with mental health problems aren't going.What are you basing this off?

It isn't the services, it's that friends and family for not openly advocate for them when there is someone who needs one. Mental health services are available. It's that crazies don't use them. You can have all the programs and spend all of the money in the world, but if the people who need them aren't going it doesn't do a hell of a lot of good. permalinksaveparent[+]gobeavs1 2 points3 points4 points 9 minutes ago (0 children)[]gobeavs1 2 points3 points4 points 9 minutes agoEarly identification of warning signs is part of it but it still boils down to stigma and access to mental health and general healthcare services. permalinksaveparent[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 56 minutes agoWay more complicated than that, or availability of guns.permalinksaveparent[+]Only_A_Username -2 points-1 points0 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]Only_A_Username -2 points-1 points0 points 13 minutes agoBut we need guns to protect our chil... oh wait.

There were people there with a bevy of different mental issues and some of them who didn't have families had no place to go. So when they were discharged, they were sent to a homeless shelter. A FUCKING HOMELESS SHELTER!! Just to lay on a cot and be there. They were thrown away like trash because they have a chemical imbalance that they have no control over? it is really so sad to see this and the judgement from others too. Being called crazy hurts. it isn't like we can control depression or turn it off. But you are right, a lot of it is mental health. A lot is educating the staff too because they were discharging people who I did NOT think should be discharged. I mean, they needed to be in a safe environment to them and to others. permalinksaveparent[+]xafimrev 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes ago (0 children)[]xafimrev 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes agoAnd people demonizing people who are mentally ill as evil as you will no doubt find in this thread and in the media over the next couple of weeks.permalinksaveparent[+]WideLight 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes ago (0 children)[]WideLight 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes agoIsolation, even though we live so close together.

When others use their freedom to isolate and intimidate.  When teachers (or anyone) are unable to discipline children (or anyone) who take it too far and teach them that actions have repercussions.  When we are a reactionary society brought about by sterilization and analysis over preemptive pro-community society  brought about by interaction and common sense.It's a myriad of thing and we've almost lawyered ourselves into a corner.  We don't need legislation, or increased security at schools, or armed guards or concealed Carry permits for schools, which is what the media will focus on. Instead, we need community, and inclusion rather than competition and isolation.  permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 62 points63 points64 points 1 hour ago (6 children)[]montyjack 62 points63 points64 points 1 hour agoNo idea why you were downvoted.

You can support better mental health services and still maintain that the wide availability of guns creates an unacceptable risk. I'm pretty sure no gun control activists think that our prevailing culture is peachy-keen and that it is solely the guns themselves that the reason for shootings.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 2 points3 points4 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]montyjack 2 points3 points4 points 50 minutes agoI do know some people who think it's just the guns themselves.

It is just that with in the last few decades or so people have begun placing the blame on tools, instead of the perpetrator or the what gave rise to it.For example where I grew up in KS, there are plenty of old time mass killings that happened, but the massive change is in how they reported. It was reported as unfortunate and with the events in question, with massively less emphasis on the tool used.Another interesting thing is it seems like more recent ones seem to go after society or certain chunks of it, while older ones seemed to focus on their immediate family.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 4 points5 points6 points 45 minutes ago (1 child)[]montyjack 4 points5 points6 points 45 minutes agoYes, I've noticed this too.

Although it would be surprising if Finland had as many shootings as the USA. I accept that the USA has the worst problem with this stuff, but it's hardly a black-and-white issue where one culture is sick and the other is well.permalinksaveparent[+]Delheru 3 points4 points5 points 21 minutes ago (1 child)[]Delheru 3 points4 points5 points 21 minutes agoAs a Finn, I'm fairly certain we have more of these than you do adjusted for population. Finland has really rather good health care services, though perhaps the cultural attitude towards mental illness is not always healthy (huge levels of anger can be considered good, in a 'sisu' type of way... dark side is fine as long as you channel it to productivity, if you will).Few points:1. US has roughly 60x Finlands population.2. Finland had a school shooting in 2008 at Kauhajoki3. Finland had a school shooting in 2007 at Jokela      So in the last 5 years, Finland has had 2 shootings. Adjusted to population the US should have had 120 school shooting in the past 5 years, or 2 school shootings every month.I dunno if you picked Finland at random, but it was a very bad choice of example of a place that has it better in this regard than the US.permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto -1 points0 points1 point 19 minutes agoWith all due respect, you merely misunderstood my point. My point was that Finland was smaller than the USA, so it makes sense that they have fewer absolute shootings -- it would be truly bizarre if a country the size of Finland had more shooting that the USA. And I chose Finland not at random, but for exactly the reasons you say and the numbers you cite. In absolute numbers the USA is far worse, but in a relative sense, according to its population, it's shockingly similar. This highlights the fact that, while the USA has the worst problem with this stuff, it's also a larger country and that is a small part of what leads to more incidents as an absolute number.permalinksaveparent[+]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (2 children)[]LikesGirls 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoAmerican culture isn't sick, but the gun laws are ridiculous over there.People will say "Oh but if guns were illegal criminals still would have gotten them".

Finland alone has had a few in the past decade, which puts it at a significantly faster pace than the USA is on (when adjusted for population).permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 5 points6 points7 points 35 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto 5 points6 points7 points 35 minutes agoI didn't comment on frequency, did I?Yes, it happens far, far, far more often in the USA -- and that's something Americans need to accept. However, acting like other cultures don't have the same sickness to some degree indicates someone who's making more of a nationalistic (or, in this case, anti-nationalistic -- being against the USA and China) rather than a substantive/interesting one. This madness exists in all cultures, the USA has variables that put them high on the continuum of this particular problemIt makes sense to accept it as a broadly human problem which the USA struggles with the most at the current time, rather than a strictly American/Chinese culture problem, which it plainly isn't.permalinksaveparent[+]linkybaa 4 points5 points6 points 38 minutes ago (0 children)[]linkybaa 4 points5 points6 points 38 minutes agoNo. permalinksaveparent[+]bonkosaurus 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes ago (1 child)[]bonkosaurus 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes agoWhen did Sweden have a school shooting...?I honestly can't recall one.permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 28 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphafemto 0 points1 point2 points 28 minutes agoIt had one, but going back I misremembered the circumstances surrounding that shooting (Bromma, 2001). While it was a shooting a school, it was more of a personal incident rather than what I think most people consider to be a "school shooting". Although if you're going to take that off, a lot of the American school shootings would also be taken off, as they are more personal issues where one person shoots one other person, rather than the broader and more random horror of what we've seen today.permalinksaveparent[+]davidmcw -2 points-1 points0 points 26 minutes ago (2 children)[]davidmcw -2 points-1 points0 points 26 minutes agoAfter the Dunblane shooting there was no more public ownership of guns, plain and fucking simple....permalinksaveparent[+]alphafemto 1 point2 points3 points 22 minutes ago*(0 children)[]alphafemto 1 point2 points3 points 22 minutes ago*We have this Constitution, you see...so it's not so simple. 2/3rds of both houses of Congress, and then 3/4ths (!) of all state legislatures would have to be for getting rid of public ownership of guns, in a process that will span years. We can't make quick pivots on this policy at all based on certain events, it's literally not possible. So, it's a catastrophic situation, but we're kind of stuck since 99% of (non-gang related) American gun owners are law-abiding and want to keep their guns, and we have a shitty, broken, decimated system for figuring out who the 1% might be. I'd say the latter is the bigger problem, and weirdly the more solveable right now.permalinksaveparent[+]Lepple 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes ago (0 children)[]Lepple 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes agoCompletely untrue.permalinksaveparent[+]whubbard[] 1 point2 points3 points 51 minutes ago (0 children)[]whubbard[] 1 point2 points3 points 51 minutes agoMore children will die today from cancer and car crashes.

You can't watch primetime television without seeing a few casual murders in an evening. War is a product sold to the American people. If you don't support the war of the day, you are not a true American. You may even be a terrorist. Political discourse has reached a point where vitriol and extremism are the only tools used. "If you're not with us, you're against us." "Liberals are baby murderers hellbent on destroying the country." "Republicans are mindless religious fanatics that hate your social group." To top it all off, many people are getting closer and closer to reaching their own personal fiscal cliff with the weak economy, leading to unstable and abnormal behavior.tl;dr: media, political leaders, and the economypermalinksaveparent[+]queen_rush  comment score below threshold (8 children)[]queen_rush -16 points-15 points-14 points 1 hour agoI can only answer for the United States, but most of the variables involved with violent crime include ethnic and cultural diversity, lack of socialized medicine, lack of quality education, population density and economic inequality.If you take a look at cities or states with a mostly homogeneous population that is evenly distributed with more economic equality and better education, they tend to have less crime than the contrary.The same reasoning can be applied by example from other nations; Norway, for instance. Norway has a lot of social liberty alike the United States, but because they have very tight immigration regulation, their culture is very homogeneous. They also have socialized medicine, subsidized education and very little economic inequality. There are cities, but the densities aren't remotely alike to what the United States has in an American city.To solve the issue of violent crime, we must solve these core issues of society. It's a key that most other developed nations have already come to understand, yet America lacks.permalinksaveparent[+]frankzapra 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]frankzapra 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour agoPlease, please, please tell me how socialized medicine would have prevented this. permalinksaveparent[+]Apparatii 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]Apparatii 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoI think he meant that better access to mental health care would have helped.
