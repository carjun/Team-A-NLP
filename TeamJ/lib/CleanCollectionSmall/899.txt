I just need people to talk to.  by  SeekToDestroyin  MMFB[+]transdermalcelebrity 2 points3 points4 points 12 hours ago*(0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 2 points3 points4 points 12 hours ago*Right there with you.  My little girl is in kindergarten.  I live on the other side of the damn country but this is so much in "worst nightmare" realm that I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to see her off to school on Monday.  There are a few positive thoughts I've seen about this:right now there are a lot of kids across the country, possibly the world, who are a lot more appreciated and hugged and generally given affection by parents who are feeling crushed by this; some extra love going aroundthis kind of horrible shit does bring the good people togetherAlso, I've seen this info. distributed, if you want to send a card or letter or something to the school. It may help you to process it better. And I think the people at the school might appreciate it as well.  I used to work in NYC and was there (midtown) for 9-11.  In the days that followed, I would see cards and letters sent from across the country posted in Penn Station.  It was haunting but it also helped me to process. Anyway, here's the address:Sandy Hook Elementary School12 Dickenson DriveSandy Hook, CT 06482{HUGS} Because goddammit.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Nobody said anything, but all the teachers seemed down and the parents seemed eager.  Even the cars seemed a little more obedient to the crossing guards and gave us all a wide berth while we crossed.I can't imagine what those poor families have to go through.

The party events happened at a high school graduation party.  He says that those events were "over a year ago".  And yet the guy in the article is 26.  I would think that if it were in fact around 8 years ago he wouldn't have said "over a year ago", but instead something like "8 years ago", "almost a decade ago", etc.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDoes anyone have a good glutenfree recipe for cinnamon raisin bread?  by  bellybuttonrapein  glutenfree[+]transdermalcelebrity 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI've used this recipe before with great success; Bob's Red Mill all purpose gf flour for the flour.

Going to give this a try!  by  TestandDbolin  Paleo[+]transdermalcelebrity 2 points3 points4 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 2 points3 points4 points 12 days agoI'm another one.  I have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism and despite countless diet and exercise programs (including a solid year of P90X), I couldn't lose the weight.  I'd just gain muscle on top of it.  Went paleo and very quickly lost almost 40 pounds for the first time in years.  It practically melted off, even regardless of exercise.  Plus my skin is the clearest it's been since adolescence, my hair looks great (and stopped falling out), and I feel truly wonderful.  It's like my autoimmune symptoms just took a step back.  Plus my body temp is finally starting to go back to normal range (normal for me was 96.6, and is now 98). I can't begin to tell you how great this diet is for people with hypo and other autoimmune ailments!I eat both regular and turkey bacon, but I don't overdo it.  And it is ideal to get the nitrite-free stuff (although it's a good bit more expensive).  Truly I just listen to my body.  I see that you have portions measured out, but paleo for me worked because instead of fretting exact details about portion sizes I went with my instinct. Chunk of meat or eggs, bunch of veggies, some fruit.  Within a few days on the diet it became self-regulating.  All my cravings beyond basic hunger just stopped, I ate when I felt like eating (as long as it was on the diet... eg; tree nuts or seeds for snacks if it was in between meals), and I ate as much as I felt like eating.  And actually, following that my portion sizes also dropped.  Because I just didn't feel the need to eat that much.Dropping all dairy was huge for me too.  It stopped some wretched issues I was having with tachycardia and digestive problems.  I drink coconut milk when I need something milk-like, and I use it in my cooking (both the canned stuff and the carton).  I believe almond milk should also be ok.permalinksavecontextfull comments[UPDATE] Visiting my parents: we stay in separate rooms, and apparently aren't "allowed" to get a hotel instead.  by  OneUpGirlin  relationships[+]transdermalcelebrity 7 points8 points9 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 7 points8 points9 points 15 days agoYep, full manipulation to the hilt. She's still trying to get a win.  And honestly if she really wanted you guys in the house then she'd let you be in the same room... I'd even consider it a fair compromise for her to let you stay in the same room but ask that there's no fooling around.  But instead she's still trying to go in reverse.  All the more reason to maintain solid boundaries.You could just say, "Look, we don't do well in your house, and we'll become stressed and grumpy if we stay there.  A hotel may be a little further from you, but it keeps everyone on better behavior."permalinksavecontextfull comments[Help] Is this anxiety?  by  Humbug244in  Anxiety[+]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 16 days agoThanks! I'm actually much much better (I was a total mess a year ago).Believe it or not, the fear of losing control of your body is actually very typical when anxiety latches onto medical sensations. It's very easy to become a hypochondriac because you notice things happening with your body that either other people don't have or don't notice (usually don't notice). And anxiety is very opportunistic so at first it may be bloodwork that bothers you, then suddenly it's any thought of potential damage to your body, and then before you know it you're listening constantly to your own heart rate and breathing patterns.  (try not to get that far, it's a miserable place to be)Exposure therapy is great but in the beginning it's really something to do with a therapist who can bring you back to reality if you start to lose it.  Since the research is too much then I'll just give you the quick and dirty on the vagus nerve...  It's a gigantic nerve responsible for regulating many systems in your body.  From what I can tell, if you are having vasovagal responses then your vagus nerve is nice and healthy (so don't think about it being damaged or defective, because it definitely isn't). Some of us are just a little more high strung than others. And you can learn to cope with this. Also, sometimes the physical sensations you feel are a result of a flood of cortisol and/or adrenaline.  The only thing abnormal about this is the trigger.  To explain, they've done experiments with rats and cats and mazes.  Essentially you have a rat in a maze.  When the rat smells a cat nearby but can't see it, then part A of their brain/threat detection lights up.  Now let's say the rat sees the cat at a distance, part B of their brain/threat detection activates.  Final scenario: the rat turns a corner and is suddenly right in front of the cat... well that's part C of their brain/threat detection lighting up and sending the rat into fight or flight mode with all the resulting adrenaline.  Anyway, typically with people who have panic or anxiety, it's like they are the rat and they just smell the cat somewhere, yet part C of their brain lights up and fills them with adrenaline.  It's like your threat detection system needs to be recalibrated because it's off a little.  It feels major and can have huge emotional effects on you, but really it's a small calibration issue.  I've found cognitive behavioral therapy extremely helpful with it.I'll leave it at that now that I've "talked" your ear off. I hope the therapy helps and please feel free to pm if I can ever help!permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, today I spent the entire day with a melted Milk Dud on the back of my pants, at what point did you realize you'll have to start a new life somewhere else? (Pic)  by  despoil8777in  funny[+]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago8th grade; I was not popular.  Gym class.  Discovered quarter-sized hole in the buttcheek of my gym pants literally 10 seconds before the gym teacher called me up for my turn to do basketball free throws in front of the class.  My underwear was not sexy in any way. And I suck at sports so it's not like I was going to get the ball in the basket. 2 solid minutes of me pathetically flinging the ball hopelessly at the hoop, unsexy underwear, and one of the class jocks calls out, "Hey that girl has a hole in her pants."Sadly it took another 5 years before I could escape that town.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Help] Is this anxiety?  by  Humbug244in  Anxiety[+]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoIt could be a vasovagal response; you may want to read up on the vagus nerve.  In short it's a mechanism of the body designed to take you out of action and prevent you from bleeding to death should you be traumatically injured in battle; however in this modern society a strong vagus response can be tied to anxiety. I have both anxiety and a strong vagus response (as tested and evaluated by my cognitive behavioral therapist).  I don't actually worry so much about getting bloodwork done, however I'm frequently at risk for getting light headed, passing out, having blood pressure drops, or otherwise getting a light version of shock.  I used to give blood often, then I just changed.  One day I passed out 7 times after giving blood and I was forever different. -And it probably did increase the likelihood of anxiety surrounding blood work events but I deprogrammed that.In the therapist's office, just the smell of alcohol dropped my heart rate from 80 to 60, lol. My therapist hadn't seen a reaction that strong before and asked to share it with his colleagues.  Meanwhile, a friend's husband dropped a hammer on his own toe once, passed out and stopped breathing for 30 seconds. It was a rare but confirmed vasovagal response.The fact that you are having issues even thinking about blood and veins sounds like a programmed anxiety response to an actual physical (vagus) mechanism.  The anxiety response can be unlearned and deprogrammed with cognitive behavioral therapy, and I've found that can make it less likely that your vasovagal response will be as strong or more to the point have as strong of an effect on you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDo you guys deal with anxiety-related nausea?  by  shadyoaksin  Anxiety[+]transdermalcelebrity 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 1 point2 points3 points 17 days agoFor me, the nausea of anxiety was often part of a vasal vagus response that also included other symptoms like a blood pressure dip, temperature drop, and sometimes severe shivering. This is suprisingly common in anxiety.Things that helped:  salt (I have naturally low sodium anyway, so skip this if you have sodium problems, but I would actually mix water with 1/4 tsp of sea salt; or if need be, suck on some pretzels), warmth (wool socks, heating pad, electric blanket), pressure points (put your left hand palm up place the ring, middle, and pointer fingers of your right hand horizontal on your left wrist starting at the bottom of the palm and going down the wrist; just below where your pointer finger ends up, in the middle of your wrist, is a pressure point.  Push and rub it with the thumb of your right hand. Repeat this same thing with the hands reversed.), acupuncture for nausea, and hot peppermint tea with lemon. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the most important thing you've learnt in therapy?  by  Alvin_Ailey1in  CollaborativePsych[+]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 19 days agoJust checked out his website, very cool!permalinksavecontextfull commentsDo Any NYers Know this Cat (lost after Sandy; looking for his owner) (details in comments)  by  transdermalcelebrityin  newyork[+]transdermalcelebrity[S] 2 points3 points4 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity[S] 2 points3 points4 points 20 days agoPosting on Reddit for a friend; this is not my post and I have no actual connection to this kitty.  Please refer any information to the Boulevard Veterinary Center in Staten IslandFurther Details: Please SHARE THIS time is VITAL. Thank you.It is critical that we try to locate the owner or a veterinarian that may have treated this cat rescued in Staten Island, near slater. He is unaltered, young, and very sweet. He was definitely an indoor kitty. He is being held for a 6 month DoH quarantine due to a bite wound... and he is not feeling well. We need to find proof he had a rabies vaccine.. Please help! Share this guy as much as you can. Situation urgent.Guardians of Rescue According to NY state law if the cat shows no signs of rabies after 6 months he can be returned to the owner if found or adopted.The problem is the cat is not eating. During quarantine he is not allowed to be handled. He has a cold, and the only way to get him medication is in food.Since he is not eating and is not allowed to be touched this poses a problem. If we can find the owner and provide proof of vaccination, then there is no need for a quarantine and he can be given medication another way.We can't have blood drawn, since he can't be handled. Titer would not work... It was the first question I asked.We are paying the $1800 to board him, but he's not eating... We need to find an owner or a vet that recognizes him.He is at Boulevard Veterinary Center in Staten Island, they do not know the cat. We are trying other vets in the area.permalinksavecontextfull comments19789Do Any NYers Know this Cat (lost after Sandy; looking for his owner) (details in comments) (imgur.com)submitted 20 days ago by transdermalcelebrity to newyork2 commentssharecancelloading...What's the most important thing you've learnt in therapy?  by  Alvin_Ailey1in  CollaborativePsych[+]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]transdermalcelebrity 0 points1 point2 points 20 days agoOh definitely!!!!

These workers are forbidden from saying it is their first year preparing taxes.Oh yeah, and the price they quote (on tv and if you call them) to bring you in is virtually impossible to get; if you have a dependent, that's an extra fee, every single W2... more fees, every form... that's a fee, certain fields on the extra forms... fee.
