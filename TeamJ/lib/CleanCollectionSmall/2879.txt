Please join us in welcoming these outstanding new admins, and as always, ask them anything in the comments!David A. Croach(/u/Dacvak) -Community ManagerWhat's up, reddit? I'm Dac, a humble gamer from the wondrous land of Pittsburgh, PA. After spending most of my adult life in various parts of the gaming industry, I shifted focus to the enigma that is reddit, and applied to become the Community Manager. A week after being offered the job, I was unfortunately diagnosed with leukemia, which put me out of commission for 8 months. But now that I've punched cancer in the face, I'm back in full swing. (But damn - I sure have a lot of work to catch up on!)Lesley Brownlee(/u/weffey) -Programmer (redditgifts)Hi! I'm from Canada's capital city, but made my way here to Salt Lake City via Seattle's eastside. As many of you know, I've been involved with redditgifts and/r/secretsantafor a while now, first as an award giver in the gallery, starting last fall I joined the mod team, and successfully lobbied for ayarn exchangeearlier this year. When I'm not at the computer, you can usually find me with a ball of yarn and knitting needles or my spinning wheel. I'm really excited to have joined redditgifts full time, we've got some really fun things planned for the future.Roger Ostrander(/u/reostra) -ProgrammerI'm a 33 year old programmer from Georgia, Michigan, and Maryland (inthat order). My hobbies include making games in my spare time andwriting novels every November. I've been a redditor for years, butfigured I'd create a new account for admin duties.Aforementioned admin duties include helping out with the anti-spamefforts. I'll thus be working on the non-visible backendportions of the site, so chances are you won't see me a whole lot. Ido lurk in/r/ideasfortheadminsand/r/theoryofredditand occasionallyeven comment, however!We'll likely have a few more job openings to announce this year, so if you're interested in joining team reddit, keep checking out the blog. As always, these new additions would not be possible without your continuing support. We deeply appreciate it and are working hard to keep improving reddit for you.discuss this post on redditNewer PostOlder PostHomethe reddit blogKeep up with the latest development updates, community announcements, and general reddit tomfoolery.Blog Archive2012(30)          December(1)          November(1)October(1)Introducing Three New Hires          September(3)          August(3)          July(1)          June(4)          May(2)          March(4)          February(2)          January(8)          2011(59)          December(5)          November(2)          October(2)          September(8)          August(5)          July(8)          June(6)          May(3)          April(3)          March(9)          February(6)          January(2)          2010(72)          December(3)          November(8)          October(7)          September(3)          August(8)          July(9)          June(4)          May(5)          April(5)          March(3)          February(4)          January(13)          2009(178)          December(7)          November(12)          October(14)          September(14)          August(8)          July(14)          June(16)          May(16)          April(19)          March(15)          February(25)          January(18)          2008(74)          December(16)          November(6)          October(7)          September(5)          August(6)          July(5)          June(5)          May(4)          April(8)          March(4)          February(4)          January(4)          2007(46)          December(3)          November(3)          October(8)          September(3)          August(7)          July(3)          June(3)          May(3)          April(3)          March(7)          January(3)          2006(37)          December(2)          August(1)          July(2)          June(2)          May(6)          April(1)          March(6)          February(8)          January(9)          2005(20)          December(8)          November(8)          October(4)
