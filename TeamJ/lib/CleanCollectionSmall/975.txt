In the heat of the moment, the police are not going to take any chances. If you are a cop and you are reporting to a mass shooting in a school and you see someone wearing camouflage pants in the woods, you are going to arrest them under suspicion of being a part of the incident. To say that the person was "directly involved in the incident" is complete speculation on your part.permalinksavecontextfull commentsConnecticut Shootings - "a second man was caught in an adjoining wood", " the gunman was unusually accurate in his fire."  by  whatwhatx10in  conspiracy[+]SutekhRising 1 point2 points3 points 6 hours ago (0 children)[]SutekhRising 1 point2 points3 points 6 hours agoWell said.
