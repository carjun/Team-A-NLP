It's a (pretty fair, imo) judgement about the state of the ACC in regards to Cincy and UConn. If the ACC was dying to have UConn, they would already have sent the invitation. Cincy wasn't even in the discussion until Maryland left, and then suddenly the ACC has an interest in the midwest with Louisville and potentially Cincinnati.The only thing I'm bashing is this reporter's thoughts that a power move by UC and UConn will actually have any effect on what the ACC does. The conferences have dictated the action since day 1, with the possible exception of some of the biggest schools like Texas and Notre Dame still free to do whatever they want.permalinksavecontextfull commentsESPN suspends Rob Parker for comments about Robert Griffin III and race  by  SPACE_LAWYERin  nfl[+]dobis-llc 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]dobis-llc 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoDidn't he get suspended for that 'report'?permalinksavecontextfull commentsESPN suspends Rob Parker for comments about Robert Griffin III and race  by  SPACE_LAWYERin  nfl[+]dobis-llc 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]dobis-llc 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoAlso called bananas.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I know that affirmation signed by all the remaining schools is a bit of a farce, but until the rumor mill really picks up with FSU/Clemson/VT going to Big 12 or SEC, or GT/UVA/UNC going to the B1G, I wouldn't expect much action from the ACC.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEarly Contenders: National Player of the Year  by  BenKerrin  CollegeBasketball[+]dobis-llc 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]dobis-llc 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoAlso, I think your point about Vasquez says something about the strength of the ACC then as compared to now.Or the media circlejerk that envelops Tobacco Road.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCincinnati, UConn talk of new all-sports league, could leverage ACC offer  by  jcm267in  CollegeBasketball[+]dobis-llc -11 points-10 points-9 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]dobis-llc -11 points-10 points-9 points 23 hours agoBahahahahahaOh wait, you're serious?

That is irreparable in many cases, and a whole town is now not only mourning but must find a way to counsel ~600 children and teachers, not to mention all the families of the deceased.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
