Please link directly to a reliable source that supports the claim in your post title. Images alone do not count as valid references. Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, discovery, etc).No personal opinions, anecdotes or subjective statements (e.g "TIL xyz is a great movie").No news or recent sources. News and any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) more recent than two months are not allowed.Nothing related to recent politics.No misleading claims. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.Rephrase your post title if the following are not met:Titles must begin with "TIL ..."Make them descriptive, concise and specific (e.g. not "TIL something interesting about bacon").Titles must be able to stand on their own without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary."TIL about ..." and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia, etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word "about")."TIL how to ..." posts belong on /r/HowTo.No trivial or obvious facts (e.g. "TIL the sky is blue"), or facts that appeal only to a narrow audience, specifically no software/website tips (e.g. "TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22").(Why we need rules and the TIL FAQ)Additional infoIf your post does not appear in the new queue and you think it meets the above rules, please contact the moderators (include a link to your reddit.com post, not your story).Please report spam, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate posts by messaging the moderators, as this helps us remove them more promptly!EtiquetteWe ask that you please do the following:avoid mobile versions of websites (e.g. m.wikipedia.org)link to the appropriate heading when referencing an article (particularly on Wikipedia)link to the appropriate start time when referencing videos (e.g. on YouTube)add [PDF] or [NSFW] tags to your posts, as necessary.Please also read the site-wide Reddiquette.Talk with us on IRC: #todayIlearned on irc.freenode.org, or just click here.You are loved.a community for 3 yearsSubmit a linkto anything interesting: news article, blog entry, video, picture...message the moderatorsMODERATORSnix0nwacroverMassesOfTheOpiaterelic2279lukemcrmanbraGeekymummaGuitarFreak027sdnroger_...and 9 more 1012TIL: Reddit.
