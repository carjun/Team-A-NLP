Especially when the school is claiming they both were research related. muahhaa.According to this building access he went to school every day. Generally only missing one-two days per month. Yet, in may from the 17th to the 30th his card did not access any location. He has never missed this amount of time, according to his access card. (p. 46) Further, I could not find any records of him going onto campus in June. Obviously he was there to take his prelims. Did anyone see June in the access log?From time line:May 8 - scheduled to give presentation about RNA Biomarkers (source)May 22 - bought Glock G22 .40 cal pistol at Gander Mountain in AuroraMay 28 - bought Remington 870 Express Tactical 12-gauge shotgun from Bass Pro Shops in Denver*something obviously went wrong after May 8th. Then May 17th-30th he planned.Question, when filling out a booking sheet for jail, does the arrestee fill out the top portion, or do the police? His lower case a's are in no way a match and he connects his m's and e's not his e's and s's in his first name. Thus, police must fill out the top?Second, his signature from the booking and the package log kind-of match. However, there are a lot of loops missing. (Alert-Alert! Not saying he did not commit the murder) Just wondering how much ones brain changes under extreme stress/wonder if he was on something or not on something he should have been taking.permalinksavecontextfull comments9Wants to Know: From Jimmy to James | Video | 9news.com  by  glamorousgluein  AuroraCase[+]rightwhoknows 3 points4 points5 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]rightwhoknows 3 points4 points5 points 1 month agoIf you surveyed the people that lived in my dorm complex, during my time, only a handful would know me.

This case is a bad wreck. Even more so the most intriguing part of this case is that there is this limited amount of people, the redditors/sleuths/maybeeventumblers that know all the inconsistencies. Yet, the general population has no clue what is going on. The other night one of my peers mentioned in class that she and her bf won't go to theaters after the shooting and I mentioned a few of the inconsistencies and they were blown away. In fact, most people thought I was making it up-No one is following the case and the people that were are starting to drift away from the case. I think this is what the prosecutor wants. For people to forget the inconsistencies. Perhaps as time goes forth, the advent of the internet will help bring to light the inconsistencies and lies that come out in court cases.  Why lie, hide, and change your story if it is such an open and closed case?!permalinksavecontextfull commentsHolmes defense says prosecution withholding information - 9news.com  by  zombieTankGirlin  AuroraCase[+]rightwhoknows 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]rightwhoknows 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoThe reason I think the apartment is suspicious is because of the neighbor. She supposedly went to his apartment and in some reports the door was ajar but yet in other reports she indicated that she touched the door knob and felt the door was unlocked? Then she heard the music but the guy that lives next door did not?I don't get why everyone in Aurora lies. Do they not have anyone credible that lives in that area? wtf. I understand everyone wants to get the twenty minutes of fame, but between the bar buddy, the supposed concert performer, hookers, the mailman, random people on the street infront of the complex, and then even people at the theater saying they saw two people and that JH does not look like the person they saw in the theater shooting, I'm like wtf. Who is telling the truth? Obviously it is not the police department that said he is adopted, he was dumped, he is spitting on people, he is wearing a spit mask, he has amnesia, he is addicted to opiates....Don't get me wrong- I think he committed this crime. I just feel there is a lot of lying and coverup. But, this is my first  crime and court trial to follow so maybe this is common.

Now that we have the court documents that indicate that JH sent burnt money I see more parallels to this movie and his actions. If anything I would speculate he watched the film a few too many times.At 4:40 you will see the main character take a red gas can out of his trunk and burn cash.

More so now, I believe that Jh is mentally ill, and he believed that he had to shoot the victims in the theater. This is because in his mind, he thinks they would have hurt him. Further, him booby-trapping his apartment (if he did in-deed do so, which I am not sure of) builds to the case that he believed someone was out to get him. Perhaps the super of the building indicated that he had to move out, lease was up, he dropped out. He thought the people of the building were against him and he had to get them before they got him. This would fit perfectly with persecutory delusions. Maybe his brain has instances were glimpses of normal behavior exhibit themselves, or rather come out. Such as with multiple personality disorder.  With this idea, perhaps he sent Dr. Fenton the package during a period of normal behavior.  At the alternative spectrum, he could have sent Dr. Fenton the package because it was his attempt to say F-u to her. She probably did try to treat him and he most likely did not want to take his medication- I would imagine that this is how most people initially respond to diagnosis of a mental illness: denial. The burnt currency fits in GREAT here. It is him saying take your fn grant money back.For sane people, everyone understands that the program is not pass-fail per-say. Moreover, the building angst between him and his professors due to his poor ability to produce ideas that were mind blowing, probably added to his delusions. For someone that has a mental illness that is starting to sink deeper, failing at prelims=mortal doom. AKA, his life is over, to him. Further, at this point I believe he thought the entire world was against him.So, why the movie theater? Perhaps he heard the other students talking about going to see the film? Or even, it could be as simple as the theater being a place where lots of people would be at. It could be as simple as a fixation on a commercial he seen on television. I honestly feel that this entire situation is a result of delusions and his brain sinking deeper into an underlining mental illness. The only glimpse of sane behavior I have seen in this case is him posting on AFF and Match.com the tagline "will you visit me in prison." I want to know the exact time that was written and the ip address. Obviously, they are his pictures, but I am wondering if at the point that he wrote the tagline, if it was only a joke or rather, just an offhand remark. Then, once his world started to slip further, the joke became a reality, for him. I also would like to know how long he was a member. I see the state suggesting he created these profiles to get sexed up before going to prison but there are multiple implications and assertions that can be made about these profiles. For instance, he wasn't proclaiming, I only want sex. In fact, he said he was down for just hanging out. He wanted a friend, and like everyone 24 year old boy, if sex happen to follow-that was great. These profiles are what drew me in closer to this case. I mean common, they read like every other 24 year old sad, lonely, looking for a friend profile. They demonstrate that he is clever, witty, and seemingly normal.   I don't know, it is difficult to make sense of a brain that is clearly not working properly. And are we even really able to make sense of the workings of a brain that we cannot begin to understand? People make sick jokes all the time. Depending on one's humor, these jokes may be offense to one and not the other. For instances, I am in my last year of my graduate program and I say quite often that suicide is always an option. Many people are probably offended by this because joking about suicide is taboo. But for me, it keeps me going. Because I have gotten this far, I could not possibly see a worth in my life if I failed or quit. Of course tomorrow, if I fail out, I most likely would go into another field. But for someone who is suffering for a mental illness, and has told themselves their whole life that prison is always an option ( a place where you watch tv, get 3 meals a day, and is air conditioned) they may start to believe this is the route they are suppose to go, and once he failed his prelims it was the end of the educational route, for him.    The purchasing weapons and stockpiling ammo, to me, suggests that he thinks someone is out to get him. Like the crazy shows that depict people that believe Armageddon is coming and believe that they must prepare for the end times.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMotion for Sanctions for Violating This Courts Order D-017  by  Fox012in  AuroraCase[+]rightwhoknows 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]rightwhoknows 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoI remember the news saying James told the police that he sent a notebook to Fenton. I remember thinking wtf, worlds dumbest criminals. But now I believe that he is not talking, has never been talking, and is probably very incoherent unless he is medicated.Yes, I too, remember the "package" fiasco. Then, who "got" the package. The police said we don't have it the FBI does, and then they indicated they never had position of the package. (I think this is because chief knew someone opened the package). What is the burnt currency? I have not read about that yet. Link for me, please. Isn't Jh's lawyers saying that the mug shot was also a violation and want to know why the mug shot was taken. What additional crimes was he charged with?permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
