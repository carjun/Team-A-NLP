And also, the theme with disappearing using the "magic device"... I still think that doesn't exist, Wayne was simply inferring that he knew Batman was over and that he could start a new life once everyone thought The Batman was dead, and Selena could be part of it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow do you wake up in the morning, /r/Seattle?  by  rascalspratin  Seattle[+]soapbutt 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]soapbutt 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoBeen living here my whole life, so I don't think my routine will help you much. I sleep with my window open (I also live in Cap Hill so there's always sirens and construction everywhere... doesn't ever wake me up but it certainly does help in not letting me go back to sleep), so it's always cold when I wake up and that always helps get me all perked up in the morning.  I get my bike gear on quick as possible so I don't stay cold, and ride my bike to work, or if its the weekend I just go for a ride. I also drink lots of cold water (usually not a minute after I wake up), and that always helps keep me awake. Also, the rain does a great job at waking me up.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSeahawks fan accurately predicts 58-0 shutout against the Cardinals (from nfl.com).  by  schnichaelsin  nfl[+]soapbutt 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]soapbutt 4 points5 points6 points 4 days agoHa song has a good beat.

Being a hawks fan, I told ya elf I couldn't root for the cards, but also def wasn't rooting for the steelers, so kinda wishes both would lose...

Still such a tragedy that he had to do such a terrible thing.
