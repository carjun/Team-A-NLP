Other gunmen apparently arrestedEDIT3: One gunmen thought to be a father of a studentEDIT4: Now 18 children dead out of 27, including gunmanEDIT5: Gunmen thought to be in 20s, wearing bullet proof vest and carrying 4 firearms. No word on second gunman, if there was one.EDIT6: Shooter identified as Ryan Lanza, with known connections to Newtown, CTEDIT7: Man found dead in Lanza's home in New JerseyEDIT8: Suspects mother, teacher at the elementary school, dead at the sceneEDIT9: Suspect in custody is are Ryan Lanza's younger brother roommates. No information on whether it is simply for questioning or for greater motivesEDIT10: Man killed in Hoboken was brother. Two roommates of Lanza believed to have no connection to massacre questionedEDIT11: Media says name of shooter has not been officially released. Speculation is now that the shooter was Adam Lanza, Ryan's younger brother. It is believed that Adam stole his brother, Ryan's, identity. Information is still hazy thoughFinal thoughts (11:40 PM EST): Sorry all, had to go to work. This isn't exactly how I pictured my top comment to be =/ it's eerie how much harder something like this hits when it's a ten minute drive down the road from you. I'm sure all of the information has been released since I left for work so I won't bother updating.

Your job in a situation like this is to tell the stories of the dead and the survivors, to capture the fear and anger, to get the facts out there, to find a way to give the story meaning, to ensure that people are still talking about it a week from now, and, if possible, to leverage the work you do to create some sort of positive change in the world. As a reporter, you hold up the mirror to society, which won't always like what it sees reflected back. If you hold the mirror right, people won't even notice who's doing the holding, all they'll care about is fixing what's wrong with that picture.permalinksaveparent[+]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours agoJournalist here as well.

Mass killings are terrible and atrocious.  Add to that the fact that the large majority of the victims were so many young, vulnerable children.  My heart just aches.I understand that the media needs to report something.  (After all, I'm sure many of you were checking all of the major news outlets to get some sort of update or bird's eye view of the situation as it was unfolding.)  So I get that they needed to release information as they gathered it.  And in times of chaos, it's easy for someone to hear something and just run with it.  Unfortunately, that kind of swift release leads to misinformation.  But rather than point fingers (news, media, social networking, gun laws, lack of gun laws, bad parenting, what have you...) we should all take this time to open our hearts to the ones we love, and also to pay attention to those around us.  Remind our friends and family how much they mean to us, take the time to let them know how important they are in our lives.  That tiny step alone could prevent another situation like this from happening in the future.  Of course, there are individuals and groups who have a negative agenda (whether brought about by mental instability, political propaganda, religious zeal, etc.) but perhaps by using love and compassion as a preventive tool we can come together during this time.  My entire heart goes out to the families and loved ones who are now suffering from this unspeakable tragedy.  And I truly wish them all a healing process that allows them to grieve and remember the lives of those lost without fear or hatred or bitterness.  There are no magic words to take away their pain, but hopefully they can all gather strength throughout the aftermath of this terrible event.  permalinksaveload more comments(3 replies)[+]a_monster_ 1584 points1585 points1586 points 1 day ago*(280 children)[]a_monster_ 1584 points1585 points1586 points 1 day ago*Final update: final class of the day. We are watching the news. We are horrified. We are all sobbing. 'm currently in one of the class rooms of the neighboring school and we're in lock down. So far we have heard nothing from the administration. We know that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook School (the elementry k-4 school). There were 2 shooters alledged. One kid (confirmed with multiple sources) is wounded and carried out of the school. The shooters are still out there, not caught. One teacher was shot.My town is trending on every major news site and it's scary as fuck. Update: 3 patients admitted to danbury hospital  by ambulance and the number of people shot is up to 4 (no ages yet). Update 2: one shooter reported dead (unconfirmed but multiple people are saying that)Update 3: One child dead. One shooter still on the loose. Yale hospital has opened a triage for victims. Update 4: Unconfirmed repoet that the principle is dead. The shooter is heading down river-side (the road). Update 5: Swatt team is sweeping the school Update 6: they've taken one woman aside and she's crying into a firefighter's arms. This could mean update number 3 about a kid dead is true. Update 7: We were released back to class. There was an announcement that said the area was safe, so we are conducting classes. I need to get back to class, so I will update later. We're watching the news, it's last period but we were forced to turn it off. One of the reporter's said,"and just think that these kids were seeing santa claus last weekend." We turned the audio off and we're all crying still.This is hell. Some kids are bawling in the bathroom, there are only 10 or so (out of 25) that remained in class). Nobody has a dry eye right now. Some kids are angry and swearing, others are staring at their feet. We don't know how to deal with this. This town has virtually no crime, we were unprepared. permalinksave[+]Saucy_Taco 123 points124 points125 points 1 day ago (5 children)[]Saucy_Taco 123 points124 points125 points 1 day agoSandy Hook is my hometown too, and I just can't believe this.

Insurance is only required to cover mental health care "equally" as it does the rest. What this often means is that the psychologists and psychiatrists who would be of the most assistance are treated as "specialists", requiring a copay of 2-3x that of a general practitioner, despite having to see psychiatrists and psychologists at least once a month, on average, for any semblance of quality care. While they are required to cover the care, they are also not required to have any caregivers in-network. They are also not required to treat psychiatric prescriptions in the same way that they treat non-psychiatric meds. Often, this places the psych meds in the "premium" or "non-preferred" category.What does all of this mean, really? It means that I, a gainfully employed, 24 year old woman with bipolar disorder cannot afford the help I need, even with the addition of insurance and my husband's income. Copay for a visit to my primary care physician is $25, no matter how frequently I visit. Copay to see a psychologist or psychiatrist is $60. And that's if there's an in-network doctor. There isn't, through my insurance, a single in-network mental health care provider that isn't part of a hospital. Psychologists and psychiatrists at most of these hospitals are there for consultation or to deal with the mental ward, not to take on patients of their own.All told, in order for me to get the care I need to be "normal", I need to spend, in-network, $300 per month on doctors (psychologist, for therapy, once a week; psychiatrist, for meds, once a month), and another 50% of the $500/month that my meds cost (because, well, they're non-preferred medications). Out of network? I'm looking at $100 per visit (minimum), with the meds still at $250.I'm lucky. I have insurance. Those who are uninsured are even less likely to be able to get the help they need. Let alone those who are homeless.We need to fix the mental health care system. I think it would help everyone, not just those like me. I think it would help us see less violence in our society.permalinksaveparentload more comments(7 replies)[+]thenewmeta 745 points746 points747 points 1 day ago (61 children)[]thenewmeta 745 points746 points747 points 1 day agoIf you dont want to propagate more mass murders, dont start the story with sirens blaring.

And if they don't get them, they will make them.  And if they don't make them, they will use knives, axes, chainsaws, even a car, to do what they want to do.The secondary problem is weapons.

The shooter's mom was also a kindergarten teacherthere and was the target. I don't know any more than that.  EDIT3: Apparently the shooter's mother (Nancy Lanza) was not a teacher at Sandy Hook (at least in recent years)EDIT4: The teacher's aide that worked with my mother was shot in the foot and went into surgery this afternoon and is stable. She sat with the kindergarten children during lockdown and kept them calm despite her injury.EDIT5: Way to go media. We somehow went from "The shooters mother, a kindergarten teacher at Sandy Hook was shot in her classroom" to "The shooter's mom, enthusiastic collector of guns, was shot in her home.". Do they just make this shit up? Did anyone fact check?EDIT6: Just to highlight how screwed up the media coverage of this was, a radio program reported this afternoon that my mom was "unaccounted for" 7 hours after the incident. My mom actually got a laugh out of this :-)permalinksaveload more comments(19 replies)[+]griffith12 29 points30 points31 points 1 day ago (2 children)[]griffith12 29 points30 points31 points 1 day agoMy son is a kindergartener.

If these people can get help before they spiral out of control, maybe we wouldn't have these senseless mass murders.We also need to be able to force someone to do a mental evaluation or talk to someone. The really crazy people, don't know they are crazy. They will never get help because they believe nothing is wrong with them. But most have families and friends who know the truth.I have personal experience with this. It's impossible to commit someone, get a mental evaluation or do anything to help them if they don't want help or believe they need help.My dad was mentally ill, there is an increased risk for children to develop the same illness.I already told the rest of my family, if I go crazy like my Dad, put a bullet in my head, don't think twice about it.What he dealt with was horrible, what we dealt with was just as bad. We tried to get him help, we called the state, the hospital, spoke to psychiatrists and psychologists. "They couldn't do anything". That's what we were told. Nothing could be done if he didn't want help or admitting to hearing voices, seeing lasers, etc.He got worse over time. At one point, he started boiling water in the microwave. Claiming it was killing someone. He would take a laser pointer and run it up and down his head, did the same thing with a  flashlight. Then he go outside and shine it at something. He took coax cable and put it in ice, saying they were recording him.I'm glad that he didn't hurt anyone, but he could have. He was fixated on our old neighbors, who he had believed they were the ones doing this too him, talking to him. At times they were friends, sometimes they were enemies. He fired a gun in the house at the floor, we got rid of the gun.People want to focus on gun laws, we should focus on mental health laws.How many times do we see some crazy person rambling on the internet? We see it all the time, but we dismiss it. We ignore it. We want to believe they are just trolling or playing around.We can be blind to our own family.There is a difference between non-violent crazy and violent crazy. They both need help and attention.I wouldn't be surprised if this guy told someone like his mom his thoughts. I doubt he would tell her his plan, but I bet there were plenty of signs that were ignored.I would see a psychiatrist if it was free or affordable for me. My whole family could use therapy, I want it but it's not affordable.TL;DR Guns are only 1/2 the problem. We continue to ignore mental health laws. We need better healthcare, we need cheap and free ways for people to get help and speak to a mental health professional. We need an easier way to get people who don't want help, some help.permalinksaveload more comments(3 replies)[+]this_sort_of_thing 66 points67 points68 points 22 hours ago (5 children)[]this_sort_of_thing 66 points67 points68 points 22 hours agoSo there's TWO Ryan Lanza's in the area?

He killed her and killed some of the five year olds in the class. The second sick bastard I don't have much info on, but roomers around town say he/ she was dressed as a nun.

CNN had previously identified the mother as Nancy Lanza, a teacher at the Sandy Hook Elementary, according to law enforcement sources.The source also told CNN there was no body found in the house searched by authorities in Hoboken, New Jersey. Two law enforcement sources say a man was taken away from questioning from that house. He is believed to be the brother of the shooter, according to the sources.The first law enforcement source says the school shooter was dressed in "black battle fatigues and a military vest."The Bushmaster .223 found at the scene is a semi automatic weapon, the source says.
