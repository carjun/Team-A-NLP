I had to go to the doctor and they said it wasn't a big deal, just eat healthy and it will go away. I did eat better, but it kept growing and growing. The pain was unbearable, I was always having weird shits, it messed up my appetite and I could only eat certain stuff. I reacted bad to some foods too, even had to sto drinking because it would have seriously messed up the tumor itself and make it harder operate on. The doctors, throughout all this, did nothing to help but say I needed more rest. I looked sick man, people went out of their way to help me, trying to stay positive, but you could see in their eyes this thing woukd have me in the hospital soon and they knew it.And they were right. One day it started to drain unexpectedly, had to be rushed to the hospital. It was a battle and I was sick and fighting it for hours, but finally they had to cut the little bugger out of me. Something about the umbilical cord being too close to his neck or something.permalinksavecontextfull commentsaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
