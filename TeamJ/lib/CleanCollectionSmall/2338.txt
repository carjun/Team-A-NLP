The story that stands out the most to me was about a car that hit a deer. Pretty typical, a car on a country highway here in Illinois hit a deer and it flipped up into the windshield. However, it was the back side of the of the deer that penetrated through the glass, and it was still very much alive after the fact. The deer, finding itself stuck, was frantically trying to escape from the vehicle/windshield. As it was doing this it was kicking it's legs trying to "run away", resulting in the driver and passenger being stomped to death by deer hooves, trapped in their own car. When the rescue folks finally arrived the deer was still trying to escape, the people in the car already dead.That one really bugged me.Edit: I need to better illustrate the last sentence. It was about 30-45 minutes or so until rescue arrived on the scene - so that's 30 to 45 minutes of that deer stomping away in that car. I couldn't even imagine what it looked like inside.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood for Batch  by  SGV21in  steelers[+]superGreatAwesome 1 point2 points3 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]superGreatAwesome 1 point2 points3 points 11 days agoWhat a game, he should be proud.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGirl sleeps over, she gets your hoodie, you get these  by  nklenchikin  funny[+]superGreatAwesome 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]superGreatAwesome 0 points1 point2 points 19 days agoI'm not the only one! permalinksavecontextfull commentsSanta grabbed my shoulders and whispered in my ears, "what do you want for christmas this year handsome?"  by  dylguy94in  creepy[+]superGreatAwesome 1 point2 points3 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]superGreatAwesome 1 point2 points3 points 20 days agoNot creepy, kinda funny thoughpermalinksavecontextfull commentsI caught three boys trying to make off with one of our bikes right from our drive way.

I used to work at an ad agency here in Central Illinois and I worked with a lady who had a ton of alpacas, she even looks similar to the lady in your picture, same age range and all. Alas, it doesn't look like it's her. I even set up a webcam and ustream account for her to watch over her new-born alpacas from her office.But as someone from central Illinois, I can confirm this is oddly typical.
