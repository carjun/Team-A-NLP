ShootingPresident Barack Obama said he and first lady...Conn. Massacre Second-Deadliest School Shooting in U.S.Friday's horrific elementary school shooting...Earlier in the morning, 20-year-old Adam Lanza (pictured below) had stormed into Sandy Hook Elementary School and opened fire. Newtown Police Lt. George Sinko said on NBC's "Today" show it appeared Lanza shot his way into the school by shattering glass by the front door.By the time his shooting rampage had ended, 20 small children and six adults had been killed. He, too, was found dead at the scene. A woman believed to be his mother, Nancy Lanza, was also found shot dead in a Newtown home. Despite earlier reports, it did not appear she was a staff member at Sandy Hook Elementary. Newtown superintendent Dr. Janet Robinson told told NBC Connecticut that there was no record of Nancy Lanza in their database. She may have been a substitute teacher, but it was unclear.Investigators spent hours questioning Lanza's 24-year-old brother Ryan, who told them that Adam had a history of mental health issues and that they had not spoken in two years, NBCNews reported.It was the second-deadliest school shooting in American history, second only to the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting that killed 32.President Obama, addressing the nation for the second time, said Satuday that  in his weekly radio and Internet address that "every parent in America has a heart heavy with hurt."On Friday, Obama teared up as he talked about the young victims.The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old," he said at a news conference. "They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own."So our hearts are broken for them today."Adam Lanza carried four guns to the school on Friday, law enforcement officials told NBC News.Two 9mm handguns recovered at scenea Glock and a Sig Sauerwere legally purchased and registered to the shooters mother, Nancy Lanza. The make of the other two and whom they were registered to is not known.Officials told NBChe also had an assault-style rifle in the car but did not bring it into the school.On Tuesday of this week, law enforcement officials tell NBCNews, Adam  Lanza tried to buy a rifle at Dick's Sporting Goods in Danbury. The  store declined the sale, they say, partly because he did not want to  undergo the background check, and partly because Connecticut has a waiting  period, which he wouldn't agree to.We have a mountain of evidence, both physical and forensic, Lt. Sinko said on "Today." Obviously were not going to leave any stone unturned.Students and parents described a scene of terror when the shots rang out early Friday morning. Witnesses said the attack occurred during morning announcements.The brother of one student said his sister had heard screams coming over the intercom.When they were leaving the room  (state police) were telling the students to hold hands and close their eyes until they were outside, he said.Back at the vigil, mourners wrote messages on three easels erected at the entrance to the church."May God look after and take care of your little angels," one wrote. "We are so so sorry for your loss. God bless your families. His strength will guide you."Another wrote: "Sleep in heavenly peace."Becky Mantone, who drove three of her daughters from nearby Fairfield to the vigil, said she didn't know anyone directly impacted by the attack, but felt compelled to take part so they could provide some small bit of comfort to their neighbors."We wanted to give our support to this town," Mantone said while she and her daughters stood in a circle, cradling lit candles outside the church. "I hope people would help our town if God forbid something happened to us."As the investigation continues, officers have been assigned to the parents so the information is communicated directly to them, according to state police.Major crime detectives are still working the scene and their investigation won't be completed for another day and a half to two days, Lt. Vance said Saturday.Its going to be a long, painstaking process, he said.Authorities have appealed for privacy to families of the victims.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyGet the latest headlines sent to your inbox!Privacy Policy | More NewslettersPosted Dec 14, 2012Leave CommentsTop StoriesTODAYMOST WATCHEDMOST EMAILED Amid Tragedy, Stories of Heroism Emerge  Gunman's Aunt in Crystal Lake: He Was Raised By Good Parents  Chicago Reacts To Connecticut School Shooting  Teen Struggling With Cystic Fibrosis Keeps Performing  iPads Helping Doctors  Inside a Bikram Yoga Studio  WW II Fighter Plane Pulled From Lake Michigan  Court Invalidates Illinois Gun Laws  Final Supply Of Twinkies Arrives in Chicago  Obama Reacts to Connecticut School Shooting Follow nbcchicagoMore newsward-room Jackson Changed Records After Husband's Resignation: Reportlocal Oswego Schools Prep For Mayan Apocalypselocal Anonymous Donor Drops $20,000 in Salvation Army KettlesMore newsUS & Worldnational-international Amid Tragedy, Stories of Heroism Emergenational-international Hillary Clinton Faints, Recovering at Homenational-international Parents Asked Priest About Kids' Last MomentsMore national-internationalPhotos and Videosevents Steve Starr Tribute Eventevents Your #Chicagogram Photos: December 2012fashion Supermodels: Then and NowMore MultimediaWhat's NewNBCChicago Weather AppStay ahead of the storm with the NBC...
