Photos from the school evacuationThe shooting at a Connecticut elementary school sent frightened pupils into the parking lot.A law enforcement official in Washington said the attacker was a 20-year-old man with ties to the school and that one of the guns was a .223-caliber rifle. The official also said that New Jersey State Police were searching a location in that state in connection with the shootings. That official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the source was not authorized to speak on the record about the developing criminal investigation.Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was fine. Its alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America, he said.The superintendents office said the district had locked down schools in Newtown, about 60 miles northeast of New York City. Schools in neighboring towns also were locked down as a precaution.A dispatcher at the Newtown Volunteer Ambulance Corps said a teacher had been shot in the foot and taken to Danbury Hospital. Andrea Rynn, a spokeswoman at the hospital, said it had three patients from the school but she did not have information on the extent or nature of their injuries.State police said Newtown police called them around 9:40 a.m. A SWAT team was among the throngs of police to respond.A photo posted by The Newtown Bee newspaper showed a group of young students  some crying, others looking visibly frightened  being escorted by adults through a parking lot in a line, hands on each others shoulders.Mergim Bajraliu, 17, heard the gunshots echo from his home and raced to check on his 9-year-old sister at the school. He said his sister, who was fine, heard a scream come over the intercom at one point. He said teachers were shaking and crying as they came out of the building. Everyone was just traumatized, he said.Richard Wilfords 7-year-old son, Richie, is in the second grade at the school. His son told him that he heard a noise that sounded like what he described as cans falling.The boy told him a teacher went out to check on the noise, came back in, locked the door and had the kids huddle up in the corner until police arrived. Theres no words, Wilford said. Its sheer terror, a sense of imminent danger, to get to your child and be there to protect him.The White House said Barack Obama was notified of the shooting and his spokesman Jay Carney said the president had enormous sympathy for families that are affected.___Associated Press writers Jim Fitzgerald in Newtown, Pete Yost in Washington, D.C., and Michael Melia in Hartford contributed to this report.Copyright 2012 The Associated Press.
