But can someone explain this to me. American pro-gunners (of which there seem to be very many), say that having guns is safer than not having guns - because it causes a bit of a standoff situation where "You don't fuck with me, and I won't fuck with you". Hence guns deterring gun crime.Well. I call fucking bullshit on that, again. Clearly, when you have people with guns and they target a place like a school where kids don't have guns to "protect themselves", the pro-gun for less-gun-crime argument is totally void. Unless of course you suggest we give elementary school kids weapons? Maybe just the odd scud missile?permalinksave[+]JimminyLummox 1 point2 points3 points 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]JimminyLummox 1 point2 points3 points 29 minutes agoI hear ya,and pretty much agree, however the reality is that gun laws aren't going to stop criminals from getting guns.  If someone is sick enough to shoot up a school, they're going to break the law and get a gun.   I don't know what can stop shootings like this, but gun laws won't do a darn thing to help.permalinksaveparent[+]Kastro187420 7 points8 points9 points 31 minutes ago (4 children)[]Kastro187420 7 points8 points9 points 31 minutes agoI call Bullshit on your reasoning. Explain to me again how criminals respect laws and will just stop using guns because people ask them to. I would love to hear how you plan to make that happen.permalinksaveparent[+]teckademic -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]teckademic -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes agoRight... and look at everything else that is illegal and it still being done. Drunk driving kills people but we aren't banning alcohol, Kids are over dosing on prescription drugs and those are still accessible. Banning guns will not stop PEOPLE from killing other people.permalinksaveparent[+]lonelyinacrowd 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (2 children)[]lonelyinacrowd 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoWell, first you change the 2nd amendment. Then you ban companies from selling guns and ammunition. Then you make it illegal for people to carry guns (except cops). If you get caught with a gun, you get fined and the gun is confiscated. Then you do a massive series of anti-gun = anti-murder campaigns, that make people with guns seem like insecure dangerous idiots to stigmatise gun ownership, which enforces a positive anti-gun social reaction.Of course it's not going to change things over night. But a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. At the moment, the USA is walking blind and backwards.permalinksaveparent[+]Kastro187420 -1 points0 points1 point 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]Kastro187420 -1 points0 points1 point 12 minutes agoSo basically we say "Screw the constitution", lie to everyone in an attempt to brainwash them, and then punish anyone with intelligence who knows better.I'm sure glad you're not in charge of politics here.permalinksaveparent[+]DeskFlyer 0 points1 point2 points 4 minutes ago (0 children)[]DeskFlyer 0 points1 point2 points 4 minutes agoThe black market would negate everything you just suggested.permalinksaveparent[+]cavehobbit 2 points3 points4 points 31 minutes ago (0 children)[]cavehobbit 2 points3 points4 points 31 minutes agoTrying to understand what is happening and who is doing it, is one thing. Standing on dying children for political points is evil. Whether it is the idiots saying it is a gun-free zone or OMG Guns R BAD!!permalinksaveparent[+]SunflowerFortunado 3 points4 points5 points 25 minutes ago (3 children)[]SunflowerFortunado 3 points4 points5 points 25 minutes ago You're an idiot for even turning this into a debate at this time. Do you really think somebody this insane would not have done something like this without a gun?  Guns aren't the only thing that kills you fool. In China the other day 22 people were stabbed with a knife.  So much for no guns and they'll just stop. Automatic weapons are illegal in California.  Guess what, PEOPLE STILL GET FUCKING KILLED FROM THEM ALL THE TIME THERE.  If there's not a way to get rid of every one, your plan would never work and just leave law abiding gun owners like me without a weapon to protect my own family.permalinksaveparent[+]didymusIII 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]didymusIII 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago22 stabbed but NOBODY DIED - Huge difference - can you not see that?permalinksaveparent[+]lonelyinacrowd 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago1) Ad hominem, nice2 & 3) Funny you mention the China attack, guess how many of the 22 people stabbed died? ZERO4) Guns don't protect people. See my above comment, and the fact a while bunch of kids just got murdered.Of course you can't get rid of every single gun - so what? If there was 1 gun in the USA, do you think you'd be in danger? No of course not, the chances of you being affected would be less than winning the lottery. The same logic goes for if there's only 1000 guns, or 10000 guns. You're still safer than if there are hundreds of millions of guns, with basically no restrictions on who owns them.You could do a lot if your government took a full anti-gun stance. Firstly you massively stigmatise gun ownership with national campaigns. You ban buying and selling of all guns and ammunition to those who don't have a license, and you make licenses really really tight (farmers/rural hunters only and no handguns or automatics). You make gun possession without licence illegal and confiscate and fine any perpetrators. You then do an attractive amnesty, where you give people cash back for their guns.permalinksaveparent[+]stortz 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]stortz 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agoI'm not pro-gun or anti-gun or anything related to that, but you can't kill 27 people with a knife without being some kind of professional assassin.permalinksaveparent[+]smitty42 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes ago (0 children)[]smitty42 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes agoIt's silly go say that the people who disagree with you would argue the kids need guns to defend them selves. What would be argued is that teachers should have guns to defend the kids. You should know this, and I think it is dishonest to pick such a silly example to expect from your opponents.permalinksaveparent[+]teatimes 1 point2 points3 points 20 minutes ago (1 child)[]teatimes 1 point2 points3 points 20 minutes agoThe uk banned guns after the last school shooting here and there hasn't been another one since. Maybe the us could have a trial period of banning guns it's not like things will get any worse.permalinksaveparent[+]DeskFlyer 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]DeskFlyer 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoThat doesn't mean one won't happen there tomorrow.permalinksaveparent[+]NathanielNimtz 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]NathanielNimtz 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoLet people have guns, and both good and evil people will have guns. Keep people from having guns, and only the evil will surely have them.permalinksaveparent[+]giritrobbins 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes ago (1 child)[]giritrobbins 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes agoAs others have said, criminals will always be able to get guns it is a matter of fact. The thing is a higher proportion of gun owners does actually track with fewer crimes. I know this isn't a great link because it has bias but it still makes the points.http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/493636.htmlAs for your argument we don't know why the school was targeted but kids are pretty helpless. There is an article on /r/worldnews that is stating a mass killing in China also just occurred with a knife. permalinksaveparent[+]lonelyinacrowd 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]lonelyinacrowd 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoNot a mass killing. A mass attack. Not one of the children died (although sadly 2 are quite seriously ill).Feel free to come at me with more arguments I can easily debunk.Please see the wood for the trees.
