But will it bring lawmakers to their senses?The addition of more than two dozen innocents  most of them kindergarteners  to the ranks of the countrys victims of gun-wielding mass murderers is shameful. It also seemed to be a tipping point for a number of elected officials, President Obama among them, who wiped away tears as he spoke Friday of the children lost and the families shattered.The president also spoke of taking meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. He was echoed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said the nation must, crack down on the guns.Similar comments have followed past mass shootings. As has little action. Lawmakers would honor the victims of Newtown, Conn., by beginning a meaningful conversation on how to reduce gun-related violence.TweetEmailPrintShareLinkedInTumblrStumbleUponRedditDel.icio.usDiggAAView Comments|Share your thoughts More In OpinionADVERTISEMENTFind us on FacebookMost PopularMost CommentedMore Headlines1Rose Chase accused of killing husband2Buffalo Bills' offense has slumped of late, much to coach Chan Gailey's chagrin3Man flips car, arrested on DWI, drug charges4Police release details in fatal East Rochester crash5Missing Brighton girl located, is unharmed18Gov.
