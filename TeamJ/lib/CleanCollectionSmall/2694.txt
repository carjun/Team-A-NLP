I have to work at several schools and it totally fucking boils my blood that I'm made to be more afraid of "the law" than monsters like this. I'm to leave my gun in the car and disarm myself so people like this can have an easy task of killing unarmed people.permalinksaveparent[+]redzero519  comment score below threshold (5 children)[]redzero519 -6 points-5 points-4 points 2 hours agoYou are not Rambo.

I don't put on the action music and dress up in fatigues when I go to the grocery store but I sure as hell put a pistol in my holster. It's called self-defense.

Most CC people are trained.  You don't need to be trained to buy a gun legally.  And not having a CC permit isn't going to prevent you from going and shooting up a school.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 9 points10 points11 points 2 hours ago (11 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 9 points10 points11 points 2 hours agoI'm not sure what you're saying. Concealed carry people are shooting up schools?permalinksaveparent[+][deleted]  comment score below threshold (10 children)[][deleted] -8 points-7 points-6 points 2 hours ago*No.  I'm saying that you don't need to get any training, and hardly even get a background check to buy a gun.  If everyone who bought a gun have to go through what you have to to get a CC permit, I would be happier with gun laws.Edit: Someone tell me how requiring training to buy a gun is fucking unreasonable? permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours ago (9 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours agohardly even get a background check to buy a gun.Background checks are required for gun purchases from FFLs.I'm fine with requiring reasonable training to buy a gun(maybe just handguns), as long as there are no waiting periods, and the training must be paid for by taxes and provided for free to American citizens.But this will not reduce crime by any means. Not at all.Why? Because criminals will buy illegal guns and not go through the training.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 hours ago (8 children)[][deleted] -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 hours agoTell me why waiting periods are bad?  It seems perfectly reasonable for someone to have to wait to buy a gun.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoIt is annoying, and doesn't prevent crime. Criminals do not pass background checks, and don't usually buy their guns from FFLs.I often buy two or three guns at one time, it would be really annoying to have to wait.permalinksaveparent[+]fishsounds 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (6 children)[]fishsounds 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoWhat purpose do they serve?

Goes to walmart.  Gets shotgun.  Kills wife.Guy is raging that his wife left him.  Has to wait a few days.  Decides not to kill wife.  And I know what your response will be.  You will say he will just find another way to kill her.  And that might be true.  But I think the likelyhood of him killing someone goes up pretty substantially if he gets a gun as opposed to trying to strangle her.  Strangling a person is hard.  Shooting a person is not.permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]thisautoguy 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]thisautoguy 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agono, but knowing there are people there who  carry might...permalinksaveparent[+]ryan_m 25 points26 points27 points 2 hours ago (36 children)[]ryan_m 25 points26 points27 points 2 hours agoWhy does everyone always assume that the gunmen in these situations are basically SEAL team members and armed citizens are bumbling assholes?Usually, people that are licensed to carry concealed are MUCH better shots than the vast majority of the population and likely the majority of police too. permalinksaveparent[+][deleted]  comment score below threshold (35 children)[][deleted] -13 points-12 points-11 points 2 hours agoWhy does everyone assume that people carrying guns are Navy Seals and could take down a gunman amidst chaos and panic without downing a few innocents?permalinksaveparent[+]ryan_m 20 points21 points22 points 2 hours ago (20 children)[]ryan_m 20 points21 points22 points 2 hours agoI can't speak for everyone, but I'd trust the shooting of a licensed shooter over a police officer.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted]  comment score below threshold (18 children)[][deleted] -12 points-11 points-10 points 2 hours agoThat's funny.  permalinksaveparent[+]Bloodysneeze 11 points12 points13 points 2 hours ago (16 children)[]Bloodysneeze 11 points12 points13 points 2 hours agoI bet you think the police officers get a lot of firearm training.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted]  comment score below threshold (11 children)[][deleted] -7 points-6 points-5 points 2 hours agoI bet you think people who legally buy guns get a lot of training.permalinksaveparent[+]Bloodysneeze 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (9 children)[]Bloodysneeze 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours agoThere's a big difference between gun buyers and CCW carriers.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 hours ago (8 children)[][deleted] -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 hours agoThat's the point.  You don't need any training or testing or even a background check to buy a fucking gun.

I have shot hundreds more rounds as a private citizen in the last month than I did in two years as a police officer. permalinksaveparent[+]Nickdanger3rdEye -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 hours ago (3 children)[]Nickdanger3rdEye -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 hours agoThey do if they aren't a shit force.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (1 child)[]montyjack 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours agoContrary to popular belief, most cops train with their guns about once a year.  If you look at the ESB shooting that happened a few months back, the gunman hit his target and left.

You ever wonder why the chilling security footage of these criminals always shows them calmly walking through their target school, shooting at will?  It's because no one is armed and capable of stopping them.  "gun free zones" are the ONLY places these things happen in.Even if the odds of an armed civilian stopping a lunatic shooting up a school are only 25%, I'll take those odds.  If the choice is certain death or a chance at survival, I'll take survival every time.permalinksaveparent[+]derrick81787 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoWhy is the evil gunman always the more skilled one in these examples?  You make it sound easy, like Gadsden doesn't even have a chance.Also, the gunman already has guns.  These things never end because the shooter doesn't have a gun he can use.  They end when the shooter is killed or when the shooter chooses to stop.permalinksaveparent[+]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (1 child)[]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoThey're called gunmen because they already brought guns.Nope, just let them finish. It'll be better for everyone if you just let them finish.permalinksaveparent[+]DeadComma 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes ago (0 children)[]DeadComma 0 points1 point2 points 39 minutes agoBut the problem is.. everybody with a grudge becomes a potential gunman when there is a gun in the vicinity.
