Sources said Adam Lanza smashed parts of his compute, and investigators have been working on trying to salvage what they can.So far, they said nothing has been found.We also learned Lanza shot his mother four times at their home while she was likely sleeping in bed. He then packed up his mother's cars with guns and made his way to the school. There, he shot out the glass near the front door and then went inside armed with an assault rifle and two handguns.After shooting the principal and another staff member, he turned left toward the first graders, where he shot and killed 20 students and four more adults. CBS is reporting that first responders spotted Lanza at the end of the hallway, ducking from view.It was at that point he used one of the handguns and took his own life by shooting himself in the head.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is still very much involved in the investigation by visiting local gun shops and shooting ranges, searching for any clues that may lead investigators to a possible motive of the shooting.Investigators are still trying to get a better sense of who Lanza was.Lanza was considered socially awkward and an outcast, according to Richard Novia, who used to work in security for the Newtown School District.  He said Nancy Lanza was very involved in Adam's education by volunteering at school all the time.  Eyewitness News learned Lanza did undergo some sort of psychiatric evaluation sometime within the past few years, and investigators are working to talk to the doctor who performed that evaluation and track down any paperwork.  But overall, Novia was surprised by the deadly rampage that left 20 children and 7 adults, including Lanza's mother, dead."He had some social disorders, poor personal skills," Novia said.  "We felt strongly he could develop. He was highly intelligent, but how do you inject him in the system and develop him socially?"The shooting investigation is expected to last months.Copyright 2012 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).
