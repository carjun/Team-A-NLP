You've just brought us back full circle.If we're talking, specifically, about mental health issues, then so be it.  We had one nut in China slash 22 kids going to school.  We had one nut in America shoot 20 kids going to school (notwithstanding 6 adults as well).  One set of kids will see their parents again, the other won't.Why do I focus on this?  Because if we can't stop all the crazies in the world at least, at the very least we can hamper their criminality.  It is possible.All of our efforts failing should show you inarguably that all of our efforts can still fail. That's my point.We haven't even come close to trying 'all our efforts'.  If one state institutes strict gun controls, and another state employs lax gun laws, then you've certainly haven't even come close to trying 'all your efforts'.  Everything you've done is moot, because the boat is still leaking from the other side.permalinksavecontextfull comments"...if you dont want to propagate more mass murderers..." - Dr. Park Elliott Dietz [1920x1080]  by  iruber1337in  QuotesPorn[+]Kaiosama 4 points5 points6 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]Kaiosama 4 points5 points6 points 14 hours agoIf 24 kids had died from cancer, we would be fighting to fund a cure.  If 24 kids had died from terrorist bombing, we would be tripping over ourselves to make sure it never happens again.But if 24 kids die from gun violence, we're just supposed to throw our hands up and say 'oh, well nothing can be done'?  Really?permalinksavecontextfull commentsBros with siblings  by  eyobromoin  gaybros[+]Kaiosama 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]Kaiosama 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agoAs long as individuals own firearms people will be able to do things like this. When I live in a country where it is as easy as it is for a criminal to get a gun you can bet your ass I want to be able to have one myself.And yet it's a catch 22.  You live in a country where it's easy for a criminal to acquire guns specifically because it's easy for *everyone* to acquire guns.Not being able to acquire firearms as easily doesn't necessarily translate to banning outright.  But at least there should be some checks and balances.I cant say that my having a gun in a situation where I can save a life is going to result in anything but my own death, but I would rather be able to try to take the bastard with me.At least you're pragmatic.I didn't get that impression from your previous post.permalinksavecontextfull comments"...if you dont want to propagate more mass murderers..." - Dr. Park Elliott Dietz [1920x1080]  by  iruber1337in  QuotesPorn[+]Kaiosama 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]Kaiosama 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoIn china, 22 kids were slashed yesterday.  All of them will still be with their parents come the end of the year.The crazy man went nuts, and yet didn't have the tool to finish the job.  So "it" is preventable... but it might be too late for the US.permalinksavecontextfull comments"...if you dont want to propagate more mass murderers..." - Dr. Park Elliott Dietz [1920x1080]  by  iruber1337in  QuotesPorn[+]Kaiosama 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]Kaiosama 2 points3 points4 points 15 hours agoExactly.The local news here in the tri-state NY metro area is nothing but murder, violence, every now and again sexual assault, hit-and-run accidents, freak accidents in general, and on and on and on and on...Every night the news is about someone dying in whatever way they can find.  If a mass-murderer weren't on TV, it would be something else.The nightly news is likely violence-porn at this point, but hey, it brings in viewers... so it is what it is.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBros with siblings  by  eyobromoin  gaybros[+]Kaiosama 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]Kaiosama 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoI hope that someone will be appropriately armed, trained and available if your loved ones need to be defended.Do you honestly think that could've helped in this situation?

They would be dead had this been a gun.But of course let's toss out that number of 22 children 'slashed'... as though being slashed amounts to instantly dropping dead.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Kaiosama -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Kaiosama -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours agoIt seems that the countries with more gun control still experience greatly higher murder rates.Australia instituted strict gun control following a mass killing in the 90s, and they haven't had another one for decades.The problem is that such regulation has to be instituted across the board, across the entire country, and in every state at the same time in order to have an effect.If you have gun control in one state and none in a neighboring, all you're doing is supplying guns to criminals.  Hell, you don't even need to look at just the US... look at the impact the US is currently having on Mexico for example.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Once a decade, once every two decades?  As a matter of fact, when was the last mass shooting ever in Norway?Here in the US, we seem to be having these killings almost monthly it seems.I swear, they're so common-place now.  The only thing that's shocking is it's an elementary school, and most of the victims are children.  But had this been in a mall it would almost be run-of-the-mill.. which is pretty sad to say.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

But god forbid you bring it up as a problem on reddit.Even here, where people are supposed to be logical, the overwhelming sentiment is that there is no problem with simply handing out guns without psych evals.Everytime you even mention it, people start taking offense.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

What I'm asking is 'how regularly of an occurrence is it'.  And is it comparable to the mass shootings here in the US.They have over a billion, we have a little over 300 million.
