Being reimbursed by the USAF for the money spent traveling to and staying in the base hotel at MCGuire for my flight physical has taken well over a month and that is only $150 they owe me (which i desperately need ARGH!) so I can grasp at what you're trying to tell me. Hopefully the good intentions/vibes you've brought to my thread will manifest themselves in another Redditor being able to assist me. I am so anxious for OTS to start and would hate for my TS clearance to be delayed or any other issues to arise over a few hundred dollars. If your husband and yourself frequent /r/AirForce at all then maybe I will run into you guys on there sometime in the future once I'm already in Maxwell or even Pensacola for flight school afterwards.

That's not mentioning the logistics of my Commander's Call meetings monthly until I fly off to Maxwell as part of the DEP program, the lease on my apartment still needing to be paid off amongst other responsibilities. It is not that I will never have the money to catch up on these bills, it's the fact that the state of NY may string me along a bit TOO long for the creditors liking. Situationally, as well as logistically a short-term money loan that I could repay back with interest  would be ideal. Your generosity did not go unnoticed, not even close, especially since it seemed you created that account just to respond to myself and one other person's request for help. Very kind-hearted of you.permalinksavecontextfull comments[REQ] Air Force Officer to-be behind on bills prior for leaving for OTS (x/post from /r/loans)  by  frishdawgzin  Assistance[+]frishdawgz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]frishdawgz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoThat is such an incredible offer.. more than I would ever expect, thank you! Hopefully something that drastic should'n't be necessary as I do qualify for extended UI benefits but it is simply taking too long for the funds to reach me as I was unaware I needed to refile my claim at the 1 year mark. Once I do get the funds owed to me they will be backdated so the $930 I am currently owed will all be given to me plus what I receive weekly going forward ($310). Main issue is that Verizon and Citi and Capital One and Con Ed aren't too keen on hearing me out :(permalinksavecontextfull comments[REQ] Air Force Officer to-be behind on bills prior for leaving for OTS (x/post from /r/loans)  by  frishdawgzin  Assistance[+]frishdawgz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]frishdawgz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoPM sent.permalinksavecontextfull comments[REQ] Air Force Officer to-be behind on bills prior for leaving for OTS (x/post from /r/loans)  by  frishdawgzin  Assistance[+]frishdawgz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]frishdawgz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agosure..

There would be less open perimeter shots for our long-range snipers without Felton's superior dribble penetration and ability to break down a defender 1-on-1. That's not even mentioning the humongous liability the PG position would be on the defensive end without Ray-Ray.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat would you do if the Lakers came to us today and offered us the following, one-time-only offer?  by  bookey23in  NYKnicks[+]frishdawgz 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]frishdawgz 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoI'm not so sure about packaging Shump.

He isn't blocking enough shots from the weak side or even really altering many as he seems to avoid leaving the floor whenever he can on the defensive end. I dunno about it being an injury though.. especially after 17 rebounds tonight and the way he has been running the floor and getting to the line when he is hit in transition so I'm as confused as everyone else.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
