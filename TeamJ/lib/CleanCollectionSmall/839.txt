I'm in a Big Ten school as well. College is a wonderful opportunity to find yourself and figure out what you want to do with this life. Enjoy every second of the next four years, because they will fly right by (trust me, I'm about to graduate soon). Oh yeah, and good choice on a Big Ten school. Great party schools, with wonderful academics. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho here likes to write?  by  wtf_shroomin  trees[+]wtf_shroom[S] 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]wtf_shroom[S] 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoDude I think we just invented a new form of psychology. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho here likes to write?  by  wtf_shroomin  trees[+]wtf_shroom[S] 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]wtf_shroom[S] 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoYou could essentially map out your personal thought process.
