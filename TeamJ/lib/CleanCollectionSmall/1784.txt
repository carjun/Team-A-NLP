Technically legal because of bullshit - but it is a complete scam. You CAN make money out of it, but it is only by scamming it out of other people - who end up being your relatives, friends and everyone you meet. You'll then become hated by pretty much everyone later on.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow fake images change our memory and behavior. Doctored images can affect what we eat, how we vote and even our childhood recollections. The question scientists are asking is why theres nothing we can do to stop it.  by  Libertateain  science[+]9fdkwm8djuamn -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago*(0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago*To be fair, professional witnesses are usually taught how to be more or less impartial. This effect is covered in training and all fields are aware of it.And anyone who takes testimonies from normal witnesses knows how not to contaminate them and distort their memories, unless of course he or she is heavily incompetent.P.S. Not a cop, but I took same class for testimonies they usually take here. And please, this is not about driving offenses.P.P.S. IMO, problem is not with accepting witness testimonies, but rather shitty defense lawyers, possibly biased jury/judges and incompetent LEOs at times.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTwinkie CEO Admits Company Took Employees Pensions and Put It Toward Executive Pay  by  maxwellhillin  politics[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*Make note that there was no bailout for Hostess. It was normal bankruptcy.As for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, it is made to protect private pension plans. That's the intended mechanic. It's a whole new ball game.But yeah, prosecution of CEOs that drove Hostess into the ground would be great. They alone aren't capable of paying off these pensions though, so taxpayers are on the hook regardless. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTwinkie CEO Admits Company Took Employees Pensions and Put It Toward Executive Pay  by  maxwellhillin  politics[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*There was DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed in 2010. It isn't perfect, but it's something.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTwinkie CEO Admits Company Took Employees Pensions and Put It Toward Executive Pay  by  maxwellhillin  politics[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*Essentially, when a company or institution becomes too big to fail, meaning it needs to be bailed out or we risk economic collapse - it becomes regulated and can't do same risky deals it did before. This slows down sudden spikes in economy, but it makes it a lot more stable. DoddFrank Wall Street Reform is a recommended read on that matter.Without these regulations, these companies essentially hold entire economy hostage. It's more or less what happened not long ago.But anyway - Yes, you can let bank robbers shoot all their hostages... that could possibly send a message to bank robbers to never take hostages again - sure. But that would also mean customers who could become hostages would never go there again. Who wants to risk getting shot? And no customers = no business.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTwinkie CEO Admits Company Took Employees Pensions and Put It Toward Executive Pay  by  maxwellhillin  politics[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI think that's a very deep question that can't be answered by just pure ideology. It depends on numbers, by how much it can affect the economy.A bank failing can, for example, easily ruin other banks or companies due to spillover effect. Entire financial industry could have been affected. Plenty of companies that build houses or grow crops would then be the target. Slowdown of economy and recession then follow. It is not even limited to one country - global business means everyone will be affected and ultimately blame US for damaging their economy, thus making US less attractive business investment later on.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTwinkie CEO Admits Company Took Employees Pensions and Put It Toward Executive Pay  by  maxwellhillin  politics[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoBailouts are to prevent further damage to the economy, so actions of the company don't damage it even more. It shouldn't be canceled because of notion of punishment.Now, proper regulation and enforcement is where prevention and punishment of such actions should occur. That's how I see it at least.

Yes, you did. At very least, you implied.The youth demographic has always been liberal, basically throughout history. Then you use the quoteIt was Winston Churchill who said, "If you're not liberal at age 18 you have no heart, if you're not conservative at age 40 you have no brain".Then you try pass the quote as a fact.This is not something specific to this past electionokayIt's not my personal opinion, it's a quote. It's also not an opinion to say that young people tend to be more liberal and old people tend to be more conservative, that's absolutely true today.Yet this is not what you said. Today is not always. You state something without data, then you imply a causation link with a quote. Which also has no data. You should re-read yourself.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDaily Mail deletes top comment over death of Nurse who answered prank call to Duchess of Cambridge because it finger points the press as the cause of problem.  by  sutiivein  worldnews[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago*(0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago*How do you do this?

Answer: no.Common conceptions are NOT evidence. So you shouldn't claim your statement as correct or truth. It should be prefaced with "it is my personal opinion" then.In the absense of evidence, you don't rely on anything to define truth. You tell - "I don't know". But must I remind you that there is indeed evidence. Those studies joeflux posted are still correct in pointing out that people generally have more liberal views. They are at least a lot better that thinking something is correct because someone said that quote in the past...permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is r/politics so anti-GOP?  by  bearface93in  Republican[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoHow has it been "around for ~150 years at least, spanning two continents"? How? You point out faults in studies, that is okay. But then you don't bring up any evidence of your own, only anecdotal and subjective perspective. That does not confirm your point in any way.If anything, these studies still weight more towards your statement being incorrect. Feel free to find actual evidence supporting your position if you wish.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is r/politics so anti-GOP?  by  bearface93in  Republican[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago*(0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago*Depends what exactly. You get downvoted in /r/republican for saying "all liberals are complete idiots", that is correct. Is that a valid conservative opinion? I would think not - otherwise I'd encourage you to reevaluate your political theory.Btw, I've scouted /r/conservative since it became private - plenty of "all liberals are idiots" being upvoted. And if you try to pass liberals as something more that complete demons... you have good chances of being downvoted there. I don't think it's helping them in any way to understand their ideology.It's true that /r/politics does that with blaming and generalizing republicans as well. That is not correct way to act - but that doesn't excuse the other side to act the same way.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is r/politics so anti-GOP?  by  bearface93in  Republican[+]9fdkwm8djuamn -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago*(0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago*Except, is there any evidence that people actually become more conservative as they get older? (http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/14ogk6/why_is_rpolitics_so_antigop/c7f1xxe)Plenty of things were said in the past. Doesn't mean they are right.

I do want people to make right decisions - that's why I advocate regulation.Keep in mind, I'm not advocating banning unhealthy foods. And neither did Yoni Freedhoff. I am advocating regulations in place that prohibit and fine companies that lie or misinform their customers on their products. Simply put, if food is unhealthy - companies shouldn't be able to brand it as healthy.As for corruption in government... That too is something to fight against. Corporate lobbying is shoddy and almost always unethical - but that doesn't excuse society from trying to solve the problem. You can't just sit on your arse and say "everything gets corrupted anyway". Your country wouldn't even be founded if people took this attitude.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPhysician calls on redditors to spread the word about misleading food industry practices  by  livingonasongin  videos[+]9fdkwm8djuamn 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]9fdkwm8djuamn 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoThat is not what he said. Regulation is easy. For example, they can't say it's healthy if it's NOT HEALTHY. That is a regulation.The whole problem is that companies can lie and manipulate. More sugar in food is addictive and makes customers buy it more. So they put it in, despite it being highly damaging to people. Put a "Healthy" word in it - AND EVERYONE WILL BUY IT. Companies that try to keep their foods healthy are put in disadvantage since they don't put in more addictive sugar.Result? Profits for company, while customers are scammed out of health and money.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
