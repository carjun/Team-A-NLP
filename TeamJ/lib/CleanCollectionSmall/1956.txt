My grandfather passed away quite a few years ago on Christmas Eve. I remember bawling and calling the airport to get last minute flights for my mom and other family members. It was horrible because we were right in the middle of sitting down to eat dinner and everyone was laughing and cracking jokes right before we got the call. Even though it was about 8 years ago I still think about it every Christmas Eve. Also, my cousin suddenly passed away in 2005 and his birthday was on Christmas Eve :/permalinksaveparent[+]mjxl47 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]mjxl47 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI agree; my grandfather passed away just after Christmas last year.

Some parents where just yesterday worrying about how much money they had to waste in buying their children games and toys.   Hell, some of them even bought it and have them wrapped under the tree even!  I think that this situation, though horrible any time of the year, is just unreal at this time.permalinksaveparent[+]kphlax42 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]kphlax42 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoThese parents are Getting ready for Christmas...

Then that time of the year would be the horror time for that family. But yeah feels worse since Christmas is seen as the children's holiday, so everyone else who isn't struck by this tragedy feels more for the family because they assume it would be worse for the family now.  permalinksaveparent[+]thestraylightpun 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]thestraylightpun 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoIt's more that there is going to be constant reminders everywhere they go.

The reminders might be more glaring around Christmas but that is because it's such a big holiday worldwide, but you can be sure that no matter what date it occurred the families would feel all the reminders. permalinksaveparent[+]jeremybryce 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]jeremybryce 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoPresents. They will be left unopened... or returned. One more thing that will need to be done... and each present will be a reminder of them opening it on Christmas morning... and the excitement and joy in their faces that now will not happen or ever again. But yeah pretend that its somehow not worse right before Christmas. permalinksaveparent[+]gressie -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]gressie -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours agoI think most of the people who downvoted me are misunderstanding me. You lost your goddamn child, murdered. The parents don't give a flying fuck if it's right before this overhyped holiday. You think the parents would have a merry christmas if their child was murdered in March? They would still think about what to buy their kid and how they can't do that now. Jesus Christ, don't touch the american xmas spirit. Losing your child right before the holidays is infinitely worse than any other time of the year, am I right?permalinksaveparent[+]Ledatru 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Ledatru 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agohttp://www.theonion.com/articles/hundreds-of-people-who-will-die-before-christmas-r,30707/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_campaign=standard-post:headline:defaultpermalinksaveparent[+][deleted] -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[][deleted] -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours agoNo one cares it was near Christmas.Seriously.No one, not a single person, related to one of the young victims cares that Christmas is around the corner.
