I'm a bit more depressed lately, and although my neurologist is planning on taking me off of it now that I've started Lyrica, it's going to be a year-long process.  Take to your doctor and see if they can switch you over to something else (or at least discuss your situation with them) before you become too dependent on the pheno.  Tegretol treated me well for about 15 years, and the Lyrica has been fairly side-effect-free so far.Good luck.permalinksavecontextfull commentsmy whole life i have had really bad eyes, but today i woke up with perfect vision, freaked out about it only to realise i had forgotten to remove my contacts before bed.

One day I just snapped and wrote a nasty letter to him, inviting him to stop by so we could "discuss" the situation, and got right up in his face when he arrived.  I'm 5'11" and 140lbs fully dressed, and he is an ex-marine who is well over 6' and 200+lbs, but that meant nothing to me.  All I saw was red.  Someone dragged me back into the house before my neighbor could beat the shit out of me, but I was shaking with anger for at least an hour afterwards.Best of luck to you, this rage thing doesn't happen to everyone.  I've heard of more than a few success stories involving Keppra.permalinksavecontextfull commentsClear EEG came back, still exhibiting symptoms of temp. lobe epilepsy. So frustrating!

I don't even like doing this, because for every person complaining about a repost, there's someone like me, pointing out you're not supposed to bitch about reposts....instead of posting the most famous save of all time, post a less famous, but equally cool save.No argument from me here, but sometimes you just have to work around it.  The person who reposted this gif will respond more strongly to their post being downvoted into oblivion, than to a complaint that they will most likely never even read.  And even if they don't stop reposting it, you can always unsubscribe from the sub-Reddit.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNot in my house  by  stlepinin  gifs[+]quit_complaining 5 points6 points7 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]quit_complaining 5 points6 points7 points 1 month agoYes, I do.  Maybe not from you personally, but in almost every message thread with more than 100 posts, you will find someone bitching about reposts.This is the first time I have seen this particular gif, or even heard of this goalie.  This is not a repost for me, and I'm sure it's a first for plenty of other folks.If you don't like it, downvote and move on (like you usually do).  Then see what you can do about getting a plane ticket to Colombia, so you can hunt down and punch this guy.  But I guarantee you'll continue to run across this gif, even after his nose is broken and his stupid stache is ripped off.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNot in my house  by  stlepinin  gifs[+]quit_complaining 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]quit_complaining 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoI see a post like this at least once every day.
