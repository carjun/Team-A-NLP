The song reached number one on the Billboard Top Tracks chart in October 1982. Released as the second single from I Can't Stand Still, it peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1983. The single was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1983, representing shipments of one million records.[1]Contents1 History2 Chart3 Cover versions4 See also5 References[edit] HistoryThe song is about the callousness (and callowness) of TV news reporting as well as the tabloidization of all news. Henley sings from the standpoint of a news anchorman who "could have been an actor, but I wound up here", and thus is not a real journalist. The song's theme is that TV news coverage focuses too much on negative and sensationalist news; in particular, deaths, disasters, and scandals, with little regard to the consequences or for what is important ("We all know that crap is king"). The song was inspired by the intrusive press coverage surrounding the deaths of John Belushi and Natalie Wood, and Henley's own arrest in 1981.[2] Lines in the second verse, "Is the head dead yet?", were likely inspired by the shooting of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, and specifically, the erroneous reports by all major news outlets that James Brady, Reagan's Press Secretary, had died from his gunshot wound to the head.Among the musicians on the record were Timothy B. Schmit and Joe Walsh, two of Henley's Eagles bandmates. Walsh performs the first guitar solo, followed by Steve Lukather of the band Toto; the guitar basic tracks are played by Danny Kortchmar who also helped Henley composing this song.[2] Jeff Porcaro (also of Toto) plays the drums on this track.In the Eagles' Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne concert DVD, Henley (speaking for the band) dedicated this song "to Mr. Rupert Murdoch"; in many live performances, this dedication remains but is sometimes changed "to Mr. Bill O'Reilly". The song was also used in the 2004 documentary Outfoxed as well as in the shorts for the 1995 movie To Die For. The song was performed on the Eagles' Long Road Out of Eden tour in 2008. During the song, a background video shows, among other things, clips from The O'Reilly Factor, Glenn Beck, and The Jerry Springer Show.[edit] ChartChart (1982)PeakpositionAustralian Kent Music Report51[3]Austrian Top 408Canadian RPM Top Singles1New Zealand Singles Chart7South African Singles Chart2U.K. Singles Chart59U.S. Billboard Hot 1003U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play47U.S. Billboard Top Tracks1[edit] Cover versionsThe song was covered live by the Eagles in 1999.
