I don't know how it's going to end, I never ask what the next episodes are like, we have 8 more to shoot. I honestly don't know where it's going. I'll be as surprised, almost surprised as the audience because I read the scripts 3-5 days before we start shooting and that's the first time I hear of what's going to happen"Not the same interview but a recent one from CranstonEDIT: I found the quote, it's from 2010:"I don't know where it's going, but I'm pretty darn sure that he'll die at the end of this run. At the end of this show, Walter White will die. How he dies, I really honestly don't know."permalinksavecontextfull commentsGot My Fiesta Bowl Tickets in today!
