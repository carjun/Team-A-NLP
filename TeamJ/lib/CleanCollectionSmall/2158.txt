Clearly it wasn't," said the body's deputy chief executive Tony Tyler.In a statement to CNN, six-time Paralympic gold medalist Pistorius -- who also reached the semifinals of the Olympic 400 meters competition -- said he was unaware of any ill treatment to the horse."I participated in the race in good faith as it was to promote abilities across sport and I was totally unaware of any alleged excessive force being used on the horse," said the 26-year-old."I don't condone any ill-treatment of animals and would always hope that a horse would be ridden in the correct way.
