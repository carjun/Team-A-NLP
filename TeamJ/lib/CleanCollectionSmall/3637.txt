December 16, 2012 02:45 PM ESTDecember 21, 2012 is drawing closer and as it does you might want to expect more people to carry out massacres (or try to) as they believe the world will be ending. In fact, there could be a connection between the Sandy Hook Connecticut shooting and the Mayan doomsday prophecy.According to numerous reports, family members of Nancy Lanza said that she was a "prepper" and was actively preparing for doomsday and financial collapse. This is the reason she had so many guns in her home. Sadly, those guns were turned on her and twenty-six other innocent people by her deranged son, Adam Lanza, who may or may not have also believed the world was about to end on the 21 of December."She was stockpiling food. We talked about prepping a lot. She was getting ready for the economic collapse," said Marsha Lanza, Nancy's former sister-in-law. "Nancy wasn't one to deny reality..."Whether or not Nancy Lanza believed the world would end on December 21, 2012 is unknown but sadly the world did end for her one week before the rumored apocalypse.While it is great to be prepared for disaster, the horrific shooting in Sandy Hook just goes to show that if you don't have your guns locked up they can be used on youand othersvery easily.Do you think that Adam Lanza was influenced by his mother's apocalyptic beliefs? Do you think there will be more shooting or mass murders as December 21, 2012 draws closer?Photo courtesy of NY PostRelated posts on Gather|view moreDecember 21, 2012 Doomsday: Mayan's Explain What Will Happen, Blame the GovernmentDecember 21, 2012 Doomsday: Did the Mayans Expect Good News on 12/21?December 21, 2012 Doomsday: Have You Got Your 'Tsunami Proof' Pod Yet?More by Linda Shaw |view moreDecember 21, 2012 Doomsday: Mayan's Explain What Will Happen, Blame the GovernmentDecember 21, 2012 Doomsday: Have You Got Your 'Tsunami Proof' Pod Yet?December 21, 2012 Doomsday: Did the Mayans Expect Good News on 12/21?
