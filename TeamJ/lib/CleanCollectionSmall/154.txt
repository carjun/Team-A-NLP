(Allison Joyce / Getty Images /December 19, 2012)2 1/94By Tina Susman, Brian Bennett and Joe Mozingo, Los Angeles TimesDecember 17, 2012, 3:30 a.m.NEWTOWN, Conn.  Before a town devastated by a rampage against its children, and a nation wondering how it could happen again, President Obama vowed to use the power of his office to prevent such calamities and fulfill what he called America's foremost obligation."Can we honestly say that we're doing enough to keep our children, all of them, safe from harm?" Obama asked. "I have been reflecting on this in the past few days, and if we are honest with ourselves, the answer is no. We are not doing enough and we will have to change."His remarks departed from similar speeches after other mass shootings, when he made vague calls for conversation but did not promise action. Though he made no specific policy proposals Sunday, his statements strongly signaled a political battle to come over gun control.AlsoWho they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsPhoto:Connecticut school shootingSchool shooting: How do you tell a child his protectors are dead?See more stories XFor victims of Jewish center shooting, massacre renews their pain Connecticut shooter would 'just shut down' in high schoolTRANSCRIPT AND VIDEO: Obama's full speech"In the coming weeks I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this. Because what choice do we have? We can't accept events like this as routine."Are we really prepared to say we are powerless in the face of such carnage? That the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?"Obama's speech Sunday evening capped a cold, rainy day in Newtown that seemed to augur the toll setting in from Friday's shooting. Residents huddled together in their homes, sought solace in churches and set up makeshift memorials for the 20 first-graders and six staff members killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Funerals were set to begin Monday."Everyone is trying to sit together and support each other right now," said Kalianna Faust, 16, a student serving coffee at Caraluzzi's grocery store. Between shifts, Faust had been obsessively scrolling through her friends' Twitter and Facebook accounts, reading tributes and gazing forlornly at photographs of the dead children. Her 15-year-old sister, Monica, spent the weekend holed up in sorrow in her bedroom. Kalianna ventured out only on Saturday to light candles at the St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church."We just hold each other and watch the news," she said. FULL COVERAGE: Shooting at Connecticut school  Many turned to St. Rose for comfort. Even the normally sparse 7:30 a.m. Mass was filled to capacity Sunday. The vaulted red-brick church, set behind stately trees, lost eight young members Friday and has eight funerals to prepare.People came to find a shred of peace, to memorialize angels that so recently sat and fidgeted among them in the pews. But they met only new despair. During the noon Mass, Msgr. Robert Weiss abruptly interrupted the sermon to evacuate the building; a threat had been called into the church's offices."It was a menacing call that threatened to disrupt the Mass in a violent way," said a stoic Brian Wallace, spokesman for the diocese, standing in front of the church.Filing out, people were "distressed" and "very sad," he said. "There was some anger. But no panic. We have seen incredible dignity in the faces of these people."Police searched the premises and determined there was no danger, but the day's events were canceled."I don't think anyone can be surprised about anything after what has happened," Wallace said.Authorities continued Sunday to release details about the shooting, but nothing to answer why it happened.The gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, carried hundreds of bullets when he shot his way into the school and fired a Bushmaster .223 semiautomatic rifle at the children and adults, Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance said Sunday. Lanza then shot himself in the head with a Glock 10-millimeter handgun."The Bushmaster was used in the school, in its entirety," Vance said.WHO THEY WERE: Shooting victims Lanza carried multiple, high-capacity magazines for the rifle, each with 30 rounds, and multiple magazines for both handguns, with "hundreds of bullets," Vance said. He was also armed with a Sig Sauer pistol. A shotgun, the type of which was not identified, was found in the trunk of his car outside the school.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Times123next|  single pageComments121Comments (121)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQcrusader4commonsense at 7:54 AM December 19, 2012                One thing I DO NOT find in common with ALL these shootings...how the gun did it itself. One thing I DO find in common with ALL these shootings...how EVERYONE always says things like, "we knew he was nuts", or "we knew he was a ticking time bomb & would eventually kill". What I DO NOT hear you idiots advocating new bans on guns saying....How you are going to protect the rest of us from deranged and unstable people who will use whatever they can find to kill children. Where is the blame going to lie when we have another whacko use things that aren't guns? Who will you blame then? Will you cancel out the internet so they can't find their weapons recipes? How about as parents, if you have a sick child, YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Don't whine to me how it's not fair to patients who have these problems. Try explaining to the families of 20 children how your kids right to exist in a normal life trumps the rest of our rights to live without fear. Ask why it was taking so long for this mother to lock him up. THAT'S who you can blame for this. As the victim of a violent gun crime, I may be one of the few on here who can speak about what a victim feels. Not once did I ever want guns taken away from anyone. What I did want, an explanation as to why someone who was known to be that violent was out on the street to begin with. Ban the crazies, not the guns.Milquetoast at 1:17 AM December 19, 2012                You talk about how no one can ever TAKEaway the LEGAL weapons in America, and thatthe Second Amendment guarantees this RIGHT ...but what if the legal guns were suddenly deemedILLEGAL?Like the illegal children of illegal citizens weresuddenly .. somehow .. deemed .. L E G A L ?HMMMMMM?We've seen that happen recently, uh - haven't we?And why? Because, as the one who said he would useHIS power to affect change NOW, he just thought thatit was the right thing to do THEN! And NOW we're paying for the education of illegals.FEELS GOOD, don't it?NEVER LET A GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE!Australia was only able to buy back 20% of the weaponsthey were seeking, about 700,000 of them.Obama, thanks to his "Broke Back" policies, has no money. Did you think he was going to TAKE those guns away?I'd like to see him try.And did you think an armed American population would be effectively pounded back by the U.S. military?I've got news for you: In the long runa roguegovernment can NEVER beat the American people.We have a hard enough time with just the Taliban.Remember, it's WE THE PEOPLE ...not WE THE GOVERNMENT.This is one thing Obama is not going to "deem" so.LJP305 at 8:04 AM December 18, 2012                Too many Americans -- men in particular -- have an unhealthy obsession with guns.  Closing the gun show loophole, implementing better background checks on  would be gun purchasers, longer waiting periods for gun purchases to  ensure info submitted on purchase applications is correct and limiting  high capacity magazines are reasonable ways to control and further  regulate gun purchases in the US.Govt in America has never tried to come after our legally possessed weapons, and no Govt in America ever will! The 2nd Amendment wasn't written with any thoughts of protecting Citizens' access to military-type assault rifles enabling purchasers to fire several rounds/min. I challenge anyone who supports Citizens' access to military-type assault rifles to name a single time in our history when Citizens' access to assault rifles kept a single Govt agency from coming after legally possessed guns in America or protected families members safe in their homes from intruders or elsewhere from criminals.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
