At the end of the day the job of the executive branch is to enforce laws. Even if Obama decided to ignore the federal law here the next president could easily return to normal enforcement.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow do I prevent the homeless from pooping on my business' back entrance?  by  poopsforin  AskReddit[+]AssbuttAsses 5 points6 points7 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 5 points6 points7 points 4 days agoYeah and the smell of a hobo box will attract more hobos.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFlorida Teen Accidentally Shoots Off His Penis And A Testicle  by  DriveOverin  news[+]AssbuttAsses 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoSeems like one should also not have already procreated to qualify (or your kids die in the process).permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL the Mortgage Interest Deduction saves over $5k for those making over $250k, but just $91 for those making $40k or less.  by  garymrushin  todayilearned[+]AssbuttAsses 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 1 point2 points3 points 17 days agoWell if our tax code was revenue-neutral that might happen. I guess you could legislate the reduction in tax rates along with eliminating the deduction. I agree our tax burden should ease the pain of poverty first, then encourage consumer spending in the middle class, and not prioritize giving the wealthy more wealth. I never understood how the lower tax rate on the wealthy "created jobs". We're talking about take-home income, right? If you're using take-home, after-tax money to put back into your company to hire an employee, you need to fire your accountants.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL the Mortgage Interest Deduction saves over $5k for those making over $250k, but just $91 for those making $40k or less.  by  garymrushin  todayilearned[+]AssbuttAsses 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago*(0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago*Well you would get that extra thousand dollars after a year of paying interest when you file your taxes but you can't qualify that as cash on hand when you're getting a home loan. Maybe you could put it towards the principal of your home each year but it probably just goes where most tax refund money goes ( bills, savings, consumption, etc).If it were a straight up tax credit I could see calling it a transfer of wealth, I guess I just have to disagree there. Interesting to know the history behind the deduction, I assumed it was some holdover. Though what would stop the wealthy from forming corporations to buy their extravagant homes then writing off the interest (and upkeep)?Edit: oh you were saying the $1000 would go to the renters. How would that happen if you stopped the mortgage deduction?permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL the Mortgage Interest Deduction saves over $5k for those making over $250k, but just $91 for those making $40k or less.  by  garymrushin  todayilearned[+]AssbuttAsses 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoI do think if a family is going to buy a home it's silly to think the final decision will be made if they can take an extra deduction on their tax return.  I'm not sure how it's a transfer of wealth from the renter to the owner though. You could argue removing the deduction would increase rent payments on the property a little bit.Really I've never been sure why that deduction exists, I assumed it was to incentivize property ownership but I'm not sure the intent behind the tax code there.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL the Mortgage Interest Deduction saves over $5k for those making over $250k, but just $91 for those making $40k or less.  by  garymrushin  todayilearned[+]AssbuttAsses 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoThere are people between those two income extremes. It's hard to have extensive write-offs when you look at people paying smaller amounts of income. There are people in the middle class who do get a sizable write-off using the mortgage deduction. Maybe capping the total amount might be less wasteful but still incentivize homeownership. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDo chemotherapy patients actually like when people shave their heads for them, or is it just annoying?

Also in a lot of "red states" over 40% of voters voted for Obama. The group that gets the most votes in a winner-take-all election doesn't speak for the whole state, let alone the mere 30,000 or whatever that sign their name to an impotent, non-binding web petition.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTexas is attempting to secede from the United States.

You could call states like New Jersey with 4% of votes in because it's obvious which way things are going.

They had a riled up and angry voting block and they both tried to calm them. At McCain's concession you'd have thought a riot was about to break out.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMSNBC host Joe Scarborough repeatedly shouts Benghazi! to block discussion over Republican led voter suppression.  by  sacr3dc0win  politics[+]AssbuttAsses 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoMSNBC's morning show is like watching a hostage situation, it's bizarre and unnerving and full of screaming and you think the scary man might kill the lady.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProtip: Don't use a mann co surplus ticket in an MVM until halloween is over.  by  magicaxisin  tf2[+]AssbuttAsses 6 points7 points8 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]AssbuttAsses 6 points7 points8 points 1 month agoThe math is still the same, a group collectively spends $12 to each get 6 extra drops, most of which are just weapons, unless the surplus tickets compound in payoff somehow.

They cost 2 dollars and you usually get 1 weapon, where you could buy 2 keys from a trader and swap it them for around 5 ref.

I understand the "no adding unless the price is agreed upon" point of view.Also for bigger trades you want time to research the person you're dealing with, make sure they didn't steal the item they at trading, that their offer isn't duped, that they don't have bad reputation, etc.  And if you're weighing offers that circumvents the process and puts you in a higher pressure situation. Of course it's faster, and of course the person trying to talk you down on price would prefer to just add you and ignore your very clear instructions.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
