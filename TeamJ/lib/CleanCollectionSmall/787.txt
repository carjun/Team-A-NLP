Most of them will never live anything close to a normal life after going through this at this young of an age.  At least with the past high school shootings the kids were old enough to conceptually understand what happened.permalinksaveparent[+]joeanon 502 points503 points504 points 1 day ago (33 children)[]joeanon 502 points503 points504 points 1 day agoMost of them will not be significantly effected actually. Only a small fraction will have any kind of long term problems. Most of them did not witness anything. They heard sounds in the distance and people told them to run. It won't be until they are older they fully realize what happened. permalinksaveparent[+]ologies 166 points167 points168 points 1 day ago (2 children)[]ologies 166 points167 points168 points 1 day agoI'm inclined to agree with you - children are resilient and have pliant enough minds at this point that with the right support structure and guidance, even those who witnessed the worst of it first-hand have a good chance of growing up to be healthy, productive adults. I hope they get all the help they need and are surrounded by lots of love and patience while they cope.permalinksaveparent[+]nixonrichard  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]nixonrichard -9 points-8 points-7 points 23 hours agoIt sounds like those who witnessed the worst of it didn't make it out.God save any poor little Dexter who lived through that nightmare of all your friends and peers around you being slaughtered.Poor kids.  I wish I could extend a big hug to every one of them.  Somehow, though, I don't think any amount of hugging will do the trick.permalinksaveparent[+]fantomfancypants 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]fantomfancypants 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoAaand as per usual, the truth is somewhere toward the middle of these extremes.permalinksaveparent[+]Kernel_Forbin 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]Kernel_Forbin 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoWell put.permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (14 children)[]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoAt fourth grade they will most definitely be profoundly effected by that for life. They are also going to experience the loss of teachers and children their own age. The younger children especially, are going to be forced to mature a lot quicker than they should. At age 5, most children still don't fully understand the concept of death and it is a very strange situation for them to be in when someone their own age passes away. permalinksaveparent[+]JoelBlackout 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]JoelBlackout 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoI can tell you that even at 24, watching someone die will profoundly affect you and how you look at life.Source: Me.permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]chrissymad 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoSo true. 24 as well and despite not even being there or knowing anyone first hand, I'm even having a hard time. permalinksaveparent[+]fkausername 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]fkausername 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoYou are most certainly correct about having to mature much quicker from dealing with this. Reality hits you at a young age. You lose that innocence you once had. I lost my parents at 8 years old and life was never the same. As much as I wanted it to be normal, there was always that thing in the back of your head haunting you.permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago<3 When I was 9 years old, in the fourth grade, a first grader who I would play with in aftercare was killed in a drunk driving accident while we were on Christmas break. I wasn't there to experience her death, obviously but the aftermath was awful. I can't imagine what these kids will go through, especially being there and seeing their friends die. I can only hope that they have a strong and loving support system for life. permalinksaveparent[+]econleech -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (0 children)[]econleech -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoI am curious.  In what way are you not normal?  Are you not able to live a normal life at all?  There's a big different in losing both your parents than losing some classmates and teachers.  You lost your primary support structure, these kids did not.  I don't think they are comparable at all.permalinksaveparent[+]hemmicw9 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]hemmicw9 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThis whole situation is making me sick and depressed. So horrible. permalinksaveparent[+]iatowk 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (6 children)[]iatowk 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agowill most definitely be profoundly effected by that for lifedo you have any evidence supporting that?permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (5 children)[]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoWill post more later but: hereAfter five years of age, children gradually understand "that death is final, inevitable, universal, and personal" (Grollman, 1967, p. 101).Most ten-year-olds understand that death is an irreversible and inescapable part of life.This was a k-4 school, they're mostly at an age where they are learning or already know what death entails. Let alone the fact that I'm sure some kids will have seen their fellow school mates be murdered. Also why is no one jumping on the other train for the previous posters who stated the children will not be effected at all? permalinksaveparent[+]hauntedmansion 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]hauntedmansion 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoI think the point was they most likely won't be profoundly affected.  Depending on your definition of profoundly, of course.Human minds are resilient when faced with tragedy and horror.  We have many coping mechanisms in place to allow us to continue functioning and adapting, even when our whole world shatters.  These kids will go on and likely live lives indistinguishable from their peers who did not experience such events, and that's a good thing.  Kids especially are tougher than we give them credit for.  We see them as very vulnerable and defenseless, but their minds are constantly working to assimilate these things and go on functioning in a healthy way.  It doesn't always work, but most of the time it does.Basically, people who had horrible childhoods and emerged relatively normal are far more common.  For something like that to do permanent damage to a person's psyche is rare.  For a one time incident in an otherwise healthy childhood, this should have a very minimal impact on them in the long run.  As it should be.permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]chrissymad 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI actually heard on MSNBC a few minutes ago from a child psych that roughly 15% of children in a group like this will experience long term, possibly 'noticeable' effects. Just an interesting tidbit. permalinksaveparent[+]ologies 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]ologies 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI don't think anyone is claiming that the children will not be affected whatsoever.permalinksaveparent[+]iatowk 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago*(0 children)[]iatowk 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago*So children 5+ understand death and what it means to die but I think its a bit of a stretch to say that they "will most definitely be profoundly effected by that for life". Edit: Yeah it could be a different story for some poor kid that experiences something as awful as watching someones life end. I still have a hard time believing that the kids hiding in the bathroom with their teacher are going to be affected as much. permalinksaveparent[+]econleech 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]econleech 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoUnderstanding death doesn't necessary mean being negatively affected by it.  Understanding death should mean you be at peace with it.permalinksaveparent[+]smacksaw -4 points-3 points-2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]smacksaw -4 points-3 points-2 points 23 hours agoCitation neededSeriously.

My brother didn't directly witness the shooting at our high school, but between losing a faculty member he knew and all the circus that surrounded the shooting, it definitely affected him. permalinksaveparent[+]junkit33 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]junkit33 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoShort of the parents uprooting their lives and moving to another state, there is no possible way the kids won't talk to their friends about this kind of stuff.  Not to mention with 20+ kids dead in a small school, odds are nearly everybody just lost at least a friend.Also, with that many shot (keep in mind we only know the death count so far, so shot will be a lot higher), I'm not even sure the number of kids who "only heard sounds and didn't witness anything" is anywhere near as high as you think.permalinksaveparent[+]yetanotherpoop 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]yetanotherpoop 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoand there will be an AMA.

They've lost friends and possibly siblings. And now their school and town is a circus. But they probably will live a "normal life" (whatever the hell that is).permalinksaveparent[+]helloalicehello 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]helloalicehello 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoIt's the ones in the room with the 18 children who died that'll be fucked up for life. :[permalinksaveparent[+]scatmango 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]scatmango 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI agree.  What sort of trauma will the adults around them insist that the children experience? It's really up to the parents to what extent they allow their children to be traumatized because no child can really understand what just went down.permalinksaveparent[+]Aleriya 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Aleriya 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoKids are more resilient than you'd think. They often bounce back better than adults would, and I'm sure most of these kids will be fine, especially if they are monitored and offered early therapy for any issues that pop up.permalinksaveparent[+]sheburns 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]sheburns 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours agoI don't agree with this. permalinksaveparent[+]somuchvienna 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]somuchvienna 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoWow exaggerate much? permalinksaveparent[+]WestMIRailroader 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]WestMIRailroader 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoActually there were a few being interviewed that had said that they had to close all the doors so that the animals wouldn't get in the rooms.

There are enough adults that were in the building to piece together exactly how everything happened.

So, for whatever reason, their parents most likely consented to these interviews.  permalinksaveparent[+]joeanon -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]joeanon -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 day agoA safe holding area? They are safe anywhere now the shooter is dead. Stop being such a pussy. Putting children in a holding area because you are scared and there are no threats is exactly the opposite of the mentality this nation needs. It's that type of radical and overly protective mentality that breeds this type of violence and makes people think they need to lock their doors, buy guns, and peep out their windows for suspicious activity.We are not all individuals whom can cut off from society and hide in our 'safe holding areas'. The safest place is with the community, not locked up alone in your home. The sooner society learns that the sooner we can move away from this type of hyper individual mentality that drives alienation and ostracization.We are a society, no a series of people living in fear boarded up in their homes. When bad things happen we COME TOGETHER, we don't go hide.  permalinksaveparent[+]benderrod 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]benderrod 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoclearly you missed 28 days lateralso, moron, they just arrested another guy who was hiding in the woods. one shooter is dead, "safe" is far far away when things like this happened. also, you try thinking rationally when your kids have been shot you insensitive, stupid insecure fuck.permalinksaveparent[+]huckstah 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]huckstah 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoYou piss hair too? high fivepermalinksaveparent[+]Imalurkerwhocomments 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]Imalurkerwhocomments 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agodoes it tickle when you piss!?permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
