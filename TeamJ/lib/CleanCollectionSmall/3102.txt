We thought Columbine was as bad as it could get, but here in America alone there has been31 deadlyschool shootings since Columbine, and we are all leftwondering when the madness will end.Maybe this tragedy in Connecticut will be a tipping point in this ongoing debate about where we should stand with guns in our culture. There is no doubt that we live in a violent society. Guns (and the glorification of them) are everywhere. They are in our games, our movies,andin our art.We embrace guns and we celebrate the fact that it is in our Constitution. Now, astonishingly, pro gun advocates are saying that if the kindergarten teachers were armed this tragedy would not have happened. (Yeah, that's the ticket, arm kindergarten teachers in every school in America.)Now we are learning that the animal who slaughtered these children in Connecticutwas raisedby a mother who embracedthe gun culture."Nancy Lanza took her son, Adam, to a shooting  range and taught him how to use a firearm before he turned a gun on her and shot  her dead, then executed more than two dozen terrified children and teachers at  an elementary school. Fifty-two-year-old Nancy Lanza was an avid  gun collector who had legally purchased five firearms, all registered in  Connecticut, according to police records. 'She said she would often go target shooting  with her kids,' Dan Holmes, owner of the landscaping firm Holmes Fine Gardens,  told Reuters. He recalled that she once showed him a 'high-end rifle' that  she had purchased. 'She was very proud of it,' he told the New York Daily  News. 'She loved  her guns.'"Unfortunately, so did her son.Posted byfield negroat8:30 PM41commentsLinks to this postLabels:Adam Lanza,Columbine,guns,Nancy Lanza.Friday, December 14, 2012Here we go again."The purpose of government is to enable the people of a nation to live in safety and happiness. Government exists for the interests of the governed, not for the governors. ~Thomas Jefferson~The "people of a nation", of course, includes its children.I am sure that the parents of those twentychildren who lost their lives in that bucolic community in Connecticut today thought that their children were safe. Theywere not. The truthof the matter is that you are not safe anywhere in America, anymore. There are a lot of urban high schools with metal detectors. Statisticsshow us that those children are certainly not safe. Rural elementary schools in upper middle class neighborhoods do not havemetal detectors. And before today that was not even subject to debate.Now, after these horrific events, we find ourselves soul searching again.This is not a gun control post. Regular readers on this blog know how I feel about the NRA, the pimps who run it, and the prostitutes' politicians who take their money.To be fair, there aresomereasonable voices on the other side of this debate, and I have to hope that at some point we can find some common ground on this issue. I saw the president crying today while he was addressing the country about this latest tragedy. Maybe he was thinking about his children. Maybe he was thinking of all the children who were slaughtered on the streets of his hometown this past summer. And, maybe, just maybe, he wasoverwhelmed with theweight of it all. Honestly, how many of these shootings can one nation take? "Weve endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years and each time I hear the news, I react not as a president but as anybody else would, as a parent. That was especially true today.I  know there is not a parent in America whodoesnt feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old.They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings. Kids of their own.Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams.Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and the families of those adults who were lost.Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their childrens innocence has been torn away from them too early and no words will ease their pain.As a country, we have been though this too many times. Whether its an elementary school in Newtown, a shopping mall in Oregon, or a Temple in Wisconsin, a movie theater in Aurora or a street corner in Chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, these children are our children."Yes they are, and so are our guns.

I know that some folks think that it's a non story, but, to me, it's a pretty big deal.I am still waiting on my friend who is a top flightADA in Baton Rouge to call me and tell me why the BRPD is so silent about this case. BF, (only initials for now) I am waiting on that call."Baton Rouge Police Department talked with witnesses and determined the incident was an accident caused by Dotson who team mates said was drinking alcohol at the time of the accident."Riiiight.Anyway, let's talk about my man Matt Drudge for a minute. You have to give it Drudge, he sure knows how to grab attention with his headlines. He seems to be part of a growinglist of wingnuts who arecrying a river about the movie Django Unchained. (Nothing like a slave killing a white man to piss off a wingnut.)The movie itself has gotten all kinds of Golden Globe love.Drudge wasn't satisfied withjust one "N*gger" in his headlines. He had to dropten of them. Ten!(Why did he bother toleave out that one I?*shaking head*)Of course, Matt being Matt, he made some false claims about what was in the movie as well."What's going on here? Tarantino uses n*gger hundreds of times..." Ahhh, no he didn't.Anyway, I agree with what Goldie Taylor told Martin Bashir:"Bashir asked for Taylors reaction to the rights newfound war on Jamie Foxx.Taylor said that Drudge would never become an arbiter of what is racially unacceptable in this country. She savaged his site for peddling material like this to line their own pockets.In terms of a war on Jamie Foxx, for making a mockery for the world that is Matt Drudge, I mean, how black is that? Taylor jokingly asked, in reference to Foxxs controversial SNL monologue.How black is that, Tour agreed.Taylor insisted that Foxx has regularly made fun of that far-right fringe that is frustrated with the fact that the President of the United States is black, implying that Drudges anti-Tarantino headline caters to this group. "I agree with what Chris Haire wrote as well:"Now, I'm not really sure what Matt Drudge's fedora is trying to accomplish with all of this "n*gger" stuff. But as near as I can tell, the hating hat is apparently upset that white people  like say Matt Drudge and Rush Limbaugh, and, oh, Sean Hannity  can't just use the word "nigger" like they used to.In today's world, Spike Lee can say it. And Jamie Foxx can say it. And the actors in Quentin Tarantino the anti-slavery, Spaghetti Western-inspired epic "Django Unchained" can use it. But Drudge and the rest of the angry white men of America can't. And, well, that's just not fair. Or at least that's what Matt Drudge's fedora is saying to me. Perhaps you're hearing something else entirely." [Source]No Chris, I am hearing the same thing.

I was sad to hear that she lost her job attelevision station KKKTB3in Shreveport, Louisiana (color me shocked) for responding to some racistignoramus on Facebook.How do I know that he is a racist? Field Negro Exhibit-1:"On November 14, a viewer named Kenny Moreland, whose Facebook profile picture is the Little Rascals Buckwheat character with the caption Buckwheat Say: O-Tay, posted this comment on KTBS-TV's Facebook page:Not to start any trouble, because I think that the annual Three Minute Smile is a great function and I love to see kids so happy. Am I the only one that has noticed that this year, all the kids, lets say, are people of color? This is Channel 3, not KSLA, the Project Pride network, that might as well be part of the BET channel. Did KTBS slip up on a news story, and owe Sports criminal mayor Cedric, a favor? Seems like some racism going on to me. Just saying..Moreland wrote another comment on the stations website earlier that same day:Has anybody else noticed that this years 3 minute smile contestants are all of the same race? I thought this was Channel 3, and not KSLA the Project Pride network. Looks like racism to me. Not to put it down I think its great for the little kids to get such a chance, but come on.. Are Yall on Cedric Glovers secret payroll now?" [Source]Ms. Lee's big mistake was responding to the knuckle dragger.This, of course, gave her equally ignorant bosses a reason to terminate her. We must always protect the racist troll posting on Facebook andnot our own employees.Did the black people in Shreveport tune in to watch Ms. Lee? That was a rhetorical question. What black people think or want in places like Shreveport, Louisiana doesn't really matter. "Lee told Mije.org: I was the one who brought it to their attention after they let it fester on the page for 6 days, but was then chastised for responding at all. I sent a screen grab to my boss via e-mail telling them that Im ok with the anti-Rhonda commentary sometimes, but what has been posted at the time was . . . racist, and I asked them to please support me in removing the ones that didnt encourage thoughtful, respectful and civil discourse on our FB page. I never got a reply, only punished. To this day the posts are still there.She added: . . . Race has been the issue with me since I started. That much is VERY true. Weather is an older white boy business and arms have been less than open for a young black girl  a polar opposite. As reported Ive had more problems here in the south than I have anywhere else in my 25+ years in the business. Perhaps there is a pattern, but I am a glutton for punishment (ha, ha), and I want what I deserve as any professional would so if I have to fight for it I will.Yes you are a "glutton for punishment". You know those people down in Shreveport had issues with your appearance. Why not too long ago some viewer wrote thatyour hair was too "natural" for television."Lee told CNN's Soladad O'Brian that she was not aware of the companys social media policy and was never warned about any unsatisfactory actions. She also said that there is no hard copy of the policy.It seems that Lee was punished for discussing race rather than the commenter being banned for his racist comments. It is a sad, yet accurate reminder of how being comfortable with our Blackness is a symbol of inferiority to others, namely the commenters who attacked her on Facebook. We can look Black but not too Black, as was the case for Lee. Though She told CNN this is not the first time her hair has threatened her job security."Ms. Lee, it might be time to find a nice wig and weaveshop.

Hostess Brands Inc. executives allegedly were supposed to apply  designated funds towards employee pensions, but injected the money into the  company instead.It is unclear how much money is missing from the pension plans or how many  employees are affected, according to Yahoo Finance, which has reported that in  August 2011 the company said it would stop making pension contributions  altogether.Hostess shut down just last month following a strike by one of the unions  representing employees working at the company.Hostess's chief executive officer, Gregory Rayburn, has said in an interview  that he thought it was "terrible" that employee money meant to go towards their  pensions were not used for their intended purpose.He has said, "I think it's like a lot of things in this case. It's not a good  situation to have." [Source]Gee, ya think? You can always count on "the man" to screw the little guy.Finally, the next one of those red state wingnuts try to tell you about all those urban folks sucking up freebies from the government, remind them about the following story:"Seventy percent of counties with the fastest-growth in food-stamp aid during the last four years voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2008, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data compiled by Bloomberg. They include Republican strongholds like King County, Texas, which in 2008 backed Republican John McCain by 92.6 percent, his largest share in the nation; and fast-growing Douglas County, Colorado." [Source]Of course republicans are claiming that this is the case because they (republicans) can't find jobs under Obama and theyare nowforced to depend on the government for something as basic as food. (It looks like that 47% is growing.)This, of course, is not true. Poor whitepeople in America have always voted against their own bestinterest. This isbecause they feel that they are somehow connected to those who arewealthy and influential by race, religion, or gender. Besides, it's so much easier to blame those other people for your station in life than to actually look in the mirror and see what a f&*^ up you are.Here is the thing, it doesn't matter who is in power in Washington. What goes on in D.C. isn't going to affect your live in Eubank, Kentucky.

Mommy, pleasedon't let your son grow up to be a football player. And this wasn't the first time for Brent. Hehas had trouble with the law due to DUI issues in the past.So now we can all get on our soap boxes and start relating society's problems to the NFL: We need more gun control; people shouldn't drink and drive; domestic violence is wrong; and young men who suddenly come into large amounts of money should learn howto manage their lives.I agree with all of the above.Finally, staying with the football theme, a young promising football player at a fine high school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana was recently hospitalized with some serious injuries. The circumstances surrounding his case remain murky, and the BatonRouge police department has some explaining to do. "16-year-old University High School football player is recovering after an ambiguous incident late Friday night at the BREC Perkins Road Community Skate Park left him in a medically induced coma.Though the Baton Rouge Police Department said the investigation is ongoing, one fact has been confirmed  DVante Dotson had alcohol in his system.

The bill, which would have taken the debt ceiling gun away from the head of the U.S. economy by requiring a two-thirds majority to override a presidential increase to the debt ceiling, was McConnells idea, but when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid agreed with McConnells request for a vote on the bill Thursday afternoon, McConnell objected.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) wanted to prove on Thursday that Democrats dont have the votes to weaken Congress authority on the debt limit. Instead they called his bluff, and he ended up filibustering his own bill.The legislation, modeled on a proposal McConnell offered last year as a last-choice option to avert a U.S. debt default, would permit the president to unilaterally lift the debt ceiling unless Congress mustered a two-thirds majority to stop him.McConnell brought up the legislation Thursday morning. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) initially objected, seemingly proving the Republican leaders point that it cannot pass the Senate. But then Reid ran it by his members and, in the afternoon, agreed to hold that same vote. This time it was McConnell who objected.The Republican leader objects to his own idea, Reid declared on the floor. So I guess we have a filibuster of his own bill.Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL) also weighed in on McConnells maneuver, innocently noting that it really calls into question whether or not this was the kind of offer that one would consider to be good faith.The Obama-era Republican Senate Minority has made unprecedented filibuster abuse their calling card, but this may be the first instance of filibuster self-abuse.

It's Grover and his merry men against the President. Who will blink, first? Hey Ihavean idea: Why don't we just hold hands and jump off the cliff together? I think that there are a lot of people in America who are secretly hoping that we will all go over the cliff. Some, on the other hand,are not so secretive about it.The following is from a blogger who styles him/herself "Liberal Anthropologist":"There has been much talk recently about how one side or another should deal with the fiscal cliff. The Democrats are a lost cause (at the moment) when it comes to fiscal matters. This is most evidenced by the absolutely ridiculous proposal made by Obamas team.So this is my suggestion to the Republicans. Just announce now that if the presidents people do not put forward a serious proposal that involves massive spending cuts that the fiscal cliff will be gone over.And it is a good thing.Why? Because we need to cut all of that spending anyway. It is not even enough. It is a down payment on the spending cuts that are really needed. So the automatic spending cuts are a good thing." [Source]Now that's tough talk. And, to be fair, O and his peeps are talking just as tough."The White House is "absolutely" prepared to go over the so-called "fiscal cliff" should negotiations with Republicans fail to muster a deal that would prevent a devastating series of tax hikes and spending cuts from triggering Jan. 1, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said today.Geithner, whom President Obama assigned to be the point person on his "fiscal cliff" proposal, told CNBC in an interview that an agreement won't be reached by year's end unless the GOP concedes an increase in tax rates for the top two percent of wealthiest Americans. Disparity over whether to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for all Americans or only those making less than $250,000 a year has barricaded any headway on a plan for months."

I think that youare going to need every penny.Finally, I am going to leave you with a story.I don't want to give my opinion, because there are some folks out therewho just out of GP will sayblack if I say white. Rather, I will let you read and decide for yourself. "In October of 2006, the Jackson family of Solomons, Md., would be rocked, when their 21-year-old son, *Brandon (pictured), was reportedly jumped by 7 to 8 White males. Six years later, Brandon would be sentenced by a nearly all-White jury to 12 years in prison for attempted murder, aggravated assault, and possession of a weapon for defending himself against one of the victims. Struck down but buoyed by faith, Brandons mother, Gloria Fisher, spoke with NewsOne about how she wont stop until she gets justice for Brandon.While Brandon helped his employer move furniture at her house in Jackson, N.J., he allegedly noticed that a fight had broken out at a party across the street. After walking toward the altercation to investigate the melee, one of the individuals involved, who is said to have been visibly intoxicated along with the raucous group, began fighting with him.According to Gloria, Brandon quickly shut the aggressor down and attempted to return to the house he came from.But that would be just the beginning.The aggressor  now allegedly armed with 7 to 8 other White males in tow  followed Brandon and then reportedly began stomping and kicking him while yelling, Kill the n*gger!According to Gloria, Brandon pulled out his 3-inch work pocket knife in self-defense, forcing the group back, but it was the homeowners call to police that would finally force the motley group to stand down.On the police report, even though the officer would list the incident as a racial offense and Brandon would sustain injuries to the back of his head and knees and even had a fingernail bitten off, he would later be the only one charged with aggravated assault and illegal weapons possession.It wasnt until April of 2009 that Brandons case would go to a grand jury. By then, the charges would somehow be trumped up to include attempted murder.Even though Brandons lawyer would manage to get a statement from the homeowner, proving that he had indeed been attacked by the group of White teens, the prosecutors office reportedly refused to give this vital information to the defense attorney. Brandons trial would then be postponed yet again before finally taking place in September 2011  almost 5 years after the trial first began."

(Seriously, if youve never checked in with TFN, you should: Its author, Wayne Bennett, is a fantastic read who can cut through bullshit like a hot knife through butter, which is a far grosser analogy than I wanted to make, but there you have it.)"  ~Philebrity~"..While most of what he writes is tongue-in-cheek, his space is a safe house for candid discussions about race, especially in the comments section, where people of all colors meet."  ~~Daniel Rubin, "The Philadelphia Inquirer"~~ "To white people, Bennett's musings are like kitchen-table talk from a kitchen they may otherwise never set foot in. To African Americans, he is part of a growing army of black Internet amateurs who have taken up the work once reserved for ministers and professional activists: the work of setting a black agenda, shaping black opinion and calling attention to the state of the nation's racial affairs."  ~~Richard Fausset, "L.A. Times"~~~ "That's why I love the blog "Field Negro" so much. Field, as he's known to his fans, has the sense of reality that it takes to call out the (CowPuckey) of blame beating by those who are in positions of power and their lackeys. Because of his handle and his unabashed way of writing about racial issues, Field is often cited as a "Black blogger." What he is, however, is a first-class detector of blame deflection and an excellent student of history. If you want to write about the past and future of repression there's really no other perspective to take - which is why everyone should read Field."    ~Erik Hare, "The Twin Cities Daily Planet"~  411 On The Fieldfield negroPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, United StatesRaised in the house, but field certified.

I currently lay down the law in the city of "brotherly love".View my complete profile"Half a century after Little Rock, the Montgomery bus boycott and the tumultuous dawn of the modern civil rights era, the new face of the movement is Facebook, MySpace and some 150 black blogs united in an Internet alliance they call theAfroSpear.Older, familiar leaders such as Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton and NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, are under challenge by a younger generation of bloggers known by such provocative screen names as Field Negro, thefreeslaveand African American Political Pundit. And many of the newest struggles are being waged online."~Howard Witt-The Chicago Tribune~"I had no idea, for example, of the extent of the African-American blogging world out there and its collective powers of dissemination.But now, after reading thousands of anguished, thoughtful comments posted on these blogs reflecting on issues of persistent racial discrimination in the nation's schools and courtrooms, what's clear to me is that there's a new, "virtual" civil rights movement out there on the Internet that can reach more people in a few hours than all the protest marches, sit-ins and boycotts of the 1950s and 60s put together." ~Chicago Tribune Reporter, Howard Witt~FIELD NEGRO OF THE DAY(RAPPER, T.I.)
