Jennifer Lopez cozies up to a furry friend at Wild Life Sydney Zoo on Saturday.Superstar Jennifer Lopez, 43, and her twins, Max and Emme, 5, as well as boyfriend, dancer Casper Smart, 25, spent yesterday between her two concert gigs doing what most ordinary families do in Sydney  enjoying the city.The couple checked out the harbour, boarding the 70-foot motor boat Aquabay moored at Woolloomooloo at lunchtime, before heading to Darling Harbour's Wild Life Sydney zoo to get up close and personal with a koala and a snake.The singer's mother, Guadalupe, was also on board the boat, celebrating her birthday, which was last Tuesday.And while there was no diamond ring on Lopez's fourth finger, Smart got his own surprise, said zoo staff, when the snake he was holding made a wee on him, making the singer laugh.The couple prompted talk of a possible Christmas wedding when they were spotted browsing for diamond rings in Tiffany & Co in Perth, although Lopez, known as J.Lo, quickly hosed down speculation.The singer has had a 13-year career, with hits such as If You Had My Love, On the Floor and My Love Don't Cost A Thing.She has spent much of her career avoiding diva like antics and working on her Jenny from the Block brand - although in recent years she has had a massive resurgence in popularity  as a judge on American Idol.She performed in Sydney on Friday and Saturday night as part of a tour off the back of a greatest hits collection, Dance Again ... the Hits.Lopez has been as much in the headlines for her love life  as her music and film career, with credits such as What To Expect When You're Expecting and The Back-Up Plan.She has been married three times and has  had a series of high profile boyfriends including rapper P. Diddy and Hollywood heavyweight Ben Affleck. The pair were known as "Bennifer".Her two children are with singer Marc Anthony, from whom she filed for divorce last year.While there have been no reports of diva antics in Sydney  although she strangely only spent a few minutes on the boat at Woolloomooloo before leaving with her security in her black SUV, possibly to avoid waiting cameras - her dressing room rider does stipulate: "everything white and no beverages in the dressing room".Also on the list for the backstage area are white flowers (preferably roses or lilies), white lounges, white covers for the chairs, white candles and even white food such as fish and fruit.Tweet      Print StorySaveLatest News Funding boosted for 'carbon and capture' project Killer forced his wayPerfect pupil's next big test - finding a jobMan dies as inflatable raft upturnsClass heroes save lives Editor's Picks Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireFun at the Clunes show.Newlyncouple shocked by truck accident Popular Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeMemories flow of Daylesford's Boathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesFloats needed for DaylesfordNew Years Eve GalaDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireMultimediaGallery: The Boathouse Cafe burns      Gallery: Keele BreenHannah Knight catches up with local artist Keele Breen.
