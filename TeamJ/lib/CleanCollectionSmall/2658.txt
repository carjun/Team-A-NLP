In those days you needed a physical to run the marathon or a note from a coach saying you were in shape. Switzer's coach sent in a note that had no indication she was a woman. She also registered as K.V. Switzer instead, completely gender neutral. Finally she had someone else pick up her race number for her because she would have given herself away. Ultimately she did break a rule though because the AAU didn't sanction any events for women over 1.5 miles. Since the Boston Marathon was an AAU race, she didn't officially run it any more than Bobbi Gibb who finished an hour ahead of her. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSounds like 1968.  by  eat_pizzain  funny[+]sulejmankulenovic 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]sulejmankulenovic 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoHave any of you reported this post?

With that said, I think he made a mistake in telling you that you could run on it. I think he made that decision because he was probably giving most of his thought to the fact that you had a race coming up(which you had probably already paid for) and the injury wasn't serious enough to do you any real harm in the meantime. So from his perspective, there's not much of a reason to say no to you. The problem with that is that it's coming from a very short sighted view of running that focuses on the here and now. He said that you could run on it but did he discuss any kind of end game for this thing? How did he plan on getting rid of the pain besides ice and a shot? That's why I focused my reply on the timeline, to highlight the fact that you ran on an injury for quite a long time without intentional breaks to take care of it. I know it's just a nagging pain but it's not going to go away if you keep running, and if you do it could escalate into something else. Again, I have zero medical knowledge and I very well could be just a monkey banging at a keyboard for all you know, but here's my prescription. You ran on it for about 10 weeks. If you want to be done with this thing then you need to give some serious thought to taking an equal amount of time not running. Taking off ten weeks is extreme, but I think injecting cortisone and continuing to run on the thing as if it doesn't exist is equally extreme. Use your personal judgement and your unique knowledge of your body to try to strike a balance between the two, but the main thing is that you absolutely need to take some time off. You also need to think beyond just getting the pain to go away and actually getting to the source of the injury so it doesn't just come back. First off, forget about shoes and running form. Those things, combined with running surface, body weight, muscular imbalance, and several other popular topics are(again this is just my opinion) aggravating causes of injury that very rarely cause problems on their own. In my opinion, the vast majority of running injuries are caused by too much, too fast, and too soon. The other aggravating factors come into play only after you've already crossed the tm/tf/ts threshold. So why do running magazines and books talk so much about form and shoes? Because running literature tends to learn from and mimic elite runners. Elite runners need to worry about these things because they're constantly riding the too much line to ensure they get their best performance possible. For them these secondary factors can make the difference between a record and losing their sponsorship. No one wants to be the one to say this, but if you're a recreational runner you shouldn't be riding that line. Unless you have a team of specialist doctors, massage therapists, personal coaches, and antigravity treadmills, you should err on the side of caution. And even if you do err on the side of caution it's very likely that your whole idea of what is cautious is way off because of things you've read about or heard from other runners. So this is really something that you need to just go out and play around with for yourself. That might not be what you want to hear, but the truth is that running is a very personal sport and every body is different. There are rough guidelines out there but you're never really going to know what's right for you without getting out there and making mistakes. I like to tell people that running is all about learning from your body, not about it. When you have a little pain in your achilles at mile 5, that's telling you something that you shouldn't ignore. What is it telling you? I don't know because I'm not you. I know that when I take a break longer than a few weeks and come back my achilles starts hurting at 50 mpw, stays painful for a week at that same mileage, then subsides. It's like clockwork every time. I didn't read that in a book or a magazine. I learned it on a road and now it's mine for the rest of my life. Go learn something about yourself. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHeterosexuals of Reddit, when did you realize you weren't gay?  by  TheBastardTrollin  AskReddit[+]sulejmankulenovic 20 points21 points22 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]sulejmankulenovic 20 points21 points22 points 1 day agoMy friend and I found a small stash of 70's playboy magazines in the woodshed at the farmIt continues...permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL - An apparently mentally ill Roman Catholic priest has regularly interrupted sporting events by running onto the track with signs about the impending apocalypse.

So the pain developed and you went to the ortho about mid-late August. He diagnosed it so you did the NSAID, ice, stretching thing while continuing to run. It didn't work so you got the injection on 9/5. Knowing you were training for an upcoming race he gave you the go ahead to continue running, which you did until the week after the 11/3 half when you got bronchitis. You took a month off, ran a week(pain free?), and now the pain has begun again.So if I have this right, you ran from the beginning of the pain on about 8/20 all the way to 11/3 without taking a major break from training?permalinksavecontextfull commentsLeg pain / pes anserine bursitis?  by  AJ_Redditin  running[+]sulejmankulenovic 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]sulejmankulenovic 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI asked because I know in growing teens this injury can take months to recover from.

He has the appearance of a normal, well-adjusted, caring person. His room is relatively clean, his personal appearance is together(albeit a bit disheveled), he has an active social life, his grades are adequate. The difference is that all of this is achieved with the absolute minimum effort.So no, he wouldn't have tons of clothes on the floor. He would have them in a hamper in his closet, waiting until he completely runs out of laundry.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNot like I needed another reason to hate religion.

If you read what I linked to you'll see that the practice started because they believed it had a positive medical effect. When they found out it had a negative effect, they altered the ritual to get rid of the risk. In my book that's admirable behavior and shouldn't be rewarded with a bunch of sensationalist nonsense that paints a picture of most Jews giving babies herpes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNot like I needed another reason to hate religion.

The World Wildlife Fund and Google are teaming up to deploy a fleet of anti-poacher UAVs in Africa. The goal? Survey and stop rhino poachers.  by  daviddesousain  technology[+]sulejmankulenovic 8 points9 points10 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]sulejmankulenovic 8 points9 points10 points 7 days agoThat's an interesting idea. If rhinos are being poached then we know there's a market for the horns. So if it were legal to raise, kill, and sell the rhinos then it would give people an incentive to not just get what they can of the last bit of the population, but to secure future populations for future profits. Also, people are resorting to such dangerous means to obtain the horns only because they're extremely valuable. If there were an open market for the horns the price would drop dramatically and poaching wouldn't be worth the trouble.The problem is getting a legal industry off the ground would require a much larger population than currently exists. So that brings you back to the exact situation we're in now, trying to stop the poachers so a healthy population can grow. As far as I know, rhinos don't have a reproductive problem like pandas so, if allowed, they can repopulate themselves.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle Drones Launch In Africa.
