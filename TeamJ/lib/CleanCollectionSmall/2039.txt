He argued that "God allowed those children to die so they would be welcome into his arms." I was more than angry at this and below is the counter argument I gave himThe God of the Old Testament is a just god, not a loving god, he is also "perfect"To be perfectly just God must act without passion or prejudice therefore God cannot be emotionalIf God is not emotion then he can't love usIf Satan is the opposite of God then he is purely emotion and therefore the only one of the two is capable of loving usIf the new Testament God is a loving god he must be Satan and not the God of the Old TestamentTherefore Satan is the one who allowed this to happen and is the one who "welcomed these children into his arms"My girlfriend then chimed in "so he worships Satan and not god?"He freaked out and stormed out the door. I realize this argument is absurd but at this point I wanted him to shut up and it was the only way to make it happenpermalinksavecontextfull comments[The Office]Toby IS NOT the Scranton Strangler(Not so much a theory as an anti theory)  by  bearshyin  FanTheories[+]le_fez 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]le_fez 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoyou have completely convinced me that it's wrong with such a well thought out and persuasive argumentpermalinksavecontextfull commentsTSA Detains sick little girl for hours  by  uxlin  news[+]le_fez 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]le_fez 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago"hours" "nearly an hour" same thingpermalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

Maybe using these murders Toby contrived a story about the Strangler, he uses the ideas to write a mystery novel based on "the Scranton Strangler" he figures that the person who was arrested will be aquitted but maybe that guy actually committed one of the murders and that's how he ended up convicted.  Or Oscar makes it up, again using a string of unrelated murders, purely to prove he's smarter than everyone else and things get out of hand. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPope Benedict Blesses Top Lawmaker Pushing Ugandas Kill The Gays Bill  by  fishnetdiverin  atheism[+]le_fez 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]le_fez 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agofrom Hitler Youth to Nazi Pope, leopards don't change their spots. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSeems legit.  by  PrincessSparklyZamin  atheism[+]le_fez 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]le_fez 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoyes, yes it did and now my eyes are twitching I think they are trying to leap from my head to punish me for making them read that....messpermalinksavecontextfull comments[The Office]Toby IS NOT the Scranton Strangler(Not so much a theory as an anti theory)  by  bearshyin  FanTheories[+]le_fez -4 points-3 points-2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]le_fez -4 points-3 points-2 points 1 day agoReading this made something click for me. Maybe there is no Scranton Strangler, maybe it's something Toby made up for one of his novels that somehow got leaked out and mistaken for reality. That would explain how knows an innocent man is on death row. And yes I realize this theory ignores things like there would have to be bodies and evidence but the Office has not always been grounded in reality, plus I'm thinking of this on the fly, may have to try to flesh out this theory because I have nothing else to do. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your useless talent?  by  IamSofaKingIttyin  AskReddit[+]le_fez 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]le_fez 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI always wake up two minutes before my alarm goes off. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThere needs to be a system in which you must be literate to vote...  by  thebestthingsincein  books[+]le_fez 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]le_fez 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago"Totally unbelievable!!! talking animals are dumb and the colors weren't realistic so glad that Shakespeare guy made a movie based on it"permalinksavecontextfull comments[GTM] Eager.  by  B-musin  GuessTheMovie[+]le_fez 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]le_fez 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agopretty woman?permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy library book REEKS!  by  earthpeesfirein  books[+]le_fez 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]le_fez 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agomy sprayed them lightly with something and then left them to air out in our guest roompermalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you could go back in time, what would you change?  by  boxman1124in  AskReddit[+]le_fez 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]le_fez 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agogo back to the day I blew out my knee and tell myself not to play that pick up football game.

He's a hypocrite and no better than a proselytizing Christian in that sense. Too many Christians assume that all atheists act the way he does.
