Dan Malloy confirmed the Sandy Hook killer was still alive as authorites entered the school.Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy confirmed on Sunday that authorities believe Adam Lanza was alive when police arrived at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday and only ended his killing spree by shooting himself when he knew the cops were closing in.RELATED STORY: HEROISM AND SACRIFICE PHOTO GALLERY"He shot his way into the school," Malloy said on ABC's "This Week." "The school was locked. He used a weapon to open up the glass, and then walked in."When asked if he "blasted" his way through the glass, Malloy said, "Right, with several rounds, a number of rounds.""He discharged to make an opening and then went through it, went to the first classroom, as you know, went to the second classroom," he continued."We surmise that it was during the second classroom episode that he heard responders coming and apparently at that time decided to take his own life," he said.RELATED STORY: FIRST GRADE TEACHER DIED PROTECTING HER STUDENTSMalloy's description of the horrific events follows a CBS News report that the first police officer on the scene saw the gunman down a long hallway when he entered the school. That officer told CBS that the shooter spotted him and ducked into a room off the hallway where he unleashed a final barrage of bullets before killing himself.The officer, joined at this point by his partner, then found Lanza dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound near a group of children and their teacher who had all been shot multiple times.RELATED STORY: LIST OF SANDY HOOK VICTIMSAnother group of children who had also been shot were found huddled in a nearby bathroom.Malloy said on "This Week" that police responded quickly, in just minutes, after getting the first phone call alerting them to the shooting. The governor believed that call was made from an injured person in the school office.RELATED STORY: GUNMAN ADAM LANZA LEARNED TO SHOOT FROM HIS MOTHERRELATED STORY: GUN CONTROL DEBATE TAKES TO SUNDAY MORNING AIRWAVESDuring a separate interview on CNN, Malloy's voice broke as he described telling the families who had been "clinging to hope" in a firehouse near Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday that their children and family members would not be coming home."That's an exercise that I will live with for the rest of my life," he said during an interview on CNN. "You can never be prepared for that - to tell 18 to 20 folks or families that their loved one would not be returning to them."klee@nydailynews.comPost a Comment CommentsSee All Comments[Discussion Guidelines                                                        ]To post your comments, please, Sign in                                                         .
