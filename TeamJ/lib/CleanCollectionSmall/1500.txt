See More The question goes to what would make a person something like this? Something so terrific to children so little. Let's bring in psychiatrist dr. Janet taylor to talk about the mind of the shooter. Clearly, everybody understands this young man was mentally ill. But to pick children, young, young children, as his victims. I mean, that is about the worst thing you could do. What does that tell you about his motivation? About his stability or instability, obviously? Certainly, there is an evil just heinous quality to it. And the fact is, it's impossible to predict who will be violent. But risk factors are, individuals who have been exposed to physical abuse, sexual abuse. If there's an underlying psychological impairment, which certainly he was described as odd and in the autism spectrum. If they have access to guns and weapons. And certainly, individuals who may have revenge in their mind. But who wants to hurt innocent children? Obviously, there's a lot of people in this country that are autisticr haves asperger's syndrome and never commit a violent act. This young man, according to police, is shooting his mother at his home, and getting in the car with his weapons, driving to an elementary school, walking in and shooting kindergartners and first graders. I think the premeditative quality of it indicates a fact that you can be mentally ill. You can be psychotic and know right from among. And this case, I think he deliberately knew what he was doing. Certainly, his underlying mental illness, presumably that he had, was not an excuse in any way for a what he did. The fact that the target was young children. Does that give you any indication of perhaps he was trying to hurt something that meant something to his mother? I mean, presumably that would be the link. Unfortunately, we will not know. But you have to think that the fact he killed his mother and then went and killed innocent children, maybe there's a link between his mother and the kids. Or maybe he just felt like he was doing something so horrific that he would always be remembered. We won't know. At the end of the day, we have to pray for families and understand that at some point, we will understand the motive. But it still will never be enough to bring the poor kids and adults who died back. The focus is on the families and the victims.
