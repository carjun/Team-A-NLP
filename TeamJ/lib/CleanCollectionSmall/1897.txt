I guess I am pretty stupid for using concepts like logic and reasoning. Silly me huh?You're using concepts like smug faggotry, irrational fear and by appealing to emotion (which is a fallacy, already stated).

You seem to think criminals are stupid.I'm also confident that the homicide count if RPGs were actually able to be owned by civilians would be zero, since they'd undoubtedly be horribly expensive and owned only by the most responsible. There's also no reason to even use an RPG over alternatives. That's a fucking stupid example.That is my reason, that there is fuck all reason to own it with plenty of negatives associated to the escalation of arms acquired by the general population.You don't have a reason backed up by data or facts, only feelings and irrational fear.

With 28, including 20 children, shot dead in Connecticut, it's not 'politics' but basic decency to insist America have this debate.  by  kimat-qn-gurruodin  politics[+]s0beit 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoI don't think we can actually have a conversation at all after your statement that all forms of gun control are utilitarian. Welcome to every civilized country on earth where governments exist and regulate/legislate firearms. Not sure how this kind of mentality works.I think you may be confusing the word "utilitarian" with "utopian", or something else. You should google it. I'm not saying this to be rude, it's just clear that your statement has no connection to the word. It's not even a negative term, it's just a form of argument.Longer wait times can deter impatient and impulsive individuals.I believe the current wait time is 3 days, what is the precise appropriate amount of time required to wait before your impulses fade? I'd like to know. "Longer" isn't a metric of measurement.Stricter background checks can weed out those with past records mental issues. (apparently current background checks are not sufficient or always carried out. Need stricter adherence and a better database)I'd be comfortable with checks on previous mental issues if people could also be removed from the blacklist by seeking the appropriate medical treatment. Somebody having a mental problem should be able to own a firearm when they are deemed fit to own one, it's something important that is hardly ever brought up. I'm also fairly worried that very minor problems in a person's psychology could prevent them from buying a firearm. Got prescribed Xanax by your doctor? Can't own a firearm. Things like that. I know, slippery slope and all, but things do tend to move in that direction when we're talking about such an emotional topic.Military grade weapons should not be available to the general public for obvious reasons you don't seem to understand. (when civilians have better weapons than police then what? When unqualified individuals purchase these firearms will their use be as controlled and efficient as in the hands of someone who is trained months and years?)The police are people too, you know. They are just as likely to be responsible with their firearms as any other law abiding citizen. I also believe self-defense means self-defense. If you can't expect to actually defend yourself from other people (say, somebody who has a powerful firearm) then it can't be called the right to self-defense at all.You're right, the reasons are not at all obvious given the statistical data. It's only if you ignore logic that your argument seems valid, because by any metric "assault" rifles are safer than shotguns and pistols. They're safer than knives, vehicles and home appliances as well, just a little factoid.Blanketed opposition and extremism such as "all gun control is utilitarian and wrong" and "all guns should be illegal" is another reason why this country is fucked. When people can't meet in the middle like reasonable adults it means we cannot address this issue effectively.I might be guilty of blanketed opposition in my personal life, but for the sake of this argument I have remained fairly centrist. I personally don't think any new laws are required in the way of firearms. I live in Chicago, and all of those restrictions were firmly in place since the 80s. Our city was only able to get sicker and more dangerous over the years, so I may be biased, but if my anecdotal evidence (and that of my entire city) means anything it's that strict gun control is less than effective.I believe it's important to address the mental health issues surrounding the motivations to murder, but I don't believe it's at all important to address guns specifically. There's a litany of gun legislation on the books and they have sadly failed to bring the death toll down.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis one is just for you, Reddit.  by  shenanigansswagin  4chan[+]s0beit -1 points0 points1 point 8 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit -1 points0 points1 point 8 hours agoI don't think I really need a reason. To me, it doesn't need to be justified. You have not done a sufficient job explaining why I shouldn't own one. You haven't given any reason at all. I don't care if you don't see the need in owning one. Good for you, don't buy one.If you're implying they're dangerous, I've just explained that they're not at all dangerous compared to any alternative. I can guarantee you right now, that knives, vehicles, prescription drugs and even exercise equipment (not combined, each on their own) have killed more people in America than rifles, fully automatic or not. If they're "designed to kill humans", they've done an absolutely horrible, inefficient job of it.358 people killed with rifles in 2010, with the total percentage of military styled Sport Utility rifles at just under two percent of the total number of rifles in civilian hands. That is roughly equal to 7. I would imagine (since they're insanely expensive and you have to jump through numerous legal hoops to get them) the number of murders by fully automatic rifles is zero.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis one is just for you, Reddit.  by  shenanigansswagin  4chan[+]s0beit -6 points-5 points-4 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit -6 points-5 points-4 points 9 hours agoThere's types of guns made specifically to avoid killing too, like bean bag weapons. You conveniently brought a "kitchen" knife into the argument so I just thought I'd bring that up.What about hunting knives? Those should be banned at least, right? They're made specifically to rip apart flesh at the very least.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis one is just for you, Reddit.  by  shenanigansswagin  4chan[+]s0beit -2 points-1 points0 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit -2 points-1 points0 points 9 hours agoAR-15 is the semi-automatic version of the M16 rifle. It's entire reason for existence is that it is not automatic.Even if you don't understand "the need" for an average citizen to own one, the fact is you are literally thousands of times more likely to be killed by a handgun over a semi-automatic or fully automatic rifle (well, at least by another civilian, I can't speak for dictators). In fact, the stronger a weapon is, at least in the United States, the less likely you are to be killed by it. It seems paradoxical until you realize concealing an AR-15 is fucking impossible and rifles are expensive as fuck. You need an FBI background check to own an automatic weapon, or certain other types of weapons.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNewtown shootings: if not now, when is the time to talk about gun control? With 28, including 20 children, shot dead in Connecticut, it's not 'politics' but basic decency to insist America have this debate.  by  kimat-qn-gurruodin  politics[+]s0beit 5 points6 points7 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit 5 points6 points7 points 9 hours agoObviously I didn't say anything to the effect that getting shot by a military grade weapon was very likelyThen why restrict them?meant to be used by trained professionalsI don't think that's in the manual, and that's really your own interpretation... they don't seem to be much of a problem for anyone, other than people with certain sensibilities thinking they're scary.It's not unreasonable to ask for stricter regulations of sales,background checks for individuals, longer wait times, in order to purchase firearms.In what context? If we're talking in this specific case, and cases like it, the guns were stolen. So in this case, I think it is unreasonable to ask for stricter regulations because everything you've mentioned would have been easily bypassed.Stricter regulation of sales - You need to elaborate, this is incredibly vague, but no matter what regulation on sales was in effect his mother would be the consumer. Assuming she would be cleared, this would not be effective.Background checks for individuals - He stole them from his mother, this would not be effective.Longer wait times - How does this fix anything? Really, what would this do? Even in the cases where gun owners have used their guns to commit crimes, it's not on impulse. There's already a lengthy waiting period, and they have possessed a gun for a while before using it to commit a crime. Please cite one example where somebody bought a gun, and immediately after the waiting period committed a crime with it. This is just something that makes no sense to me, and once again, his mother owned the guns for some time so this also would not have been effective.Not sure where you think I stepped into the utilitarian region with my comment. It's the blanketed opposition to even discussing gun control that really hinders any progress on this issue.The entire concept of gun control is utilitarian.we cannot ignore the numerous mass shootings that have taken place this year alone. I personally believe mental health awareness would do wonders, people don't really seem to be pushing that as much as gun control, though.To do so would be an insult to the victims who would have much rather have had their gunman denied a gun and still be alive.Appealing to emotion is a fallacy. Passing laws based on emotions evoked from something like this does no good. It is important to remain logical. This is how the patriot act got passed with little opposition.I think it's important to note that all of the things you've brought up would have done nothing at all to prevent this crime from occurring. He didn't use an "assault" weapon, he didn't buy the guns himself, they weren't used immediately after a purchase.So, when you bring up laws like this which would not have prevented this crime in any way, yes, people become wary. It makes people feel like you're not working to prevent this crime from occurring, but rather working to prevent people from owning things you don't like. I'm not making the assertion that this is the case, but that is certainly what it would seem like.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI see a lot of anime with a child about the age of 13-15 who live alone.

Sure, "military grade weapon" sounds scary, but those things are huge, not very easy to conceal, and cost a bundle.Automatics have even fewer deaths since you already require an FBI background check and about $10,000+ to own one, as well as a yearly fee.It would make sense, if you're a utilitarian and actually believe gun control would work, to ban handguns.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLast year Handguns Killed: 48 People in Japan, 8 Great Britain, 34 Switzerland, 52 Canada, 58 Israel, 21 Sweden, 10,728 in The United States - Uk | Frrole  by  wideirisin  politics[+]s0beit 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours agoAnd size matters how?It matters in this instance because it's not per-capita, and comparing Japan which is pretty tiny to the whole of the United States in raw numbers is a little unfair.I'm not saying I agree or disagree with whatever point the OP is trying to make, I'm just stating that it's not a legitimate comparison.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis one is just for you, Reddit.  by  shenanigansswagin  4chan[+]s0beit -12 points-11 points-10 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit -12 points-11 points-10 points 11 hours agoThe AR-15 does have a use other than killing people.Killing animals while hunting.

Smaller firearms are not only more affordable, it's also sort of hard concealing a 3-4 foot long weapon.Rifles are just not a good way to kill people illegally, too much exposure for virtually no benefit. Also, fully automatic firearms are insanely expensive. They are truly reserved for the well-to-do and people have to pass an FBI background check already to obtain them legally. I see no problem with them owning one, they are the people with the most incentive to follow the law (and they do, in fact, crimes with fully automatic firearms in America are virtually nil).permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis one is just for you, Reddit.  by  shenanigansswagin  4chan[+]s0beit 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours agoLIMITING PEOPLES ACCESS TO FIREARMS WILL LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO USE THEM IN VIOLENT ACTIVITIES.LIMITING PEOPLE WHO WILL FOLLOW THE LAW FROM OBTAINING FIREARMS WILL NOT LIMIT ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE ABIDING THE LAW EITHER WAY.If you're worried about criminals, they will just break the law to get a gun unless it's less efficient to do so. Maybe it costs too much, maybe they can kill the people they want to kill without a gun, but I doubt they'll say to themselves "Well, darn, getting a gun will be a bit hard so I guess that murder I've planned will have to wait until the liberals let their guard down".permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis one is just for you, Reddit.  by  shenanigansswagin  4chan[+]s0beit 7 points8 points9 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit 7 points8 points9 points 11 hours agoShould be noted that comparing overall crime before and after a ban is more effective than comparing two completely different countries with different sets of social problems. It's also not really indicative of anything since crime has been falling worldwide, with or without gun laws.

Chicago, New York, Detroit, Washington, Los Angeles. All very, very violent places. All more strict than any of the places you've mentioned, so much so that they elevate the crime rate of their entire host state.Now, this doesn't actually mean any of their laws necessarily had an impact either way. I'm not saying anti-gun laws increase crime any more than pro-gun laws decrease crime. I really don't believe either to be true. I think it is most certainly a people problem. You need to have problems containing aggression, be a sociopath or insane to murder somebody in cold blood in the first place. Sane people don't just kill others, especially not over drugs, money or because they thought it would be fun (in the case of mall/school shooters).The mental problems are the core here, I would say that America, because it puts very little emphasis on mental health and because most people just don't understand what it means to be mentally ill here (as evidenced by our legal system) is extremely prone to violence. It's not necessarily exacerbating the problem, but it's not really doing anything to fix it either. Criminals are not rehabilitated and warning signs go completely unnoticed. You're considered crazy is you see a mental help professional. etc.I'd also argue that mental health can impact social standing, which is why a lot of the poor inner city youth end up killing one another. If the middle-class teens were as mentally damaged as some of these gang members (who were often raised by, or were personally exposed to in various ways people who have extremely volitile personalities, kill, beat, rape or murder) they would be killing each other about as much. Those people won't amount to much, and since they were raised to be terrible people, so too will they raise their children to be terrible people. It's a vicious cycle.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
