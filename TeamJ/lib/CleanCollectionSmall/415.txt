TODAY's Erica Hill reports, and Savannah Guthrie talks with two men who knew her. By Miguel Llanos, NBC NewsAs witnesses recount the horrific crime at Sandy Hook Elementary, one constant is emerging: Even more children would have been killed had it not been for the actions of teachers, a custodian and even the students themselves.Follow @NBCNewsUS"A lot of children are alive today because of actions the teachers took," School Superintendent Janet Robinson told NBC's TODAY show on Saturday, a day after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at the K-4th grade school in Newtown, Conn.Principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, both among those killed, were said to have run towards the gunfire as it broke out, with Hochsprung lunging at the gunman, according to town officials.Advertise | AdChoices Hochsprung was coming out of a meeting when she confronted the shooter, Board of Education chairwoman Debbie Liedlien said Saturday.Jeff Capeci, chairman of Newtown's Legislative Council, said Hochsprung's actions were nothing short of heroic."From what we know, it's hard to classify her as anything else," he added.Teachers like Maryrose Kristopik took their students to the safest areas in their classrooms. In Kristopik's case, it was a closet."We hid in a closet, we stayed quiet, we held hands, we hugged," Kristopik, who teaches music, told the New York Daily News. "I tried to talk to them calmly."Mary Ann Jacob, a school library aide, told reporters Saturday that she took 18 4th graders into the back of a classroom and blocked the door with a filing cabinet."The kids cozied up, and we waited," Jacob said, adding that the children were told it was a drill."When the police finally came, we were afraid to open the door," she said of the hour-long ordeal.

"Then bullets whizzed by."A custodian warned of the gunman by running through the halls, said 4th grade teacher Theodore Varga."He said, 'Guys! Get down! Hide!'" Varga said. "So he was actually a hero."It was not known if the custodian, whose name was not released, had survived.Related: Principal had 'talked about this exact type of incident'Even some students were able to muster up courage as shots were fired around them.One student claimed to know karate, the Associated Press reported. "It's OK. I'll lead the way out," the student said.School Superintendent Janet Robinson talks about the heroism of teachers and says the shooter's mother was not a full-time teacher at Sandy Hook.A parentsaid his 6-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher.Advertise | AdChoices "That's when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door," Robert Licatasaid.
