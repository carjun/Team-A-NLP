It is truly sad that we stopped raising kids to be stand up people,and pass it off to the doctor when all he cares about is how many pills he can get into this kid so he can get that new BMW.Burnus_Swarthout: I feel all of these shooting cases are brought abouthttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Burnus_Swarthout/connecticut-shooting-armed-teachers-gun-advocate_n_2304654_213929834.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

Unfortunately, his mother was irresponsible by not having them locked away from an emotionally disturbed child. The guns were no more responsible for these murders than the car that transported Lanza to the school. The guns were a means to an end, we need to address the cause...If there had been a teacher properly trained in the use of a firearm at that school, things could have possibly been minimized. Today the United States ranks behind countries like: France, Sweden, Singapore, Norway, in murders per capita...I cry for these poor innocents that were slaughtered by a homicidal maniac and feel we owe these children a real effort to provide a safer world, by addressing the societal problems that cause the behavior...regularguynyc: The animal that did this in CT was illegally carryinghttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/regularguynyc/connecticut-shooting-armed-teachers-gun-advocate_n_2304654_213928655.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itHUFFPOST SUPER USERjhuffingtonObama 332, Romney 2061895 Fans11 minutes ago ( 4:48 PM)So you'd be okay with getting rid of the gun show loophole?jhuffington: So you'd be okay with getting rid of the gunhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/jhuffington/connecticut-shooting-armed-teachers-gun-advocate_n_2304654_213930897.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.
