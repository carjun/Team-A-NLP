And, in these two seasons, he's accumulated nearly 10,000 yards.The experience and firmer leadership will come to him, we just have to let him grow. Everyone wants a quick fix rookie QB to come in and explode, no one's willing to wait a bit. There is an incredible amount of talent in Stafford and I do believe he has the potential to become an elite QB, but he needs to develop the attitude and mind of an elite QB.Also, as a sidenote, I fucking love the little side arm flick. I hope that never goes, but I also hope he doesn't get carried away with it. There's a time and a place for those throws.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho or what is the biggest disappointment of your team this year?  by  zipzap21in  nfl[+]tbonefeelgood 3 points4 points5 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]tbonefeelgood 3 points4 points5 points 3 hours agoStafford is second in the league in passing yards, despite the Lions having the most dropped passes of any team. Stafford's been excellent.The play calling and our DB's have been awful.In the Houston game, instead of running the ball on 3rd down to get the ball in the middle and possibly gain an extra yard or two. The call was a hail mary!In the Colts game, our DB's were non existent on that last play and let the Colts walk into the damn end zone.We have lost all 9 games by an average of 6.52 points, thats 1 possession. Some smarter calls and DB's that aren't as useless as dog turd and we would have definitely had more success.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSupermarket checkouts have been taken over by children wanting to pack my bags for charity.  by  TheGoodOttoKatzin  britishproblems[+]tbonefeelgood 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]tbonefeelgood 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours agoI had to do this crap once two days before Christmas and it was my 10th birthday!Only highlight was being given a 50p coin from an older woman when I told her it was my birthday.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's something that's part of Internet/reddit culture that makes you cringe?  by  MapleMoonFUCKFUCKin  AskReddit[+]tbonefeelgood 84 points85 points86 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]tbonefeelgood 84 points85 points86 points 5 hours agoIt seems like a lot of the internet and most definitely reddit seem to think that everyone is out to bring the white male down.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe rules of pool - why is there no consensus.  by  I_love_weetabixin  britishproblems[+]tbonefeelgood 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (0 children)[]tbonefeelgood 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoNo one shot carry.

I mean, they chose to play a sport where they know full well that serious injuries are inevitable. That was their choice to do so. The NFL didn't make them choose this line of work. So why is the league responsible for what happens to them?I'm guessing that it's like most work environments where the employer has to make sure nothing goes wrong in the place of work. But in this instance, it seems absurd, since during the entire working period, there is risk of serious injury for these guys.EDIT: I'd just like to add, that what I'm saying does not mean I think the NFL shouldn't try to make it safer for the players...they should. I'm just saying the players know what they are signing up for, it's not the NFL's or Goodell's fault if they end up with a career ending injury/serious head trauma.EDIT 2: Thanks guys for the info. It certainly helps me to understand this a bit better.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy Plan for the Offseason  by  My_Tallestin  detroitlions[+]tbonefeelgood 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tbonefeelgood 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoFairley and Suh is a fantastic DT combo, we need to put some solid ends there. If we do manage to keep Avril, then I want to see Jackson on the other end. KVB sucks.If we got Milliner, Rhodes, Banks or Reid by whatever means, then I'd be happy. An early DE and Banks or Reid later on would be great.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOn Sept 16th, the Cardinals beat the Patriots 20-18 in Foxboro.

There's so many talented guys at those positions this year. Not to mention, we need someone who isn't 1000 years old as a DE (Vanden Bosch), especially with the possibility of Avril asking for too much and not being able to sign him. After that though, we need defensive backs desperately.As for WR's, as long as Burleson comes back healthy, we should be ok.permalinksavecontextfull comments12/12/12  by  Hunteazyin  funny[+]tbonefeelgood 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tbonefeelgood 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoEarlier this year, we had, 21/02/2012.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWent to the Lions vs. Colts game, took some pictures.  by  KevinJDin  nfl[+]tbonefeelgood 1 point2 points3 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]tbonefeelgood 1 point2 points3 points 11 days agoThe camera kept showing Stafford's face throughout the Colt's last drive of the game, his expression explained everything.
