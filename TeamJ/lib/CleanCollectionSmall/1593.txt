At stake, 419 delegates.Gingrich heads to Alabama early this afternoon for two campaign events before returning to Atlanta for Election Night. The former House speaker is expected to easily win his home state of Georgia, which he has said is crucial to his campaign for the nomination.

Alabama cites "wide spread" voter fraud has reason for enacting photo ID laws.  When asked to cite examples to show how "wide spread" the fraud is occurring, a Republican state legislator cited "three incidents" of voter fraud, "occurring primarity in districts with minority majorities".  When asked for details, the legislator cited a clerk that was convicted of voter fraud.  The clerk had been accussed of the improper handling of absentee ballots.  A clerk.  Absentee ballots.  How does the new photo ID laws address that sort of voter fraud?  It doesn't.March 6, 2012 12:34 pm at 12:34 pm | FtrampushIt's  time for this Old man to retire.He has been taking his supporters to the cleaners for too many years.Hence if he retires than all the Repub Politicans will regain their BeesMarch 6, 2012 12:45 pm at 12:45 pm | Oscar Dormani wish that all of these republicans would lay off of Obama about his health care bill and they are praising Mitt Romney for his health care law in the state of Mass. and he said the difference between his and Obamas is that his doesnt have as many pages as Obamas but everyone needs to realize one thing and that is Mitts health care law is only for the state of Mass. and Obamas is for the entire country of United States and one thing everyone needs to realize is the reason there hasnt been that much done in the last 3years is because the House Republicans has held this country and its business hostage just because they dont like Obama and if the rest of the country would realize that then they are probably gonna get voted out of the house and let the democrats take back control and let them get the job done for this country. And their talking about jobs the Majority of the jobs lost was lost under Bush's watch and this country was going down hill so fast and Obama has gotten it turned around a little but he could have gotten alot more done if the republicans didnt have control of the house, it it was left upto me i would send all of the republicans in the house and in the senate home unemployed and let them see how the rest of America feels.March 7, 2012 12:34 am at 12:34 am | johnny57They got rid of Imus when he shot his mouth off.  I don't see any reason why we shouldn't get rid of Rush Limbaugh.  He does not set a good example for people.  He is also addicted to Oxycodone, what is up with that?  Do we want prescription drug addicts advising us on policy and politics.  His time has come, and he should go!March 7, 2012 02:33 am at 2:33 am |  Back to main previous postnext post Follow this Blog: Twitter.@PoliticalTicker on Twitter Huckabee: Lack of religion in classroom leads to violence in schools bit.ly/UlWETaPoliticalTicker1:36 pm ET December 15, 2012RETWEETHillary Clinton faints, has concussion bit.ly/Y5BsXpPoliticalTicker1:36 pm ET December 15, 2012RETWEETHuckabee: Lack of religion in classroom leads to violence in schools bit.ly/ZvlVR4PoliticalTicker1:36 pm ET December 15, 2012RETWEETHuckabee: Lack of religion in classroom leads to violence in schools - wp.me/p4HKM-17qBPoliticalTicker1:36 pm ET December 15, 2012RETWEETHillary Clinton faints, suffers concussion - wp.me/p4HKM-17qwPoliticalTicker12:38 pm ET December 15, 2012RETWEET From CNN PoliticsAmid fanfare, same-sex couples exchange marriage vows in Seattle December 13, 2012 02:50 pmHouse Republicans stick with Boehner on fiscal cliff  December 13, 2012 02:50 pmA tearful Obama: 'These children are our children' December 14, 2012 09:38 pmEx-Senate leaders: How to make a deal December 14, 2012 04:27 pmDebt talks delay Congress' break December 14, 2012 05:47 pmGOP tries different tactic on cuts December 12, 2012 12:27 pmRelated LinksCNNPolitics.comElection CenterThe Cafferty File BlogTIME.com: Swampland Recent Posts Huckabee: Lack of religion in classroom leads to violence in schoolsHillary Clinton faints, has concussionObama: 'Our hearts are broken'McCain, Rice, Obama and the politics of personalityLawmakers respond in aftermath of Connecticut school shooting Recent Comments Larry L on Obama: 'Our hearts are broken'cloud on Huckabee: Lack of religion in classroom leads to violence in schoolsCBR on Huckabee: Lack of religion in classroom leads to violence in schoolsEric S on Huckabee: Lack of religion in classroom leads to violence in schoolsKristi on Huckabee: Lack of religion in classroom leads to violence in schoolsArchivesMarch 2012SMTWTFS FebApr 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031Weather forecastHome | Video | CNN Trends | U.S. | World | Politics | Justice | Entertainment | Tech | Health | Living | Travel | Opinion | iReport | Money | SportsTools & widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN mobile | My profile | E-mail alerts  | CNN shop | Site mapCNN en ESPAOL | CNN Mxico | CNN Chile | CNN Expansion |  |  |  | CNN TV | HLN | Transcripts 2012 Cable News Network.
