Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]fiziks07 29 points30 points31 points 41 minutes ago (0 children)[]fiziks07 29 points30 points31 points 41 minutes ago36 parents will be getting that heartbreaking call today. 36 parents will not get to spend the holidays with their child. The families of the children, and all of the others will remember this every holiday season and it will always haunt them. Unimaginable.As a father with a daughter who is getting ready to start school in 2013, this hits hard. The real WTF here is that there are two shooters. It's hard enough trying to understand why one person would do such a thing, but to think that two people were able to carry this out really gets to me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGiven that there are many different systems of measurement for distance/size (e.g. meter v. inch or km v. mile), are there different measures of time as well?

There's a lot of red tape and planning involved, not to mention capital. We've got the planning and some of the red tape figured out, but finding investors will be the hardest.I think that's what turns so many people off to the idea. I've had a few businesses already, and I finally think I've found my true calling.From the first time I gave a brew to someone and saw the satisfaction and enjoyment they got from it. That's when I knew it was what I wanted. I want to make people happy, and I want to give them delicious beer that they can enjoy time and time again.Worth the effort, time, and money?
