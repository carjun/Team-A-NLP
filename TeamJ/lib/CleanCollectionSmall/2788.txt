Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]hobbitlover 6 points7 points8 points 20 minutes ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover 6 points7 points8 points 20 minutes agoReporter here. It's a shitty, underpaid and unappreciated job on the best of days. Take my advice and do something else  get an IT degree or become a teacher or something. You'll be happier.If you do decide to go on with your degree, then harden up. You'll be asked to do a lot of things you don't want to do, that seem cruel or classless, but remember that your job is to be completely dispassionate and harden up. Your job in a situation like this is to tell the stories of the dead and the survivors, to capture the fear and anger, to get the facts out there, to find a way to give the story meaning, to ensure that people are still talking about it a week from now, and, if possible, to leverage the work you do to create some sort of positive change in the world. As a reporter, you hold up the mirror to society, which won't always like what it sees reflected back. If you hold the mirror right, people won't even notice who's doing the holding, all they'll care about is fixing what's wrong with that picture.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

There's someone above them telling them to talk to kids, get reactions. And they're doing it because that's the way media works these days. There will be some good, respectful reporting on this shooting after the fact, but you won't get it from the 24 hour news cycle. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I think it will take a while to sort out, but whatever the final tally this is a tragedy beyond scope for the families of the victims  and especially all of the children.

The problem with tips is that people generally tip the same whether the service is good or bad so they don't get spit in their food next time -- and when tips are automatic, there's really no incentive to provide good, friendly service or to hire real "people persons." The fact is, some people are really good at it, and deserve to be tipped. They're nice, they're genuine, they work hard, they fix problems and they deserve recognition for what they do. I believe that customer service at that level is a rare and special skill that's not rewarded nearly enough in society. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoHave you tried filters?

I played rugby competitively for 14 years and the best part was hanging out on grass all afternoon. I loved the smell of it, the feel of it, the way it would get slippery on wet days. I also like having grass in a backyard because I actually do like mowing, (got paid to do it for years) and playing around with kids on the grass is the best thing ever. But, that said, it's not for everyone and if you have backyard grass then you don't need front yard grass when there are so many other interesting, less labor intensive things you could do with that space. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoMost people I know do them because sometimes unpaid internships are the only way to get hired by the companies offering them  a free tryout of sorts where they don't have to pay to train you and can see if you're a hard worker and a good fit. It's a scam because they can skip the whole expensive and time-consuming recruitment process, they can get rid of you easily if you don't work out, and they can trap you into a level of productivity that's unfairly high (e.g. if you did this much as an unpaid intern, you should do THIS MUCH as a paid staffer).permalinksavecontextfull comments13567Got confirmation from Microsoft that they're working on the Music App/sync issue.

Without them I'd be living in a suite over a gas station somewhere, making minimum wage and playing video games eight hours a day.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt's official - Rush to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  by  Keywork99in  Music[+]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoAt the same show I think  1990-91ish?permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt's official - Rush to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  by  Keywork99in  Music[+]hobbitlover 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI used to pump his gas sometimes when I was in high school. I knew who he was and he gave me a credit card and the name said Gary. I only knew him as Geddy, so I asked him what was up. He told me that when he was a little kid he couldn't say his own name and called himself Geddy, and it caught on in the family. Nice guy, nice car, good tipper. One time he came in he was actually listening to the Tragically Hip, my other favourite band at the time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan of Steel - Official Trailer #2 [HD] - YouTube  by  dreadmonsterin  videos[+]hobbitlover -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoI don't know, I've seen enough gritty, super-serious superhero movie remakes lately. I think I'd prefer to see something more fun and maybe even a little campy.
