See More Police canvassing gun shops and firing ranges within 15 miles of newtown, connecticut, searching for more clues about the gunman and his mother. And tonight, some of those who knew them are coming forward to us with details about a young man who seemed to be unraveling. Here's abc's chief investigative correspondent brian ross. Reporter: Increasingly, adam was so troubled he would not leave the house, and his mother, nancy, in the last few months, 20-year-old son. It was just getting a little harder for her as time went on. Reporter: Nancy lanza was a regular that newtown bar and restaurant, where the owners said she told them about her struggle with adam's emotional and behavioral problems for years. I knew he was on medication, but that's all I know. Reporter: Since elementary school at sandy hook, through high school, adam was known by classmates as strange, severely shy. He hated looking into your eyes for a couple of seconds. Reporter: A former baby-sitter says he was told by the mother to never leave adam alone. Never turn your back on him at anymore time. Reporter: The former school security director who became close to adam said he had several disorders, including the inability to feel pain. So, if he had cut himself or hurt himself, he would not know it or feel it. So, we were being very, very careful with him. Reporter: But despite adam's issues, friends say nancy lanza took her son to local firing ranges and introduced him to the world of high-powered gun, including the bushmaster assault-style weapon he used to kill his victims. Demonstrated here in a video posted on the company youtube channel. The bushmaster can fire 45 rounds per minute and is the most popular style semiautomatic rifle in the country. Federal agents say nancy lanza bought her bushmaster legally in march 2010. A model apparently tailor-made by the company to be legal, even under connecticut law that suppose bly bans assault weapons. Okay, brian ross reporting in on his investigation. 1View CommentABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSshows:GMAGMA LIVE!GMA Recipes GMA Concert SeriesWorld NewsWorld News with David MuirNightline20/20Most Fascinating People Primetime NightlineDiane Sawyer SpecialsPrimetimeThis WeekWhat Would You Do?World News NowABC News NowPlaylist:World News: 12/18/12World News: 12/17/12World News: 12/14/12World News: 12/13/12World News: 12/12/12Person of the WeekWorld News ReportsWorld News ExtraHome > Video > World News > World News ReportsCerberus Capital Management to Sell Investments in Gun MakerCerberus Capital Management to Sell Investments in Gun MakerChris Cuomo on the backlash against Bushmaster and assault weapons.Newtown, Connecticut Tries to Return to NormalNewtown, Connecticut Tries to Return to NormalDan Harris looks at the courage of young students returning to school.Fiscal Cliff Negotiations: Trying to Make a DealFiscal Cliff Negotiations: Trying to Make a DealJon Karl reviews current proposals and how they might affect American families.Christmas Travel Could Be Slowed by Winter StormChristmas Travel Could Be Slowed by Winter StormGinger Zee tracks the forecast weather as holiday approaches.The Aftermath of Gun ViolenceThe Aftermath of Gun ViolenceMatt Gutman meets doctors who deal with tragic shootings.Instant Index: Instagram Changes End User AgreementInstant Index: Instagram Changes End User AgreementDiane Sawyer reports the news stories that had people buzzing this week.Newtown, Connecticut Gets Support From Across AmericaNewtown, Connecticut Gets Support From Across AmericaAmy Robach on the many acts of kindness after the school shootings.Who Was Newtown Gunman Adam Lanza?Who Was Newtown Gunman Adam Lanza?Troubling picture of Connecticut mass murderer slowly emerges.A Message of Hope from Newtown, Conn.A Message of Hope from Newtown, Conn.Sandy Hook shooting survivors stay hopeful in wake of tragedy.The Reality of Raising a Troubled ChildThe Reality of Raising a Troubled ChildParents speak out about the issues that can go with raising a mentally ill child.President Obama Pledges Action to Prevent More TragediesPresident Obama Pledges Action to Prevent More TragediesA new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows 54 percent of Americans favor stricter gun control.Hillary Clinton Faints, Suffers ConcussionHillary Clinton Faints, Suffers ConcussionGovernment says secretary of state fainted from dehydration caused by a stomach virus.1 of 4 | Next External links are provided for reference purposes.
