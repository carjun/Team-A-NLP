Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]perrygeo 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoAccording to MSNBC, he was targeting one classroom in particular. Her teachers aid was there and was shot. No one knows for sure since they haven't released the victims names.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]perrygeo 138 points139 points140 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]perrygeo 138 points139 points140 points 1 day ago*My mother teaches at this school. In the classroom that likely was the focus of the shooter. She took a sick day. While I'm so glad she's OK, somehow I don't feel lucky. It makes me sick beyond belief.  EDIT: Looks like the psycho was targeting his own mother's classroom. EDIT2: To clarify, my mother teaches kindergarten at Sandy Hook elementary but was home sick. The shooter's mom was also a kindergarten teacherthere and was the target. I don't know any more than that.  EDIT3: Apparently the shooter's mother (Nancy Lanza) was not a teacher at Sandy Hook (at least in recent years)EDIT4: The teacher's aide that worked with my mother was shot in the foot and went into surgery this afternoon and is stable. She sat with the kindergarten children during lockdown and kept them calm despite her injury.EDIT5: Way to go media. We somehow went from "The shooters mother, a kindergarten teacher at Sandy Hook was shot in her classroom" to "The shooter's mom, enthusiastic collector of guns, was shot in her home.". Do they just make this shit up? Did anyone fact check?EDIT6: Just to highlight how screwed up the media coverage of this was, a radio program reported this afternoon that my mom was "unaccounted for" 7 hours after the incident. My mom actually got a laugh out of this :-)permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow is this possible?  by  zhannin  WTF[+]perrygeo 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoWe ALL arepermalinksavecontextfull commentsFirst off road ride  by  OversizedSpoonin  MTB[+]perrygeo 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoRight on! you've got the right attitude for this sport and it only gets better with practice!

French press definitely has some oils going on, you can taste it and even see the difference. But how does the oil, once ingested, cause increased cholesterol? Not sure. I have two friends, both serious coffee fiends, who switched to paper filters and within weeks had significantly reduced cholesterol numbers.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsDo I have what it takes?  by  physguy420in  Velo[+]perrygeo -6 points-5 points-4 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]perrygeo -6 points-5 points-4 points 17 days agoThats a fairly high number but still only puts the OP in cat 1 according to the power profile charts.

The first version is confusing unless you happen to know the behavior of the dict() function. The second version (or luckystarr's suggestion) is explicit; the intent is clear and unambiguous. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow far do you travel for rides?  by  Jschaf355in  MTB[+]perrygeo 0 points1 point2 points 23 days ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 0 points1 point2 points 23 days agoI live in Portland, OR and there is almost no legit singletrack within about 45 minutes of the city. But if you're willing to drive 1 or 2 hours, there are dozens of awesome rides. So inevitably my weekends involve sitting in the car for a few hours.  If the drive gets up towards 3 hours (like out to Bend or Oakridge), I generally try to make a camping weekend of it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsContour or GoPro? which one to pick?  by  defridgeoratorin  MTB[+]perrygeo 5 points6 points7 points 26 days ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 5 points6 points7 points 26 days agoI have an older Contour HD and am not too impressed by it. The mounting system sucks and the video always comes out a bit shakier than I'd like. Still, it's a fine camera if you can deal with the mount and want a nice, light helmet cam. Some friends of mine use the Go Pro. The nice thing about it is the mounting system is more secure and can be run in many more configrations (vids shot with the chest strap look awesome when you get the bars in the frame. ) and arguably has better video quality. The only to the Go Pro is that it's larger and clunkier (and probably a bit heavier).permalinksavecontextfull commentsPoor Bastard Who Just Started Watching 'Lost' In For World Of Disappointment  by  PinkSlimeIsPeoplein  entertainment[+]perrygeo 0 points1 point2 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 0 points1 point2 points 28 days agoPoll for those of you who have seen the whole series:Given what you now know, would you watch the entire series again?permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrimet announces no more warnings - if you are caught without fare on the Max, you will get a ticket.  by  DrunkyCrowin  Portland[+]perrygeo -5 points-4 points-3 points 28 days ago (0 children)[]perrygeo -5 points-4 points-3 points 28 days agoI'm glad you mention price: I live in NW portland and work in NW portland (6 miles away) and it takes me 2 hours round trip to take public transportation. And I get to pay $5 for this. Great. OR I can drive, pay $6 for parking, $1.50 for gas and take 40 minutes round trip.I'd gladly pay an extra $2.50 to save 80 minutes a day!  If parking cost quite a bit more, public transport would be a economical choice!permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Performance Impact of Using dict() Instead of {} in CPython 2.7  by  gthankin  Python[+]perrygeo 9 points10 points11 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 9 points10 points11 points 1 month agoMost of the time a dictionary with fixed keys looks better as dict(), and requires less typing to boot.Not in my opinion. Why obscure the fact that your keys are meant to be strings? The dict is a fundamental data structure and everyone who uses python should be intimately familiar with it's syntax. >>> c = dict(a=a, b=b) >>> d = {'a': a, 'b': b} The end result is obviously the same but the later explicitly declares that the keys are strings. Plus you can use any other immutable you want for keys using this syntax. Plus it's faster. Plus the constructor matches the repr of a dict. The only reason to call the dict function (IMO) is when you need parameter expansion or converting other existing data structures (iterables of tuples, etc) to dicts.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHiring's Imagination Gap - and How to Close It  by  jonflain  business[+]perrygeo 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI agree that the rigid qualifications make it difficult to find an exact match - companies should be looking at people capable of performing tasks in the future, not necessarily in the past. As a programmer, I see jobs posted with very specific requirements ("Must have 5+ years of experience with Java Spring framework") when they really want to be asking about overall capability as a programmer ("Must have demonstrated experience designing software using a modern application framework"). A good programmer can adapt to any new technology. A bad programmer may have the experience on paper but is utterly incapable of change. OTOH, The idea that anyone with a liberal arts education can be trained to do anything is ridiculous. In tech fields especially, there is so much experience and knowledge required to become productive. I'd venture to say that it takes half a decade to get good at programming IF you already have some natural talent in that area. So is it reasonable for job seekers to expect that level of on the job training? Definitely not. The companies can train them on the specifics but job seekers have a responsibility to bring that experience and base of knowledge to the table. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow I act on /r/Portland  by  Broadband-in  Portland[+]perrygeo 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoUp until a few years ago, I though lol and \o/ were just emoticons for "throw your hands in the air, and wave 'em like you just don't care"permalinksavecontextfull commentsReminder: out-of-town visitors love The Peculiarium!  by  redlikerubiesin  Portland[+]perrygeo 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoOK - How exactly does one pronounce "Peculiarium" ?a) Pek-yoolee-air-ee-umb) Pek-yuh-lair-ee-umc) ???This is a source of much debate between some NW bike commuters who pass by the place. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow can students afford PSU?  by  pdxpalekidin  Portland[+]perrygeo 6 points7 points8 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]perrygeo 6 points7 points8 points 1 month agoHow can students afford PSU?
