If that wasn't your intent, I apologize for insinuating that it was.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

It's not my fault you weren't reading what I said. I said, it should be a privilege. Obviously, we are already willing to take the right to own guns away from some people, so in that sense, it's status as a unimpeachable right has already been broken.I meant that gun safety training should be mandatory in order to own a gun.No, it won't catch everyone, but how can it hurt?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

That's the issue here. You went straight on the defensive about me trying to take away your rights. Well, I'm not trying to.Also, I do think that horrible shootings and urban violence are big enough issues to show that our current laws aren't sufficient. Gun safety training and mental evaluations are the kinds of things I'm looking for.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes agoI have a problem with calling gun ownership a right. It should be a privilege. One that must be earned and can easily be lost.That being said, I'm not trying to stop peaceful, law abiding citizens from getting a gun.Also, the fact that guns aren't the only weapon ever used to commit murder, doesn't mean what I said about them creating a sense of empowerment isn't true.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes agoThat's essentially what I'm advocating. However, this "I don't think it would do much" kind of stuff, doesn't really hold much weight. We won't know what the effect is until we've tried.I would also like to see mental health testing and gun safety testing before a gun could be purchased.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]sosuhme 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago*(0 children)[]sosuhme 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago*Your right on your first point, but the problem is you seem so sure that it wouldn't solve the problem. We need to at least try more responsible gun control laws to see if they work, but it can't get pushed because as he mentioned, the political power is too strong to fight.I'm not an advocate for banning guns, just for doing more to restrict who can get their hands on one. But even that gets made to sound like a radical view point by so many, and that I find absurd and disheartening in terms of our country's view on guns.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Man this makes me sick.Yes, society is fucked up. No, you can't place the blame for a tragedy strictly on an inanimate object.Does the ease with which children and mentally unstable adults can get their hands on deadly weapons contribute? Of course it does.Does having a gun in your hand change your mentality and disposition? Well, for some people it does. Holding a gun can make a person feel powerful, and for those already inclined to commit heinous acts, it can empower them.Come on people. Let's try to work at the problem from both sides instead of just calling each other idiots for wanting to find a solution to the problem.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy Plan for the Offseason  by  My_Tallestin  detroitlions[+]sosuhme 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoI still see us as highly likely to take DeMarcus Milliner, but that could change.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNorth Dakota Wind Rage  by  dubcheesein  northdakota[+]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI work for a theatre.

I like to put low temperature windshield wiper fluid in my car so that if I need it, it works. It's cheap. Otherwise... Be very, very, very careful when driving on snow or ice. Make sure you start slowing down early or you are liable to hit a slick spot and slide out into an intersection, it happens all the time. If your car doesn't have anti-lock brakes, learn to pump your brakes when you start to skid instead of just putting the hammer down.  It wouldn't be a terrible idea to find an empty parking lot to learn how to drive on the ice, but don't make a big scene or the cops will probably come.permalinksavecontextfull commentsChoking  by  Dinantin  funny[+]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoTotally. Two and a half men has gone the exact same route since Charlie left.

I really wish they could pull that off while actually being funny. Also, the racism seems counter productive if they are going for a more equality based show.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis girl at college had a house party, i feel sorry for her.  by  Tangy-Cheesein  pics[+]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoIt's like guns and people who commit murder with them.

I mean, he needs to get more versatile, but the speed is fantastic. Also, as he grows up, if he grows into the music, he'll get a better flow.permalinksavecontextfull commentsChoking  by  Dinantin  funny[+]sosuhme -2 points-1 points0 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]sosuhme -2 points-1 points0 points 2 days ago*Yeah, I knew I'd find this comment in here eventually. I just have to ask, what do you like about it? From my perspective the jokes are ridiculously simplistic, unoriginal, and poorly timed, not to mention racist, and not in an edgy way, just in a, "Oh, look, I'm Asian. That's funny right?" kind of way.I have to understand what you like about it..Edit: I don't really care about the downvotes, but I would like an explanation. I see all these comments saying that reddit is hypocritical, or that this is just the hive mind at work. I didn't need to check this thread to know that I didn't think this show was funny at all. I gave it a college effort and thought it was miserable and corny, but there's always a chance I'm just not understanding why it appeals to some, so I asked.Edit2: I should say, this is projecting a little as I see this kind of thing come up on a frequent basis.permalinksavecontextfull commentswhy so bitter, vikings fans?  by  Beauxtatoin  nfl[+]sosuhme 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoVikings fans aren't the only ones who believed this, at the time they were pegged by most to win.
