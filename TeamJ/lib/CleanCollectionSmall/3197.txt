(AP)  The husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords says the response to the deadly shooting at a Connecticut elementary school must consist of more than regret, sorrow and condolence.Mark Kelly said in a post on his Facebook page Friday that the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who are courageous enough to have a "meaningful discussion" about the nation's gun laws.Kelly says the families of the victims and the entire Connecticut community are in his and Giffords' thoughts and prayers.Giffords was nearly killed in a January 2011 shooting that killed six people and wounded 13 at a meet-and-greet event outside a Tucson, Ariz., grocery store. She was left partially blind with a paralyzed right arm and a brain injury.
