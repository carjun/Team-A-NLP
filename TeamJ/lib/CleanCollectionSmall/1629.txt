To simply call this man evil is missing the point, all these men are products of our society. To find the answers we have to look to ourselves not to the government to "protect" us with gun laws.

What sweden did do well is not sensationalize the killing in the media. Someone posted a video of a psychologist saying the media in the U.S. needs to stop airing the photos of the killers faces, talking about their personal lives daily for weeks, putting the kill counts in the headline. The Psych. said all of this was counter-productive to stopping mass shootings and to tackle the stories in a way that isn't congruous with how hollywood has made violence. Also if anyone has ever read the book Black Sunday, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(novel) one of the points the book can make is that you'll never really be able to stop people from hurting people. permalinksaveparent[+]Izzago 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Izzago 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours agoI honestly cried upon reading about this.

I am in no way arguing against what happened. It is a tragic event and should be treated as such...now for my opinion...For my whole school life, I was told that the policy for an intruder in a school was to close the curtains, Lock the door, and hide in a corner of the classroom away from the doors and windows....WHY WAS THIS POLICY NOT FOLLOWED!!!!  all these students were told to "grab a buddy, close your eyes, and walk fast out" Wouldn't that give the killer(s) more targets doing that?and what ever happened to the security at that school? every door of that school should of been locked except the main entrance.I am not going on a "Conspiracy Theory" here. All I am saying is that this could of been as less severe, than it was if proper policies were followed.and before you yell at me that it is a "Small town with no crime, this kind of activity was not on anyone's mind"... I live in a small town of ~40,000 people. and when columbine happened, my town forced these new policies that i talked about into affect. even in my small town. where we have an extremely small crime rate.again to reiterate. I am very saddened that this happened. and this is a huge tragedy and that this will be something hard to get over... but there were things that could of happened to make this less tragic. and saved some lives. What I listed were not ways to have stopped this from happening. but it could of lessened it....EDIT: This is an opinion I formed as of the last details that I heard at 2pm EST Friday December 14th, 2012, If I am missing information that makes my opinion false, please politely let me know.... and I am sorry if this post offends anyone.

There WILL ALWAYS BE bad people with guns out there.  The question is: Do you want to barricade yourself underneath a desk and pray to a god that you don't believe in to bail you out after the shit hits the fan; or do you want to grow a pair and at least have the option of firing back?I bet if you asked every one of those teachers that were in that school what the #1 thing is that they would have wanted on them when this motherfucker was trying to kill everyone, every-single-fucking-one-of-them would say the same thing: A gun.Pull your fucking heads out of your asses, you commie fucks.  permalinksave[+]knative -5 points-4 points-3 points 12 hours ago (2 children)[]knative -5 points-4 points-3 points 12 hours agoThere was a news story, it must have been 20/20, anyway, they gave these people guns or something and then they faked a mass shooting to see how they would react, and basically everyone that didn't have training failed miserably.

This is the same problem with drugs, there is a culture to take into count. In Cuba, coke is basically used like coffee, here it causes massive problems. The Native American culture uses peyote as a religious ritual, Americans don't do so well on it and become addicts. Same can be said about a massive amount of drugs. Taking guns away would not work. It is part of our culture. There would be a revolution because of the farmers and the people who either need them due to the area they live or just have heirlooms that have been passed down and have a deep respect for them. Our country was won by farmers who owned weapons, not military. What we need is mandatory gun safety classes and more mental health care for those with severe disabilities.There are people like me in the country, I grew up around guns. I lived in the country and we had to protect ourselves from both animals that got a little too close to our animals and from poachers that would think that it was OK to trespass to get a deer, stray bullets be damned. There was the fact that the closest police were 40 minutes away so, when someone would break in, as they tried to once, you had to protect yourself and your family. Usually, them just knowing you are armed keeps them from coming in. If we weren't, we would have been robbed, at the very least.At fiveish years old, I learned basic gun safety (basically, don't touch!) At eight, I learned more advanced gun safety. I never touched a gun without my Dad's OK because I was taught to respect and fear them. He also locked his up. You don't sit a loaded gun out. If you keep a handgun out for self defense, take the clip out and put it in another location close but not right next to the gun. Someplace you can reach quickly. You don't keep a loaded gun around and these people need to start locking theirs up in a gun safe.(Side note, for the holidays: You also don't buy look alike air pistols for your kids. You make sure you can tell it is an air pistol from 10 feet away, in the dark. My Dad was a cop, kid thought it was funny to pull a look alike on my dad and his partner at night. My dad raised his gun and told the kid to drop it, he did (thank god) and my dad heard the plastic hit the ground. Those things look fucking realistic.)You don't ban knives because people use them to attack people. You don't destroy heirlooms swords because sharp objects are used to kill people.

More male geniuses AND idiots.Another data point is that the majority of child abuse incidents involve a female perpetrator.  Of course, females also disproportionately spend time as caregivers, but we know from all sorts of other data that people victimize those they have power over.  They do it when they think they will get away with it.Normal people will even take action they think kills another human being, just because someone tells them to.  See the Milgram Experiment, which has been replicated over and over again.  Not just a few, but a supermajority.There was also massive popular support for the Iraq war and killing of civilians.

I'm not someone who thinks guns should outlawed but they should treated like we treat vehicles.  You have to get them inspected in most states every year or you get fined quite heavily.  You should have to produce the weapons at least once a year and prove you are a responsible owner, are not endangering others and haven't transferred the weapon to a non registered owner.  Maybe you should also be required to carry insurance.  We could also easily eliminate loopholes and prosecute dealers at gun shows.  permalinksaveparent[+]LDH_3 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]LDH_3 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours agoI didnt realize that part of info, my mistake.

The cities and states with the strictest firearms laws such as California, New York, New Jersey, and Washington D.C. have the highest amount of crime both gun related and non-gun related.Nobody on the anti-gun side can provide conclusive evidence that stricter gun laws cause a decrease in crime.

The same people who are spouting "guns don't kill people, people kill people" are the same people saying that video games are to blame. While the people defending video games and that they didnt make the shooter kill people, turn right around and say that guns are to blame.Both are issues that dont take care of what i believe is to be the core of the problem, which is mental health care.. As for the if guns were banned less people would die argument, sure a knife would probably result in less fatalities, but a bomb could result in more. If both guns or video games were banned, things like this will still unfortunately happen until we can take care of the main issue. I know its something important to talk about, but i am of the belief that it is more important to give the families time to grieve, before we make this all political.

If you ignore the fact that there's virtually no chance of this happening...But the idea is that if our Government turns on us, and they have all the guns, then we're screwed. We can't defend ourselves. If the only people to have guns are Cops, Military, and well, criminals, then we the other people, we can't fight back. In reality, even with guns we couldn't fight back, our military outclasses us normal people (we normal people?) quite a lot. So if they turned on us, we wouldn't be able to do much. But the idea is that you should be able to hold your own as a private militia. And since the whole point is that the authority is who you're fighting...And yeah, we just don't want to be outmatched.

If these people can get help before they spiral out of control, maybe we wouldn't have these senseless mass murders.We also need to be able to force someone to do a mental evaluation or talk to someone. The really crazy people, don't know they are crazy. They will never get help because they believe nothing is wrong with them. But most have families and friends who know the truth.I have personal experience with this. It's impossible to commit someone, get a mental evaluation or do anything to help them if they don't want help or believe they need help.My dad was mentally ill, there is an increased risk for children to develop the same illness.I already told the rest of my family, if I go crazy like my Dad, put a bullet in my head, don't think twice about it.What he dealt with was horrible, what we dealt with was just as bad. We tried to get him help, we called the state, the hospital, spoke to psychiatrists and psychologists. "They couldn't do anything". That's what we were told. Nothing could be done if he didn't want help or admitting to hearing voices, seeing lasers, etc.He got worse over time. At one point, he started boiling water in the microwave. Claiming it was killing someone. He would take a laser pointer and run it up and down his head, did the same thing with a  flashlight. Then he go outside and shine it at something. He took coax cable and put it in ice, saying they were recording him.I'm glad that he didn't hurt anyone, but he could have. He was fixated on our old neighbors, who he had believed they were the ones doing this too him, talking to him. At times they were friends, sometimes they were enemies. He fired a gun in the house at the floor, we got rid of the gun.People want to focus on gun laws, we should focus on mental health laws.How many times do we see some crazy person rambling on the internet? We see it all the time, but we dismiss it. We ignore it. We want to believe they are just trolling or playing around.We can be blind to our own family.There is a difference between non-violent crazy and violent crazy. They both need help and attention.I wouldn't be surprised if this guy told someone like his mom his thoughts. I doubt he would tell her his plan, but I bet there were plenty of signs that were ignored.I would see a psychiatrist if it was free or affordable for me. My whole family could use therapy, I want it but it's not affordable.TL;DR Guns are only 1/2 the problem. We continue to ignore mental health laws. We need better healthcare, we need cheap and free ways for people to get help and speak to a mental health professional. We need an easier way to get people who don't want help, some help.permalinksave[+]davesidious 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]davesidious 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoHealthcare in the US will not make sense for generations to come.

Knee jerk "ban guns" isn't the whole problem here, it all goes much deeper and mental health issues are another key factor in all these incidents as far as I can tell.   Each and every time the individual/s who carry out these atrocities are not well.  Not excusing them (not AT ALL) but it is a truth: they are all deeply disturbed individuals.  The fact they have access to weapons just adds to the deadly mix.   No doubt in my mind there needs to be restrictions/bans on semi automatic weapons but also there needs to be something done in the area of mental health support services.  permalinksaveparent[+]OllieWillie 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours ago (8 children)[]OllieWillie 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours agoI'm so fucking sick of people saying "guns dont kill people, people kill people"...

Anyone in this country can still buy drugs if they want. When the 18th amendment was in effect, people still purchased and consumed alcohol. In countries with bans on certain types of weapons, those weapons are still obtained. The difference is that instead of being obtained from legal, tracked sources, they're obtained from criminals. permalinksaveparent[+]BosskPlissken 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (1 child)[]BosskPlissken 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agoThe majority of people would have no idea how to find a gun on the black market or they wouldn't have the connections to do it.

Not every person who has a gun today would be able or interested in seeking one out on the black market.  It's not like the black market will have an online store.  It's not going to be impossible to get a gun by any stretch, but it'll be a little harder.Not to mention the high end guns.

The one thing I disagree with is the comment about shooting deer. Half of the reason for the 2nd amendment was to protect the people from the government. Since the government has access to burst-fire and fully automatic weapons, the people need access to at least what we have now. That does not include automatic weapons and assault rifles, which aren't legally available. permalinksaveparent[+]OllieWillie 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (1 child)[]OllieWillie 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoMy deer remark was a little weak ill concede.

To be honest, it was something I only learned in the last few months as I delved into the reasoning for it as a personal search. Until then, I had no idea it was based on English law that was established after King James II had been trying to disarm people that disagreed with him. I (naively) thought it was a blanket "everyone should be allowed to own a firearm." That's what the English law argued, though our amendment was tailored to specify a regulated militia. Granted, we haven't followed that, since we have a standing army (not allowed by the Constitution) instead of a militia, which just complicates the issue. permalinksaveparent[+]perogies -5 points-4 points-3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]perogies -5 points-4 points-3 points 18 hours ago100% agree.

I don't own a gun nor do I ever want to, but we can't just blame guns. If we ban guns and then people find a much more destructive tool what then? People will adapt and there's going to be other things to worry about. Sure death by guns will go down, but death by another tool will replace it. If all of a sudden a few people decided to go on a killing spree driving into pedestrians, would be ban cars too? We're going around in circles. permalinksaveparent[+]awa224 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (2 children)[]awa224 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoCars aren't made for the specific purpose of killing. Either are knives, crowbars, baseball bats or a multitude of other items used for murder. Guns are.This pretty much sums up my opinion on the matter.permalinksaveparent[+]crisscutfries 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (1 child)[]crisscutfries 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoGuns could easily be used for disarming, staggering... but I think I miscommunicated my emphasis. What I'm saying is that... Intent is what drives these massacres and there are plenty of other tools that can be used to do damage. It is intent that makes guns used for killing as well as any other weapon. I'm not saying everyone should buy a gun, I'm just saying intent has more to do with the matter than guns do. Banning guns isn't going to stop massacres it'll just be another bump in the road for dangerous people to go around.I'm not supporting buying a gun... I've said it before, I don't have it, I don't want it. I'm just saying is that I can't imagine the world becoming a land of rainbows and unicorn just because we take away the rights of carrying a gun. People are crafty, people will find other means.permalinksaveparent[+]awa224 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]awa224 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoBanning guns will never happen, so there's no point in arguing for or against that. However, stricter rules on who can own them, especially high powered handguns and assault rifles (which there is absolutely no reason to have apart from harming or killing another person, self-defense or otherwise), will help to make this more difficult for these dangerous people.You tell me another way to kill 20 people in a matter of minutes. A bomb? Sure, but how many people keep bombs in a bomb cabinet at home? Getting rid of guns isn't going to turn the world into a utopia, but does that mean that we should let things continue the way they are? Even a small step forward is better than staying put at this point.permalinksaveparent[+]blaaaaahhhhh 5 points6 points7 points 19 hours ago (3 children)[]blaaaaahhhhh 5 points6 points7 points 19 hours agoThe Chinese incident shows that banning guns wouldn't stop these types of senseless crimes, but it also shows it would cut down the fatalities.
