His mother, who was once a teacher at the same school where he committed this massacre, left her teaching job to stay at home and care for Adam. One detail that was released Saturday morning was that Adam forced his way into the building, he was not let in. He was not allowed on the premises, but police didnt divulge why he was barred from the school, according to Fox News live on Saturday morning.Adam was estranged from his 24-year-old brother, Ryan Lanza. He had not talked to his brother Adam since 2010. Ryan who is a rising star at an accounting firm in New Jersey, was handcuffed and taken out of work yesterday because his ID was found at the crime scene on his brother. This led to the preliminary reports that the shooters name was Ryan Lanza. Ryan is not a suspect, but he was able to provide authorities with information on his brother and his mother, who is also dead. The Conn. school shooting: More details emerge as information about shooter, Adam Lanza, is revealed.      Photo credit:        Getty      Adam started his day Friday by shooting his mother in the face. Dressed in cutting-edge military garb he then took his mothers car and three guns, which were legally registered to his mother, and went to the Sandy Hook Elementary School and after he killed six adults and 20 children, he killed himself. This leaves 28 people dead, including the shooter and his mother.Ryan Lanza told authorities that his brother had autism and people who know the family painted a grim picture of Adam. He was a boy who could not feel pain. During softball Adam had to be careful not to fall and hurt himself because if the broke a bone or received any other kind of injury, he could not feel it.  Some people who knew Adam said the shooting in Newtown shocked them, but they were  not surprised to hear it that he was Adam who did this shooting, according to Radaronline.Adam was subject to outbursts and had major issues," a family insider told the New York Daily News. They also reported on his intelligence, as a family friend said: "He was smart. He was like one of these real brainiac computer-kinds of kids. The insider went on to say, Adam had a lot of mental problems.These reports bring up many questions regarding Nancy Lanza, who is dead by the hands of her son as he shot her first before going on this shooting spree. Why would she have three powerful guns in the house when she knew her son was so deeply disturbed? He was enough of a problem that she left her job to stay home and care for him and she also had to know he was barred from the school. Why we should bring all these guns in the home? They were legally registered to her.Tweet0EmailPrintReport Roz Zurko,      Hartford Top News ExaminerRoz Zurko is a published freelance writer originally from Milford, Conn. and writes from her home in Westfield, Ma. today.
