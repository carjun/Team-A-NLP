They were yelling at him, saying he just played his last game at Yankee Stadium."A lot of people are saying a lot of things I haven't heard before,'' Swisher said. "That was the last thing I thought would happen in this ballpark. The fans get on you so much. It's tough. It hurts."I lose the ball in the lights (Saturday night), and the next thing I know, I'm  responsible for Derek's injury.''The Yankees have scored in  one of 21 innings this series, and  the inning in which they scored came with a painful price. The Yankees scored four runs in the ninth  Saturday against Tigers closer Jose Valverde to tie the score, but three innings later, Jeter broke his left ankle while fielding a ground ball, and he's  out for the season."We've had to move on from a lot of different things this year,'' said Yankees  manager Joe Girardi, who had a team meeting with his players Sunday and will make a trip to Illinois today for his father's funeral before joining the club in Detroit."We've lost the greatest closer of all time, (Mariano) Rivera, where people left us for dead. People left us for dead in August and September. We won more games in the American League than anyone."(Jeter) is not a player you want to lose.  We have to find a way. We have done it all year long, and we're going to have to do again.''Yet, time is running short, and the Yankees are showing no signs of offensive life. They are hitting .192 in this series and .205 this postseason. They have scored more runs (11) in the ninth inning or later this postseason than the first eight innings (nine) of their seven games.Team-wide slump"We're down, but we're not out,'' said Yankees center fielder Curtis Granderson, who struck out in all three of his at-bats Sunday and  has  one RBI this postseason. "It's baseball. Things can turn in a heartbeat.''Yet the way the Yankees are hitting, every at-bat is Groundhog Day. If they're not striking out, they're grounding out. They struck out 10 times Sunday and had  three fly-ball outs.Second baseman Robinson Cano, perhaps the MVP of the team, is enduring the worst slump in Yankees postseason history, hitless in his last 26 at-bats.Alex Rodriguez, the highest-paid player in baseball history, who has been pinch-hit for or benched in four of his last five games, is 0-for-18 with 12 strikeouts against right-handed pitchers this postseason.Granderson and Swisher are a combined 7-for-52 with two RBI.The loudest cheers at Yankee Stadium on Sunday came  in the bottom of the ninth when the  scoreboard showed the New York Jets had won and the New York Giants had a fourth-quarter lead against the San Francisco 49ers. The applause would have been louder, but most of the crowd had departed.The Yankees, who sold 3.54 million tickets this year, announced that the crowd of 47,082 did not constitute a sellout. What's more, thousands of seats were empty."We noticed, it is very surprising,'' Granderson says. "Obviously, we got to give them something to cheer about.''There was a time when Yankee Stadium was the most feared ballpark in the land. These days, the Tigers find it almost a calming place to play."This is a very easy place to play right now,'' Tigers left fielder Quentin Berry said. "Coming from Oakland (for the AL Division Series), and how rowdy they were, and how loud, that was the loudest place I've ever been in my entire life."Coming from there, man, it made this trip so much easier to deal with from the fans, and the electricity, because it's nothing like Oakland was.''The Yankees hardly resemble the team that finished the regular season with the American League's best record, and without Jeter in the lineup, it marked the first time since Oct. 28, 1981, that they played a postseason game without Jeter or  Rivera on the roster.Captain's injury hurtsTorre, the umpire supervisor for Major League Baseball, was in the umpires' room when Jeter went sprawling in the 12th inning Saturday night. He kept waiting for him to get up. And waiting. And praying.Jeter, the club's starting shortstop through a run of five World Series titles that began in 1996, was carried off the field by trainer Steve Donohue and Girardi. Torre rushed into the Yankees training room and stayed with Jeter until the news was delivered that his ankle was broken."When I saw him be taken off the field, it told you it was something more than a bruise or something," Torre said. "He's the last guy that wants anybody to make a fuss over him."It was pretty sad for me. It wasn't devastating, just sad. He wasn't talking last night. Guys were coming in after the game was over, but there really was nothing to say. He just sat there."The fact that he was hurt is one thing, but the fact that he can't be there for them, you know. It sounds hokey, but it's true.''Jeter was hobbling the last month, playing with a bone bruise on his foot, and a swollen ankle. He couldn't even start at shortstop in Game 3 of the AL Division Series against the Baltimore Orioles, and was used as a DH. Girardi said  that Jeter underwent a cortisone shot at some point.Now, perhaps pushing himself beyond limitations, his ankle gave out in the 12th inning, and he lay  on the infield dirt, yelling in pain, while the Yankees Stadium  crowd gasped.For the first time in his career, Jeter is unable to play in the postseason. If the Yankees fail to win the World Series, Jeter will call the season a failure, the way  he does every year they don't end it with a parade."That's why I feel so bad for him,'' says MLB-TV broadcaster Harold Reynolds, a  close friend of Jeter's. "To Derek Jeter, this is everything. This is who he is.''Now, at a time the Yankees need him most -- looking for a hero, even a savior --  he is gone. Jeter won't even be in Detroit, instead scheduled to visit a foot specialist in North Carolina."It's a big loss, but way to honor Derek  is to get the job done in his absence," Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. "So that's what we're going to focus on. We have no choice.''Copyright 2012 USATODAY.comTweetEmailPrintShareLinkedInTumblrStumbleUponRedditDel.icio.usDiggAAView Comments|Share your thoughts More In ADVERTISEMENTLeBron James: Games 'nothing compared' to Conn. tragedyUnlikely walk-on lifts Butler over No. 1 Indiana'Catholic 7' announce departure from Big EastAiling RGIII to sit, Cousins to start for RedskinsPeterson: Comeback POY award is 'in the bag'Rubio's flashy return sparks T'wolves past MavsKyrie Irving's Zorro mask can't stop red-hot KnicksDavid Price autographed Twinkie sells on eBayBell: Playing with pain is part of NFL playoff pushMore National HeadlinesMost PopularMost CommentedMore Headlines1Woman in widely-used Connecticut shooting photo is victim's sister2Kilpatrick trial sees another injured lawyer, more texts, new allegation3Top Republican official Ron Weiser's comments about Detroit on videotape are causing a stir4Detroit Tigers LHP Adam Wilk's curve straightened out5U-M suspends three players from Outback Bowl193Rochelle Riley: Perhaps gun control now possible in honor of 20 dead children 83Top Republican official Ron Weiser's comments about Detroit on videotape are causing a stir59Mitch Albom: School shooting a watershed moment49Tom Walsh: Snyder needs good economic news to regain credibility, agenda43State's new guns-in-school law provokes outcries and praise in wake of Connecticut rampageIn Newtown, Sunday services honor victims of tragedy No danger at Conn. church after phoned threat Obama to speak at prayer vigil in Connecticut Report: Teacher tried to divert shooter Woman in iconic photo is sister of slain teacher Drumbeat for change grows as Connecticut town grieves Most ViewedPhoto GalleriesThe scene in Newtown, Day 2Newtown school shooting victimsADVERTISEMENTEmail this articleBronx jeers for listless YankeesThe fans have booed virtually every hitter but Ichiro Suzuki and Mark Teixeira.
