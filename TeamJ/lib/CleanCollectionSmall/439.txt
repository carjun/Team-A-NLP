Police shed no light on the motive for the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, declined to elaborate on the whether the shooter left a note or other messages explaining why he forced his way into a Newtown, Conn., school. But police are continuing to comb through the crime scene."It is going to be a long and painstaking process," Vance said at a packed press conference shortly after 10 a.m. this morning.For the full story from our sister site, NJ.com click here.Lanza is believed to have suffered from a personality disorder and lived with his mother, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation.Asked at a news conference whether Lanza had left any emails or other writings that might explain the rampage, state police Vance said investigators had found "very good evidence" and hoped it would answer questions about the gunman's motives. Vance would not elaborate.Among those killed was the school's well-liked principal, Dawn Hochsprung. Town officials said she died while lunging at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him. A woman who worked at the school was wounded.At least one parent said Lanza's mother was a substitute teacher at the school. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.Lanza's older brother, 24-year-old Ryan Lanza, of Hoboken, N.J., was questioned, and investigators searched his computers and phone records, but he told law enforcement he had not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.For about two hours late Friday and early Saturday, clergy members and emergency vehicles moved steadily to and from the school. The state medical examiner's office said bodies of the victims would be taken there for autopsies.The gunman forced his way into the kindergarten-through-fourth-grade school, authorities said. He took three guns into the school  a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both semiautomatic pistols, and a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle, according to an official who was not authorized to discuss information with reporters and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The weapons were registered to his slain mother.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Sponsored LinksRelated StoriesTell me, Alabama: Gun control or "right to bear arms?"
