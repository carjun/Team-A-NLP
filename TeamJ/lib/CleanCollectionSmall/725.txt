And raise you with...Scumvag  by  Deracinatedin  AdviceAnimals[+]ubersiren 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ubersiren 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoFor me, specifically, I have a big problem with things in my vagina that aren't my husband's penis. Fingers, tampons, speculum at the gynecologists' office all make me really queasy. When I first started having sex, even penises bothered me. I'd get nauseous after sex. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with a boy forcing himself on me in middle school or not, but it's a possibility. The last time I went to the gyno, I passed out twice and had to be revived with smelling salts! permalinksavecontextfull commentsBeginning to freak out a little. Slight baby name rant, maybe.  by  ubersirenin  BabyBumps[+]ubersiren[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ubersiren[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI realize my reply came off as bitchy, but I really didn't ask for help on naming my child or for the internet's thoughts on my pick. I don't know how to say it nicely... I don't sugar coat things well. I've been saying it out loud for months. My friends like it, family likes it, husband does not. That's the only issue. Not the name itself. I'm sure you're a nice lady and your intentions are good. There already exists a list of names that my husband and I agree on; I don't need additional help. I'm just upset that the one name I'm truly in love with, he won't even consider. And furthermore, he doesn't have one that he's equally in love with to back up his rejection of mine.We can't use Sailor for a number of reasons, but I honestly thank you for your concern and for your supportive nature.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrendy baby names >=|  by  BishopMyrielin  BabyBumps[+]ubersiren 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ubersiren 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoYou're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
