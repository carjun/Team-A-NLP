Feinstein to introduce gun-control bill next yearBy Morgan LittleWASHINGTON  Two days after the shooting deaths of 26 people at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school, Sen. Dianne Feinstein pledged Sunday that she would introduce new gun-control legislation at the beginning of next years congressional session.It [the bill] will ban the sale, the transfer, the transportation and the possession, the California senator said on NBCs Meet the Press. Not retroactively, but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips of more than 10 bullets.Feinstein said the purpose of her proposal, a version of the assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004, is to get weapons of war off the streets of our cities.

Cloud                                          WASHINGTON  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who canceled an overseas trip this week due to a stomach virus, suffered a concussion after she fainted, the State Department said Saturday. Clinton, who has said she plans to step down shortly, fainted after she became dehydrated due to the virus, the department said in a statement. She is recovering at home and being monitored by doctors. She will continue to work from home next week, staying in regular contact with department and other officials. She is looking forward to being back in the office soon, the statement said. No other information was provided and a spokesman for the department declined to comment. Clinton was due to testify in congressional hearings Thursday on the Sept. 11, 2012, attack against a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. Her condition may cause the hearing to be postponed. Clinton was scheduled to go to North Africa and...More...Three lessons from the near-final popular voteBy David LauterMore than five weeks after election day, almost all the presidential votes have been counted. Heres what the near-final tally reveals:The election really wasnt close.On election night, President Obamas victory margin seemed fairly narrow  just slightly more than 2 percentage points. White House aides anxiously waited to see if Obama would surpass the 2.46-percentage-point margin by which President George W. Bush defeated Sen. John F. Kerry in 2004.They neednt have worried. In the weeks since the election, as states have completed their counts, Obamas margin has grown steadily. From just over 2 percentage points, it now stands at nearly 4. Rather than worry about the Bush-Kerry precedent, White House aides now brag that Obama seems all but certain to achieve a mark hit by only five others in U.S. history  winning the presidency twice with 51% or more of the popular vote.As of Friday, Obama had 50.97% of the vote to Mitt Romneys 47....More...Obama dedicates weekly radio address to Connecticut shootingsBy Kathleen HennesseyWASHINGTON -- President Obama used his weekly radio address to offer solace and prayers after the shooting that killed 20 children at a Connecticut elementary school.Every parent in America has a heart heavy with hurt, the president said in a taped address to be released Saturday. In all, 28 people died, including the shooter, who took his own life, in the slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.Obama called on Americans to extend a hand to the families of the victims, and come together to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this. Regardless of the politics.Obamas emotional remarks echoed those he delivered Friday at the White House, when he fought back tears and paused to collect himself as he talked about the shootings. House Speaker John A. Boehner canceled the Republican rebuttal to the presidents weekly address, out of respect for the victims.The Ohio Republican said Obama could speak for the...More...Fix the Debt hits the airwaves to influence 'fiscal cliff'By Melanie MasonWASHINGTON -- Fix the Debt, a coalition of business executives and policymakers advocating for sweeping deficit reduction, will release its first television ad Sunday, marking a new phase in the groups efforts to influence the fiscal debate. Formed five months ago as an offshoot of the Center for Responsible Budget Priorities, the nonprofit group has assembled a roster of influential politiciansincluding Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg--and major business leaders. Members of the group regularly take to op-ed pages and cable news to urgea deficit reduction deal that brings in new revenue, cuts spending and includes major reform to social programs like Social Security and Medicare. They also have visited the White House and Capitol Hill. The group has chapters operating in 17 states, and is backed by a reported $43 million war chest, seeded mainly by corporate donations. But while Fix the Debt had been running print and...More...EPA tightens standards for soot pollutionBy Neela Banerjee                                          Citing the need to strengthen safeguards to public health, the Obama administration announced the strictest standards in 15 years for soot, the fine particles emitted by power plants and diesel vehicles that contribute to haze and respiratory ailments. The Environmental Protection Agency tightened the limit, called the national ambient air quality standards for fine particles, to 12 micrograms per cubic meter for the annual average level of fine particulate matterfrom the standard of 15 micrograms per cubic meter last set in 1997. These standards are fulfilling the promise of the Clean Air Act, said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. We will save lives and reduce the burden of illness in our communities, and families across the country will benefit from the simple fact of being able to breathe cleaner air. Right now, 99% of U.S. counties are already in compliance with the new standard, the EPA said. Of the remaining counties that will be out of compliance,...More...Susan Rice withdraws from secretary of State considerationBy Morgan LittleWASHINGTON  Susan Rice, who came under heavy criticism for her defense of the Obama administration after armed militants killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of State on Thursday as the president began to narrow his choices for key Cabinet positions. If nominated, I am now convinced that the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly  to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities, Rice wrote in a one-page letter to President Obama. That tradeoff is simply not worth it to our country. In a statement, Obama praised Rice, who is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as a key member of his Cabinet and an advisor and friend. PHOTOS: Notable moments of the 2012 presidential election While I deeply regret the unfair and misleading attacks on Susan Rice in recent weeks, her decision demonstrates the strength of her character, and...More...Americans want compromise in 'fiscal cliff' talksBy Melanie MasonDemocrats have an edge in public support in the fiscal cliff negotiations, a trio of polls out this week reveal, with the majority of Americans endorsing a compromise deal that includes spending cuts and tax increases. The desire for compromise extends to some of the thornier issues in the fiscal cliff debate: an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday found that 65% supported a deal that included increased tax rates (a longtime nonstarter for Republicans) and cuts to Social Security and Medicare (often resisted by Democrats). For the first time, a majority of Republicansnearly 60%want their partys leaders to compromise in order to reach a deal. Thats a notable shift from 2011, when majorities of Republicans wanted their party to stick to their positions instead of strike a deal. Democrats also are amenable to bargaining over the fiscal cliff, with 70%an all-time highsupporting a compromise. PHOTOS: Notable moments of the 2012...More...Defiant Boehner presses for 'fiscal cliff' cutsBy Lisa Mascaro and Michael A. MemoliWASHINGTON  House Speaker John A. Boehner broke out the charts Thursday to make his case that spending cuts must be part of any year-end budget deal with President Obama. Its this issue  spending! said Boehner, pointing to the chart beside him in the Capitol. Spending is the problem, he said. Thats why we dont have an agreement. Negotiations over the looming fiscal cliff  the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that take effect next year  appear to have come to a standstill. Democrats are in no rush to suggest additional reductions to domestic programs, pushing the responsibility back to Boehner to outline the kinds of cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that Republicans want. The Ohio Republican is under immense pressure from conservatives in the House GOP majority not to yield to Obamas call to raise taxes on wealthy households without serious reductions in...More...Notable moments of the 2012 presidential electionMore photos: Paul Ryan's past | President Obama's past | Mitt Romney's past | The best 2012 election photosMore...Boehner: Obama's 'fiscal cliff' deal 'mainly tax hikes'By Morgan LittleWASHINGTON -- Republican leaders kicked off Wednesday with a fierce critique of President Obama's handling of fiscal cliff negotiations, part of the political posturing on both sides that has characterized efforts to avoid across-the-board tax hikes and spending cuts before a January deadline. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who has been engaged in face-to-face meetings and phone calls with Obama since last weekend, dismissed the president's latest proposals as unbalanced. As of today, the president's plan to avert the fiscal cliff still does not meet the two standards that I laid out the day after the election, Boehner told a news conference. His plan does not fulfill his promise to bring a balanced approach to solving this problem. It's mainly tax hikes. Boehner described his latest phone call Tuesday with the president as frank, and said they had exchanged proposals. But he provided no details and its unclear if...More...1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12Older Entries AdvertisementConnectRecommended on FacebookFollow @latimesYour Host Over the past 30 years, James Rainey has covered schools, foster care, the environment, courts, the media and the last three presidential campaigns. @LATimesraineyContributorsRobin AbcarianMark Z.
