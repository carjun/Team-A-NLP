Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Redditor8472 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Redditor8472 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour agoIt's not what happened in 1990. It's what happened in 1973.There is apparently a correlation between abortion and crime rate. Legalizing abortion means that fewer children of lesser means and/or less capable parents, which means that there are fewer children at higher risk of becoming criminals, which means a lower crime rate in general. With Roe v. Wade being decided in 1973, you only start to see the impact in the early 1990s, when those aborted embryos would have become late teens/early twenties.It's one of the stories in Freakonomics (the first one). If you have Netflix, there's a documentary version of Freakonomics on there which covers the abortion/crime rate correlation.The tl;dr of it is that a few states legalized abortion a few years prior to Roe v. Wade, and the drop in crime correlates with those earlier legalizations, whereas everywhere else correlates with the SCOTUS decision.Wikipedia has a long article on it as well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadian TV explained by u/atomicbolt  by  Ricekrisperin  canada[+]Redditor8472 5 points6 points7 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]Redditor8472 5 points6 points7 points 12 hours agoMade in Canada is awesome.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadian TV explained by u/atomicbolt  by  Ricekrisperin  canada[+]Redditor8472 1 point2 points3 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]Redditor8472 1 point2 points3 points 12 hours agoIt's also available on the CBC's website, along with pretty much all of their shows.It doesn't make Mr. D any less terrible though.
