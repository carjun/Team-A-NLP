I'm tired of this being like, a Christmas tragedy. It is a tragedy. That is all.permalinksaveparent[+]illgresi 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (1 child)[]illgresi 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoIt's only a "Christmas" tragedy because for a lot of families, Christmas is highly focused on the children. They go to great lengths to make Christmas one of the happiest days for their children, they take them to see Santa Claus, they buy them two sets of gifts-- from themselves and from Santa, they have their kids help decorate the tree, maybe they have them help decorate the yard. Schools have kids make ornaments, like those ornaments of their hand-prints in clay...Yes, it is a tragedy, it is awful and it would be as awful any day of the year. It just hurts a little more when you realize their parents had all these things ready for their kids, probably their kid's favorite holiday, and they can no longer see the happiness in their kid's face, nobody will wake them up Christmas morning, just a few days away, to open presents...Unless you mean to say that not all those kids celebrate Christmas probably, that probably some were Jewish, or another denomination, and that's true too. But it's not just Christmas, the winter break is just a very important time for families to spend time with their kids. This season is just very child-centric; mall Santa, kid's movies, commercials of kids opening presents, etc...permalinksaveparent[+]janetheignorantslut -2 points-1 points0 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]janetheignorantslut -2 points-1 points0 points 11 hours agoI mean I get it, I just think it's really sad that people are essentially like, "Oh no, not Christmas! That's the one time of year when I normally make sure to act like I love my family by showering them with material goods!" It also feels like you're validating children's feelings that winter break is the part of their childhood most worth living, which is ridiculous.permalinksaveparent[+]iGotChubs4You  comment score below threshold (1 child)[]iGotChubs4You -6 points-5 points-4 points 21 hours agoomg DAE h8 bad stuff?permalinksaveparent[+]p0st_master -5 points-4 points-3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]p0st_master -5 points-4 points-3 points 20 hours agothis made me laughpermalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
