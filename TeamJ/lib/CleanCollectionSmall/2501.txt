For mas shootings at lease, people rob liquor stores all the time. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]dieselgeek 2 points3 points4 points 37 minutes ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek 2 points3 points4 points 37 minutes agoHow is it so ridiculous?  This event today is tragic and makes me want to vomit, but it's really pretty rare. Tons of countries have violence and strict gun laws on the book.  Really if they were proven to stop violence, and stop people from hurting others, than I'd be all for it. Simple fact is they don't really impact crime.    I mean look in prisons, NO weapons are allowed , yet they are made with the simplest of supplies they find, and the knowledge that is shared. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I mean really just strip us of our rights, we don't deserve them. _So many factors in this nation put us where we're at.  The 2nd is not one of them. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]dieselgeek 1 point2 points3 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek 1 point2 points3 points 59 minutes agoYou can get killed so fast with a knife.  Knives are pretty scary, it does not take much to understand how to use one.  I've seen plenty of people that can't hit a target 10 yards in front of them with a firearm. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Also we have a thing called the 2nd amendment. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoBack that up please.  You can not buy a firearm from an FFL without a NICS check.    That's the law, sorry, but no way around that. Also, Felons are not allowed to buy guns, so if they get them, then it's illegal, so making private sale illegal is not going to stop them from buying anything, as they were breaking the law before hand anyway. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]dieselgeek 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoHow is that going to stop anyone from doing anything? 5 day waits (which we don't have in my state)  are so silly.   Take the LA Riots for example.  Store owners wanted to protect themselves, but they had a 10 day wait, so NOOO  go for them.  10 days to wait so you can protect yourself.   Sounds like a great idea huh?    If these laws were in anyway proven to work, that would be fine, but no thought is put behind them. They are made on fear, and with out thought, or real data to support them. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

These are huge ranges, with lots of different places to shoot.  That place where the  lone star match was at is also huge.  It's a private owned play ground. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo remember the other day when I attempted to camo my rifle?
