Kubiak returned to Houston to start his head coaching career after spending 20 years in the Denver area, first as a player and then later as an assistant coach.  Prior to arriving in Houston, Kubiak served as Denver's offensive coordinator for 11 seasons, helping guide the Broncos to back-to-back World Championships in Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII and three AFC West Division titles.  Kubiak tutored Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway from 1995-98 and oversaw the most dominant rushing attack in the NFL. In 1998, running back Terrell Davis was named NFL Most Valuable Player after becoming the fourth player in league history to rush for over 2,000 yards.  In Kubiak's 11 years in Denver, the Broncos had 28 Pro Bowl players on the offensive side of the ball.  Kubiak began his coaching career in 1992 at his alma mater, Texas A&M, as running backs coach. There he guided Greg Hill to second-team All-America honors in 1993.  Kubiak started his NFL coaching career with the San Francisco 49ers as the quarterbacks coach. In his lone season in San Francisco, he guided Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young to league MVP honors. Under Kubiak's tutelage, Young posted an NFL-record 112.8 quarterback rating and was named MVP of Super Bowl XXIX after tossing a Super Bowl-record six touchdown passes.  Background: Kubiak starred at quarterback for Texas A&M from 1979-1982, earning all-Southwest Conference honors as a senior. He played for the Broncos from 1983-1991 as the backup to Elway. Kubiak played in 119 games during his career and tossed 14 touchdowns in that span. During his time as a player in the Mile High City, he was a part of three teams that reached the Super Bowl.  Personal: Born August 15, 1961 in Houston. He and his wife, Rhonda, have three sonsKlint, Klay and Klein.
