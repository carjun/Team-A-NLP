The bars in a college town essentially charge $5 for a chance to pick up a sloppy girl at the end of the night.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI think I like my antagonist more than my protagonist  by  briangilesin  writing[+]Jinairik 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoI find myself drawn to a character when I care about the character's desires and motives. This can be done in many different ways (relevant backstory, driven by strong emotion, etc), so you have a lot of room to be creative here. A good writer can make the reader cheer on any protagonist!permalinksavecontextfull commentsVolibear Cosplay  by  iamadogwhatisthisin  LoLFanArt[+]Jinairik 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoSO CUTE.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWife vs. Brother.

The whole "new tradition, no wife" thing seems like he just doesn't want her there. With you being the only married one, he can set these "general" rules out to exclude her specifically. I would try to talk it out with him since even you are still unsure as to why he doesn't like her.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the biggest movie plot hole you have ever seen?  by  kickster777in  AskReddit[+]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoToy Story 3.HOW DOES SLINKY GET DOWN FROM THAT BIG MAGNET THING!?!?permalinksavecontextfull commentsCierra's Bad Ideas  by  Brlghtsldein  cringe[+]Jinairik 17 points18 points19 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 17 points18 points19 points 4 days agoTHIS GIF LIVES AND DIES HERE.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI worked my ass off to overcome poverty, now I am rich and bored  by  richdoodooheadin  Advice[+]Jinairik 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago...Cheesecake Factory?...

I apologize if you're being serious (in which case, my advice still stands), but this subreddit isn't meant for this kind of stuff.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI worked my ass off to overcome poverty, now I am rich and bored  by  richdoodooheadin  Advice[+]Jinairik 10 points11 points12 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 10 points11 points12 points 4 days agoI hate to sound like a jerk, but you seem to be a reckless, ungrateful moron. You're blowing through your inheritance. Someone, I'm assuming your grandmother or another family member, worked for that money. Well, I suppose they could have won or something... That is aside from the point. You did not earn that money and you're throwing it around like it is nothing. My advice is put 90% of that remaining 30% into a better education (find something you love, not this culinary crap) and after that into the bank. That other 10% can be used to gradually get used to not living this crazy lifestyle (instead of dropping it cold turkey).permalinksavecontextfull commentsTougher jungle, more wards, oracles nerf - Junglers, how are you dealing with the changes?  by  zergmodein  leagueoflegends[+]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoI ask for a lot of damage to be done on the small camp and buff before they go to lane. That goes a long way. I pretty much always build hunter's machete now. That build into some pretty nice items. I don't find myself getting philo as often now. It is harder to gank, I agree. It gives me more time to farm now though. I've found it that I have way more cs and in turn gold by late game due to farming so much. You can clear so fast with an upgraded stone. Diana is just disgusting, I've cleared small camps in under 5 seconds with her easily by mid game. Its kind of a slow start in the jungle, especially being forced into sometimes using up all 5 pots in a clear, but I find it to be more rewarding mid/late game.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWee Teardrop being random  by  ThaWizin  cringe[+]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agolmao lol so randomz xDpermalinksavecontextfull commentsSuggestion for U of I students  by  CamelKnucklein  UIUC[+]Jinairik 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoI'm with you, man.

This "feel something" thing is interesting though. Maybe she needs to do something outside of the everyday cycle. I think you should just continue being a good friend to her. Maybe plan something fun with her that is slightly different than what she experiences regularly, something that you know she would be interested in. It shows you care and it might help her "feel something" in a positive way.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShould I go to a show tonight alone?  by  fluidinstaccatoin  Advice[+]Jinairik 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 1 point2 points3 points 10 days agoGoing out alone is not weird at all! Admittedly, some people do view it in a negative light, but how else are you going to meet people? Think of it as a way to filter out judgmental people like that. Who knows you might meet some nice people or you can be that suave, mysterious stranger. Just be careful if you go out drinking at the bars alone!permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy friend admitted to cutting, I'm not sure how to respond  by  Luvmabubblesin  Advice[+]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoIf she seems any bit suicidal, you need to contact somebody fast. If she is just doing it to either punish herself or something along those lines, you should really try to encourage her to see a professional that can help. This is a very delicate situation, so don't take it lightly.(I realize this is all sort of obvious advice, but we shouldn't risk anything in a situation like this since neither of us are trained to handle something like this.)permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuit job and pursue love/travel?  by  firstworldproblemzzzin  Advice[+]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoDo you go on vacations? My old parents (I'm a college student, so I'll speak from their perspective) got this urge often. I asked them why they went on so many vacations and this is kind of why. Sure, they don't have as much as a couple that stays at home, but they love to travel across the world. They also told me it's nice to have a home to come back to and  a job that keeps them secure. You seem well off now, but you really might screw yourself over. I'd imagine it would be really scary to have no money and no job in your mid 30's.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI really need help getting over her.  by  bonerifikin  Advice[+]Jinairik 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 1 point2 points3 points 10 days agoI don't know dude, I'd probably stay away from her. She seems to have really screwed over your social life. I wouldn't let her affect you anymore. What exactly are you looking for in this closure? That is kind of a key question. If you're hoping for maybe something to spark out of one last interaction, I suggest not actually seeing her again. When I was in a situation like this, the face-to-face closure thing kind of made it worse. If you are seeking some form of closure, I suggest a substitute or something that can kind of symbolically represent closure to you because it sure is closed for her. Maybe destroy something she gave you? When I broke up with my girlfriend (different situation now), I destroyed this craft thing she made me and it kind of felt like it was finalized when it was over.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat do I major in?  by  Jinairikin  Advice[+]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoThanks for taking the time to write this out. I'm going to try again next semester. It is widely known by my math department that I had the hardest professor for this course, so perhaps I'll get a little luckier next semester. I still feel like I haven't actually proved a unique proof all by myself though. I can't rely on her teaching since I have a very hard time understanding her and from what I can understand it is usually just her telling us what to do opposed to her actually teaching. Are there any outside sources that can help me for a class with this description? "Fundamental ideas used in many areas of mathematics. Topics will include: techniques of proof, mathematical induction, binomial coefficients, rational and irrational numbers, the least upper bound axiom for real numbers, and a rigorous treatment of convergence of sequences and series. This will be supplemented by the instructor from topics available in the various texts. Students will regularly write proofs emphasizing precise reasoning and clear exposition."permalinksavecontextfull commentsCalling all high school teachers...I need advice!  by  hiimmidgin  Advice[+]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agoIf you love it, pursue it. Worst case scenario is that you won't find a career in teaching for a while (years? ideally not...) and you may have to work elsewhere in the meantime. I plan to teach too (admittedly I am much further behind you in the process), and I have fully accepted the fact that finding a job is going to be brutal. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMarble Blast Ultra (removed from XBLA due to IP disputes) has been unofficially ported to PC (Download link at the Youtube video)  by  alo81in  Games[+]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]Jinairik 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoBro, I was so the same way.
