Adam Lanza was also found dead at the school. That same day, law enforcement sources apparently gave the media incorrect information that Adam's brother Ryan, who lived in Hoboken, was a suspect. The confusion appeared to occur because Adam had been holding Ryan's ID.But according to local news outlets, Ryan was at work at Friday and wasn't even aware of the shootings, and began posting on his Facebook page in response to people and the media implicating him.  When he got home to Hoboken, the police questioned him and a roommate.Rumors flew fast and furious in front of Ryan's uptown building all of Friday, and Hoboken police, who were on the scene investigating, released a statement there. The media mostly left on Friday evening when the suspect's true identity was discovered.However, CNN, the New York Times, and other media returned on Saturday for the second day of coverage. One reporter asked people walking by if they know Ryan Lanza. Meanwhile, groups of other twentysomethings who live and party in this densely populated town walked by the same corner unaware, dressed in Santa for the annual 'Santacon' event being held across the river in New York City.
