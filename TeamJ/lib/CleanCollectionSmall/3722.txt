J. Paul Vance said.Those families are going through a very difficult and trying time,  Vance said, pleading with the media to respect the survivors wishes for  privacy. A list that names the deceased will be made available as soon  as the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has finished its work.  Vance said that the bodies inside the school all have been transported  to that officelocated in the Hartford suburb of Farmington, about 40  miles from Newtown.It isnt clear when the elementary school will reopen. Vance said  investigators likely will be on scene for another one to two days. The  superintendent of schools in Newtown is expected to address the media  Saturday, Vance said.Echoing what Newtown police told Patch Saturday morning, Vance said  investigators are working hard to try and establish the gunmans motive.  Until that investigation is complete, Vance said, no information about  its details will be released.I have to tell you that there are certain things, that there are simply cards we are holding close to our chest, he said.Also echoing Newtown police, Vance confirmed that the gunman appeared  to have forced his way into the school by shooting through glass to  breach a secure, locked system.Vance said that good evidence was recovered at the school as well  as a Sandy Hook home where a woman whose son is believed to be the  shooter was found dead Friday.Multiple news outlets citing police   sources have identified 20-year-old Adam Lanza as the gunman. According to NBC News,     three weapons used in the shootingstwo 9 mm handguns and a   riflewere   legally purchased and registered to Lanzas mother.[The school and home] did produce evidence that investigators are able to use, Vance said.Vance confirmed that all three weapons were located near the shooter by police responding to the scene Friday.First responders to the school encountered several students and  staff suffering from gunshot wounds, according to a press release  issued by the state police.On- and off-duty troopers and Newtown Police Department officers  responded to what the world quickly learned was a horrifying,  unimaginable scene following a 9:30 a.m. 911 call reporting a possible  shooting at the school, Vance said in the press release.Upon arrival, teams of Troopers and Officers formed Active Shooter  Teams and immediately entered the school, Vance said in the release.  Teams performed rescues of students and staff, removing them to a safe  location as they searched for the shooting suspect within the building.  The building was evacuated and students walked hand in hand out to a  safe location.The shooter, whose identity police have not yet confirmed, was found  dead inside the school, Vance said. Police have said the gunman shot  himself.Multiple media outlets have identified 20-year-old Adam Lanza as the  gunman. Vance also confirmed that a relative of the gunman was found  dead at a residence in Sandy Hook. That deceased person is believed to  be Lanzas mother, Nancy. Nancy Lanza, originally reported to be a  teacher at the school, is not in fact a teacher there, according to CNN.In all, 27 people were killed, police said, including 20 children.  Among the adults killed were the schools beloved principal and  psychologist.The identities of all victims have been established, Vance said.  Families of those killed have asked that no media members press them for  interviews, Vance said.The bodies of those that perished have been transported to the Office  of the Medical Examiner, which is located in Farmingtona suburb of  Hartford about 40 miles away.State Police Major Crime Investigators are continuing to process the  school crime scene, gathering evidence and documenting the entire  facility, Vance said in the press release. State Police Detectives  assisted by Newtown Detectives processed the interior and exterior crime  scene. Teams of investigators flooded the community and followed each  lead, developing extensive information.In addition to the support for families themselves, Vance said, a  crisis intervention team is being made available to the larger Newtown  community. That team can be reached at 203-270-4283, Vance said..........Related Topics:Newtown ShootingEmail me updates about this story.[["validates_email_format_of",{"message":"Enter a valid email address e.g. janedoe@aol.com."}]]Website:Thanks.
