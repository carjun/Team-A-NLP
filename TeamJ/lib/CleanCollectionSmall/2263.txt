It has rich notifications, background sync, a full intent system, homescreen and lockscreen widgets, a fleshed out shortcut system, Google Now, the ability to install apps from any source, and a bunch of other stuff.I'm looking through the Cydia store right now because I'm curious, but can a JB'd iPhone duplicate these things, and what does it offer that Stock Android doesn't have?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Everything from my Google account syncs pretty well, but iOS's lack of an intent system keeps me from setting chrome as the default browser, or Gmail as the default mail client (for instance).permalinksavecontextfull comments5 hour flight today....I think I'll be alright  by  OvertimeWrin  gaming[+]Red-Sox 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Red-Sox 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours agoThat's the thing. Jailbreaking is easy, but if you don't want to deal with headaches like waiting for exploits before updating and such, Android is probably the way to go. A stock Android phone is still way more powerful than a JB'd iPhone. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle Maps for iPhone was just released, and it's even BETTER than Android's version.

The current guidelines are great, but the first-party apps you mentioned are just as pretty as anything coming out of Cupertino. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle releases updated Sound Search widget; adds search history that syncs across devices  by  irishtexmexin  Android[+]Red-Sox 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]Red-Sox 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*This paired with the fact that it's a lock screen widget  on 4.2 makes a great example of how futuristic Android has become. In a few gestures--without picking your phone up--you can identify and save a song to a cloud-kept list. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are currently the best examples of well-designed apps for Android?  by  scoularisin  Android[+]Red-Sox 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]Red-Sox 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago*Hey there. Great work on the app, I really love it. Use it all the time.The black background is great on AMOLED displays, but a dark gray looks better on other panels imo. (see Pocket, for instance.)Also, is there any chance that on tablets you could add dual panels in portrait landscape? Reddit Sync does this, and it's really nice. (See Google Drive for an even better implementation.)permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle's Schmidt: Android is 'winning that war' with Apple  by  fudnipin  Android[+]Red-Sox 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Red-Sox 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoTrue, but they are designed by Google. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle's Schmidt: Android is 'winning that war' with Apple  by  fudnipin  Android[+]Red-Sox 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Red-Sox 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoYeah, but it's unlike Windows vs. OS X in that there is first-party hardware with AOSP Android. That's what makes it so cool for me. permalinksavecontextfull commentsOutside of the built in android apps and google apps (don't include reddit apps) what is the one you could not live without?  by  Drew2727in  Android[+]Red-Sox 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Red-Sox 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoIt's not public. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNew York Times Android app updated with tablet UI  by  fudnipin  Android[+]Red-Sox 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Red-Sox 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoMore importantly, exciting times for Android. permalinksavecontextfull commentsOutside of the built in android apps and google apps (don't include reddit apps) what is the one you could not live without?  by  Drew2727in  Android[+]Red-Sox 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Red-Sox 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoWhy this instead of Google Music?permalinksavecontextfull commentsHTC Announces One SV, A 4.3" Dual-Core Mid-Range Device That Completely Confuses The HTC One Brand  by  bolanroxin  Android[+]Red-Sox 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Red-Sox 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoDitched my XL for a Nexus 4.

I was assuming no one here carries it around in their front pocket if it creates a bulge like it did for me, but I added it on the off-chance someone does. I think it also displays that I realize it's a totally subjective matter and that it's merely my opinion. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
