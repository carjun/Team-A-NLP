Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]ologies 3 points4 points5 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]ologies 3 points4 points5 points 15 minutes agoI'm inclined to agree with you - children are resilient and have pliant enough minds at this point that with the right support structure and guidance, even those who witnessed the worst of it first-hand have a good chance of growing up to be healthy, productive adults. I hope they get all the help they need and are surrounded by lots of love and patience while they cope.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

You don't walk into a day care facility and start talking about sex in graphic detail with a bunch of children there.If you exercise literally any form of mindfulness based on your audience, guess what? You "self-censor". If you watch your language around kids or lower your voice when you want to talk about a scandalous topic in public, you "self-censor". This isn't some kind of new-fangled oppression of your free speech, you've most likely been doing it all along. This is really no different, except now it's suddenly too much to ask of you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat do you think the TILs of the future will be about our era?  by  are_you_positivein  AskReddit[+]ologies 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]ologies 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours agoWhite trash isn't necessarily insulting based on the target's race - if anything, it's socioeconomic.

It also calls into question your yet-unsubstantiated claim that this is a BIG MAJOR PROBLEM!!!So yeah, I'll still be waiting here.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPublic Buses Across Country Quietly Adding Microphones to Record Passenger Conversations  by  brotherofbadulain  news[+]ologies 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]ologies 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoOkay, well, I'll just be over here waiting for your sources instead of your extrapolation.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAmsterdam police will turn a blind eye to foreigners buying cannabis in its famous "coffee shops" when a national ban comes into force next year, the city's mayor said on Wednesday.  by  Libertateain  worldnews[+]ologies 16 points17 points18 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]ologies 16 points17 points18 points 1 day agoStroopwafels, dude.

In fact, the cameras appear to be doing just fine as it is, as this bus fraud is being challenged in court with what looks to be decent amounts of evidence.2) You claim every major city has this problem and it costs them a lot. You have shown me...3 links related to the last three years in Philadelphia only and not a one of them talks about the cost to the state or prevalence. What of the other cities?3) On that note, you should also be comparing these nationwide incidences to the billions of trips made in one year alone - Even if these attempts at fraud happen 10 times a year, based on roughly 10 billion trips yearly, that's a .0000001% occurrence rate per trip.4) I'm not asking for evidence because I think it's impossible that there's a problem - for all I know, it could be, but declaring this a nationwide "problem" is a pretty hefty statement that you should be backing up with some facts instead of conjecture. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPublic Buses Across Country Quietly Adding Microphones to Record Passenger Conversations  by  brotherofbadulain  news[+]ologies 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]ologies 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago[Citation needed]permalinksavecontextfull comments10 books for skeptics.
