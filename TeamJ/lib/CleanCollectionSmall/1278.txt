Now Nancy Lanza is known as her son's first victim.Authorities say her 20-year-old son Adam gunned her down before killing 26 others at Sandy Hook. The two shared a home in a well-to-do Newtown neighborhood, but details were slow to emerge of who she was and what might have led her son to carry out such horror.Kingston, N.H., Police Chief Donald Briggs Jr. said Nancy Lanza once lived in the community and was a kind, considerate and loving person. The former stockbroker at John Hancock in Boston was well-respected, Briggs said.Court records show Lanza and her ex-husband, Peter Lanza, filed for divorce in 2008. He lives in Stamford and is a tax director at General Electric. A neighbor, Rhonda Cullens, said she knew Nancy Lanza from get-togethers she had hosted to play Bunco, a dice game. She said her neighbor had enjoyed gardening."She was a very nice lady," Cullens said. "She was just like all the rest of us in the neighborhood, just a regular person."JESSE LEWIS, 6Six-year-old Jesse Lewis had hot chocolate with his favorite breakfast sandwich  sausage, egg and cheese  at the neighborhood deli before going to school Friday morning.Jesse and his parents were regulars at the Misty Vale Deli in Sandy Hook, Conn., owner Angel Salazar told The Wall Street Journal."He was always friendly; he always liked to talk," Salazar said.Jesse's family has a collection of animals he enjoyed playing with, and he was learning to ride horseback.Family friend Barbara McSperrin told the Journal that Jesse was "a typical 6-year-old little boy, full of life."ANA MARQUEZ-GREENE, 6A year ago, 6-year-old Ana Marquez-Greene was reveling in holiday celebrations with her extended family on her first trip to Puerto Rico.
