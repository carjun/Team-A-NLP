The video above is President Barack Obama fighting tears while giving a statement in the White House briefing room. Below some reaction from the Georgia delegation.U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson:I am terribly saddened to learn of the shootings today at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. I ask all Georgians to join me in praying for the victims and the families affected by this horrendous tragedy.U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Atlanta:I am incredibly grieved by this horrible tragedy. As one who has experienced violence and even terrorism in my life, I deeply regret that young innocent children were killed and that their families and the people of Newtown, Connecticut must face this violence in their communities. My heart weeps at the senselessness of this atrocity.This time of year is special for the children of this nation. They are looking forward to the magic and wonder of the holidays, but today they are suffering through a very sad and dark hour in American history. The psyche of many children in Connecticut and throughout this country will be scarred for decades to come.My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the entire Newtown community in this very difficult hour. We as a nation and as a people must take a stand against the tragic problem of mass shooting in American schools. Theres not any room in American society for these unspeakable acts of violence.Update 5:15 p.m.  Flags will be at half staff in the City of Atlanta. Heres this from Mayor Kasim ReedOn behalf of the City of Atlanta, I want to express my deepest sympathy for the children, families, teachers and first responders affected by todays horrific tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on December 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut, I hereby order that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff at all City of Atlanta public buildings and grounds until sunset, December 18, 2012.Print18 comments Add your commentJohnDBDecember 14th, 20125:59 pmI wonder how long it will take for the first idiot to try and politicize this horrible tragedy in these forums.LinkReport this commentLeftinthesouthDecember 14th, 20127:30 pmLooks like you already have.LinkReport this commentShooter's Mom, Straw Buyer?December 14th, 20127:50 pmThis horrific event is still a fluid story, but we must see that these mass killings define our America.Im a many-generation Georgia nativenot just a CSA descendant, but a Cracker that takes their roots back to the Revolutionnot the Tea PArty whacko revolution, but the Amercian Revolution, the days of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Some of the forebears were working the mountains of Cracker land when the 2nd Amendment was penned, and gave us unlimited rights to be armed beyond reason, in these days of auto-loaders and drum magazines.Reasonable gun laws arent a threat to my owning lots of guns, and even more guns than teeth, like a good cracker. Being older, I go back to the days before the 1968 Gun Control Act. Back when normal people bought guns through the mail from the Sears Roebuck Catalog. Back when things like this mass killing of children, or ANY mass killing off the battlefields (with rules for mass killing) were unimaginable.WE have rules about gun ownership; we need some better onesIll suggest a few. One thats a federal law in place NOW is that you cant buy guns if you arent over 21. If the headline proves true that the shooters mother lawfully purchased these guns, and the shooter is in fact only 21then its reasonable to conclude that the dead mom here facilitated all this. Twenty year old boys cant buy SigSaeur and Glock high capacity auto-loader pistols, or Bushmaster .223 assault rifles. Being a straw buyer, especially for someone who is mentally challenged, as the older brother suggests, is illegal, and for a reason. Many innocent have paid a price, if these facts are born out.Georgia, having finally got a state registry for the 159 countys separate concealed carry weapons permits, formerly called pistol toter permits needs to move past being a dumb shall [must] issue permit state,where any non-felon and non-court psycho-registered citizen is automatically given a concealed carry permit. We should include mandatory legal training about the consequences of drawing a gun.And close the gun show loophole. Yes, I can still sell my gun to another citizen, but letting these circus-style gun trading gatherings sell to  anybody with no background check is a recipe for more and more to this. And why dont reckless gun owners go to jail when their kid gets their accessible gun and kills another kid. The law is there; stop calling it Gods Will and a tragedy when some irresponsible gun owner lets some kid get killed form not having a gun safe or $3 gun lockMy gun rights arent threatened if nut jobs dont buy guns, and their mothers and fathers should be held to account if they arm them. Yes; guns do kill people; not much we can do about crazy, but keep guns and crazies separated. Its that simplealways has been.Prayers for the innocent; damnation for the enablers.LinkReport this commentStarikDecember 14th, 20127:58 pmIt probably would be impossible to do away with guns, or access to guns  there are too many guns, theyre easy to steal, and a large part of the population simply wouldnt comply.  What we can do is get control of the dangerous mentally ill population.  Why not a schizophrenic registry?  Why is it so hard for families to get inpatient help for damgerous family members?  Why are there no beds to house them?LinkReport this commentMarianneDecember 14th, 20128:50 pmWhy did the shooters mother have these guns? An assault rifle? This is unbelievable!

ALL GUYS NEED TO BE PREPARED TO DO THIS TO PROTECT WOMEN AND CHILDREN. I AINT GOING OUT LIKE NO PUNK. MASS KILLERS ARE SERIAL KILLERS THAT BLOOMED TO EARLY,I.E. THEY HAVENT LEARNED THE PATIENCE A SERIAL KILLER HAS. FACTS ABOUT AMERICA AND GUNS/KILLERS: America is 4.5% of the worlds population and 85% of the worlds serial killers (90% of serial killers are perfectly sane. Serial killers are an American cultural EXPORT due to TV. America has almost one gun per person (300 million for 313 million people). Almost ALL serial killers are males in their 20s or early 30s who wanted to be famous or someone big, hate their Mothers, are sexually dysfunctional, played with fire and abused animals as a kid. The reason for the explosion of these killings in America is reality TV shows, the 24 hour cable news networks, and our obsession with celebrity. BUT the major issue is America is and always has been a violent society due to major social ills such as sexism and the prison industry (America has more prisoners than China and India combined although they are nearly 40% of the worlds population and the US is 4.5%) and lack of social mechanisms found in Canada and Europe. 99% of what you hear about such shootings from the media and so called experts is completely and utterly non factual as in NOT TRUE. The shocking news is atleast 91% of all such killings can be eliminated if we behaved as Western Europe, Australia, and Canada do.LinkReport this commentluangtomDecember 14th, 201211:42 pmAmerica has a big problem and there are those that wish to legislate it away via gun-control laws, drug-control laws and whatever other knee-jerk reaction they can get passed to deal with our problems. They do not work. What is driving America over the edge? What drives people to the point of taking the lives of innocents that have had nothing to do with them at all? What sort of statement are they wishing to make?America knows how well the War on Drugs has worked. Grade-school children can purchase drugs outside their schools, as can middle-school, high school and college students. So, where do we begin? Why do we try to assimilate all of the mental-health patients back into defenseless areas of society such as our schools? This country is not only overwhelmed by the influx of illicit drugs, it is over-prescribed with drugs to make everyone feel better. Just check your medicine-cabinets and see how many drugs are on hand. Ever had an injury? PoofI bet there are meds like vicodin, lortab or percocet in the cabinet. Kids gets these everyday from home.What of gun-control? Well, do you think China is going to demand knife-control? A man stabbed 20 children in a school in China and our news here over-rode that news, but it still occurred and they are still reeling from it. Is more legislation on knives truly the answer? What prompted that man to do what he did? Wake-up, America, we cannot legislate away common-sense with more control.LinkReport this commentjconservativeDecember 15th, 20126:36 amWe should include mandatory legal training about the consequences of drawing a gun. This from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources:  If you were born on or after January 1, 1961, you need to complete a hunter education course prior to purchasing a hunting license.One needs to take a class to get a hunting license but not to own or carry a firearm.LinkReport this commenthiramDecember 15th, 20128:17 amI see an opportunity for unemployed military veterans.

More gun saturation in our culturebut, in the case of the legislature, perhaps it proves out the old Biblical proverb: the guilty flee when no one persueth.LinkReport this commentMrLibertyDecember 15th, 201210:14 amAt its rotten core, government is nothing more than violence.  Why would I care what people who belong to this system have to say about this.We do not have a system that simply enforces laws against the harming of anothers property or person.  We have a system that takes the fruits on ones labor, takes ones property, takes away ones freedom to decide what they will eat, what they will put into their bodies, how they will dispose of their income, what they can and cannot sell, when they can and cannot sell it, where they can travel, what type of healthcare services they can purchase, whom they can purchase them from, what wage one can agree to work for, where one can live, what one can do with ones property, whether one can legally protect ones own life from harm, etc.  All of these restrictions on freedom and liberty are backed up with the implicit violence of the government.You may not want to face these truths.  You may wish to wrap yourself in the flag, comfort yourself with idealistic words like democracy, majority rule, etc. but ultimately at the heart of it all is a system populated and endorsed by people who believe that it is their right to take money from others against their will, impose their values on others, and deny them their rights because they can convince enough other people to go along with them.  These actions are no less immoral because a government does them than if they were done by an individual.Life is hard, and plenty of things push people over the edge.  But what type of society have we allowed america to become?  What does our society actively do to push people over the edge with the violations of personal liberty, violations of human rights, and violations of property rights all under the cover of law?LinkReport this commenthiramDecember 15th, 201210:17 amAt carryWhat are our options, now that the gun lobby, enabled by our spineless politicians, have made military weapons available to one and all, including the insane?

Even if we had more, you could still get a gun as easily as you can get drugs.  A better solution is to address the threat.    The post above, carry AR-15s at schools is naive.  The solution is indeed to have an armed police officer at every school.  The officer doesnt have to carry an assault rifle, just his pistol.  I bet you these low-lifes would think twice about shooting up a school if it was public knowledge that there is an officer there who would at least put up a fight.  Locking down the schools does nothing.  The guy in Connecticut got in anyway.  With a cop inside the place the kids would have at least had a chance.  Im sorry, Mr. AR-15 poster, but I could give a rats a$$ about a school being inviting. The lives of the children are way more important.LinkReport this commentUninviting Public Legislature w/ AR-15sDecember 15th, 20124:45 pmMaybe you miss the pointit is not needed or appropriate to have GSP officers parading around the capitol grounds, the peoples house where laws are debated and created, with assault rifles. Exactly what is the threat? Why waste the money and intrude into citizens lives with paramilitary arms in the public world, for the look of toughness or macho or something.As to schools, what is the threat? Crazy and determined attackers will still cause chaos and mayhem, if not at the school, then the public library or mall or theatre, whatever..seems these have all been targeted. Just exactly how do you plan to pay for armed officers at 4,000 public school campuses in Georgia? More tax cuts?  For most of our rural Georgia countieswhere these mandates really hurt public budgetshaving deputies manning the metal detectors at the public courthouse, with no discernible threat, is a big waste and expense. We do have 159 counties, most barely have budgets; many are in the red now.Childrens lives, and all lives are priceless. The GOPs cutting GBI crime labs, funding for the GSP, DNR, EPD and other state agencies, and allowing all kinds of county level tax exemptions that defund police, EMTs, fire service, etc. flies in the face of really caring about people. With the new privatized schools and privatized prisons pipeline, maybe they can share armed guards and get assault rifle discounts.Making these sites secure doesnt work like you claimread about the employee shooting himself in the head in the Federal Courthouse in Birmingham las week:Employee commits suicide inside Alabama federal courthousehttp://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/14/us-employee-suicide-idUSBRE8BD01D20121214LinkReport this commentBuckhead BoyDecember 15th, 20124:46 pmtd, you ask how we should pay for the egregious gun violence in this country. How bout we tax the hell out of firearms and ammunition at the points of manufacture or import. Then, we permit their retail sale or transfer only through government-run stores, and we tax the hell out of that transaction through an excise tax. And, we require the transactor(s) to show proof of say $2 million in personal liability insurance coverage, and we tax the insurance premium. Then, we subject ownership of a firearm to an annual ad valorem tax with the requirement of maintenance of the insurance coverage. We prosecute violators as tax evaders, and destroy the contraband. The illusion of your 18th Century right would be maintained, but we probably wouldnt in actuality have to spend that much more on protection. And, the rest of us would be able to pursue life, liberty and happiness at schools, colleges, malls, theaters and other places of assembly in civil society with considerably less trepidation.Nothing new here in concept. All that is needed is to close our ears to the henchmen and dupes of the merchants of death and recognize that this isnt the 18th Century  that our closest neighbor is likely to reside 2 or 200 feet away, not 2 miles, and that our chance of encountering gun violence is significantly greater in a population of 300 million than 3. Besides, I cant recall having to attend a militia drill recently; so why would ownership of a firearm have benefit for national defense or otherwise be of value to the commonweal? A firearm is just an uncommonly dangerous product, and its ownership just another dangerous endeavor; and thats how we should treat such.LinkReport this commentAdd your commentName (required)E-mail (required, but will not be published)Enter your comments hereAbout Political InsiderFrom the ATL to DC with Jim Galloway: Because all politics is localTwitter and other contact info, plus a bio Political Insider RSS feedSearch this blogSearch for:Recent Posts Obama, Isakson, Lewis, Reed react to Conn. shooting Your Daily Jolt: Kingston suggests short cliff dive Hank Johnsons mea culpa on the m-word Video: Kasim Reed talks gay marriage on MSNBC Your Daily Jolt: Barrow glad for a few less crazy people in House Broun: This is not about a race in 2014 Chambliss campaign managers thoughts on Deal: Nothing Your Daily Jolt: Deal tells legislators money is tight Kasim Reed announces support for gay marriage Poll debunks N.C. senators proclaimed peanut superiority Archives December 2012November 2012October 2012September 2012August 2012July 2012June 2012May 2012April 2012March 2012February 2012January 2012December 2011November 2011October 2011September 2011August 2011July 2011June 2011May 2011April 2011March 2011February 2011January 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010September 2010August 2010July 2010June 2010May 2010April 2010March 2010February 2010January 2010December 2009November 2009October 2009September 2009August 2009July 2009June 2009May 2009April 2009March 2009February 2009Previous entries More from the AJC  Tweets by @politicalinsidr  Follow on Twitter   On Facebook  E-mail JimBlogrollA View from the HinterlandAJCs Georgia politics pageAtlanta UnfilteredBlog for DemocracyCracker SquireCrazy for LibertyDaily KosFiveThirtyEightFresh Loaf/Creative LoafingGeorgia Daily DigestGeorgia PunditHeneghan's Dunwoody BlogHuman BehaviorJamie Dupree's Washington InsiderJason Pye, LibertarianPeachPunditPeanut PoliticsPolitiFact GeorgiaRedstate.comSwampland/Time magazineThe Caucus/NYTThe Fix/WPThe Saporta ReportTop of the Ticket/LATWashington/The AtlanticAll AJC blogs Tell us what you think about the siteSend us your suggestions about this page.Send a feedback technical issueSubscribe Customer Care Vacation stops, manage subscriptions and moreAJC ServicesStaff contactsReprints and permissionContestsSubmit event listingsSend us news tipsCareers at AJCCareers at CoxAJC StoreAJC ConversationSectionsNewsSportsEntertainmentTravelBusinessLifestyleObituariesOther EditionsSign up for newslettersDigital ProductsAJC for iPadSign up for ajcMobileRSS and WidgetsToday's news | A1 imageArchivesGuidesBest of AtlantaSchool GuideNeighborhood GuideAJC in EducationAtlanta Home SalesAtlanta TopicsTravel GuideAtlanta Holiday GuideAtlanta Crime & SafetyFind Atlanta JobsGraduate/MBA EducationAffiliatesCars at AutotraderLocal Services at KudzuCoupons at ValpakAdvertisingAbout our adsAdvertise with usE-SheetsAJC Sitesajc.comAccessAtlantaAtlanta JobsAtlanta HomesAtlanta ApartmentsAtlanta CarsAtlanta ClassifiedsMundo Hispnico Visitor Agreement | Privacy Statement 2012 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
