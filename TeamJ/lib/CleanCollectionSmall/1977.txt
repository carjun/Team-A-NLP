Just heard the reports on NBC Connecticut feed I'm watching.permalinksaveparent[+]mojorisin2592 54 points55 points56 points 1 day ago*(25 children)[]mojorisin2592 54 points55 points56 points 1 day ago*It's really true what they say, that these things can happen right in your backyard. As someone who grew up in CT, this is unbelievable. I always figured these types of things would only happen far away; deep in my imagination these things only happen in Colorado or Arizona or other places that seem like nowhere to me... I don't know why I had this mindset. False sense of security, I guess... This is just sickeningpermalinksaveparent[+]vpovio 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]vpovio 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago...I grew up in Arizona... :( We're all "somewhere else far away" to someone else, right?permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (16 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoI don't think there really is any correlation to location for mass shootings. They're unpredictable. permalinksaveparent[+]Draydi 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (6 children)[]Draydi 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoI think he refers more to the fact that he was in the mindset that he never thought something like this would happen so close to home. Neither did I until half of my best friend's family (including him) was senselessly murdered because some random guy was having a bad day. Shocking realization that the world isn't as safe and happy as kids are brought up to think it is.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (5 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoYep. I know the feeling. I live in Tucson.permalinksaveparent[+]WeGotVices 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (4 children)[]WeGotVices 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoYeah the Gabriel Giffords shooting is the biggest thing to hit us ever, but I really think Tucson is a nice place besides that. But yeah it does make you realize it can happen absolutely anywhere.permalinksaveparent[+]octoberthug 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (3 children)[]octoberthug 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoTucson is really nice. The area where that incident happen is a pretty, upper-middle class neighborhood. It seems to me that these tragedies happen in somewhat decent places. You don't hear about mass shootings in Detroit or Compton.permalinksaveparent[+]IamFinis 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]IamFinis 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoYou know, except for the daily drive-bys and gang killings that are so common place the local news barely reports on them anymore. I grew up less than 20 miles from East Los Angeles. Twenty years ago it was a hell-hole, I can't even imagine it now. if I was a believer in a deity I'd thank that deity every day I escaped.permalinksaveparent[+]octoberthug 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (1 child)[]octoberthug 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoThose places were named based upon the violence and crime that occurs there. Those murders tend to be gang/drug/money related. I realize that sometimes bystanders are killed too. But there are not mass murders of innocent students/movie-goers/shoppers/etc. permalinksaveparent[+]IamFinis 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]IamFinis 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoA large number of them are domestic violence related as well. But that's not my point, my point is violence is violence. Is it any less tragic that a 14 year old kills another 14 year old over perceived territory encroachment?  Aren't both innocent bystanders of their circumstances? Anyway, I don't want to get into it. Just clarifying my point. Your point is equally valid and I hear you. permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 1 day ago*(2 children)[][deleted] 1 day ago*[deleted]permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (1 child)[]Butthole_Scientist -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoColorado is the healthiest state in the country.Most mass shootings have happened in California, if I'm not mistaken. Although California is large and has the highest population.Also, gun violence is the highest in the places with the stricted gun laws, if you were not aware.Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Illinois, New York, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]mojorisin2592 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]mojorisin2592 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*I think there's a higher correlation between mental health and mass shootings than high gun violence and mass shootings, like in the states you mention. Crime rates would be higher in urban populations, which have reason to have strict gun laws. Low access to mental health facilities and high suicide rates in relation to loose gun laws is a fairer reflection of the possibility for mass shootings, in my personal opinion. States like Colorado and Arizona fit this description, so those were the examples I used. However, the whole point of my comment was that this type of thing can happen anywhere. I'm just saying I have some reason to think that places like those are more likely to have mass shootings (including the previous media portrayal of mass shootings in those places), whether or not it's valid. permalinksaveparent[+]lilrabbitfoofoo 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (5 children)[]lilrabbitfoofoo 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoAny place where you find untreated (re: poor health care options) paranoid schizophrenics with legal access to military grade (re: kill people quickly) weapons you will find these kinds of mass shootings occurring.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (4 children)[]Butthole_Scientist -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agomilitary grade A semi automatic hunting rifle would have had the same outcome, buddy.An actual "military grade" assault rifle has never been used in any mass shooting since they were heavily regulated in 1934.permalinksaveparent[+]lilrabbitfoofoo 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago*(3 children)[]lilrabbitfoofoo 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago*I didn't say assault rifle.  Strawman much?That said, automatic or semi-automatic pistols are not used for sport hunting either.  They are used only by law enforcement (police, FBI, CIA, etc.) and the miltary and they're designed and used to do one thing and one thing only...killing people.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist -1 points0 points1 point 15 hours ago (2 children)[]Butthole_Scientist -1 points0 points1 point 15 hours agoActually, I personally have hunted with a Glock 20. So have many other people.Many people hunt with handguns. There are "handgun only" hunting seasons, in fact.permalinksaveparent[+]lilrabbitfoofoo 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (1 child)[]lilrabbitfoofoo 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoSad but true.  Neither challenging or necessary in the modern age, but there do remain a small number of men with extreme issues of inadequacy and/or cowardice who use guns to compensate for them.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoWhat, hunting? I hunt meat not for inadequacy, but because its a good way to put high quality meat on the table for a good price. permalinksaveparent[+]kennybearxoxo 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]kennybearxoxo 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoI know what you mean. I grew up in a town right next to Newtown and I never thought anything so awful could happen there or anywhere near there. I used to go there all the time. This is truly disgusting.permalinksaveparent[+]eddanger 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]eddanger 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoAs an Arizonan, I'm probably about as surprised as you. permalinksaveparent[+]Zincbeatr 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Zincbeatr 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI'm from Southbury, the town over from Newtown. I had this same mindset, even after leaving CT. I'll be back in a week for christmas, it really puts things into perspective.permalinksaveparent[+]Patass 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]Patass 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoNever been to Waterbury or new haven have yapermalinksaveparent[+]mojorisin2592 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]mojorisin2592 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoI have. They don't shoot up elementary schools. They just shoot up houses in broad daylight.
