Louis Gohmert (R-TX) told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace this morning.Rep. Gohmert was referring to Elementary School principal Dawn Hochsprung, who was murdered Friday in one of the worst school shootings in U.S. historyat Sandy Hook Elementary Schoolin Newtown, Conn. Twenty sevenpeople were murdered by Adam Lanza Friday morningincluding 20 children, ages 6 and 7, in first grade.There are over 300 million privately owned firearms in the U.S. and 47% of American households contain at least one firearm. Self reported gun ownership in America is at the highest point since 1993.After 70 people were shot and 12 killed at a movie theater by a man using an semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle, Gohmert said the reason the attack occurred was, ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs and wondered why no one else in the theater had a gun to take down the shooter.There has been great investigation and study into this, Gohmert said as he commented on Sandy Hook. They choose this place [because] they know no one will be armed, he concluded. Once you start drawing the line, where do you stop? Thats why it is important to not just look at this emotionally.Lanza used a.223 semi-automatic M4 Bushmasterassault rifle Friday to kill 26 people. Gohmert, who is a former judge, has served in Congress since 2005 and is a ardent supporter of the National Rifle Association and an opponent of gun control.Connecticuts chief medical examiner,Dr. Wayne Carver,said yesterday that all of the victims of the Sandy Hook School massacre were killed by multiple gun shots from a long gun. His comments suggested that even though Lanza had two handguns, the Bushmaster assault rifle was the murder weapon.A 10 year ban on assault weapons was signed into law in 1994 and expired in 2004.Lauren Victoria Burke is POLITIC365s Managing Editor.
