Lots of examples of that particular tactlessness over the years, it's a big reason why I don't watch live TV news anymore. Edit - maybe this is a good time to start a writing campaign to all the news stations asking them to rein in their reporters from asking these types of questions.  The incident that did it for me was the Waco massacre.  A reporter was with David Koresh's mom and they were watching their compound burning on the news.  The fucking reporter asked "what are you feeling right now as you watch this?"  DK's mom just looked at her like she was insane and said "Those are my grandchildren..."  I turned it off at that point, don't know if the reporter got booted out or not.  I think crap like this is why so many people cheer at the reporter getting punched in the die hard movies. permalinksaveparent[+]cadex 190 points191 points192 points 1 day ago (14 children)[]cadex 190 points191 points192 points 1 day agoOver here in the uk a 7 year old girl went missing.

It's a shitty, underpaid and unappreciated job on the best of days. Take my advice and do something else  get an IT degree or become a teacher or something. You'll be happier.If you do decide to go on with your degree, then harden up. You'll be asked to do a lot of things you don't want to do, that seem cruel or classless, but remember that your job is to be completely dispassionate and harden up. Your job in a situation like this is to tell the stories of the dead and the survivors, to capture the fear and anger, to get the facts out there, to find a way to give the story meaning, to ensure that people are still talking about it a week from now, and, if possible, to leverage the work you do to create some sort of positive change in the world. As a reporter, you hold up the mirror to society, which won't always like what it sees reflected back. If you hold the mirror right, people won't even notice who's doing the holding, all they'll care about is fixing what's wrong with that picture.permalinksaveparent[+]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours agoJournalist here as well. There's nothing inherently wrong with interviewing people if they want to be interviewed.But your personal ethics do come into play with what to ask. Many other reporters that I see and work with just have no off switch. Personally, I don't think I'd be approaching kids for an interview. I can't source them anyway.

Numbers up to twelve now, at least. Real time updates thanks to User mygrapefruitEDIT: More than 20 dead likelyEDIT2: 27 dead, 14 students, one of two gunmen. Other gunmen apparently arrestedEDIT3: One gunmen thought to be a father of a studentEDIT4: Now 18 children dead out of 27, including gunmanEDIT5: Gunmen thought to be in 20s, wearing bullet proof vest and carrying 4 firearms. No word on second gunman, if there was one.EDIT6: Shooter identified as Ryan Lanza, with known connections to Newtown, CTEDIT7: Man found dead in Lanza's home in New JerseyEDIT8: Suspects mother, teacher at the elementary school, dead at the sceneEDIT9: Suspect in custody is are Ryan Lanza's younger brother roommates. No information on whether it is simply for questioning or for greater motivesEDIT10: Man killed in Hoboken was brother. Two roommates of Lanza believed to have no connection to massacre questionedEDIT11: Media says name of shooter has not been officially released. Speculation is now that the shooter was Adam Lanza, Ryan's younger brother. It is believed that Adam stole his brother, Ryan's, identity. Information is still hazy thoughFinal thoughts (11:40 PM EST): Sorry all, had to go to work. This isn't exactly how I pictured my top comment to be =/ it's eerie how much harder something like this hits when it's a ten minute drive down the road from you. I'm sure all of the information has been released since I left for work so I won't bother updating. Keep these families affected in your thoughts and prayers, as well as those families affected by the attack in China,  and let's hope we can finally find a way to keep psychopaths away from not only our children, but from all innocents. permalinksave[+]neonmonster 526 points527 points528 points 1 day ago*(280 children)[]neonmonster 526 points527 points528 points 1 day ago*27 confirmed dead nowEdit: 20 of the deceased are children :(permalinksaveparent[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 735 points736 points737 points 1 day ago (146 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 735 points736 points737 points 1 day agoThere are no words.

I'm not saying "oh fuck, they can afford the funeral" because I know your intention was about alleviating the stress and heartache and not just the financial. BUT, in that regard, maybe a fund for a cause that directly benefits children would be appropriate? In the name of those that died. Or even to set up a memorial. Or a donation to the school. Or possibly a fund to help with the mental health of the students who are alive, to cope? I don't know. Instead of putting it into individual's hands who may not need it, I can see it being used towards a greater awareness and communal good. permalinksaveparentload more comments(29 replies)[+]NobodyFollowsAKiller 36 points37 points38 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]NobodyFollowsAKiller 36 points37 points38 points 22 hours agoUpvote upvote upvote.permalinksaveparent[+]happypolychaetes 26 points27 points28 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]happypolychaetes 26 points27 points28 points 22 hours agoThis is a really good idea.

We are watching the news. We are horrified. We are all sobbing. 'm currently in one of the class rooms of the neighboring school and we're in lock down. So far we have heard nothing from the administration. We know that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook School (the elementry k-4 school). There were 2 shooters alledged. One kid (confirmed with multiple sources) is wounded and carried out of the school. The shooters are still out there, not caught. One teacher was shot.My town is trending on every major news site and it's scary as fuck. Update: 3 patients admitted to danbury hospital  by ambulance and the number of people shot is up to 4 (no ages yet). Update 2: one shooter reported dead (unconfirmed but multiple people are saying that)Update 3: One child dead. One shooter still on the loose. Yale hospital has opened a triage for victims. Update 4: Unconfirmed repoet that the principle is dead. The shooter is heading down river-side (the road). Update 5: Swatt team is sweeping the school Update 6: they've taken one woman aside and she's crying into a firefighter's arms. This could mean update number 3 about a kid dead is true. Update 7: We were released back to class. There was an announcement that said the area was safe, so we are conducting classes. I need to get back to class, so I will update later. We're watching the news, it's last period but we were forced to turn it off. One of the reporter's said,"and just think that these kids were seeing santa claus last weekend." We turned the audio off and we're all crying still.This is hell. Some kids are bawling in the bathroom, there are only 10 or so (out of 25) that remained in class). Nobody has a dry eye right now. Some kids are angry and swearing, others are staring at their feet. We don't know how to deal with this.

No one gives a shit right now about your politics. I'm very, very political (if you must know what side, my comment history in the subs I frequent will tell you) on this issue and I'm not going to say a word about it. Why? Because I've seen people after such incidents crying, in real pain, and I know that they don't want to talk about politics right now. Give it 3 fucking days before you start saying what would have prevented this tragedy. 3 days, that's it, then we can duke out politics. For now, let people grieve, and shut the fuck up.I just wish I could tell this to the news media as well, but oh well.edit: yes, I realize 3 days is a completely arbitrary number and may be excessive to some. I was just throwing out a number. My only point was that you should give the families and the town to grieve, and your first thought when something tragic happens shouldn't be political, but rather it should be respect and empathy.edit2 Stealing this from /u/thenewmeta below me (This was part of my point and in line with not immediately turning the internet, though more importantly the news, into a heated political debate constantly talking about this incident): If you dont want to propagate more mass murders, dont start the story with sirens blaring. Dont have photographs of the killer. Dont make this 24-7 coverage. Do everything you can to not make the body-count the lead story, not to make the killer some kind of anti-hero. DO localize the story to the affected community and make it as boring as possible in every other market. Because every time we have intense saturation coverage of a mass murder, we expect to see one or two more within a week.permalinksave[+]WoohooOvertime 273 points274 points275 points 1 day ago (87 children)[]WoohooOvertime 273 points274 points275 points 1 day agohttp://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-december-10-2012/any-given-gun-day---bob-costas---fox-newsI suggest you watch this and consider an alternate point of view.For those who don't wish to watch, the point Stewart makes here is that someone in the US dies from gun related violence every single day. When, then, is it appropriate to finally have a political talk about guns? Three days from today, someone in a ghetto neighborhood is probably going to get shot up and die. By the arbitrary standards you've imposed here on when people can actually speak about gun control, is that person's life somehow worth less than those of the people lost in this tragedy?permalinksaveparentload more comments(87 replies)[+]Liebhaben 166 points167 points168 points 1 day ago (10 children)[]Liebhaben 166 points167 points168 points 1 day agofucking no. when things happen you talk about them, you don't cast them to the side.

No, you can't place the blame for a tragedy strictly on an inanimate object.Does the ease with which children and mentally unstable adults can get their hands on deadly weapons contribute? Of course it does.Does having a gun in your hand change your mentality and disposition? Well, for some people it does.

Violence with firearms that manifests itself in this form is a social medical problem, not a problem of property rights.   Gun crime where robbery and assault is involved, is also not a property rights issue, it is a socioeconomic one.Mental health is a serious problem, that often goes unchecked.  It is when it goes unchecked, combined with a unique circumstance, that tragedies like this occur.  While people are quick to blame guns, the same sort of thing happened in China quite recently with a young man armed with a knife was able to kill 9 people before he was stopped.99.99% of all firearms are never used to intimidate, hurt, or kill people.  For those reasons, and more, I think anyone who is staunchly anti-gun is barking up the wrong tree.permalinksaveparentload more comments(11 replies)[+]m4tthu 61 points62 points63 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]m4tthu 61 points62 points63 points 1 day agoSmartest comment in this threadpermalinksaveparentload more comments(93 replies)[+]alaskamiller 46 points47 points48 points 1 day ago*(7 children)[]alaskamiller 46 points47 points48 points 1 day ago*Advocating for the other side, this is what happens when you live in the land of the free. You get people who don't always agree, groups are marginalized, anger seethes, and some are willing to resort to extremism for whatever purpose they rationalize. Right now, the most urgent conversation is the immediate either or demonization of us versus them, splitting sides. This happens no matter what and death, anger, destruction is used to push whoever's agenda best. My country is devolving into a state where there's no right or wrong anymore, just how many people you can get to agree by screaming the loudest.I think these incidents are indicators of an overall trend of the general unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Happy people don't do these things. But you can't guarantee everyone's happiness forever at every moment, only try to provide for an environment for anyone to pursue happiness. But remember where we came from. We live in USA, an experiment from 200 years ago that through the generations have been built through trials and errors, blood and sweat. These are the costs and collateral damage of freedom. There are some that strive to keep the bar high but there are also people willing to kick the bar lower each day.If you are angered by any of this the very most important you can do now is do everything you can to keep raising the bar and help everyone else be there too.

These acts are not committed by sane, well-adjusted people, they are committed by people with unrecognized and untreated mental illnesses who have fallen through the cracks because they can't afford basic bloody treatment or worse are deterred from seeking it due to rampant discrimination against the mentally ill.

Insurance is only required to cover mental health care "equally" as it does the rest. What this often means is that the psychologists and psychiatrists who would be of the most assistance are treated as "specialists", requiring a copay of 2-3x that of a general practitioner, despite having to see psychiatrists and psychologists at least once a month, on average, for any semblance of quality care. While they are required to cover the care, they are also not required to have any caregivers in-network. They are also not required to treat psychiatric prescriptions in the same way that they treat non-psychiatric meds. Often, this places the psych meds in the "premium" or "non-preferred" category.What does all of this mean, really? It means that I, a gainfully employed, 24 year old woman with bipolar disorder cannot afford the help I need, even with the addition of insurance and my husband's income. Copay for a visit to my primary care physician is $25, no matter how frequently I visit. Copay to see a psychologist or psychiatrist is $60. And that's if there's an in-network doctor. There isn't, through my insurance, a single in-network mental health care provider that isn't part of a hospital. Psychologists and psychiatrists at most of these hospitals are there for consultation or to deal with the mental ward, not to take on patients of their own.All told, in order for me to get the care I need to be "normal", I need to spend, in-network, $300 per month on doctors (psychologist, for therapy, once a week; psychiatrist, for meds, once a month), and another 50% of the $500/month that my meds cost (because, well, they're non-preferred medications). Out of network? I'm looking at $100 per visit (minimum), with the meds still at $250.I'm lucky. I have insurance. Those who are uninsured are even less likely to be able to get the help they need. Let alone those who are homeless.We need to fix the mental health care system. I think it would help everyone, not just those like me. I think it would help us see less violence in our society.permalinksaveparentload more comments(7 replies)[+]fat_stig 13 points14 points15 points 9 hours ago (3 children)[]fat_stig 13 points14 points15 points 9 hours agohttps://twitter.com/nicster/status/279713723906654208One guy tries to use a shoe bomb = Everyone at the airport takes their shoes off. 31 school shootings since Columbine = no changes.Truly asinine permalinksave[+]ThePoose -1 points0 points1 point 4 hours ago (1 child)[]ThePoose -1 points0 points1 point 4 hours agoThe possible maximum casualties from a plane bombing is in the thousands because the plane can kill people on the ground too.The possible maximum causalities in a school is around 50.

Mass killings are terrible and atrocious.  Add to that the fact that the large majority of the victims were so many young, vulnerable children.  My heart just aches.I understand that the media needs to report something.  (After all, I'm sure many of you were checking all of the major news outlets to get some sort of update or bird's eye view of the situation as it was unfolding.)  So I get that they needed to release information as they gathered it.  And in times of chaos, it's easy for someone to hear something and just run with it.  Unfortunately, that kind of swift release leads to misinformation.  But rather than point fingers (news, media, social networking, gun laws, lack of gun laws, bad parenting, what have you...) we should all take this time to open our hearts to the ones we love, and also to pay attention to those around us.  Remind our friends and family how much they mean to us, take the time to let them know how important they are in our lives.  That tiny step alone could prevent another situation like this from happening in the future.  Of course, there are individuals and groups who have a negative agenda (whether brought about by mental instability, political propaganda, religious zeal, etc.) but perhaps by using love and compassion as a preventive tool we can come together during this time.  My entire heart goes out to the families and loved ones who are now suffering from this unspeakable tragedy.

If these people can get help before they spiral out of control, maybe we wouldn't have these senseless mass murders.We also need to be able to force someone to do a mental evaluation or talk to someone. The really crazy people, don't know they are crazy. They will never get help because they believe nothing is wrong with them. But most have families and friends who know the truth.I have personal experience with this. It's impossible to commit someone, get a mental evaluation or do anything to help them if they don't want help or believe they need help.My dad was mentally ill, there is an increased risk for children to develop the same illness.I already told the rest of my family, if I go crazy like my Dad, put a bullet in my head, don't think twice about it.What he dealt with was horrible, what we dealt with was just as bad. We tried to get him help, we called the state, the hospital, spoke to psychiatrists and psychologists. "They couldn't do anything". That's what we were told. Nothing could be done if he didn't want help or admitting to hearing voices, seeing lasers, etc.He got worse over time. At one point, he started boiling water in the microwave. Claiming it was killing someone. He would take a laser pointer and run it up and down his head, did the same thing with a  flashlight. Then he go outside and shine it at something. He took coax cable and put it in ice, saying they were recording him.I'm glad that he didn't hurt anyone, but he could have. He was fixated on our old neighbors, who he had believed they were the ones doing this too him, talking to him. At times they were friends, sometimes they were enemies. He fired a gun in the house at the floor, we got rid of the gun.People want to focus on gun laws, we should focus on mental health laws.How many times do we see some crazy person rambling on the internet? We see it all the time, but we dismiss it. We ignore it. We want to believe they are just trolling or playing around.We can be blind to our own family.There is a difference between non-violent crazy and violent crazy. They both need help and attention.I wouldn't be surprised if this guy told someone like his mom his thoughts. I doubt he would tell her his plan, but I bet there were plenty of signs that were ignored.I would see a psychiatrist if it was free or affordable for me. My whole family could use therapy, I want it but it's not affordable.TL;DR Guns are only 1/2 the problem. We continue to ignore mental health laws. We need better healthcare, we need cheap and free ways for people to get help and speak to a mental health professional. We need an easier way to get people who don't want help, some help.permalinksave[+]davesidious 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]davesidious 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoHealthcare in the US will not make sense for generations to come.

More male geniuses AND idiots.Another data point is that the majority of child abuse incidents involve a female perpetrator.  Of course, females also disproportionately spend time as caregivers, but we know from all sorts of other data that people victimize those they have power over.  They do it when they think they will get away with it.Normal people will even take action they think kills another human being, just because someone tells them to.  See the Milgram Experiment, which has been replicated over and over again.  Not just a few, but a supermajority.There was also massive popular support for the Iraq war and killing of civilians.

These are just a few of the many memorable masacres that have occurred THIS YEAR ALONE. Closing our eyes to the problem isn't making anything better. Something must be done. That is no longer to question. Regulation can have quite an impact. Take the reforms that swept through Australia in the 90s, for instance. They went through something quite similar and we can learn from their response. Please. Read: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1730132/pdf/v010p00280.pdfand please, do something.

He's the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head at a massacre in Tucson, Arizona, in January 2011. Here's what he said:I just woke up in my hotel room in Beijing, China, to learn that another mass shooting has taken place - this time at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and the entire community of Newtown, CT. I just spoke to Gabby, and she sends her prayers from Tucson.As we mourn, we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right. This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws - and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America.
