Not right at this moment of course, I still have some growing up to do and become financially/emotionally stable. My father always told me that I was and am the best part of his life, to have a child and watch as he/she grows into an adult, all of the possibilities that lie before him and to share in his achievements. It must be a truly beautiful thing. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNYU student's documenting of US drone strikes reveals harrowing trend  by  dominicuin  news[+]Only_A_Username -1 points0 points1 point 18 hours ago (0 children)[]Only_A_Username -1 points0 points1 point 18 hours agoI can't, and that's what's sad.
