Better matchup. Chargers are really weak at cb and Smith has been on fire the last couple of weeks. Wallace is a good second play, but dallas has great cbs.

Miles austin is almost a must start since dez might not play, and even if Dez does play a WR with a surgery needing broken finger is not a reliable target. Definitely start Austin over hawkins.

I mean how much does it cost to do a patchy dye job for the blonde/black hair combo hes supposed to have, and some color contacts? But Tywin was so well portrayed outside his physical appearance that I love it. The Dothraki seem good to me, more mongoloid than asian, as well Renly's just handsome enough looks. permalinksavecontextfull comments23012[WDIS] .5pt PPR and .2 returns, Pick 2 WR: Givens, S Johnson, D.
