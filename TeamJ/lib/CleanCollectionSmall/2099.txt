People tend to seek out what's happening and always wanting to know the truth.permalinksaveparent[+]Mr_Ected 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours ago (16 children)[]Mr_Ected 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours agoIt sickens me know that some rich asshole is probably glowing with happiness right now, knowing they are capitalizing off the brutal mass murder of adults and innocent children.permalinksaveparent[+]Gangela 17 points18 points19 points 22 hours ago (6 children)[]Gangela 17 points18 points19 points 22 hours agoI know that some people are greedy and opportunistic, but do you genuinely believe that someone is happy because of a mass murder of children? That's pretty hyperbolic in my opinion.permalinksaveparent[+]Mr_Ected 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours ago*(4 children)[]Mr_Ected 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours ago*In this world I do believe that in instances like this some of the more twisted individuals motivated by greed have little regard for the families in these tragedies and are more concerned with squeezing every last cent out of their story than mourning for the impacted individuals. They may not be "happy" about the deaths strictly speaking, but they are probably happy that their bank accounts are growing as a result of said deaths and they will do what they can to capitalize further, which is why we will hear all about this story for the next few days in sickening detail including detailed graphics, a history of the murderer, interviews with children, etc.Maybe I'm just cynical. permalinksaveparent[+]snacktivity 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]snacktivity 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours agoMaybe?permalinksaveparent[+]AmatureHour 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]AmatureHour 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoI am right there with you. From the reporters to the head honchos. I hate to talk like this during these times, but this is why you have asshole reporters asking these kids questions they should never be asked, they know if they don't they will lose their jobs. I may not think someone is genuinely happy about it, but I mentioned in another post I bet some of them heard cash register noises in their head for a few seconds. We live in a fucked up world, not only did this shooting happen but people are glad to be able to profit from it and ruin more lives. This shit will be slammed in their faces for weeks.permalinksaveparent[+]Intr0vert  comment score below threshold (1 child)[]Intr0vert -6 points-5 points-4 points 21 hours agoYou obviously live in a fantasy world. permalinksaveparent[+]Mr_Ected 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Mr_Ected 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoObviously.permalinksaveparent[+]lwoodnj 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]lwoodnj 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoDo you know what a sociopath is? permalinksaveparent[+]Metaphex 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (8 children)[]Metaphex 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoWhy is it the fault of the media for showing this?  Isn't it the fault of the viewing public for showing preference to the news programs that air this type of content?permalinksaveparent[+]Mr_Ected 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]Mr_Ected 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoOr is it the fault of the media for manipulating people's emotions to generate more views? They are interviewing children for fuck's sake. Yes, it's sad that people are naturally suckers for this, but it's also sad that the media has to resort to this type of reporting, so they can use emotional outrage to further profits.permalinksaveparent[+]Metaphex 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Metaphex 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoOr is it the fault of the media for manipulating people's emotions to generate more views?Well, if a media outlet chose not to report using those methods, their viewership would probably decrease, and they'd be more likely to go out of business.  We as consumers get to dictate the type of media we have, and we've made that decision.A business isn't going to "do the right thing" if it means they'll fail as a result, and it's unreasonable to expect them to.  Unless you want to socialize the media, that's how it works.permalinksaveparent[+]thatoneguy211 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (5 children)[]thatoneguy211 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoNo, people are never responsible for their actions. It's the evil corporations.permalinksaveparent[+]Mr_Ected 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (4 children)[]Mr_Ected 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoYou don't think that the media uses human emotion to manipulate said humans?If someone like, say, Charles Manson brainwashes people then is the result of what those people did the fault of Manson or the ones who were brainwashed?The media is finely tuned to play with your emotions to generate a response, for profit.permalinksaveparent[+]thatoneguy211 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago*(3 children)[]thatoneguy211 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago*If Charles Manson brainwashes people then is the result of what those people did the fault of Manson or the ones who were brainwashed?Both? There's a reason Susan Atkins was sentenced to death for the Manson murders. Pointing fingers and blaming some greedy billionaire for what's on TV totally ignores a much larger underlying problem with society. The crap's on TV because people want it on TV. Pretending like they don't have a choice because of clever marketing is silly.permalinksaveparent[+]Mr_Ected 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago*(2 children)[]Mr_Ected 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago*It's not just 'clever marketing', people are completely inundated in this crap through their entire lives. Why are political parties more divided than ever? Why do people in groups like the Tea Party continue to steer certain people in the US way far to the right? As you would say - clever marketing. The same goes for the media. It's easy to get sucked into today's media because it's EVERYWHERE. Trust me, they know how to generate a response from their target demographic and it's incredibly hard to just ignore it.But you are right, both are to blame to some degree. However, I believe the one doing the brainwashing, or drug dealing, to be a bit more responsible. As much as we would all like to think we are independent free thinkers, we really aren't that complex of a species. It's easy for powerful groups of people to manipulate the less powerful among us, that's pretty obvious. Do you blame the sheep?  permalinksaveparent[+]ANGRY_TORTOISE -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]ANGRY_TORTOISE -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours agosheepJust stop.

It's just a metaphor, but it's a fitting one. Do I really need to give examples of this? permalinksaveparent[+]huxrules 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]huxrules 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoShowing commercials throughout the whole thing.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
