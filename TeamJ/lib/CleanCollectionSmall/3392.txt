The thought was completely absurd: The woodsy elementary school where Lauren Rousseau taught was more perilous than a battlefield in Iraq or Kuwait.

A secretive Manhattan financier whose private equity firm owns the company that makes Bushmaster rifles put the arms maker on the block Tuesday after the tragedy in Newtown struck too close to home.
