It has got to be better than the other drivel they are putting on. A dog isn't just for Christmas unless you are Korean.v1/comments/context/e2b4ce09-15b9-37c8-9d6a-e84da33842a8/comment/1355662007841-ab3ecb89-410d-4c49-bf65-6376de2ccb4bViv8 hours agoThis is so wrong and saddens me that our innocent children who believe in Santa are exposed to these characters.

If a Santa showed up looking like any one of those pictures then get your money back. "Santa school" is just a gimmick, a way for some dude to make extra money. Best Santas are quality children entertainers. Santa is not there to promote toys, he's there to listen to what the kids want for Christmas, be jolly and enjoy his job (and no drinking alcohol on the job).v1/comments/context/e2b4ce09-15b9-37c8-9d6a-e84da33842a8/comment/1355672739230-5e9473be-bc81-4c60-964e-6ce3e78ae8e6Geff5 hours agoAh !

From wearing the costume with confidence, knowing which toys are hot this year, how to answer those tricky questions from little kids about the North Pole and Mrs Claus, and of course how to deliver the perfect Ho, Ho, Ho everything they need to know is here. And, in a rather sweet and uplifting doc, we see that some of the Santas are from the wrong side of the tracks: Frank, 51, from Chelsea is a father of three with a criminal record; while 20-stone jobless Milton Keynes resident Steve, 49, needs a break in his life, to prove to himself and his family that hes not a failure. Could Father Christmas-ing be that chance? lessLatest FeaturesWatch exclusive Michael McIntyre interviewYahoo! TV Features - Mon, Nov 19, 2012 14:52 GMTWatch Jon Richardson clipYahoo!
