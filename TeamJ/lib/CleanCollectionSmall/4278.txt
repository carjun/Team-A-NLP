Please read these before submitting your gem:This subreddit accepts links from the reddit.com domain only. All others will be removed on sight. Mercilessly.  Comments from the default subreddits are not allowed. Please submit to /r/defaultgems instead.Links to entire subreddits, user pages, or entire submissions (self post or otherwise) will be removed. Single comments only, please!Self posts will be removed on sight unless they are discussions based on this subreddit and this one only. Do not link to your own comments please.ProTip: If the comment you're linking to requires some context, just add "?context=x" to the URL, where "x" is the number of previous comments you want displayed. For a detailed explanation on why this is important, please see this thread.Please don't include the subreddit name in your submission title.
