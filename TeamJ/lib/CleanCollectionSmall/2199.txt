I think America is the most diverse country in the world, and not everyone gets along with each other. I have a feeling bullying played a role in this shooting as well, (a student's father was the alleged gunman). It's not really something anyone can know for certain. But one thing I do believe is restricting guns won't work. It will never work, just like the war on drugs there is always going to be an underground black market for anything.permalinksaveparent[+]doody 2 points3 points4 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]doody 2 points3 points4 points 30 minutes agoI think America is the most diverse country in the worldA lot of people think that until they travel.permalinksaveparent[+]Se7en_speed 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]Se7en_speed 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoWell obviously we don't know much about the shooter.  But better regulation of person to person gun sales would keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  Assuming this person had a license periodic mental health evaluations should be a prerequisite to having a gun license.Im absolutely for the right to bear arms, I just think that concrete steps should be taken to prevent criminals from getting guns, and to prevent people who show violent tendencies from owning guns.permalinksaveparent[+]Purplethreadhooker 3 points4 points5 points 38 minutes ago (0 children)[]Purplethreadhooker 3 points4 points5 points 38 minutes agoThere are more guns in America than people.

The town where this occurred us in one of the richest if not the richest county per capita in the US. But there is still a large diversity of income levels there. There are people making minimum wage and then there are hedge fund managers all living in the same towns. Although this specific town is more rural and most homes are not that large nor for people with very low income.A reason why this shooter/dad could have been living in New Jersey is the same reason why he would have been living in CT area. He probably was commuting into NY city from surrounding suburbs. Usually if you do that from as far away as Newton, you make at least a certain amount(otherwise its not worth it) and work long hours.permalinksaveparent[+]doody 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes ago (2 children)[]doody 0 points1 point2 points 32 minutes agoNow is the time for prayers.
