I did a little research, and it's actually called a Donor Advised Fund (DAF). I'm setting one up now as we speak. The minimum to start the fund is $25000, and so i need to liquidate some assets, or see if I can transfer them in directly. This will take about an hour or two.I've set up a relief fund through crowdrise.com. This will allow anyone to effectively donate directly to the DAF- 100% of the funds donated will be pooled together, and then paid out, tax free, a little bit each year (this year, a lot, and a little less every year after) which will allow the psychologist companies in Newton resources to help the families affected for the lifetimes of the families (in other words, so long as the money in the fund isn't drawn down to 0, the money inside will grow at a rate of roughly 5-8% each year. then, if you only pay out 5% of the fund a year, the principal of the fund is preserves, guaranteeing that these families will always have (hopefully) free counseling)permalinksavecontextfull commentsI desperately want to set up a fund for the children and families affected by the Connecticut shooting, please help.  by  jpegmasterjessein  Assistance[+]rokyoursoks 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]rokyoursoks 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours ago*Hey. I'm a Financial Advisor from Irvine California.We need to figure out the names/titles of psychological relief groups in CT that will be involved in helping these families recover. And, eventually, the names of the families involved in order to pay them small income each month to help with daily life.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]rokyoursoks 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]rokyoursoks 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoOkay. There are these things called Donor Advised Funds and Charity Lead Remainder Trusts that one can create that allows any number of people of people to pool their money together in a trust. The assets in the trust grow tax free for the life of the trust, and payments out of the trust are not taxed so long as their destination is a 501(c)3 organization (nonprofit) OR named beneficiaries of the trust. So what I'm going to do is create one of these trust and accept donations, 100% of which will go into the trust.What I need from reddit: what are the best psychological relief groups in CT that can benefit from funding who will be at the aid of these families. We need to fund them ASAP in a big way.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat can we do as a community to help the victims and family of the senseless shooting that took place in Connecticut today?  by  thejoyoflearningin  AskReddit[+]rokyoursoks 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]rokyoursoks 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoAgreed. I think a donation fund on a website is a start, and donating it to organizations that work in psychological relief for the families is proper.Also, I'm a financial advisor, so I would be happy to create a Donor Advised Fund or something of the sort that, if we pooled enough money together, could grow tax free and pay the affected families income for the remainder of their livespermalinksavecontextfull commentsStill can't believe i caught Taco's shirt last night!  by  manaboiin  OFWGKTA[+]rokyoursoks -2 points-1 points0 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]rokyoursoks -2 points-1 points0 points 9 days agoThis fool definitely takes pics of his amazon prime orders and throws them on r/of .
