A young gunman slaughtered 20 small children, six teachers and his mother on Friday after walking into a school in an idyllic Connecticut town wielding at least two sophisticated firearmsNEWTOWN, Conn. (AP)  A man killed his mother at their home and then opened fire Friday inside an elementary school, massacring 26 people, including 20 children, as youngsters cowered in fear to the sound of gunshots reverberating through the building and screams echoing over the intercom.The rampage, coming less than two weeks before Christmas, was the nations second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the Virginia Tech massacre that claimed 33 lives in 2007.Our hearts are broken today, a tearful President Barack Obama, struggling to maintain his composure, said at the White House. He called for meaningful action to prevent such shootings, saying, As a country, we have been through this too many times.Police shed no light on the motive for the attack. The gunman, Adam Lanza, was believed to suffer from a personality disorder and lived with his mother, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to discuss it.Panicked parents looking for their children raced to Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, a prosperous New England community of about 27,000 people 60 miles northeast of New York City. Police told youngsters at the kindergarten-through-fourth-grade school to close their eyes as they were led from the building so that they wouldnt see the blood and broken glass.MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty ImagesBarack Obama wipes his eye as he speaks following the shooting at a Newtown Elementary School, which left at least 27 people dead.Schoolchildren  some crying, others looking frightened  were escorted through a parking lot in a line, hands on each others shoulders.Law enforcement officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that Lanza killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, then drove to the school in her car with at least three guns, including a high-powered rifle that he apparently left in the back of the vehicle, and shot up two classrooms around 9:30 a.m.Authorities gave no details on exactly how the attack unfolded, but police radio traffic indicated the shooting lasted only a few minutes.A custodian ran through the halls, warning of a gunman on the loose, and someone switched on the intercom, alerting people in the building to the attack  and perhaps saving many lives  by letting them hear the hysteria going on in the school office, a teacher said. Teachers locked their doors and ordered children to huddle in a corner or hide in closets as shots echoed through the building.State police Lt. Paul Vance said 28 people in all were killed, including the gunman, and a woman who worked at the school was wounded. The schools principal was believed to be among the dead.Michael Bocchieri / Getty ImagesA man is escorted to a car by law enforcement in connection with an elementary school shooting on December 14, 2012 in Hoboken, New Jersey. According to reports, there are 27 dead, including 20 children, after a gunman identified as Adam Lanza, opened fire in at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The shooter, identified as Adam Lanza was also found dead at the scene.A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said investigators believe Lanza attended the school several years ago but appeared to have no recent connection to the place.At least one parent said Lanzas mother was a substitute teacher there. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the law enforcement official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.Lanzas older brother, 24-year-old Ryan, of Hoboken, N.J., was being questioned, but a law enforcement official said he was not believed to have had a role in the rampage. Investigators were searching his computers and phone records, but he told law enforcement he had not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the unfolding investigation.At one point, a law enforcement official mistakenly identified the gunman as Ryan Lanza. Brett Wilshe, a friend of Ryan Lanzas, said Lanza told him the gunman may have had his identification. Ryan Lanza apparently posted Facebook page updates Friday afternoon that read, It wasnt me and I was at work.AP / Melanie Stengel / New Haven RegisterA young girl cries following a shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northeast of New York City, Friday, Dec. 14, 2012.Robert Licata said his 6-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher.

His daughter was uninjured.Theodore Varga was in a meeting with other fourth-grade teachers when he heard the gunfire. He said someone had turned on the intercom so that you could hear people in the office. You could hear the hysteria that was going on. I think whoever did that saved a lot of people. Everyone in the school was listening to the terror that was transpiring.Also, a custodian ran around, warning people there was someone with a gun, Varga said.He said, Guys! Get down! Hide!
