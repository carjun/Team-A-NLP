I've been a software developer for 15 years, and all of my best contracts have been through one or two reputable recruiting firms.However, I find your generalizations a little offensive, as my wife works as an IT Recruiter and this doesn't match what she does AT ALL, her job goes like this:Find anyone that is or might be looking for a job with skill sets a position you have needs.Interview them and test them to assess their value as a possible candidate for a position.Filter that list of candidates down to people that aren't complete morons or weirdos for the client (the hiring company) and send that to the client.The client picks 2-3 and sends them back.She arranges interviews.If the client picks one, she then brokers negotiations on the salary/benefits/etc. The more the candidate gets paid, the more she gets paid, generally.If the client doesn't pick one, she starts all over again.As for the finding of open positions, that is always done by sales people, NOT recruiters. The sales people do this:Work to get on a vendor list for a company that may have hiring needs.Maintain relationships with hiring managers at those companies.Get requests to hire and gather information about what they really want and how much they're willing to pay the resource, etc.Hand it off to the recruiters to work on.She's never been asked to doctor someone's resume. She gets paid peanuts for what she does. And she gets to put up with a lot of bullshit from everyone she works with: Egotistical developers, Picky hiring managers, Anxious sales people worried about their commissions, etc.She gets talked down to on a daily basis by developers, too. Typical "I'm an ubersmart techie" crap we've all seen at work. She's told me, but she never complains about it.EDIT: One more thing, you don't want to be an asshole to as experienced IT recruiter. They usually know every hiring manager in town, and frequently get called for references on a person. (Not used as references, but rather called up by the manager like "Do you know anything about this guy, or do you know someone that's worked with them?").  Recruiting companies keep permanent records on everyone they deal with, things like where they've been, what they're like, their personality, their quirks an demeanor, the type of jobs they like, known problems they've had in workplaces, you name it.... If you're a dick to the wrong recruiter, you could easily find yourself not getting opportunities because you've essentially blacklisted yourself as being too difficult to work with. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHTML5: Server-sent events with Angular.js, Node.js and Express.js  by  josdirksenin  javascript[+]Shark_Kicker 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Shark_Kicker 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoI'm only pointing this out because a lot of people have no idea how to structure their Angular apps, as it's not a commonly used tool yet.

There was no use of dependency injection here, and it's like the author chose to ignore all of Angular's documentation about what should and shouldn't be in a controller. Wiring up that even in a controller is a no-no.    // define the ctrl    function statCtrl($scope) {        // the last received msg        $scope.msg = {};        // handles the callback from the received event        var handleCallback = function (msg) {            $scope.msg = JSON.parse(msg.data);            $scope.$apply($scope.msg);        }        var source = new EventSource('/stats');        source.addEventListener('message', handleCallback, false);    }permalinksavecontextfull commentsNYU student's documenting of US drone strikes reveals harrowing trend  by  dominicuin  news[+]Shark_Kicker 20 points21 points22 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Shark_Kicker 20 points21 points22 points 2 days agoBut an alleged second strike which kills rescuers?FTFY.I'm not sure I buy what this twitter feed has to offer at face value.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLook up in the sky tonight!  by  sharkalligatorin  pittsburgh[+]Shark_Kicker 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Shark_Kicker 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoThe horizon in what direction?permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoogle Maps for iPhone was just released, and it's even BETTER than Android's version.
