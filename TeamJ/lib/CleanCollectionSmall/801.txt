He has huge discretion here when it comes to the actual application of the law enforcement apparatus.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNow, children in Connecticut.

It's an extended suicide filled with horrific violence.  To create that situation doesn't seem to me to be cowardice.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPresident Obama Says Marijuana Users Not High Priority in Drug War - ABC News  by  moviegeek81in  news[+]Phallic 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Phallic 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIf the government articulated a non-law enforcement response and pumped enough advertising money into it then people would go for it.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Phallic 21 points22 points23 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Phallic 21 points22 points23 points 1 day agoI always find calling shooters "cowards" an interesting response.  Like by emasculating the guys who do this stuff we can make ourselves feel slightly less horrible about it.But people in these situations just march in knowing they're going to die, one way or another.  I don't know what the fuck to call that but "cowardice" certainly doesn't seem appropriate.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPresident Obama Says Marijuana Users Not High Priority in Drug War - ABC News  by  moviegeek81in  news[+]Phallic 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Phallic 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoIt's incredibly frustrating to hear that out of the mouth of someone who surely, surely doesn't believe a single word of it in terms of it being the right choice.I find it impossible to imagine that someone of that position and intellect could truly buy into the flimsy pro-law enforcement arguments.What set of interests is he representing when he takes that stance?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is your opinion on anal sex?  by  Thunderbolt069in  AskReddit[+]Phallic 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Phallic 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI don't have any issues with it, but it's certainly not an obsession like it is for some internet people.I've had the opportunity before and just been "meh".
