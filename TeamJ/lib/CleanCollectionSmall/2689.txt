Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]wendysNO1wcheese 1 point2 points3 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]wendysNO1wcheese 1 point2 points3 points 25 minutes agoI'm all for more strict gun laws if it helps, which is still up for debate. Look at Chicago's gun laws and rate of gun homicide. But don't make this an Obama thing. People were bitching about their gun rights way before him. It'd be impossible to take away guns. There are all ready way too many in circulation, which in turn if guns were made illegal, they'd still be readily available to criminals. As they are now, and always will be. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Costas didn't see that. He had an agenda and used the wrong time to push it. Liberals, instead of being mad at the gunman, get mad at pro-gun people. It's sad. BOTH sides of the spectrum don't want to have a conversation.

Well if someone does that from drinking to much, I'd just make light of it while helping em out and saying " I've been there before" or something like that. If it's someone who keeps drinking too much all the time to the point of throwing up then make sure they're safe, but bust their balls the next day and tell them to they should curtail the excessive drinking. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPSY released a song with lyrics such as: "Kill those (expletive) Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives...Kill their daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers Kill them all slowly and painfully" in 2004...
