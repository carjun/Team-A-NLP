Nowhere did I call you as a troll. I very clearly meant that a comment like yours 'which is nothing but general critique' can turn away people who are not used to that. Some people do sit on a high horse all the time and it is necessary to maintain the illusion. I would do that if it brings some different stuff to r/India. Also how quickly you have resorted to name calling?permalinksavecontextfull commentsThanks for the awesome meetup guys  by  nashavi86in  Chennai[+]neoronin 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]neoronin 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoCan't come till Pongal again :(permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
