But teachers knew something was awry. Later, emergency workers swarmed in while parents waited, helpless.Comments10previous123next|  single pageIn another classroom, student Brooke Kinsey and her classmates huddled in their coat cubbies while their teacher read them a book. At one point, someone started pounding on the classroom door.The gunman? Was he trying to get in?The pounding stopped.AlsoWho they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootings::About 9:30 a.m., someone called 911."Six-seven, Sandy Hook school," a dispatcher told emergency responders, according to recordings obtained by the New York Post. "The caller is indicating she thinks there is someone shooting in the building."Police and paramedics swarmed the school, though it's unclear whether the gunman was still wending his way through the halls when they arrived. The recordings capture the competing tones in the first responders' words  sometimes dispassionate, sometimes heated  as well as the ringing of phones in the background."Coming at me  downstairs wing!" one responder said, his words blurring into one another. "Come up the driveway, left stairway."One responder hid behind a garbage bin on the school grounds. Another said he was staked out on the school's southeast side."Be advised," one responder said, sounding out of breath. "We should have multiple weapons, including one rifle and shotguns."Again and again, the phrase "medical emergency" buzzed over the radio."What is the number of ambulances you will require?" a dispatcher asked."They don't know," a woman replied. "They're not giving us a number."Then came what, in retrospect, was a chilling comment:"The scene is not active  not active at this time," a responder said about a minute later. "Reduce your speed, but continue. No need for further response."::At the firehouse, Robert Licata had little to do but worry about his son. Was he OK? How about the boy's beloved teacher, Victoria Soto?"Your faith kicks in," Licata recalled later, "and you hope and pray that all the children in the room were hidden somewhere, and you pray that the gunman did minimal damage."Finally, his wife got a call from a friend.Their son was alive.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Timesprevious123next|  single pageComments10Comments (10)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQTahuaya at 1:18 AM December 17, 2012                So the teachers were trained to lock the classroom door and hide the kids. I do not understand why they were not trained to move as many student desks in front of the door as they could. A shooter could shoot the door's lock and enter a room but there isn't any way they could blast a pile of desks our of the way.I've been for gun control for a long time and hope that this time the nation wakes up. High capacity clips where a pistol, such as the Glock 19 can hold 33 rounds in the clip and one in tehchamber is nuts. No one needs that much fire power to defend themselves. Carry two additional clips and a shooter could fire 100 rounds and only reload twice.How many times is the nation going to go through this? For me, the NRA is the Grover Norquist of gun control. Just as the Grover Norquist pledge signers will not accept any compromise on taxes, the followers of the NRA will not accept any compromise on gun ownership. These two groups are also strongly represented in the Republican party.Why all the right wing nuts are drawn to this party, I do not understand but at least they are all in one place and it makes it easy to know which party to vote against. To think, the Tea Party, Grover Norquist pledge signers, Christian conservatives and NRA supporters are all in one place. What a party.singfornewtown at 9:23 PM December 16, 2012                We've started a small movement trying to unite people through song in an  effort to rise above violence and fear through a hope for peace. We're  hoping to collect videos of people from all over singing "Silent Night"  and put them together into one song to be posted on Christmas. We'd so  appreciate it if you could help spread the word or participate.
