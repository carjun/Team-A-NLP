Numbers up to twelve now, at least. Real time updates thanks to User mygrapefruitEDIT: More than 20 dead likelyEDIT2: 27 dead, 14 students, one of two gunmen. Other gunmen apparently arrestedEDIT3: One gunmen thought to be a father of a studentEDIT4: Now 18 children dead out of 27, including gunmanEDIT5: Gunmen thought to be in 20s, wearing bullet proof vest and carrying 4 firearms. No word on second gunman, if there was one.EDIT6: Shooter identified as Ryan Lanza, with known connections to Newtown, CTEDIT7: Man found dead in Lanza's home in New JerseyEDIT8: Suspects mother, teacher at the elementary school, dead at the sceneEDIT9: Suspect in custody is are Ryan Lanza's younger brother roommates. No information on whether it is simply for questioning or for greater motivesEDIT10: Man killed in Hoboken was brother. Two roommates of Lanza believed to have no connection to massacre questionedEDIT11: Media says name of shooter has not been officially released. Speculation is now that the shooter was Adam Lanza, Ryan's younger brother. It is believed that Adam stole his brother, Ryan's, identity. Information is still hazy thoughFinal thoughts (11:40 PM EST): Sorry all, had to go to work. This isn't exactly how I pictured my top comment to be =/ it's eerie how much harder something like this hits when it's a ten minute drive down the road from you. I'm sure all of the information has been released since I left for work so I won't bother updating. Keep these families affected in your thoughts and prayers, as well as those families affected by the attack in China,  and let's hope we can finally find a way to keep psychopaths away from not only our children, but from all innocents. permalinksave[+]neonmonster 528 points529 points530 points 1 day ago*(280 children)[]neonmonster 528 points529 points530 points 1 day ago*27 confirmed dead nowEdit: 20 of the deceased are children :(permalinksaveparent[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 738 points739 points740 points 1 day ago (146 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 738 points739 points740 points 1 day agoThere are no words.

Humans are each born individuals with individual brains. The way someone's brain functions (free of disease or physical damage) is just the way they are as an organism. It's the same with any living, thinking creature. It will never end because genetic diversity dictates that people with this type of mind will be born no matter what you try to do to prevent it. It's hardwired into them. The only thing we can do is separate them from society, from those of us who were born with our minds similar enough that we were able to make values, laws, and culture. These individual organisms that stray from that pattern are forced out either through prison or death. If you're scientifically minded, you'll accept that this was a course of nature, and that it's going to happen anyways. If you belong to one of many major religions, you probably believe that a higher deity has set this course and that it is again out of your hands. I know this isn't much to say for those dead, but what I want to convey is that this type of thing will continue to happen because that's how the world turns. permalinksaveparent[+]0ab83a7b 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]0ab83a7b 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoIn other words, Honey Nature don't give a fuck.permalinksaveparentload more comments(1 reply)[+]RenlyIsAHomo 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (5 children)[]RenlyIsAHomo 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoAs a depressive person (with no violent tendencies so far) your comment makes me feel like offing myself is the right thing to do.permalinksaveparentload more comments(5 replies)load more comments(6 replies)[+]Twotest 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Twotest 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago45 people (38 of which were children) died at an elementary school disaster in 1927.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disasterpermalinksaveparent[+]ABCosmos 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago (14 children)[]ABCosmos 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoPeople keep saying that..

In Medieval times, all executions were public - people would bring their families and eat lunch while watching someone hang (there are many reports and paintings of this).  Also remember thousands of people would watch people in a ring kill each other just for the sport.  Many people like to believe that we are above the violence of these atrocious acts because we are more intelligent than other animals - we dress nicely, act cordial to others, and have wealth.
