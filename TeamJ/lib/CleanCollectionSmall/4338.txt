It's shocking to see how reporting incidents like this in national news sparks similar incidences. For example, in England a few years ago a suicide was reported in the news and 8 other suicides conducted in the exact same manner occurred withing two weeks. This is one reason why suicides often aren't reported. Media is important and people need to be informed so I really don't have a solution in mind. Just food for thought.

The town where this occurred us in one of the richest if not the richest county per capita in the US. But there is still a large diversity of income levels there. There are people making minimum wage and then there are hedge fund managers all living in the same towns. Although this specific town is more rural and most homes are not that large nor for people with very low income.A reason why this shooter/dad could have been living in New Jersey is the same reason why he would have been living in CT area. He probably was commuting into NY city from surrounding suburbs.

Although weve heard of Columbine, and Virginia Tech, weve become complacent, weve convinced ourselves that something horrible couldnt happen  here. We must not remain complacent any longer. Our children are affected by school violence at alarming rates, and we, as parents, educators, administrators and community members can no longer remain on the sidelines, convinced that we are immune. We must move past whatever impedes us from keeping schools safe. Conflicts of interest, monetary concerns, shifting priorities and any other obstructions must be cast aside.School safety is our shared responsibility, and we must take it seriously every day of the year, not just in the wake of senseless tragedies.Ask your local school: what is being done TODAY to improve emergency preparedness, comprehensive crisis planning, violence prevention, threat assessment management and active shooter response.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make school safety a sustained priority in this country.
