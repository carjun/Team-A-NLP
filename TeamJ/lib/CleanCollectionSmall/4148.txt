It is terrible, incomprehensible but Im going to tell you something  as we sit here at this very moment, you know it and I know it  there are liberals trying to find a way to blame this on conservatives or Republicans, Limbaugh told his audience.  As examples of past instances when such partisan blame game took place, Limbaugh named Hurricane Katrina, shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords as well as the shooting in Aurora this past summer. It may sound a little hard edged to say it, but Im telling you, there are elements of the mainstream media who are doing everything they can with their number one objective is to see if theres anything they can blame on conservative media or Republican policies or the Second Amendment, he added.
