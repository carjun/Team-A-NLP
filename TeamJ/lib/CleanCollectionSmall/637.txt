One day after Adam Lanza murdered 27 adults and children in Connecticut, before claiming his own life, the northern Indiana man was planning a similar massacre. Luckily, police thwarted the heinous crime. It adds another layer to a push for stricter gun control laws.

Meyer, 60, "is a known member of the Invaders Motorcycle Gang."  He was taken into custody after authorities were tipped off by the man's wife, who claimed he made threats to set her on fire when she fell asleep Friday.A table of illegal firearms confiscated in a large weapons bust in East Harlem are on display at a press conference on October 12, 2012 in New York City.

Police sent out alerts to neighboring schools in the area, ironically, on the same day of the Connecticut school shooting in Newtown. Armed with an arrest warrant the next day, police arrived with a SWAT team and took the man into custody without incident. While there, police found 47 guns, most of them collectibles. There was also a large stash of ammunition. Together the arsenal is valued at about $100,000. Mike Huckabee, in response to the Holly Hook Elementary School shooting, said the Newtown blame is not on gun control, but due to religion and God being taken out of schools. On the other hand, nearly 80,000 signatures on a gun control petition to Obama and the White House demand stricter legislation or complete weapon bans. Luckily the man who was arrested with 47 guns did not put his plan into action. Share this on Facebook and remember to "Like" this above.
