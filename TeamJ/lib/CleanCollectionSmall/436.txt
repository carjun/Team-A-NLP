Movies as works of art many times depict, satirize and comment on what is going on in society.   They don't create the problem; the problems are already out in the real world.   Most people realize that what appears in movies is nothing more than fiction.   What appears on screen never ever can match the violence and depravity of the real world.Artemesian: I wish people would stop blaming movies.

You might change your mind.   No one is saying mocies 'create' the problem.   But there IS scientific data to suggest a correlation between violent entertainment and anti-social and aggressive  behavior.

People haven't been complaining about those. There is direct connection between having weapons and killing, no suggestions from data needed.
