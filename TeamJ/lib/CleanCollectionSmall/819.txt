The cost of living thing is sobering - I have taken to spending occasional weekends back at my parents' house to save money - but at the same time I think it's forcing me to push myself harder and I think that's a good thing in the long run. As for the NYPD, I still haven't had much interaction with them other than at festivals and street fairs. And the radio thing... well that's why NPR exists. :-) permalinksavecontextfull commentsCensus: 49.1 percent of NYers speak something 'other than English' at home.
