I will say that many people have questions about them and the E-cig world can become very confusing very fast. I direct you to www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette We will all be happy to answer any questions you might have. There is also http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/ which provides a ton of information and generally good people. This particular device may not be for you so I urge anyone who tries it out to not get frustrated if you have trouble with it and look into other options. There are many affordable options for the newbie ecig users out there. I myself quit a smoking habit of 10 years (pack a day) just by using these devices. They do work. I have since moved onto more advanced personal vaporizers (variable voltage, variable watts etc etc), but everyone who wants to quit should give this a try. Big upvote to the OP fo this, well done my firend. Im actually gonna get in on this so that I have a kit to pass forward to someone else who wants to try it out.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEvery time I drive at night I can't believe those xenon/HID headlights are legal.
