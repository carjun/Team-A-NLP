His face has been on CNN and Fox News.  Anyone looking remotely like him or named Ryan Lanza anywhere on the East coast is in incredible danger right now.    This guy should be suing CNN and Fox News and whatever other networks shared the photo because his life could be seriously damaged from all of this.  permalinksaveparent[+]Goldenboy451 29 points30 points31 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]Goldenboy451 29 points30 points31 points 22 hours agoLawyer Redditor needed: Can he actually sue?

Look for a Ryan Lanza on Facebook. Dunno what accounts are legit right now, if any, but there's like a ton of death threats. To a guy that's supposedly dead.It might be a smart move for him to go to the police for the time being, at least until it cools down a bit. It is stupid, but stupid people might get stupid ideas if they see him in the street after seeing his picture on the TV with a "child mass killer" caption.permalinksaveparent[+]alphanovember 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (2 children)[]alphanovember 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoHis FB page was taken down now, apparently. permalinksaveparent[+]lizlegit000 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]lizlegit000 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours agoits not taken down. its still uppermalinksaveparent[+]JarasM 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago*(0 children)[]JarasM 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago*Yeah, but a lot of fakes sprung up, as well as numerous 'fanpages' - with, surprise, death threats and insults, mostly. https://www.facebook.com/search/results.php?q=ryan%20lanza&type=pagesEven more on searching for Adam Lanza: https://www.facebook.com/search/results.php?q=adam%20lanza&type=pagespermalinksaveparent[+]princesskiki 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]princesskiki 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours agoAt the time of the confusion, yes.

But when shit goes down and I'm on bad/wrong end of it, I try my damnedest to mitigate the effects instead of letting it all pour on.  He wanted it to stop, so make a comment public and that would help make it stop.I wasn't 'victim blaming', it was a suggestion to get it to stop.  Whether he attempts to mitigate or he doesn't, he has a civil case for libel against the media, and IMO he should pursue it.permalinksaveparent[+]I_PISS_HAIR  comment score below threshold (11 children)[]I_PISS_HAIR -19 points-18 points-17 points 23 hours agoAgreed.

You went to the real profile (which has now been pulled, by the way) of the shooter. Not some private, screen shot fake. Edit: "real" shooter turned out to be the brother of the actual shooter. Give me downvotes, please. permalinksaveparent[+]JesusHRChrist 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]JesusHRChrist 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoyes. The actual profile.

I'm still not convinced that screenshot was a shot from the actual profile of the brother of the shooter, though. But it's a moot point. Thanks for the update.  permalinksaveparent[+]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoYou're right.  I kept it in consideration, albeit the perspective of my comments; my comments (in my mind) were both to call the bluff (on the fake) and to also give advice on how to get people off his ass if the s/s img was legit.Since then, the profile has gone completely private, though (gives the same response as it does if you tried to go to my fb profile.)  That's not to say that this particular Ryan Lanza did that himself or if LEOs did or whatnot.permalinksaveparent[+]silverscreemer 29 points30 points31 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]silverscreemer 29 points30 points31 points 23 hours agoThe first thing I thought when I saw his facebook was, "Damn it would sort of suck if he was just some guy..."permalinksaveparent[+]sevenalive 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]sevenalive 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoI'm hearing that it was his brother now, Adam.permalinksaveparent[+]yetanotherpoop 194 points195 points196 points 23 hours ago (17 children)[]yetanotherpoop 194 points195 points196 points 23 hours agobad luck Ryan.permalinksaveparent[+]Hiro-of-Shadows 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]Hiro-of-Shadows 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoYou wanna turn some serious misfortune into a shitty meme?permalinksaveparent[+]OneOfDozens 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]OneOfDozens 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agocome on, seriously? permalinksaveparent[+]ptboi42 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]ptboi42 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours agoYes.permalinksaveparent[+]christehchris 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]christehchris 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agosome say the cup is half full...permalinksaveparent[+]escalat0r -4 points-3 points-2 points 20 hours ago (10 children)[]escalat0r -4 points-3 points-2 points 20 hours agoNot that memes are funny at any time but they're seriously not yet.permalinksaveparent[+]yetanotherpoop 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours ago (9 children)[]yetanotherpoop 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours agothat sentence made zero sense. permalinksaveparent[+]escalat0r  comment score below threshold (8 children)[]escalat0r -6 points-5 points-4 points 20 hours agoMemes aren't funny.Memes aren't funny when they make fun of a person who was accused of murdering someone.But I understand that you have a limited knowledge because you use memes to express yourself.permalinksaveparent[+]yetanotherpoop 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (7 children)[]yetanotherpoop 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoYour opinion is yours.

Are you someone whose feelings about memes I should care about? No. Do I respect that you have the right you your ignorant opinion of me. Sure. Be ignorant. But learn to use reddit's comment history to see I have contributed to the conversation with personal anecdotes rather than jumping on the bandwagon of putting some guys person information on reddit and facebook and twitter.Do I have the right to say that someone who was accused of murdering innocent children and getting death threats as having bad luck?

That Ryan Lanza is "from newtown connecticut" and "lives in NJ".  The real lanza's parents were found dead in NJ.  No way all of that is a coincidence.permalinksaveparent[+]GoMustard 40 points41 points42 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]GoMustard 40 points41 points42 points 21 hours agoUnfortunately, it appears it's not fake. What's worse, it was actually his brother, Adam Lanza, who seems to have had some kind of learning disability, who committed the shooting--- and their mother was a teacher at the school who was killed in the shooting. There are also reports that another family member is dead as well--- perhaps a third brother.That means that not only did this guy's social media get flooeded; not only did he suddenly have his name and face plastered on every major news outlet as a child-murder, but he finds out his entire family was killed in the process. What a tragic social media news clusterfuck. permalinksaveparent[+]PecanSoup 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]PecanSoup 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoThey're also reporting that the suspect's mother, a teacher, was found dead at the scene. permalinksaveparent[+]gthing 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]gthing 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoHe just changed his profile picture to a completely different pic.

Not sure if someone called him at work to tell him (I assume they would have picked him up, not let him ride a bus home) but Ryan Lanza basically got his name and face plastered on national news as a child killer, only to find out that no, it's his developmentally disabled brother who did it, who's now dead, oh and both your parents too. permalinksaveparent[+]KidCadaver 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]KidCadaver 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoWow, I didn't think of it like that.

There is (well, was, as it has now been pulled) a real profile. It belonged to the dude. It was old and it had multiple photos. Then there's this screenshot which Bosseking has posted. This screenshot is of a fake account which was just created today after all of this happened. If you visited a facebook profile and saw old photos, you visited the real one, not the fake one that Bosseking has posted a screenshot of.Bottomline, the pictues you are seeing on facebook and the news are indeed photos of the real killer. Edit: Ignore this. I'm wrong. permalinksaveparent[+]frogma 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]frogma 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours agoReal killer is likely Adam Lanza, who was using his older brother's ID (you've probably heard already, but just in case).permalinksaveparent[+]FleshyMeatCreature 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]FleshyMeatCreature 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoHadn't heard, thanks for the update.
