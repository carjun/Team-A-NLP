Especially with teachers. I want to believe that isn't true, you don't see many teachers dating 18 year olds and that is legal, but probably against policy.If the issue isn't age, but power, then it's hypocritical to allow boss and employee relationships but disallow student and teacher relationships.They are bad, that is my viewpoint. Many things are wrong with it, like grade infations or holding them hostage for sex. Or young woman having sex with the teacher to get a good grade.But I honesty can't call it rape if both parties were completely consensual. It's wrong, but it's not rape. I believe a 16 year old can consent to sex.I would say that for both genders, any match.People argue that a 16 year old can't consent, they are too immature to make a decision, that's just horseshit. They can consent with another 15-17 year old, why is it different because the other person is older?The law isn't perfect. 18 year olds shouldn't be locked up for having sex with a 16 year old. I think a lot of people can agree with that.Maybe a simple age restriction, like age of consent is at 16 if the other person is younger than 21, otherwise it's age of consent is 18.I'm glad that under our current laws, she called it right, legally it is rape. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow to avoid date rape  by  sevenalivein  MensRights[+]sevenalive[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]sevenalive[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoYou have look ^permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow to avoid date rape  by  sevenalivein  MensRights[+]sevenalive[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]sevenalive[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agohttp://www.ncpc.org/resources/files/pdf/violent-crime/daterap2.pdfpermalinksavecontextfull commentsHow to avoid date rape  by  sevenalivein  MensRights[+]sevenalive[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]sevenalive[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoMen say they misunderstand a womanswords and actionsthe excuse, She said no,but meant yes.-- From the same sourcepermalinksavecontextfull comments6456Men!

My dad had paranoid schizophrenia. We were told nothing they can do unless they do something dangerous.People only give a shit when they go on killing sprees.There is no easy access to mental health care. It's almost impossible to get someone committed or a forced evaluation. And they expect the crazy to help themselves.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan we just stop with all those DotA2 Invites ?  by  treckooxxin  playitforward[+]sevenalive 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]sevenalive 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours agoGot Dota 2?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]sevenalive 26 points27 points28 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]sevenalive 26 points27 points28 points 19 hours agoI think there needs to be an easy and cheap way to see a Psychiatrists or other mental health professionals. If these people can get help before they spiral out of control, maybe we wouldn't have these senseless mass murders.We also need to be able to force someone to do a mental evaluation or talk to someone. The really crazy people, don't know they are crazy. They will never get help because they believe nothing is wrong with them. But most have families and friends who know the truth.I have personal experience with this. It's impossible to commit someone, get a mental evaluation or do anything to help them if they don't want help or believe they need help.My dad was mentally ill, there is an increased risk for children to develop the same illness.I already told the rest of my family, if I go crazy like my Dad, put a bullet in my head, don't think twice about it.What he dealt with was horrible, what we dealt with was just as bad. We tried to get him help, we called the state, the hospital, spoke to psychiatrists and psychologists. "They couldn't do anything". That's what we were told. Nothing could be done if he didn't want help or admitting to hearing voices, seeing lasers, etc.He got worse over time. At one point, he started boiling water in the microwave. Claiming it was killing someone. He would take a laser pointer and run it up and down his head, did the same thing with a  flashlight. Then he go outside and shine it at something. He took coax cable and put it in ice, saying they were recording him.I'm glad that he didn't hurt anyone, but he could have. He was fixated on our old neighbors, who he had believed they were the ones doing this too him, talking to him. At times they were friends, sometimes they were enemies. He fired a gun in the house at the floor, we got rid of the gun.People want to focus on gun laws, we should focus on mental health laws.How many times do we see some crazy person rambling on the internet? We see it all the time, but we dismiss it. We ignore it. We want to believe they are just trolling or playing around.We can be blind to our own family.There is a difference between non-violent crazy and violent crazy. They both need help and attention.I wouldn't be surprised if this guy told someone like his mom his thoughts. I doubt he would tell her his plan, but I bet there were plenty of signs that were ignored.I would see a psychiatrist if it was free or affordable for me. My whole family could use therapy, I want it but it's not affordable.TL;DR Guns are only 1/2 the problem. We continue to ignore mental health laws. We need better healthcare, we need cheap and free ways for people to get help and speak to a mental health professional. We need an easier way to get people who don't want help, some help.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]sevenalive 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]sevenalive 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoMy father developed a mental illness in his early 40's, paranoid schizophrenia. My family tried everything to get him help, even forcefully committed. Doctors and nurses even witnessed him talking to his friend/enemy who talks to him via lasers and his brain.Nobody did anything. He never did anything too violent. He shot a gun at the floor in the house once, we got rid of the gun. But other than that and harassing our neighbors (who he had believed to be the one shooting lasers and strobe lights at him). Still nothing done.It's extremely hard (too damn hard!) to commit someone who get a mental health evaluation for people who are mentally ill. Because most of them believe there is nothing wrong with them. I told my dad flat out several times that he is crazy, what he sees and hears is not normal and is a mental illness. He became angry and didn't want to hear any of it.So the problem isn't mental illnesses are looked down on by society. The problem is they are ignored! Now my dad had a pretty good defense mechanism. A nurse asked him who he was talking to, he said God. My dad was never much of a religious man (I'm an atheist myself), he never talked to god, he never went to church. So that's obvious bullshit, but I guess they believed him. After all, there are a lot of people who "talk to God", especially when they find out they are dying.The guy who shot the congresswoman in Tucson videos up on YouTube. There was obvious signs of mental issues in his videos, but nobody cared, nobody helped.The same thing for the other shooters this year.2012 has been a bad year. The world is certainly getting crazier. Maybe it should end on the 21st. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMass Effect 3 up for grabs  by  kev___botin  playitforward[+]sevenalive 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]sevenalive 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIts not a problem  its actually comments that haven removed.

Community has won in the past, it didn't get us anywhere. Ratings haven't improved. The public isn't going to watch community because a poll says so.Best Drama: Breaking Bad followed by TWD and SoA. I havent watched GoT yet but I know that's also good.Best SciFi is Fringe, although it seems Haven has some followers.Best horror: American Horror StoryBest overall series is so damn hard to choose. You can't narrow it down to 1 but everyone tries.Best is a subjective term anyway. Is getting my heart racing during intense scenes like Breaking Bad better than making me feel all warm and happy when Community has those great moments.permalinksavecontextfull comments19 Hours ago, Community was equal with The Walking Dead.

Then meeting together again in this thread.Then you also have a redditor who lost their friend, another one knows the girl that was shot. All on the same web site. I wouldn't be surprised if someone here knows the shooter.Maybe that happens and its not as rare as I think. But I haven't knowingly encountered another redditor outside of meetups.I have seen more people randomly find people in comments on reddit than any other site. I'm not talking about location specific subreddits either.The good thing is they are safe and they have someone to talk with, who was there with them and they both know what they are going through.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShots fired at Clackamas Town Center  by  Jack_Sipperin  Portland[+]sevenalive 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]sevenalive 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoWhat a crazy small reddit world.
