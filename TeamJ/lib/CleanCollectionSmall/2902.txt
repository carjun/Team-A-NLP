The 13 victories also secured the number one seed in the Conference for only the second time in franchise history and the Division title was just the fourth ever for the team in 45 years in the league (and first since 2004).Smith earned the prestigious Sporting News NFL Coach of the Year and the KC 101 Clubs NFC Coach of the Year award for a remarkable second time in three seasons.In Smith's first year, the Falcons were one of the NFL's biggest surprises, notching 11 wins after earning just four the previous year. The Falcons' 13 wins in the regular season in 2010 was the team's highest mark since its 1998 Super Bowl season.From 20032007, Smith served as the defensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars and led a defensive unit which ranked fourth in overall defense (296.6), third in offensive points allowed (16.1) and fifth in rushing defense (99.3). The Jaguars defense also contributed to a team-record 20 interceptions and allowed an NFL-low 11 points per game on their home turf. In 2002, Smith served as the linebackers coach for the Baltimore Ravens and before joining the NFL ranks, he spent 12 seasons at Tennessee Tech from 19871998.Smith became a coach at 18, instructing linebackers while he was still in high school. He played college football at East Tennessee(19771981) and was named defensive MVP twice at his position. He led the team with 186 tackles as a senior, becoming the all-time single-season tackle leader. Smith then forged his way up the coaching ladder with stints at San Diego State (1982-85), Morehead State (1986) and Tennessee Tech (1987-1998) before making the jump to the NFL.A native of Daytona Beach, Fla., Smith was born on June 13, 1959 in Chicago, Ill.Assistant CoachesNFL SHOPFAL R.White Game Jry FALCONS WHITE99.99NFL 12 Div Champs 940 Hat ATLANTA FALCONS19.99NFL FH M Ryan Wall Graphic ATLANTA FALCONS99.99VISIT NFL SHOPTeam ProfilesSelect a Team...Arizona CardinalsAtlanta FalconsBaltimore RavensBuffalo BillsCarolina PanthersChicago BearsCincinnati BengalsCleveland BrownsDallas CowboysDenver BroncosDetroit LionsGreen Bay PackersHouston TexansIndianapolis ColtsJacksonville JaguarsKansas City ChiefsMiami DolphinsMinnesota VikingsNew England PatriotsNew Orleans SaintsNew York GiantsNew York JetsOakland RaidersPhiladelphia EaglesPittsburgh SteelersSan Diego ChargersSan Francisco 49ersSeattle SeahawksSt. Louis RamsTampa Bay BuccaneersTennessee TitansWashington RedskinsPlayer Name --%>RB Turner, 1-yd, run, TDPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 06:42 a.m.(:56) (No Huddle) M.Turner right guard for 1 yard, TOUCHDOWN.00:17QB Ryan to WR Jones, 11-yd, pass, TDPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 05:47 a.m.(14:04) (Shotgun) M.Ryan pass short left to J.Jones for 11 yards, TOUCHDOWN.00:39QB Ryan to WR White, 4-yd, pass, TDPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 05:26 a.m.(4:53) M.Ryan pass left to R.White for 4 yards, TOUCHDOWN.00:45Michael Turner TD runPublished: Dec. 9, 2012 at 04:07 p.m.Atlanta Falcons running back Michael Turner scores on a 1-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter vs. the Carolina Panthers.00:12Watch more video >InformationContact UsFAQ | Rule BookPublic RelationsJobs: League | TeamPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsInitiativesNFL RushPlay 60In the CommunityNFL AuctionMedia InfoNFL CommunicationsMedia KitMedia GuidesPlayer ServicesNFL Health & SafetyNFL Player CarePlayer EngagementMore NFL SitesNFL Youth TackleUSA FootballNFL InternationalNFL On LocationNFL Extra PointsPro Football Hall of FameNFL Ticket ExchangeNFL ShopNFL Women's ApparelLicensing 2012 NFL Enterprises LLC.
