I will use my own personal experience as an example.  One of my best friends was murdered by her boyfriend who also killed his brother.  I knew he was violent and had trouble, I saw it escalate.  I tried to talk to her and encourage her to get away from him but she wouldn't.  She just got mad at me so I backed down.  He was even admitted a mental health ward at the local hospital and let go the day before.  Now she is dead and I have to live with fact that my intuition was screaming and I didn't do enough to stop it.  That will never happen again in my life.  I will never stand by again when I feel that kind of evil in a person.  I lacked the conviction to act on my impression and told myself it was what she wanted.  I could have called the police, gotten her family involved, gotten her work involved (he used to come to where she worked/lived) etcSo what Im saying is we ALL need to feel that conviction and act on it, whatever is necessary to stop someone.  There are always warning signs and someone always sees them.  Everyone must stop ignoring them.  We have a responsibility to make our society a healthy family again instead of a disconnected dysfunctional unit.  That is where I propose we start.  permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
