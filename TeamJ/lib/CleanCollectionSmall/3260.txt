[Related: Top 10 glittery make-up palettes]"For the day, keep the glitter simple," suggests Chase Aston, international make up artist at the Body Shop. [Related: Get your Christmas party look sorted with our pick of the best dresses around]"Apply it as an accent colour along the top lash-line. Doing this will make the eyes pop, but won't appear too Burlesque!"Nights out are the best time to try out new glitter-inspired looks - Chase suggests using glittery make up to create your very own twist on the trend for colour blocking. Christmas make up: Check out our best beauty buys to achieve the look"For the evening, glitter can be applied to the lids as a block of colour for an edgy effect," he explains. "Go for vibrant blues, greens and purples, deep plums and silver glitter-infused blacks on the top lids. Sweep gold or silver onto the inner corners of the eyes and along the brow bone. "Keep the brows groomed and defined and avoid glitter mascara as this can be an overload. Instead, apply lashings of black mascara onto both the top and bottom lashes."A precious pop of colourDon't be afraid to experiment - Chase suggests opting for jewel tones, which are going to be huge in 2013. "For an intense party look, vibrant blues, dazzling emerald greens, deep purples, golds, bronzes and silvers always work best - just remember to use contrasting shades to your natural eye-colour."

"A firm flat eye-shadow brush is the best way to apply loose glitter powder as you can control the glitter easier for precision application," explains Chase. "Never use a soft or fluffy shadow blender brush as this can spread the loose glitter shadow all over the eye and cheek area."Primed and readyGlittery make up isn't just tricky to apply - it's also incredibly tricky to keep in place, which is why a good primer is such an essential piece of kit. "Apply an eye shadow primer to the lids first before applying glitter eye shadow," says Chase. "I always use Urban Decay's Eye-Shadow primer Potion in Nude. For loose glitter powders and shimmer, smooth a tone-free and fragrance-free lip balm onto the lids, then press the glitter on. So how else can we incorporate glitter into our make up routine? If the thought of wearing glittery eye shadows sounds too daunting, there are plenty of other options. "The easiest way to introduce and wear glitter during the day and into the night is on the nails," points out Chase. "Glitter nail varnish always looks edgy and sexy. Top Shop's nail varnish in Panther and NARS Night Series Varnish are both fabulously dark, edgy, sexy glitter hues. Rimmel's Precious Stones are full-on glitter colours with a fabulous selection of shades, and for the fun and frivolous, I love OPI's The Living Daylights.Finally, remember that shimmer and glitter are two very different things. While a heavy-handed approach to shimmering make up won't necessarily end in disaster, dousing yourself in glitter is never a good idea. "Unlike shimmer, which is sheerer in texture won't reflect as much light, glitter particles are much bigger, so they attract and reflect more light," explains Chase. "When applying and layering glitter shadows, keep the colour combinations simple using two key shades maximum. Never overload glitter hues as the end result can appear too theatrical." And looking like an extra from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is never, ever going to be a good look....Top glitter products for Christmas:OPI The Living Daylights nail polish, 11, www.lookfantastic.comNARS Night Breed Eye Shadow, 17, www.narscosmetics.co.ukMAC All That Glitters Eye Shadow 12, www.maccosmetics.co.ukThe Body Shop Super Volume Mascara, 10, www.thebodyshop.co.ukThe Body Shop Smudger Brush, 9, www.thebodyshop.co.ukMax Factor Glossfinity Nail Polish in Midnight Bronze, 5.99, BootsMaybelline Color Sensational Popstick in Pink Sugar, 7.19, SuperdrugEssie Leading Lady nail polish, 7.99, Superdrug @YLifestyleUK on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook  All Comments                        44 commentsPopular NowNewestOldestMost Repliedv1/comments/context/e44614af-d1c3-390f-915c-ac171e6f21de/comment/1355650024320-e3c42984-ba37-4986-8f1f-c6b0f34c5a07Val11 hours agoI think it looks cheap, tacky, ridiculous and blinking painful if it gets in your eye. Just what we nursed need over Christmas... eye problems coming in as well as all the drunksv1/comments/context/e44614af-d1c3-390f-915c-ac171e6f21de/comment/1355645554581-2ccd542c-3f98-4c94-a088-e3fbb269f1cepeggy12 hours agoJust imagine if any of this glittery stuff, which we've been seeing a lot of lately, actually got into the eye itself.  Think of the implications. It will cause more than smudged mascara trying to get it out but might involve a visit to A&E.  The need for women to outshine all other women has become ridiculous and women are worth more than 'cheap and tacky'.v1/comments/context/e44614af-d1c3-390f-915c-ac171e6f21de/comment/1355664629268-31f30baf-dbe1-4c60-8a81-37115eb432f5allen7 hours agoIt looks rubbish.v1/comments/context/e44614af-d1c3-390f-915c-ac171e6f21de/comment/1355663457104-48d05b14-ddc7-4abc-a3bf-6e256316073bNan7 hours agowon;t this glitter get into our eyes?
