Guerrero is the clear choice. He really is 'money' mayweather for taking this fight. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanelo Alvarez says he is close to finalizing fight with Floyd Mayweather | Larry Brown Sports  by  HalfZeroin  Boxing[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoYeah I agree, I'm still scratching my head as to why Floyd is considering this fight. I understand money, but still. Interestingly, Floyd has a 1" reach advantage over Canelo. If you look at Floyd's last dozen or so fights, only one of his opponents had a longer reach and only one other had an equally long reach. Just something to consider. But yeah taking on a natural 154 pounder when you were like 130 at his age? Good luck Floyd. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanelo Alvarez says he is close to finalizing fight with Floyd Mayweather | Larry Brown Sports  by  HalfZeroin  Boxing[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoYeah, I kinda buy it, but Floyd is getting older. Even though I think Floyd is a shoe in for victory against Canelo, I'd still put money on Canelo by KO because the payout would be huge. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanelo Alvarez says he is close to finalizing fight with Floyd Mayweather | Larry Brown Sports  by  HalfZeroin  Boxing[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours agoYou didn't piss off fans because they think you hate Canelo, it's because you are acting like Floyd is unbeatable. Yes he has a high chance of winning this fight and the betting odds will be high in his favor, but to say there's zero chance of him losing is laughable. It's boxing, there's always a chance anything could happen. Canelo is the biggest/strongest/fastest/youngest/freshest(and yes mildly untested) fighter Floyd has faced in a long time. You have to concede he has some sort of chance. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanelo Alvarez says he is close to finalizing fight with Floyd Mayweather | Larry Brown Sports  by  HalfZeroin  Boxing[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoI think Floyd had a legit cold/flu at the time. Even Gabriel Montoya said so on the podcast, he talked to him the day before or on the fight and said you could tell just by talking to him that he was sick. Though he didn't use that as an excuse AFAIK. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

Sometime around 03-04 maybe? I think the story is he wanted collaborate with Zildjian on a signature line or he couldn't find the right sound from Zildjians lineup at the time and went to Sabian and they were more open and welcoming. He has his own signature line, HHX Evolution. I have the 17" crash, 10" splash, and 19" crash and they are phenomenal. I've never heard such a perfectly natural EQ to a crash. You know how when you hit a crash you usually hear a 'metallic' sound? Not with these. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanelo Alvarez says he is close to finalizing fight with Floyd Mayweather | Larry Brown Sports  by  HalfZeroin  Boxing[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoIt'll either be Floyd by UD or Canelo by KO, I would put money on Canelo too because the odds will pay out huge. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanelo Alvarez says he is close to finalizing fight with Floyd Mayweather | Larry Brown Sports  by  HalfZeroin  Boxing[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoThe thing people tend to forget is Floyd is human and learns things with every fight just like most boxers do. He won't get caught like he did against Mosley. Likewise, Canelo doesn't even really punch the same way Mosley did when he caught Floyd. Floyd also won't let himself get caught on the ropes as much as he did against Cotto, partially because Canelo's footwork isn't as good as Cotto's. Floyd has a 1" reach advantage against Canelo so expect to see plenty of jabbing to keep him at bay. All that aside, I won't be surprised in the slightest if Floyd does get caught with a big punch somehow and the fight ends with a blistering combo. permalinksavecontextfull commentsColbert donates remaining $773,704.83 from his Super PAC to Sandy relief, soldier aid, and political transparency groups!  by  obsain  politics[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 32 points33 points34 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 32 points33 points34 points 1 day agoIt's satire, and there's a huge fucking difference. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI have not seen this one here...

Obviously he has some amount of talent or skill. Enough to be in the most successful metal band of all time. And even though success =/= talent directly, it's a decent measuring stick. Lars is an average drummer who has spotty timekeeping skills. I've seen world class drummers do the same thing.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsIts Time to Fix the Pitifully Slow, Expensive Internet Access in the U.S.  by  maxwellhillin  technology[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoFuck no, man, these are crusty old radio, phone and TV companies in charge of this shit.
