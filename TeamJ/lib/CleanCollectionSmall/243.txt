Newtown, Conn., recognized as a small, affluent town of about 27,000, may have had police and firefighters who knew the victims and their families.Klapow states parents may be experiencing acute psychological trauma.People are absolutely in shock right now and its something thats important because its designed to protect people emotionally, says Klapow. Parents may not be acting rationally. They may not be able to process information. They may not be able to pay attention or think straight. Its a way for our emotions to shut everything down because the situation is so horrific were not ready to deal with it. Consequently, parents unable to cope with the ongoing situation need psychological first aid, giving people the opportunity to fully express what theyre feeling as the first step to recovery.These people need, more than anything else, to have other people there support them, says Klapow. What that means is to just be there to listen, to hold them if they feel like crying, to be there if they need to get angry. This is what the grief counselors on site are doing. In other others, Im here and Im going to stay calm so that you cannot be calm.Once families let go of their emotions to a grief counselor, they should then reach out to their children, assuring them that they will be secure, and that their schools are doing everything to keep them safe.While some parents may feel concerned about their schools safety, Klapow explains its crucial now more than ever to raise their concerns to better move forward and feel a sense of empowerment over the tragic case.Its crucial, however, not to expose children, especially those in elementary school, to the ongoing coverage.Change the channel and put on something else, he advises. Young kids should not be watching this, especially the way its coming out, which is uncut, raw footage.""As a parent, what you need to do instead is communicate with your children and let them know you will do everything you can to keep them safe," he says. "Some kids are going to have concerns, and some kids arent. What we dont want to do as parents is push our concerns onto them. If your child is asking questions, you answer them to the best of your ability, you let them know theyre going to be safe. But dont force your child to talk about this right now because every child is going to feel differently.As more information unfolds about the shooting, Klapow concludes communication and being surrounded by loved ones is key to beginning the healing process.Thats what people can do for each other now, he says. They just have to be together and let these emotions play out. This is critical right now.You can reach Stephanie Nolasco at: Stephanie.Nolasco@foxnewslatino.com or via Twitter: @SNolascoFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino Print Email Share CommentsRecommendTweetRelated VideoCT Elementary School Shooting PresserRelated SlideshowFall Fruits and Vegetables that Fight CancerThe Family ChallengeChernobyl Victims Starting New Life in ArgentinaDentist Capital of the WorldShare This ArticleNewsletter SignupSign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.Newsletter SignupView ArticlePlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.You must login to comment.View ArticleFollow Fox News LatinoAdvertisementMore StoriesEscape Bid at Mexican Prison Leaves 13 Inmates, 9 Guards DeadShooting Victim's Sister Haunted by Iconic PhotoJenni Rivera's Family Fuming After Graphic Video of Singers Body Parts Hits InternetGloria Estefan, Edward James Olmos to Attend Jenni Rivera Funeral, Reports SayBotched Spanish Painting Sells for $1,421 on eBayJets Quarterback Mark Sanchez Benched in Favor of Greg McElroyFirst Photo of Marine Jailed in MexicoMexico Will Not Release Marine Vet Jon Hammar, Fate Could be in Hands of Pena NietoJenni Rivera: Teen Mom, Abused Wife & Lonely Star on the RiseMayan Apocalypse: The World AwaitsConnecticut Massacre: Evidence Found at the Scene Hints at Even Deadlier PlanSandy Hook Teacher Vicki Soto Dies While Protecting StudentsHugo Chavez Stable After Respiratory InfectionObama to Create Gun Control Task Force Commanded by Vice President BidenMexico's Drug War Made Crisis Worse, Pena Nieto Administration SaysLatinos Rumored to be Considered for Top Posts in Second Obama AdministrationMissing Latina with Leukemia Speaks to Media, Appears Safe in MexicoChiquis on Mom Jenni Rivera's Death: "I Miss You and I Know I'll See Your Beautiful Smile Again"Rivera and Daughter Had Unfinished Business," Says Former Co-Star RaqCJenni Riveras Film 'Filly Brown' Hitting Big Screen in AprilRick Sanchez: Mental Health, Guns and Violence Go TogetherMayans: They Predicted the Moon, Not the End of the World, Experts SayNewtown School Shooting: More Details About 6-Year Puerto Rican Girl KilledJenni Riveras Unrecognizable Remains Found Near Crash SiteNASA: Mayan Apocalypse a Myth, 2012 Won't be the End of the WorldJenni Rivera: A Nation MournsMayan Doomsday: Argentinas Uritorco Hill Closed After Mass Suicide ThreatJenni Rivera's Daughter Denies Affair Rumors With StepdadConnecticut School Shooting Victim Honored By HundredsUS Trucker Back in the US, Talks about Time in Mexican PrisonHIV Positive Trucker Infected More Than 50 Women, Say PoliceElection 2012: Obama Wins Re-Election, Clinches Latino VoteJenni Rivera, Life and Death of a Mexican American SuperstarWoman Sentenced to Life for Carving out FetusJenni Rivera's Remains Arrive in LA, Funeral Preparations BeginSeamus McGraw: As a Gun Owner and Father, I Feel an Obligation to Speak OutFather, 6-Year-Old Child, & Dog Found Dead Inside Van in Murder SuicideMayan End of World Hype is Causing Real Fear Among ChildrenFirst Funerals Begin for Victims Of CT Elementary SchoolMeet Miss Bumbum 2012: The Best Butt in BrazilKilled Mexican Beauty Queen Had Gun, Used as Human Shield by Drug GangSalma Hayek Distressed Over Nude Scenes in 'Desperado'Aspergers Syndrome Shows No Potential Link to  Ct.
