Friday, Dec, 14./ AP Photo/Alastair Grant    LONDON As the world joined Americans in mourning the school massacre in Connecticut, many urged U.S. politicians to honor the 28 victims, especially the children, by pushing for stronger gun control laws.  Twitter users and media personalities in the U.K. immediately invoked Dunblane  a 1996 shooting in that small Scottish town which killed 16 children. That tragedy prompted a campaign that ultimately led to tighter gun controls effectively making it illegal to buy or possess a handgun in the U.K. Play VideoHistory of U.S. gun control lawsPlay VideoSchieffer: NRA most feared by Congress "This is America's Dunblane," British CNN host Piers Morgan wrote on Twitter. "We banned handguns in Britain after that appalling tragedy. What will the U.S. do? Inaction not an option."  Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard called Friday's attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, a "senseless and incomprehensible act of evil."  "Like President Obama and his fellow Americans, our hearts too are broken," Gillard said in a statement, referring to the U.S. leader's emotional expression of condolence.  Australia confronted a similar tragedy in 1996, when a man went on a shooting spree in the southern state of Tasmania, killing 35 people. The mass killing sparked outrage across the country and led the government to impose strict new gun laws, including a ban on semi-automatic rifles.  Rupert Murdoch recalled that incident in a Twitter message calling the shootings "terrible news" and asking "when will politicians find courage to ban automatic weapons? As in Oz after similar tragedy."  The mass shooting in Connecticut left 28 people dead, including 20 children. The gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, killed his mother at their home Friday before beginning his deadly rampage inside the school in Newtown, then committed suicide, police said.  Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Union's executive Commission, said: "Young lives full of hope have been destroyed. On behalf of the European Commission and on my own behalf, I want to express my sincere condolences to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy."  British Prime Minister David Cameron, said he was "deeply saddened" to learn of the "horrific shooting."  "My thoughts are with the injured and those who have lost loved ones," he said. "It is heartbreaking to think of those who have had their children robbed from them at such a young age, when they had so much life ahead of them."  Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to President Barack Obama, saying she was shocked to learn of the "dreadful loss of life" and that the thoughts and prayers of all in the U.K. are with those affected by the events.  The Vatican said Pope Benedict XVI conveyed "his heartfelt grief and the assurance of his closeness in prayer to the victims and their families, and to all those affected by the shocking event" in a condolence message to the monsignor of the diocese in Connecticut that includes Newtown.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her "deepest sympathy" is reserved for relatives of the victims.  "Once again we stand aghast at a deed that cannot be comprehended," she said in a statement. "The thought of the murdered pupils and teachers makes my heart heavy."  But amid the messages of condolences, much of the discussion after the Connecticut rampage centered on gun control  a baffling subject for many in Asia and Europe, where mass shootings also have occurred but where access to guns is much more heavily restricted.        no previous page     next    1/2    2012 The Associated Press.

Enough is enough and until something can be done about the troubled people of today, this will continue to happen.How can the U.S. keep turning a blind eye? Is the NRA REALLY that strong that the politicians are under their control?Take heed people because sooner or later your children will be involved in one of these senseless crime.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  MrLiterally says: I extend my sympathy to the "globe" to those who do not have freedoms. Remember, while there is a price that is sometimes paid for having gun ownership in society, historically there has been a much greater price paid for having them only in the hands of government.The only new gun law needed in America is to maybe have an age limit of 25 years to own semi-automatic centerfire firearms. Under that is too young.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  nirak2-2009 says: I don't think there is a person in Canada who doesn't grief for the victims and the parents.I don't have an answer to the problem, but it would help if all parents sit down and think about the guns they have in their homes.This is especially sad since the Mother, another victim provided guns to a very unstable young son.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  Feeduptoo says: Why does it take the worst actions of humanity to unit us in the sincerity of collective grief for those lost to such horror? If we can globally sympathize and offer comfort to each other in the wake of tragedy, why can't we do it all the time, just for the sake of being able to do it?Who is in favor of these despicable acts? Certainly none who are rational and loving. That actually is the majority of humanity. Why isn't it our rallying pillar? Why do we have to wait for experiences like this to let down our guard and put aside our indifference to come together in a common cause of heartfelt sincerity and purpose to eliminate these examples of what is worst about the terror a few of us are capable of?Do we really need to wait until we have real life suffering that we can imagine happening to us, because the potential is always there, before we are willing to end the carnage? Yes, we have both an obligation and a responsibility to protect the innocent where ever and when ever we cam, whether it is in the US, Scotland, Mexico, Pakistan, Afghanistan and everywhere injustice slaughters the just and the innocent. We have to act, not just sympathize for this evil to diminish. JMHO.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  travelers345 says: UNICEF and the World Food Programme estimate that over 20,000 children die of starvation EVERY DAY. 20,000 is an exponentially greater number than 20 yet you don't hear world leaders sending condolences or speaking out for those 20,000. So forgive me but I find their sudden sincerity difficult to swallow.     reply        slownews replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Are they being intentionally starved?
