We are watching the news. We are horrified. We are all sobbing. 'm currently in one of the class rooms of the neighboring school and we're in lock down. So far we have heard nothing from the administration. We know that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook School (the elementry k-4 school). There were 2 shooters alledged. One kid (confirmed with multiple sources) is wounded and carried out of the school. The shooters are still out there, not caught. One teacher was shot.My town is trending on every major news site and it's scary as fuck. Update: 3 patients admitted to danbury hospital  by ambulance and the number of people shot is up to 4 (no ages yet). Update 2: one shooter reported dead (unconfirmed but multiple people are saying that)Update 3: One child dead. One shooter still on the loose. Yale hospital has opened a triage for victims. Update 4: Unconfirmed repoet that the principle is dead. The shooter is heading down river-side (the road). Update 5: Swatt team is sweeping the school Update 6: they've taken one woman aside and she's crying into a firefighter's arms. This could mean update number 3 about a kid dead is true. Update 7: We were released back to class. There was an announcement that said the area was safe, so we are conducting classes. I need to get back to class, so I will update later. We're watching the news, it's last period but we were forced to turn it off. One of the reporter's said,"and just think that these kids were seeing santa claus last weekend." We turned the audio off and we're all crying still.This is hell. Some kids are bawling in the bathroom, there are only 10 or so (out of 25) that remained in class). Nobody has a dry eye right now. Some kids are angry and swearing, others are staring at their feet. We don't know how to deal with this. This town has virtually no crime, we were unprepared. permalinksave[+]Savioritis 216 points217 points218 points 1 hour ago*(21 children)[]Savioritis 216 points217 points218 points 1 hour ago*"Alright, shooting's over, back to class!"...dafuq??EDIT: Just heard on the police radio, they've decided to get the kids in the other schools home.

You get people who don't always agree, groups are marginalized, anger seethes, and some are willing to resort to extremism for whatever purpose they rationalize. Right now, the most urgent conversation is the immediate either or demonization of us versus them, splitting sides. This happens no matter what and death, anger, destruction is used to push whoever's agenda best. My country is devolving into a state where there's no right or wrong anymore, just how many people you can get to agree.If anything I think these incidents are indicators of an overall trend of the general unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Happy people don't do these things. But you can't guarantee everyone's happiness forever at every moment, only try to provide for an environment for anyone to pursue happiness. We live in USA, an experiment from 200 years ago that through the generations have been built through trials and errors, blood and sweat. These are the costs and collateral damage of freedom. There are some that strive to keep the bar high but there are also people willing to kick the bar lower each day.If you are angered by any of this the very most important you can do now is do everything you can to keep raising the bar and help everyone else be there too.

The shooting, which was reported around 9:40 a.m., had taken place in the main office of the school, leaving at least one person with multiple gunshot wounds. Authorities recovered 2 handguns from the scene and are still searching the school grounds. The incident prompted the evacuation of children to a nearby firehouse and the lock down of the entire district.

I'd much rather be shot in the chest with a 9mm than stabbed in the chest with a chef's knife.Knives are more concealable than guns, they're quieter, and they're very deadly.The best defense against guns and knives is to run as fast as you can. permalinksaveparentload more comments(3 replies)load more comments(1 reply)load more comments(12 replies)[+]Oatybar 12 points13 points14 points 50 minutes ago (4 children)[]Oatybar 12 points13 points14 points 50 minutes agoI'm amazed that the talk after these events is always about guns and rarely about mental illness. permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 9 points10 points11 points 47 minutes ago (2 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 9 points10 points11 points 47 minutes agoI have a feeling that America's health care system is more at blame than America's gun culture.If we had a different culture, one that was more caring, and took care of people's health, and didn't make fun of people with mental illnesses, didn't ostracize them, I think we'd be in a much better place.So many people are afraid of seeking mental health care because they don't want to be labeled as "crazy".

It's what happened in 1973.There is apparently a correlation between abortion and crime rate. Legalizing abortion means that fewer children of lesser means and/or less capable parents, which means that there are fewer children at higher risk of becoming criminals, which means a lower crime rate in general. With Roe v. Wade being decided in 1973, you only start to see the impact in the early 1990s, when those aborted embryos would have become late teens/early twenties.It's one of the stories in Freakonomics (the first one). If you have Netflix, there's a documentary version of Freakonomics on there which covers the abortion/crime rate correlation.The tl;dr of it is that a few states legalized abortion a few years prior to Roe v. Wade, and the drop in crime correlates with those earlier legalizations, whereas everywhere else correlates with the SCOTUS decision.Wikipedia has a long article on it as well.permalinksaveparentload more comments(1 reply)load more comments(3 replies)load more comments(2 replies)[+]wendysNO1wcheese 2 points3 points4 points 33 minutes ago (1 child)[]wendysNO1wcheese 2 points3 points4 points 33 minutes agoWhat do the hell are you talking about?

It's been that way for a long time. The elementary school is a gun-free zone; it's not even supposed to have guns. The point is that increasing our laws in violation of the second amendment does nothing to affect crime. Reasons being that you cannot affect the lawless by legislating the law-abiding. One would think that all these guns are just going around murdering people but that's not the case at all. Our homicide rate with a firearm in the U.S. is 2.7 per 100,000 as of the most recent FBI statistics. It's very, very small and much less compared to many countries that outright ban guns. But I also want to know why these shootings happen. Why are people going crazy, hitting the breaking point, and committing these atrocities. What was wrong with the Oregon shooter? His GF and him split, he had been evicted, his flight got canceled/missed, etc. He was so hellbent on leaving this world and taking people with him that he stole a gun to do it. So he illegally murdered and wounded people, and stole a gun which is also illegal. That guy is a pretty typical case of who does shootings in the U.S.. IE crazy people. The only way to stop them is a combination of making people alert and willing to get involved when they see someone in such obvious distress (what about his friends, family, etc?). Just being evicted should put up warning signs that the guy isn't going to be stable. The other solution that works now and has been gaining popularity is to arm the lawful populace. Self-defense shootings rarely make it past local news but they happen often. I myself carry a gun concealed because I simply do not want to be at the absent mercy of one of these crazed lunatics. I suggest to everyone feeling competent enough to do so to actually partake. Even Illinois is readying to pass a CCW statute because they've tried all the bans and it doesn't do anything. Criminals and crazies keep committing murder and meanwhile their victims remain unarmed and defenseless. Like I've said before, when seconds matter, the police are only minutes away.permalinksaveparentload more comments(2 replies)[+]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 58 minutes ago (3 children)[]RogerShakenbak 0 points1 point2 points 58 minutes agoThen there will be a need for baseball bat legislation.permalinksaveparentload more comments(3 replies)load more comments(6 replies)load more comments(5 replies)[+]drtide4 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]drtide4 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoThis is so disturbing.

I expect that there will be no real clarity in this situation too.I also expect there will be a fruitless debate about gun laws. The main argument I see is, "people kill people!" but it is a lot easier and impersonal to shoot someone. Impersonal in the sense that you pull a trigger and that is that, whereas stabbing someone for example involves a lot more activity.
