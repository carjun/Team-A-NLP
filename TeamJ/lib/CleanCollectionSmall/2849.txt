(self.gaming)submitted 9 days ago by Holla-back-at-cha to gaming6 commentssharecancelloading...Instead of raging and complaining about the revenge respawns, I'd like to ask for some strategies you use that dwindle the chances. (If it's possible)  by  MrFantasticGDBin  blackops2[+]Holla-back-at-cha 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Holla-back-at-cha 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoStick to the walls, look behind you every now and then (you'll be surprised how much times you happen to find a person running at you when you turn around). But best of all, look at the map. If none of your players are behind you or near your back, you might want to turn around or place a claymore/bouncing betty down.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust finished Far Cry 3 - My thoughts and opinions.  by  Zalligarein  Games[+]Holla-back-at-cha 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Holla-back-at-cha 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoCan someone tell me what to expect from this game? I can't decide between this game and Borderlands 2. I would like an open world, customizability, plenty of weapons, awesome story, and a lot to do even AFTER you beat the story. A long story would be nice too.
