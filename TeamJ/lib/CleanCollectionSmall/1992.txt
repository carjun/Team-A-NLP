Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]junkit33 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]junkit33 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoShort of the parents uprooting their lives and moving to another state, there is no possible way the kids won't talk to their friends about this kind of stuff.  Not to mention with 20+ kids dead in a small school, odds are nearly everybody just lost at least a friend.Also, with that many shot (keep in mind we only know the death count so far, so shot will be a lot higher), I'm not even sure the number of kids who "only heard sounds and didn't witness anything" is anywhere near as high as you think.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Most of them will never live anything close to a normal life after going through this at this young of an age.  At least with the past high school shootings the kids were old enough to conceptually understand what happened.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Hobbit discussion thread  by  worffin  TrueFilm[+]junkit33 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]junkit33 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThe Hobbit is supposed to be lighter, fluffier, less "realistic", etc.  The Hobbit was written to be more enjoyable for children, whereas LOTR was aimed squarely at adults.I haven't seen the movie yet, but based on what you are saying, it sounds like the film differences between The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy are right on par with the books.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGang members/former gang members of reddit, what did you do for gang initiation?  by  BellyButtonLindtin  AskReddit[+]junkit33 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]junkit33 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThe kind of person who gets off on that sort of stuff would still probably prefer a safer environment, and particularly one that didn't end up in gang membership.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRacist Picks a Fight with a Cage Fighting Champion.

You're also giving up your entire life and family because you could never come back to the area.  But yes, if you're willing to press the reset button on life, then fleeing the area certainly seems like the most logical choice for leaving a gang.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGang members/former gang members of reddit, what did you do for gang initiation?  by  BellyButtonLindtin  AskReddit[+]junkit33 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]junkit33 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoYou're not going to survive that short of pure luck or terrible shooting.  At best you're going to take a couple of bullets in your legs/arms if you're really lucky.I'm relatively certain they don't use industrial thick steel reinforced meat locker type fridges.  Probably just your standard Frigidaire, which has a pretty thin door/walls.  And barely enough room for you to cramp into.permalinksavecontextfull commentsArnold Schwarzenegger: I always tell my accountant, If youre in doubt about taxes, pay more.

Perhaps they end up kind of dumb, or lacking charisma, or they are ugly, or what have you.What you can do, however, is find one later in life that fits all the requirements.It's a highly implausible scenario in this day and age, yes, but it's possible, and that's why the rule exists.permalinksavecontextfull commentsArnold Schwarzenegger: I always tell my accountant, If youre in doubt about taxes, pay more.

A child growing up in America is going to have an attachment/allegiance to America that somebody born and raised in another country wouldn't have.  And some kind of crazy brainwashing scheme is more likely to make a kid odd/crazy rather than viable presidential material.I only think it works if you have some James Bond type who is a near-flawless human being that is 100% loyal to their country.  Basically somebody who could win the presidency of their own country, but angles for the American presidency instead.  You can't predict that - you can only find it later in life.permalinksavecontextfull commentsArnold Schwarzenegger: I always tell my accountant, If youre in doubt about taxes, pay more.

With the end game, of course, being to make favorable decisions for his original country.permalinksavecontextfull commentsArnold Schwarzenegger: I always tell my accountant, If youre in doubt about taxes, pay more.

The 35 year old age itself is arbitrary, but you need to pick something.  As it is, the average life expectancy back then was about half of what it is today, and the point was more to have somebody "old and wise".  As it is, a 35 year old in office would be very young...permalinksavecontextfull commentsfyasko11 explains how a canvas with four dots in the corner is relevant art  by  Motivated_nullin  DepthHub[+]junkit33 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]junkit33 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI'm hoping that this isn' the mass perception regarding what I said. It's certainly what I took away from it.Your argument is essentially that people within a small niche pocket (artistic academia) would understand this painting in a way that others couldn't.  That would be a legitimate and valid belief from an insider's perspective.  From an outsider's perspective, that belief only exists so long as the insiders believe it.  Which, in essence, is an "emperor's new clothes" situation.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIts Time to Fix the Pitifully Slow, Expensive Internet Access in the U.S.  by  maxwellhillin  technology[+]junkit33 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]junkit33 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoTexting fees are already starting to go away.  The "standard" plans for smartphones nowadays from the major carriers are moving towards unlimited phone/texting and really just variably charging you for the amount of data you use.The prevalence of smartphones and app stores full of data-based messaging apps would otherwise kill off texting before long if they kept charging 10 cents/message or whatever for SMS.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsVigilante punishes woman for littering, in his own way...  by  BlueElephantsin  JusticePorn[+]junkit33 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]junkit33 4 points5 points6 points 2 days agoYes, because a caped cruisader throwing a bucket of water on you for littering lurks behind every corner...At most she'll remember to roll her window up after littering when stopped at a downtown intersection.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFrenchFuck accurately explains the societal pressures of being expected to "man up" and how deeply misunderstood masculinity is.  by  rafikkiin  DepthHub[+]junkit33 22 points23 points24 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]junkit33 22 points23 points24 points 2 days agoI think you nailed it better than anyone in this or that thread.  Everyone has societal ideals that are unobtainable, and there is nothing that can be done about them.  Why?  Because it's a hydra - if you cut off one head, more simply grow in its place.  For better or worse inherent human nature is to strive for unobtainable perfection.  You can either accept that, or spend your life in a futile effort to fight against it.permalinksavecontextfull comments"If you want to get a job at the very best law firm, investment bank, or consultancy, heres what you do: 1.
