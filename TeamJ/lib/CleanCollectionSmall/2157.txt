Home invasions, burglaries etcThats not the scenario here. Here we have someone who wants to take as many lives as possible or end his life and drag some people with himOverseas, especially in Europe, these types of burglaies result in homeowners often being held hostage and sometimes killed in their own homes.Ah... no. What are you talking about? I am from Europe. In Germany, armed robberies of private homes where people get hurt happen so rarely that it would be a headliner in the news. I can't remember any case of this or even a case where hostages were taken.

"neonazi" is almost used interchangeably with "nazi" when referring to a member of the far right movement in Germany. And again you're right, good thing they're in jail.

But what they want in the end is determined by what society already has, what their kindergarten buddies already have, by what is advertised. And advertised is stuff that culture industry has found out brings the most profit. So I think it's a ping pong game, pink & blue is offered by the toy companies because they make money from it, adressing it especially to girls & boys, but this can only be upheld by parents whose kids identify with this stuff because they saw an ad on television. To break this vicious cycle I see no other possibility to influence consume behavior by political campaigns, because adressing toy companies would be futile since one would have to change the economic principle thenpermalinksavecontextfull commentsLittle Girl Getting Pissed Off About Pink Toys. - (gender roles)  by  readit_getitin  videos[+]maybeadayoff 3 points4 points5 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]maybeadayoff 3 points4 points5 points 15 days agoFrom the comments there: "This is nothing more then an attack on men for being men.

All of them demand the will to change.I totally agree with that. The problem with bio-fuel on the other hand is: If we use that more and more for our combustion engines that are used in traffic and industry, it requires a reasonable amount of land change - from forest to agriculture, which in turn would have a driving effect on anthropogeneous climate change (deforestation is the second major cause of anth. CO2-rise, after the emission). So I think supplying every combustion engine with bio-fuel could be a zero-sum game or at least not have a significant positive impact - after all I don't have numbers on that. A solution that I see, and your comment points in that direction as well, is a mixture of innovative technologies and personal change of the way we live, for example, we could begin to replace combustion engines in traffic with E-engines, while most of the remaining ones use bio fuel. Simultaneously everyone has to think more thoroughly whether it's necessary to use his/her car, while with our own consumer behaviour we can reduce CO2 emissions of the industry.That or...
