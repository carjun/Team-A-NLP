At least 27 dead in an elementary school in Connecticut. Death is tragic, murder is horrendous, but when it involves children, especially children at such a tender age, how are we as people supposed to respond?I cannot imagine the heartache the community is experiencing. My heart breaks for those affected by this unimaginable act of evil, and Im not in the community, or even the state. Im only a spectator across the country watching as this unfolds before our eyes.One gunman is dead, and the hunt for the second coward is going on. I call him a coward because no man, or woman, who had any sense of courage and decency, would have committed such an atrocity on such a helpless group. I can only hope that when they find you, you are given the treatment you deserve.Passions are running high, sadness and anger are boiling over. I speak only for myself, but I pray that those grieving for loved one find consolation in this time of need. I hope that the community bands together seeking solace in one another. I hope those who believe in a God find in Him a place to find comfort.For the rest of us watching, lets show some respect while all this is still happening. In the days to come, there will be time to assign blame, to pontificate our particular views on gun control, mental heath access, and whatever else we can think of. Today lets pay our respects to the innocent bystanders of two gunmen, who decided that their best course of action was to murder children, still at the infancy of their lives.And for those of you with children, please take time to hold them and tell them you love them. As todays news reminds us, the world is a dangerous place, and you never know when the end will come.Reports currently list the casualties as 20 children and 6 adults bringing a total of victims at the school to 26. 20-year-old Adam Lanza, the suspected gunman was found dead in the school from an apparent self-inflected gunshot wound. Lanzas mother Nancy Lanza was found dead at her home.Related articlesOfficials: Eighteen Children Killed During Connecticut Elementary School Shooting (houston.cbslocal.com)Elementary school shooting leaves scores dead in Newtown, Connecticut (news.nationalpost.com)Gunman Opens Fire At Connecticut Elementary School, Kills 18 Children (hiphopwired.com)Share this:FacebookTwitterEmailStumbleUponTumblrPinterest About joehinojosaI'm a 35 year old dietary manager at a local hospital.
