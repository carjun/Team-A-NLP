Are you one of the idiots that think this same thing would have happened with a knife?  Are you going to point to the Chinese story where 22 people were stabbed and conveniently leave out the part where there were no fatalities?I don't even want to take away your guns.  I just think it's about time we try and figure out how to keep guns out of the hands of people like this.  But you don't want to have that discussion because you think your unchecked right to own a gun is more important than anything else.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]vtron -1 points0 points1 point 22 minutes ago (0 children)[]vtron -1 points0 points1 point 22 minutes agoCan you point me to a quote where Costas said that Belcher would not have been able to kill himself or his girlfriend without a gun?  He did agree with Whitlock in saying that he believes they'd be alive if Belcher didn't have such easy access to guns.  That's a completely different statement.Also, there's obviously no need to continue this discussion if you think wanting to reduce gun violence is simply a "political agenda".  It's quite obvious all you care about are your precious guns and having no limits on them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Rational people see this situation and think, "gee would that have happened without such easy access to guns?  Probably not.  We should figure out how to stop this from happening again."  You gun nuts turn that into "dancing in the blood of the victims."  Seriously, go fuck yourself.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNot sure what to get for dad (M, 58, <$60)  by  dont-panicin  santashelpers[+]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoIf you think he'd use it, you can get an entry level beer brewing kit.  That kit and a large stock pot is all the equipment you need to get started.  It probably makes sense to include an ingredient kit too.  It's a fun hobby, but be warned.  If he really likes it, your mom may hate you.  The entry cost is low, but it can escalate very quickly.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Help] She loves music, baking, and any DIY stuff around the house.

If you like pasta, I highly recommend the pasta attachment.  It's fun and pretty easy and it makes amazing pasta.  You'll never want dried pasta again.I think the 3 piece set is around $150 and comes with the roller, linguine cutter and spaghetti cutter.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGaragejournal.com has a great thread of pass/fail ratings for tools from the second largest area of contention (second only to toxic pallet wood) on this sub....Harbor Freight. Thanks to mybaggagethrowaway for pointing this out.  by  cboogiein  DIY[+]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoI'd go even further than that.  If I need a tool that doesn't have to be precise, Harbor Freight is the first place I check.  If the tool I need has good reviews, I get it.  I have their oscillating multitool (Fein ripoff) that cost $30.  I use it all the time and it works great.  I needed a rotatory hammer and HF had them for $50!  It would have cost about that much to RENT one.  I've used it probably 20 times since then and it's never failed me.  And if it does?  I'll go right back and buy another.  Now I wouldn't buy a drill press or table saw from them, but the don't deserve the hate they get.  If you go the HF expecting to buy heirloom tools, you're an idiot.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]vtron -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]vtron -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours agoOther are because there's no choice.

If you can't find it on their website, give them a call.  I had a temp sensor go bad in my furnace.  I couldn't find a replacement anywhere mostly because there was no part number.  I called Dey and they figured it out with just a description.  They may not be able to help, but it's worth a shot.permalinksavecontextfull commentsUniversity of Texas professor resigns after review finds numerous errors, conflict of interest in hydraulic fracking study  by  mareacaspicain  science[+]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThere's a difference between wanting renewables to replace fossil fuels and wanting to stop drilling.  I think most people fall under the first category, but we're not there yet.  There are people in the second category that think all drilling is bad and we should stop right now.

I know there isn't an actual answer to my question because the vast majority of deaths are not autopsied.  But without a control, how do we know anything?I'm curious as to what I'm being an apologist for?  I frankly don't care if NFL players these days are getting CTE.  They know the risks and most don't seem to care.  They value fame and fortune over the possibility of future health problems.  Just look at someone like Javid Best.  He had post concussion symptoms for a YEAR and is still trying to get cleared to play.  He obviously doesn't value his health, so why should I?Now youth players are a different story.  They're too young to understand the risks, so policies need to be in place to protect them.  The problem is, we won't know if those policies are working because we can't know the extent of the problem until there is better diagnostics.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOf thirty five autopsied brains donated by NFL players, all but one had chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  by  gunchin  sports[+]vtron 2 points3 points4 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]vtron 2 points3 points4 points 8 days agoAll I was saying is that peewee football is a very different game.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOf thirty five autopsied brains donated by NFL players, all but one had chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  by  gunchin  sports[+]vtron 7 points8 points9 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]vtron 7 points8 points9 points 8 days agoGive me a break.  We're not talking about peewee football here.  We're talking about highschool and college.  Nobody is arguing that peewee football is anything like real football or that it causes CTE.permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuestion for you very competent DIY people: what can I get to fill in really small holes in drywall/white glossy paint?  by  bangsecksin  DIY[+]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoUnfortunately, most places only offer samples in flat, so you'd need to buy a quart to match the gloss paint.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOf thirty five autopsied brains donated by NFL players, all but one had chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  by  gunchin  sports[+]vtron 4 points5 points6 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]vtron 4 points5 points6 points 9 days agoProfessional sports are at an entire different level to every other level of sportOf course they are.

When I played highschool football, the only thing they told us was not to lead with the crown of your head and break your neck.  We didn't have any concussion protocols in place.

The NFL has already changed with far fewer defenseless collisions, "hit what you see" propaganda, and much stricter concussion protocols.All of these studies are being done on people that played in a very different NFL, long before these policies were in place.  Shouldn't we give them a chance first?permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo, I saw this today on the way into work  by  matroe11in  atheism[+]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]vtron 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoWonder if it's a fear bonerpermalinksavecontextfull commentsBob Costas Goes On Gun Control Rant About NFL Player's Murder-Suicide  by  Crystalclearpoliticin  politics[+]vtron 4 points5 points6 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]vtron 4 points5 points6 points 10 days agoRunning people over with cars is also easier than stabbing people.Irrelevant.  60% of murders in 2011 were by gun (totaling 9146).  There are so few murders by car that I couldn't even find a number.Why is killing worse if the killer doesn't feel the intimacy of removing one's life?  It's not and I never said it was.  However, the threshold you need to cross to kill some with your bare hands (or even a knife) is much higher than the one crossed when pulling a trigger from across the room.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
