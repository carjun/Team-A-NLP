My point is, NYC has really strict gun control.  For petes sake, that active military guy (ignorant fool that he was) got put in jail last year for trying to check his weapon at the empire state building.  But all those laws didn't help the guy who got a bullet in his head this weekend.In other words...where there's a will, there's a way.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan slashes 22 children near China school  by  rolmosin  worldnews[+]penguin8508 -7 points-6 points-5 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]penguin8508 -7 points-6 points-5 points 21 hours agoYes; scarred with a knife, in terrible pain, suffering, and permanently traumatized, but alive.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]penguin8508 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]penguin8508 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoThere are a lot of things that go into it...It's also increasing awareness and erasing, or at least lessening, the stigma attached to mental illness.  Why don't people seek help?  Because of the stigma.There was also a really, really awesome bestof thread a few days ago about men and masculinity, and the problems that come with being a man, because they are not allowed by society to be emotion, express emotion, or ask for help.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

We're talking about increased border security to prevent illegal imports, increased police force, etc.  That stuff doesn't come cheap either.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]penguin8508 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]penguin8508 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI'm not even having an argument with you about gun control right now.  I'm acknowledging that guns allow people to kill in high numbers at a high rate.What I am asking you is, 1) do you acknowledge that people will find a way to do this regardless, 2) were people killing others in high numbers prior to the advent of the gun, and 3) doesn't what's CAUSING people to do these things warrant more attention than what they're using to do it?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]penguin8508 9 points10 points11 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]penguin8508 9 points10 points11 points 1 day agoThat was my point...that even if we put firmer gun control laws in individual states and cities, that doesn't stop people from doing it.  Let's say every gun in America was destroyed, somehow.  Let's say that happened.Does that magically erase people's impulse to kill?  Were people killing each other in huge numbers prior to the advent of the gun?Guns make it easier to kill people in large numbers.  No argument there.But do we also outlaw batteries and fertilizer, so that people can't kill children with bombs?  Do you think that wouldn't happen?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]penguin8508 241 points242 points243 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]penguin8508 241 points242 points243 points 1 day ago*I can't stress this enough, and I said the same thing when the Dark Knight Aurora shootings happened: we have to put more funding and more attention on mental illness in this country.  We HAVE to.I was in NYC this past weekend.  In case any of you don't know, there are no guns allowed in NYC...period.  20 minutes after I walked through Columbus Circle with my fianc, a man stepped up to the back of another man, shot him once in the head, then got into a car and drove off.You can take the guns out of the hands of people, but they WILL find a way to get them.  And if they don't get them, they will make them.  And if they don't make them, they will use knives, axes, chainsaws, even a car, to do what they want to do.The secondary problem is weapons.  The primary problem is PEOPLE and what is going on in their heads. EDIT:  Thank you to whoever gave me gold, that's very kind of you.  Please be compassionate and watchful over one another, everyone.  We have to do that now. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Girlfriend (22f) went crazy on me (24m) and cried for 2hrs, wants me to select other job. Am I being egotistical in my job choice, or should I go for my dream?  by  snowlaxin  relationships[+]penguin8508 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]penguin8508 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoAll right, first of all, although her emotions are warranted, her behavior is immature and unacceptable.This is what happens when you are young.  Her disappointment (and yours too, I'm sure) is enormous.  But this is what happens.  You go to college, and that's your life for 4-5 years, and that's where you are.  But then you move on.  And sometimes you move on in a way that allows you to maintain the relationships you made in college, but a lot of times, you don't.  You just move on.You do what is best for you, what your dream is, and what makes you happy.  This is the time in life that you get to be selfish, because selfishness is the only way you learn who you are and what you want.  Aller  Paris, mon ami.

It's funny; I hardly ever share my blog with people, but over the past couple of weeks, I've had occasion to do so to try to help people on Reddit who are struggling with similar problems.  Here's the link, it's two parts: http://hkb850822.blogspot.com/#!/2012/11/you-wouldnt-like-me-when-im-angry-part-1.htmlI don't know anything about your girlfriend so I am really, really throwing something out there and seeing if it sticks.  I remember when my parents used to fight when I was a kid, my father was very much like you, and my mother was very much like your girlfriend.  The reason my mother behaved this way was because 1) she wasn't getting the validation she needed/wanted from my father and 2) she was scared to death of being abandoned.  Do you think that something like that may be going through your girlfriend's head?As I said...I really think both of you reading that blog entry is going to help you understand your own anger, and her understand your anger as well.  In a fight, it is a very difficult thing to speak out of love and consideration when you're pissed off as fuck.  But the next time this happens, try very hard to take a deep breath and say: "(Whatever her name is), I understand that you're upset right now.  I want you to know that our relationship means a lot to me and I want to work out this issue with you.  But right now, I'm upset too, and my mind is not in a place where I can talk this over with you rationally.  I am afraid I am going to say something to you that I don't mean and that will hurt you, out of anger, which will make things worse.  I love you.  Can I please take ten minutes to myself to get a handle on my anger so that we can talk like adults to each other?"Ten minutes.  Just take ten minutes.  Set the timer on the oven, or the microwave, or whatever.  You see, when you leave someone who is afraid of being left, without any indication of when you'll be back, it sends them into a frenzy.  They feel completely out of control, which only fuels their own anger and upset, which as you said turns your arguments "nuclear".Do this.  It will work.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat do you think the TILs of the future will be about our era?  by  are_you_positivein  AskReddit[+]penguin8508 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (0 children)[]penguin8508 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoTIL my parents listened to a shitty, talentless series of rhythmic sounds called "music".

Many drug addicts were victims of abuse in childhood.But I don't think this is the reason that all people do it.  This is pure conjecture, so please don't jump down my throat...I don't have any research to back this up with, but I really think some people have a higher threshold for stimulation than others.  In other words, I think the normal everyday might not be enough for some people, so they need to achieve that "higher level" of consciousness to feel anything.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCalling all Parents of Reddit!
