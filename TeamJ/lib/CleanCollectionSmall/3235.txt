The debate looked more like a shouting match between some well-dressed frightened children pointing fingers instead of reasoning for a solution. With the Connecticut shootings still fresh in the minds of everyone emotions bubbled over and at times no one could understand what was being said.With parents and caring people across the country still sensitive behind Friday mornings shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, the topic of gun control came up on Morgans show and those watching at home could not believe the turmoil stirred during the national broadcast with Michigan being part of the heat.In the wake of the horrific shootings that took the lives of 20 young children and 6 adults, Morgan asked Dulan why would he want more guns in schools after what just happened in Connecticut? Dulans answer will no doubt become the sound bite for many pro-gun reps for years to come. Dulans response to the question was If we can suddenly make all guns disappear Id have a different position..theyre (guns) easy to make theyre not going anywhere, they last several human lifetimes with minimal maintenance. Dulan went on to say, so since guns exist and we know for a fact that the only way to stop an evil person like the person you were discussing at the beginning of youre show is to shoot him or hes going to shoot himself.To which, Morgan exploded with a counter action, implying that this line of logic is part of the violent problem, The argument I keep hearing is that if everyone else was armed it wouldnt happen, its a load of total hogwash!Dulan also stated, during the interview while not on camera, that mass shootings dont take place at gun shows or shooting ranges, eluding to the fact that in an area where a number of guns are being purchased and handled there is no violence to be found, suggesting that areas where guns are permitted and accessible are safe.Here in Michigan, a bill passed Thursday by legislators that would allow trained gun owners to carry concealed weapons in schools, bars, churches, day care centers and stadiums. Many Detroiters are split on what kind of repercussions the new law will bring with it, if signed.   With stuff like this tragedy happening I just dont know what the world is coming to, I mean for the first time I really scared, I mean Im really scared for me and my children, says Clair of Detroit.Terry of Detroit adds, If  you dont allow people who are responsible to have the choice to carry guns if they want, what will be next, cant hunt?Courtesy of Darrell Clem an Observer staff writer, comments about gun control have been heightened behind the Connecticut shootings.Its hard for me to process that legislation in light of watching the news about the school shooting in Connecticut, as an educational community, were alarmed at the possibility that guns would be permitted in schools, Im just in shock right now, said Jeremy Hughes, Plymouth-Canton Community Schools Superintendent.A. James of Detroit admits, I really feel uneasy about being in a place of worship and knowing someone behind me may be carrying a pistol and if he has a bad day, why wouldnt he pull out his gun and start shooting?Canton Public Safety Director, Patrick Nemecek says that schools should be off limits for concealed weapons. We would prefer that weapons are not allowed in and around our schools.The law comes with provisions that include gun owners complete extra training requirements before carrying weapons in schools, day care centers, stadiums, bars and other places. Even with the new legislation, schools and privately owned businesses can choose not to allow carriers on their property with proper posting.The Michigan House of Representatives passed the bill on Thursday with a 68-41 vote margin. The bill was approved by the Senate in a 27-11 vote. Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder (R) has yet to say if he will sign the bill, a statement from his press secretary hints that with the Connecticut shootings still fresh in the minds of Michiganders, pause is expected.He also said these situations always must and should give pause as theyre so tragic, says Sara Wurfel, Snyders press secretary. But we cant jump to conclusions either.Taking guns away from everyone is not the answer, any person who is disturbed enough to want to take a life will find a way to do so, with or without a gun. In anything, getting knowledge is the key, having more restrictions in place while closely examining those who are allowed to carry makes sense. Extensive psychological evaluations for those who want to carry guns would help. Understanding that its an ill mind that is the danger, the gun is an instrument used to carry out the crime.The Bible is clear on obeying authorities as one would obey HIM. Romans 13:3, For rulers (authorities) are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good and thou salt have praise of the same.Tweet0EmailPrintReport Val Berry,      Detroit Christian ExaminerVal Berry is a local News/Traffic Reporter.
