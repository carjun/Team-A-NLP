The lockdown was lifted after the report turned out to be a false alarm.After an extensive police search, no dangerous activity was discovered, school officials said in a statement. Police had said earlier that they received a report of a white man dressed in black with a long gun or rifle slung over his shoulder seen near the Branchville Elementary School.A MERE 20 MILES FROM NEWTOWN MASSACRE SITE, SCHOOLS IN RIDGEFIELD, CONN.
