Science is (literally) a reasonable way that people come to understand the world, and I dislike the fact that people often discredit it. Also, linguistics is too often not considered a part of science.I reject OP's fundamentally politicized dichotomy, which positions the liberal arts in some sort of alignment with the (presumably American) "left-wing," standing opposed to science (and presumably conservatism) on the right. If we agree with OP's "liberal" talk, then we agree that OP is committing as egregious an error as the one OP is charging others with committing.Being a testable and hypothesis-based method of inquiry is not the same thing as being a science. For example, one might make testable hypotheses about elves, carry out experiments, and, given otherwise credible relationships between assumptions and observations, come to conclusions about elves. This does not mean there is a science of elves.All linguistics programs study language. Not all linguistic programs study the language faculty per se, as Generative Linguistics is aimed at doing. By extension, some linguistics programs study things other than the FL, which might not require testable methods or formal hypothesizing.Most importantly, OP needs to come to grips with the fact that linguistics by very definition spans the scientific facts of language (e.g., that there is a faculty for language, that children acquire it, etc.) and the content that language communicates because both are psychological in nature. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat My Time Gets Spent On When Playing Skyrim [OC]  by  mrMiragein  skyrim[+]makeminemaudlin 19 points20 points21 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]makeminemaudlin 19 points20 points21 points 3 days agoSkyrim?

To me, most mainland Spaniards sound kind of posh or self-important. Argentines have a similar speed of speech, but they almost sound like they're singing. Also,Canarians sound more like Cubans than either of the above.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShould we encourage our majors to go to grad school?  by  PhuckingDupedin  AcademicPhilosophy[+]makeminemaudlin 1 point2 points3 points 16 days ago*(0 children)[]makeminemaudlin 1 point2 points3 points 16 days ago*I was advised to pursue graduate school by a three other professors as well. All of these people are (obviously) reasonable and intelligent, and I trust that they have thought about this. What I don't trust is that those opposed to sending more students on to Ph.D. programs in philosophy are familiar enough with the the reasoning supporting opinions contrary to their own. Professors don't seem to talk critically amongst themselves about it, or at least not in my department. Note, I was originally opposed to the idea of pursuing a Ph.D. in Philosophy because of the lack of jobs, and I reversed my position after speaking to a professor.EDIT: I was actually advised to consider graduate school by four professors, but one of them did not teach at my university. In his favor, he is a teacher at one of Leiter's top ten, and what he told me was "I don't recommend graduate school for anyone who I don't think could get in to a top ten school," and then asked me to apply to his department. This was after I presented a paper at a conference.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShould we encourage our majors to go to grad school?  by  PhuckingDupedin  AcademicPhilosophy[+]makeminemaudlin 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]makeminemaudlin 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoI was advised by three professors against grad school, specifically because there are no jobs in philosophy.I am still going to apply, of course, because they've given a terrible argument. A lack of graduate students now only assures that the field will continue to dwindle. Departments should be fighting funding cuts by pointing out that Humanities undergrads pay the same as other undergrads, but have significantly less overhead - in effect, they make money for schools. Broadly, more philosophy jobs yields more money for universities.permalinksavecontextfull comments11234I don't believe in global warming.
