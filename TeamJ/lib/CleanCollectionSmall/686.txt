Three of the four staffers were killed in Fridays shooting and the fourth staff member is being interviewed by federal and state investigators, NBC News' Pete Williams reported. Meanwhile, state police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance said Saturday that it appeared the gunman had "forced his way" into the Newtown school. Authorities have identified all the victims of the tragedy and removed their bodies from the school.  The medical examiner continues to have work to do and will provide victims' names and birthdays later, Vance said at a Saturday morning press conference. Hundreds of mourners gathered in Newtown a town of 28,000 people 60 miles north of New York City Friday night to remember the students and teachers lost in the tragedy.

"I'm thinking, 'We're next,'" Roig told ABC News' Diane Sawyer in an emotional interview. "And I'm thinking, as a 6-year-old, 7-year-old, what are your thoughts? I'm thinking I almost have to be their parent. So I said to them, I need you to know that I love you all very much, and it's going to be OK, because I thought that was the last thing they were ever going to hear. I thought they were all going to die. I wanted them to know someone loved them, and I wanted that to be one of the last things they heard, not gunfire in the hallway."

"She has been recovering at home and will continue to be monitored regularly by her doctors, Philippe Reines, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State said in a statement. "At their recommendation, she will continue to work from home next week, staying in regular contact with Department and other officials. She is looking forward to being back in the office soon." Earlier this week, a stomach virus forced Clinton, 65, to cancel an overseas trip to Morocco, that was to focus on providing more support for the Syrian opposition, according to New York Magazine. The Secretary of State is known for her grueling travel schedule, having visited 112 countries while in the job. This isnt the first time Clinton passed out after having a stomach bug. While serving as U.S. Senator representing New York, she fainted during a speech in Buffalo in 2005 after complaining of a stomach virus.

Police found Lanza dead at the sceneSandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., NBC 4 New York reported. Lanzas mother, Nancy Lanza, was found fatally shot in her Newtown home. Law enforcement officials first reported that Lanza's brother Ryan was believed to be behind the school shooting, but later corrected their report after they found Ryan at his home in Hoboken, N.J. Ryan told police that his brother had a history of mental health issues. Former classmates described Lanza as a shy but smart student, NBC News reported. Lanza carried four guns to the school on Friday, law enforcement officials told NBC News. Two 9mm handguns recovered at scenea Glock and a Sig Sauerwere legally purchased and registered to the shooters mother. The make of the other two and whom they were registered to is not known. Two days before the shooting Lanza went to a sporting goods store in Danbury, Conn., and tried to purchase a rifle, but the store declined the sale, they say, partly because he did not want to undergo the background check, and partly because Connecticut has a waiting period, which he wouldn't agree to. Twenty children and six adults were killed at the school Friday morning.

"I got bodies here. Get ambulances." Over the next 90 minutes, police rushed children to safety, interviewed witnesses and began to piece together the details of the Newtown tragedy.

The pole is a source of community pride, but on Friday night it was also a symbol of sorrow, its flag hanging at half-staff in honor of the 20 children and six adults shot to death hours earlier. That it happened in a school was the ultimate insult, residents said, because the schools are what continue to draw young families to this quiet, unpretentious town in Connecticut's southwestern corner, a 90-minute drive from New York City. The schools and the sense of kinship they foster are what keep the place together, they said. "This is a community, not just a town," said Cathy Masi, a real estate agent whose office window frames the downtown flagpole. John Vouros, who stood in the vestibule of his Main Street bed and breakfast said, "This is one of those towns where you think, 'Think could never happen to us.'" He waved his arms out at the historic downtown, lined with century-old trees and Colonial-style houses. "It's quiet here. There's no sensationalism. We all got excited when Starbucks came. And now  Now we're on the map. How ridiculous. How awful." But Newtown is resilient, he said. "You'll see that over the next few days."

It happened at about 8:30 p.m. near the high-rise hotel's front entrance, Las Vegas Metro Police Lt. Ray Steiber said. The man died at the scene of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting the woman, who was a vendor at Excalibur's concierge desk, Steiber said. The woman was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Neither the gunman nor the victim was identified, and Steiber said the relationship between the two wasn't immediately clear. The shootings took place at the hotel's front desk, which was busy with the National Finals Rodeo and other events in town.

Experts say thats a good example to follow and parents should also allow their children to talk about their feelings and avoid 24/7 media coverage of the event. "It's really important, especially at this time, for parents to check in with their kids, to be attuned to how they're feeling, how they're doing, and to answer questions honestly and straightforwardly," Glenn Saxe, chairman of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center told The Associated Press. "For any other kid in school, this has meaning. Parents need to understand that even in surprising ways, this can affect their kids." The most important thing, experts say, is for parents to try to help their children feel safe.

Egyptians are to begin two days of voting in a referendum on a divisive draft basic law that has pitted Islamist supporters of President Mohamed Morsi against a liberal, secular and Christian opposition in often-bloody clashes in Cairo and other cities. The opposition says the constitution is too Islamist and tramples on minority rights. Mursi's supporters say the charter is needed if progress is to be made towards democracy nearly two years after the fall of military strongman Hosni Mubarak.
