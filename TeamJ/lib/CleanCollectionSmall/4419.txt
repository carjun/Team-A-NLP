Lanza also was found dead in the school.Lt. Paul Vance said 18 children died in the school and two more died later in a hospital.Six adults also were slain, bringing the total to 26.

In the early confusion surrounding the investigation, federal sources initially identified the suspect as Adam's older brother Ryan Lanza, 24. Identification belonging to Ryan Lanza was found at the shooting scene, federal sources told ABC News.Ryan Lanza soon took to Facebook to say he was alive and not responsible for the shooting. He later was questioned by police.During the rampage, first-grade teacher  Kaitlin Roig, 29, locked her 14 students in a class bathroom and listened to "tons of shooting" until police came to help."It was horrific," Roig said. "I thought we were going to die."She said that the terrified kids were saying, "I just want Christmas. ... I don't want to die. I just want to have Christmas."A tearful President Obama said Friday that there was "not a parent in America who doesn't feel the overwhelming grief that I do."The president had to pause to compose himself after saying these were "beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10."As he continued with his statement, Obama wiped away tears from each eye. He has ordered flags flown as half staff.It is the second worst mass shooting in U.S. history, exceeded only by the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007 when 32 were killed before the shooter turned the gun on himself. The carnage in Connecticut exceeded the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in which 13 died and 24 were injured.Friday's shooting came three days after masked gunman Jacob Roberts opened fire in a busy Oregon mall, killing two before turning the gun on himself.The Connecticut shooting occurred at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, which includes 450 students in grades K-4. The town is located about 12 miles east of Danbury, Conn.The massacre prompted the town of Newtown to lock down all its schools and draw SWAT teams to the school, authorities said.1|2Next Page                    More from ABC News PHOTOS:  School Shooting in Conn.Connecticut Shooter Adam Lanza: 'Obviously Not Well'20 Children Died in School MassacreShooting School Has Sterling ReputationWhy Did Adam Lanza Snap?Connecticut Shooting Suspect Identified as Adam LanzaMore Video                            Follow @abcon Twitter, become a fan on FacebookComment & ContributeDo you have more information about this topic?
