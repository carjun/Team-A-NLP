I mean, you may be totally right, but you can't tell from this clusterfuck.  Just look at the middle $ amount according to the range - it should be about $63K.  Ok, that's straight up middle class, maybe lower-middle depending on the number of kids you have.  What color corresponds to the middle of the range?  Green.  Not exactly the same green as the far end of the range $102k, but not very far off.  WTF?  Either it's a poorly thought-out "visualization", or there is some strong bias at work here.  Whatever it is, the result is a lot less useful than it could be.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNeed to install a new thermostat - has anyone tried Nest?  by  FishTacosin  DIY[+]furrowedbrow 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]furrowedbrow 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoI just replaced my thermostat, and subsequently spent some time sorting out the different options on the market right now.  The Nest is incredibly expensive.  I purchased a 7 day programmable Honeywell touch screen for $73.  Do you have a complicated, multi-stage heating/cooling system with a humidifier?  No?  Just a heat pump/AC or oil/gas furnace and AC?  Then you can't really get the most out of the Nest.  Additionally, the Nest's biggest selling point is that you don't have to program it.  Programming is not difficult in the Honeywell I just bought, and it has enough flexibility to work for most peoples' schedules.  If WIFI is something you'd like to have, then I found Honeywell's for a few $ more that had that capability.  I didn't see much use in it right now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsVisualization of Phoenix neighborhood income (via RichBlocksPoorBlocks.com)  by  AnAnonymousPersonin  phoenix[+]furrowedbrow 11 points12 points13 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]furrowedbrow 11 points12 points13 points 2 days agoThe coloring is kinda useless.  There are waaay too many shades of green.  It's hard to discern at-a-glance middle incomes from higher incomes.  There should be one color for the lowest incomes, transitioning into another color for the middle incomes, transitioning into a third color for the highest incomes.permalinksavecontextfull comments{purchased} 1960 F100 4x4.

I'm guessing its a 223.  OK motor, but parts are relatively expensive and it's awfully gutless.  If you don't mind spending $, then I'd suggest using it on a Y block Ford (292 would be perfect) or an FE motor ( rebuilt 352 or 390?).  If $ is an issue and you really want a 6 cylinder, look at the later model Ford 300ci six.  Great motor, inexpensive parts, modern transmissions will hook up cheaply, and it'll fit no problem.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNeed Suggestions. We are looking for a 2008 or newer model car (but probably not brand new) <$20,000. It needs to fit me, the kids, and all their stuff.  by  wifelyredditorin  cars[+]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoHonda Odyssey or Honda Pilot.  Pilots are actually cheaper in my area than comparable Odysseys.  With one kid in a car seat, you should probably stick to vehicles with third rows.  Hence my two picks.  Both are very similar in gas mileage.  Actually, newer Pilots (2010+) with cylinder deactivation have really decent mileage.  My in-laws have one and get 20 mpg in mixed driving.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm planning to travel across the U.S. for 5 months and I want to buy a car for $3500 or less.  by  type_mismatchin  cars[+]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoAny car around $3500 is going to need an inspection from a mechanic.  It will likely need some maintenance: brake pads, rotors, fluids, spark plugs, maybe a repair like an alternator.Frankly, at $3500 and American, you're looking at either lucking into something that works but isn't much fun to drive for 4 months, or, more likely, something that will require some work at the start, will have some significant issue midway, and will still not be much fun to drive.I'd rethink this.  America is a huge country.  Lots of empty spaces west of the Mississippi.  It's all quite romantic until you are stuck 100 miles from the nearest repair shop.  With limited funds.   And limited water...permalinksavecontextfull commentsApparently, Jan Brewer doesn't like tough questions...  by  furrowedbrowin  arizona[+]furrowedbrow[S] 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]furrowedbrow[S] 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago55% of registered voters actually showed up to vote in 2010.  45% had some dumb excuse.

Things have a way of costing more over there.  Second, not all paint jobs are equal.  This guy did a tri-coat with pearl second layer, and used high quality stuff (PPG).  Not easy and not cheap.  He also had a decent amount of prep work before painting.  I've been quoted very similar prices for a pearl tri-coat, albeit for a larger vehicle ('56 Ford two-door).permalinksavecontextfull commentsConsidering cutting back on my 401K and other investments to purchase a second "recreational" home/cabin. I'd like to hear some of your thoughts.  by  johnsthrowaway1in  investing[+]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoI'm not sure anyone can help answer this without knowing the status of your personal balance sheet.  Your debt levels, your savings inside and outside retirement accounts, kids ages and their college savings, life insurance situation, etc...  Details.  Beyond that its just theoretical small talk about nothing.  Not very useful.That said, a rural cabin is unlikely to be an investment, regardless the setting (lakeside).  It may hold value, it may not.  It may have more recurring costs than you can afford, it may not.  Again, it's about the details.permalinksavecontextfull commentsASU vs NAVY.

The Focus ST, the rumored Fiesta hot hatch, the looks of the new Fusion are pretty great.  They really need a rear drive, small displacement fun car ala the Miata/Subaru BRZ.  This won't be it, but my guess is the next Mustang will be a radical leap forward. The current Boss 302 mustang is about the best you can do with the current platform and solid rear axle.  They need to keep that 302 motor, though.  That's the best damn American V8 in a long time.  Just sounds glorious.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis is why I love cars.  by  super_toker_420in  videos[+]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoNot just the fuel crisis, but also rampant inflation.

Just as the car was modified to a point where you can question whether it's still a Mustang, so was that engine way back in '69.  Unlike the Boss 429 stuffed in the '69 and '70 mustangs, this is an aluminum version of the 385 series block bored out to 494 cubic inches.  It's likely that the head and valvetrain have been heavily modified for racing duty.Nothing this hairy was ever put in a Mustang.  The Boss 429 is the closest, but many thought the side-oiler FE 427 put in earlier was stronger from the factory and a bit easier to dial in.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
