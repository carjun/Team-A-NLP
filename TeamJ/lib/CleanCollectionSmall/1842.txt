You would actually be in a minority if you've never once chuckled at a south park or family guy episode. Some of us are mature enough to understand that this is human nature, but that it has a time and a place. I'm not going to tell you to fuck yourself because I disagree with you though. You are welcome to live life as a humorless busybody who is offended at every turn. I'll continue loving every bittersweet second of life, even the crass and offensive bits. permalinksavecontextfull commentsRay Kurzweil is Google's new director of engineering.  by  Tobisluin  news[+]socsa 6 points7 points8 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]socsa 6 points7 points8 points 14 hours agoDammit, I thought you needed an MS for all the good jobs! permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

My roommate did this to his door, ironically because my dog was locked in his room (and he was drunk). I almost didn't have the heart to tell him that all of our internal doors can be unlocked from the outside by turning a screw inside of the hole in the center of the knob . Almost. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy dog got himself lock in the bathroom...needless to say, he hates confined spaces.  by  ScratchBombin  WTF[+]socsa 32 points33 points34 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]socsa 32 points33 points34 points 16 hours agoI shit you not - this is a true story. When I lived in a basement apartment for a few weeks this summer, my beagle really seemed to hate being underground. One day, I noticed the door was cracked when I got home from work. "Silly me - I left the door open," I thought, and didn't think about it until it happened again a few days later. Upon further inspection, I found that the inside doorknob was all rough feeling, like someone had been grabbing it with pliers. "Maybe it was always like that" - I'd only been there a few days, after all, maybe I hadn't really noticed the interior doorknob texture. Once again, I decided it was nothing and didn't really think about it. Later that night I was watching TV, and I heard the doorknob rattle, which was not entirely unusual, because I have a few friends who do the pop in. But nobody popped in. My fucking dog had figured out how to work the doorknob by climbing on a nearby chair, and gnawing on it until the door opened. I guess he never figured out the storm door after that though. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDon't sleep on these Ravens just yet | ProFootballWeekly.com | Positive outlook from a writer? what is this?  by  Rabid_Snowmanin  ravens[+]socsa 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]socsa 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours agoDon't worry, Ngata will break Brady's leg, and we will still lose to the backup. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are the upper/lower limits of the EM spectrum?  by  dmanwwin  askscience[+]socsa 5 points6 points7 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]socsa 5 points6 points7 points 17 hours agoAnd the age of the universe would impose a limit on the highest wavelength as well. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I kept hearing random news blurbs on the radio all morning, and the whole time I assumed the death toll must be adults, with maybe some kids hit by accident. My brain never even allowed me to considered that some lunatic would murder children like that until I turned on the TV. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThoughts Out To Those In Connecticut  by  slntkillain  VirginiaTech[+]socsa 39 points40 points41 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]socsa 39 points40 points41 points 19 hours agoI really hate that we are the standard measurement unit for school violence.

People will always be curious, and seek out information. If anything, reddit's responsibility should be to ensure that the information is accurate, and to compile sources for that information. Perhaps we don't use names, and attempt to contain related posts to just a few threads. The last thing we need are tons of meta-commentary threads in every sub. permalinksavecontextfull comments19234Let's please not forget to pray for Omarion.

But if you ask a forensics psychiatrist, we shouldn't.  by  Rick_Cheneyin  videos[+]socsa 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]socsa 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoI think this might be along the right lines... but... I think he wanted to get away with it too.  I think his plan from the beginning may have required no witnesses be left alive. Perhaps he planned on framing another person by placing a vest and gun on them, under the cover that he came to visit his mother at work.  Then things got out of hand... Who knows... I hate to suggest that this person's thought process was rational in any way, but perhaps he couldn't bring himself to keep killing witnesses. Why would he bring a bulletproof vest to an unarmed elementary school if he just wanted to kill his mom, and then off himself?  Also, why would he go to the office first?  Maybe be wanted to make it look like he was there legitimately... Other than his mother and himself, would anyone else killed plausibly have had access to his older brothers guns? permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am so fucking fed up with our news stations.  by  Luap_in  AdviceAnimals[+]socsa 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]socsa 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoWas it Daniel Tosh who said that some parents will do anything for a SAG card? permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Sandy Hook Elementary murders will be covered on the news for weeks to come.
