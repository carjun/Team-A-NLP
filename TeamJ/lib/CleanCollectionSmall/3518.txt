Young black men kill each other every day. The problem is particularly acute in cities like Chicago, President Barack Obamas  hometown. Yet, I havent seen the president or the mainstream media shed a tear over the fact more than 50 percent of Americas murder victims  are black and nearly all of those blacks killed - 85 percent-  are young men.Nor do we see media or presidential outrage or calls for more rigid gun control laws when young black kids are heinously murdered like we do when the victims are mostly white.Neither words nor God can explain the horrific mass slayings that occurred at Sandy Brook Elementary, Columbine, Virginia Tech  University, Aurora and those to come in our future. But why dont we  hear the same pain or calls for tougher gun laws from the mainstream press when Trayvon Martin was killed? Instead, the media immediately turned it into a  racially motivated killing of a black boy by a white man. Yet there is often little horror over the alarming rate of young black men who are both perpetrators and victims  of these homicides. For years the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention has reported that the homicide  rate among blacks is beyond epidemic proportions. The CDC found as of 2007, black males age  15-34 were at the greatest risk of death by homicide.  Wheres the societal outrage over the reality that 55 percent of all federal prisoners are black though blacks only account for 12 percent of  the population, as Shelby Steele noted here?. The double standard the mainstream media shows toward its coverage of black vs. white  homicides is beyond irresponsible and dishonest. When black Kansas City Chiefs football player Javon Belcher shot his wife Kassandra Perkins and then killed  himself with the same gun, I dont remember the news media calling for tougher gun laws. Why? Is it okay for blacks to kill?At the Sandy Hook prayer vigil, President Obama declared the nation isnt doing  enough to combat tragedies like Adam Lanzas killing of 20 children and seven  adults. He added We cant tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end.  These words rang hollow for a number of reasons: First, America has never  tolerated madmen or any man or woman killing innocent people.  Secondly and  equally as important, why havent we heard President Obama give a prayer vigil  in cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Baton Rouge where blacks are  killing each other with guns? In 2010,  black males age 15-29 accounted for 3 percent  of New York Citys population but 33 percent of  the citys  murder victims. When 7-year-old Heaven  Sutton was killed June 27, 2012 by gang gunfire in Chicago, Mayor Rahm  Emanuel pledged to do something about the citys high murder rate. Ive never  heard Obama describe these killings of blacks as an endless series of deadly  shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them  children . . .their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time,  as he describe the poor souls of Sandy Hook.What the media and the president seem to be saying is when black kids die, its not a gun control thing but a national disgrace weve come to accept as normal but when mostly white people are killed is  reprehensible. Both are reprehensible and ending the cycle of violence has  nothing to do with more gun laws. Homicides committed by young black men and  white men like Adam Lanza have everything to do with a lack of parenting,  personal responsibility and/or societys mishandling of mental illness.More young black men are becoming murderers because more young black men are increasingly being  born into fatherless homes. According to the  Brookings Institute, 73 percent of all black babies in America are born to single  mothers compared to 30 percent of  white babies, 50 percent  of Hispanics and 40 percent of all kids overall.Brookings found  more than 36 percent of the unmarried fathers had a prison record, five times the  share of married fathers who ever spent time in prison. The study  also found that boys born to unwed mothers experience more behavioral problems,  such as engaging in crime, than girls.When you dont  have a mom and dad caring for you, asking you if you did your homework or  teaching you right from wrong, is it any wonder, so many young black men are becoming murderers?  And it appears that  a lack of attentive parenting also may have been to blame for Adam Lanzas  killing rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School and others like Columbine and  Virgina Tech. News reports  havent been able to confirm whether Adam Lanzas mother and father ever sought  treatment for his sons Aspergers Syndrome. Nancy Lanza told  babysitters never to leave Adam alone. But Lanzas mother may have been an irresponsible gun owner.  Although it is unclear how Lanza got his hands on his mothers guns, if she kept the weapons unsecured in her home, easily accessible to her developmentally disabled son,  that would be utterly negligent.We didnt see these kinds of horrific shootings 40 years ago nor did we have the high rate of  black men murdering each other. I think thats because we had stronger families,  lower divorce rates and virtually no outsourcing of parenting to video games and  the Internet. The rise in  young male murderers isnt about a need for more gun laws. Connecticut has some of the strictest gun laws  in the nation, which didnt stop Adam Lanza. Parents need to parent. Society  needs to bring back shame in our culture and tell teenagers its not cool to  have a baby. America also needs to do a better job of treating mental illness  like a disease not a stigma. We can have a conversation about gun laws but Sandy  Hook is about the skeletons in our culture we refuse to talk  about.

Frankly, Id like every young black man in America to be defined that way.While the recent commentary by ESPN reporter, Rob Parker regarding the young Washington Redskins phenomenon may have caught others off guard--I could see it coming from ten miles away. As an educator, I have had the privilege to work with African Washington Redskins player Robert Griffin III.(Evan Vucci - AP)American male students in a number of capacities: as a  teacher, principal, counselor, coach, and mentor. The level of raw potential that I have witnessed has been nothing less than astonishing. And what hurts so bad is so much of it goes to waste because so many young black men are trying hard not be labeled cornballs and are  living down to the stereotype of what black men are supposed to be.Continue reading this post By Alfonzo Porter | 09:26 AM ET, 12/19/2012|Permalink | Comments(0)Share:More >  Facebook Twitter LinkedIn RedditStumbleUpon Digg DeliciousGoogle +1Posted at  07:00 AM ET, 12/19/2012Holiday shopping guide: Supporting black-owned businessesBy  Huda MuminWith African Americans accounting for more than 13 percent of the U.S. population and with a buying power projected to top $1.1 trillion by 2015, this holiday season is the perfect time to support local black-owned businesses.The vegan carrot cupcake at the Sweet Lobby in Capitol Hill.(Jason Berger - For The Washington Post)Whether you are looking for that perfect floral arrangement, specialty item for him, spa package for her, vegan treats, divine desserts, unique artwork or something for yourself, we have you covered with our Black-Owned Business Holiday Shopping Guide.Continue reading this post By Huda Mumin | 07:00 AM ET, 12/19/2012|Permalink | Comments(0)Share:More >  Facebook Twitter LinkedIn RedditStumbleUpon Digg DeliciousGoogle +1Posted at  02:44 PM ET, 12/18/2012Sandy Hook teachers: Heroes all teachers can admireBy  Nathan SaundersOP-ED | The events of Dec.14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., were shocking and unthinkable.Twenty children and six adults, gunned down by a person who, at a mere 20 years of age, was barely out of childhood himself. There is little, if any, solace to be had in situations like this.There are no words we can say to ourselves that will make sense of this tragedy.There is only one thing about the horror of the shootings that I can look on with pride and admiration, and that is the brave actions of the teachers at Sandy Hook.View Photo Gallery:Shooter kills 27 people, including 20 children at elementary school, before killing himself.As the president of the Washington Teachers Union, each day I tell the public how valuable and irreplaceable our teachers are. Their importance in the lives of our children is an intangible commodity that most people spend little, if any, time thinking about.Now we are confronted with the heroic actions of the Sandy Hook teachers, who hid their students in closets and risked their own lives to usher students to safety.The work of these brave souls extended far beyond the requirements of their work day, and they certainly taught the greatest lesson that could ever be taught  how to lay down your life for your fellow man.Continue reading this post By Nathan Saunders | 02:44 PM ET, 12/18/2012|Permalink | Comments(0)Share:More >  Facebook Twitter LinkedIn RedditStumbleUpon Digg DeliciousGoogle +1Posted at  12:56 PM ET, 12/18/2012Darrel Green, Trey Chaney and other celebrities discuss the challenges of fatherhood at Reid TempleBy  Sonsyrea Tate MontgomeryPrince Georges County Executive Rushern Baker had expressed the sentiments many felt after the Connecticut school shooting that killed 20 small children in their classrooms Friday. The images of the children, educators and parents scurrying away from Sandy Hook School after yesterdays horrible event left an indelible mark on our hearts and minds, Baker said in a written statement. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families who lost a loved one to this cruel act of violence. As a father, it was heart-wrenching to see parents stand helplessly outside of the school waiting to learn whether their child was alive or not.The grief was numbing, discombobulating. But when I arrived at Reid Temple Baptist Church in Glenarden on Saturday afternoon for a panel discussion on The Challenges of Fatherhood, I immediately felt better. A few hundred men were on their feet, humbled in prayer, as I entered. They swayed and sang, many with their hands raised high above their heads. Great and mighty is your name, they sang, led by a male chorus on stage. Were in tough times, said NBA veteran (and Root DC contributor) Etan Thomas, beginning the panel discussion. As a parent, seeing the massacre yesterday was tough. Were in an evil world right now, and we have to understand that the attacks on our children are mental, physical, spiritual.I settled in and found myself intrigued by what Thomas, NFL Hall of Famer Darrel Green, Pastor John Jenkins of First Baptist Church of Glenarden, and other high-profile brothers had to say about their daddy pain and their struggles to do better. Trey Chaney, who played  the hardened Baltimore thug Poot on The Wire, former Redskins player Khary Campbell, Maryland Terp Byron Muton and poet Lamar Hill also told of their pain. Thomas wished his father was around to help him navigate racism growing up in Oklahoma, or home late at night when noises in the house required security investigation. His mother did an amazing job raising him and his brothers, he said, but he envied his friends whose fathers were present. I should not have been the one trying to protect the family. I was a kid. He visits young men in jails and prisons to address anger issues, he said. Young men dont talk about this stuff.We act like everythings all right. Thomas said he carried that anger and envy until he fell in love and got engaged. Then, he didnt want to take those feelings into his marriage, so he sought counseling with Jenkins. He also wrote poetry to vent.Spoken word artist Lamar Hill rendered a passionate poem about his missing dad. The audience responded with a standing ovation.I was impressed by the panelists candor. Id heard women talk about the ache of missing daddies. Id heard people convicted of crimes trace their waywardness to a search for their fathers love. I had not heard successful outliers express their anguish at such a void.
