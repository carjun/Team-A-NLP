We beat the Yankees and Beat the Brewers. I was on the third baseline at about midfield. I got a ball from one of the foul shaggers. This was around the time that some ceiling tiles killed a construction worker. There is no replacement for the memory of being at the King Dome and having someone throw me a ball from on the field. I have been a Mariner's fan as long I knew what baseball was, and I will be one until the day I forget what baseball is.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Meta] Can we please stop it with the "I'm leaving the Mariners" posts?  by  massThorsin  Mariners[+]Disco_Drew 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]Disco_Drew 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours agoYou aren't a fan, you sound like an entitled local.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some addons you couldn't live without?  by  Vpiconein  wow[+]Disco_Drew 7 points8 points9 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]Disco_Drew 7 points8 points9 points 11 hours agoOmen, Recount, Bartender.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

He's thinking of his own kids while he's speaking. I don't think that I would have held up as well as he did. I teared up talking to my wife about it.

The fact that they're so excited about that is the sole reason that I haven't pulled them bout out of school. This is horrible. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Disco_Drew 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Disco_Drew 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoI couldn't really find it in myself to get too upset over previous incidents like this. The Aurora shooting was sad but I could just put that to the side as it didn't really affect me.I dropped off both of my kids at school this morning just like every other day and I am heartbroken over what these parents are going through. I live on the other side of the country, but I can understand what they're going through. This is the worst thing that could happen to a parent and I'm devastated. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan robs bank to pay for wife's surgery, only takes enough for operation  by  chrisjortizin  news[+]Disco_Drew 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Disco_Drew 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoYep.
