Barton Hinkle| 12.12.12An Ideological Test for Gun OwnershipJacob Sullum| 10.29.12Sandy Hook School ShootingGun ControlGunsGun RightsSecond AmendmentBarack ObamaThe former governor of Arkansas, Republican hopeful forpresident, and Fox News host says we've got no reason to besurprised when adult gunmen shoot up educationalestablishments."We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we havesystematically removed God from our schools," Huckabee said on FoxNews, discussing the murder spree that took the lives of 20children and 6 adults in Newtown, CT that morning. "Should we be sosurprised that schools would become a place of carnage?"More here.I don't doubt the governor's sincerity, but among other things,he might want to think about the declining rate of school violence.According to data compiled by the National Center for EducationStatistics, schools have been getting safer and less violent atleast over the past couple of decades - despite what Huckabee woulddoubtless consider a period of rising godlessness. During theschool year of 1992-93, for instance, the number of on-locationmurders of students and staff at K-12 public schools was 47 (out of population of millions). In2009-2010 (the latest year for which data is listed), the numberwas 25. Over the same period, the rate on victimizations per 1,000 students for theft droppedfrom 101 to 18. For violent crimes, the rate dropped from 53 to 14.And for "serious violent" crimes, the rate dropped from 8 to 4.Next: It's never too late to blame George W.Bush...

This smacks of the Trayvon narrative framing.Also,I've been repeatedly "scolded" by several people forsuggesting responsibility lies with the killer rather than our lackof mental health funding and too strict civil commitmentprocedures. I can't recall seeing so much sympathy for a profoundlymalevolent individual before. Acknowledging the existence of evilis now somewhere between politically incorrect and sociallyirresponsible. reply to thislog in or register to replyA Serious Man|12.15.12 @ 1:34PM|#I must note that directly ties into the left-wing conciet thatpeople can be programmed, with the proper amount of coercion, to be'better' and that thus there must always be something theall-knowing Leviathan could have done to stop this. These peoplejust hate acknowledging the fact that they are powerless in thisinstance, it goes against everything they believe. reply to thislog in or register to replysloopyinca|12.15.12 @ 1:38PM|#Hey, A Serious Man, what happened to our earlier comments? reply to thislog in or register to replyA Serious Man|12.15.12 @ 1:44PM|#I think they only posted the Hit and Run teaser for the articleat first, so our comments were deleted when they removed it andlinked again to the main article. reply to thislog in or register to replyHeroic Mulatto|12.15.12 @ 1:28PM|#Also,I've been repeatedly "scolded" by several peoplefor suggesting responsibility lies with the killerIndividual responsibility?
