When I'm farming XP, that's a different story. Then it's MP0 sprint all day don't care 24/7. I switch out the LS passive for the one that generates fury and use Overpower instead of Rend. permalinksavecontextfull comments(Spoilers all) Resolved: The series must end with a Stark king or queen  by  feldman10in  asoiaf[+]sevenzig 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]sevenzig 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoDid Tommen legitimize Ramsay?permalinksavecontextfull comments(Spoilers all) Resolved: The series must end with a Stark king or queen  by  feldman10in  asoiaf[+]sevenzig 6 points7 points8 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]sevenzig 6 points7 points8 points 2 days agoAs Lord of Winterfell, couldn't he still legitimize him anyway?permalinksavecontextfull commentsA little late, but here are some pictures I got from the Eagles/Panthers game.  by  slumslumin  eagles[+]sevenzig 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]sevenzig 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoLovin' the neckbeard. permalinksavecontextfull comments[Barbarian] WW looking to upgrade and some questions  by  sevenzigin  Diablo3Strategy[+]sevenzig[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]sevenzig[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI switched to a pair of Blackthorne's for the chest and pants for the extra vit so I can manage MP8 with another barb who is using Shout>Impunity.

Stanford's defense is both fast and disciplined and they've shut Oregon down.permalinksavecontextfull commentswhy I think Reid will be back for one more year... again  by  leblancbabyyin  eagles[+]sevenzig 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]sevenzig 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoHis offense is gimmicky. I have my doubts that it will be successful at an NFL level because NFL defenses are much more disciplined than your average college defense. permalinksavecontextfull commentsScientists have identified a novel mechanism by which a type of low-carb, low-calorie diet  called a ketogenic diet  could delay the effects of aging: the compound -hydroxybutyrate (OHB), a ketone body that is generated during a prolonged low-calorie or ketogenic diet.  by  Libertateain  science[+]sevenzig 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]sevenzig 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoI think the minimum daily requirement according to my nutrition professor was 50/100g to stay out of ketosis.

The hit that got him was innocuous compared to some of the other hits he had endured up to that point. Injuries weren't preventing Vick from playing solid football, his case of fumblitis was which was only exacerbated by his o-line looking like tackling dummies.Vick notwithstanding, I'll say we've seen enough from Nick Foles in the last 3 weeks to put him ahead of Chad Gabbert, Carson Palmer, And Brady Cassel.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKen Whisenhunt on the Cardinal's QB Situation  by  runningblackin  nfl[+]sevenzig 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]sevenzig 3 points4 points5 points 4 days agoUh, what? You cannot in good conscience tell me that Philadelphia's QB situation is worse than Jacksonville, Oakland, or Kansas City. Besides, the problem with the Eagles hasn't been the QB, it's been sloppy o-line play and an atrocious defense.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Monk] Looking to boost my DPS...
