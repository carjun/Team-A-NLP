We have guys who are respectful of the Saints-Falcons rivalries and guys who aren't, just like you do.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

Rivalries, at a certain point, are equal.Comparing "greatness" is silly.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers. Your thoughts, r/nfl?  by  withnoduerespectin  nfl[+]thedeuce53 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]thedeuce53 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoBut nothing can compare to the history of Bears-Packers, and the intensity is there, trust me.I must have misread that sentence - my bad.  I thought it said "and the intensity that is there" or something, leading me to believe you were saying the intensity was greater between the Packers-BearsStill, I think your last sentence can apply to just about every rivalry, especially the Saints- Falcons rivalry:You just don't see it because you're not a part of it, and it manifests itself more outside of an internet forum than on it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

Everything else is just smug entitlement.  Besides, the Saints-Falcons rivalry has been around for 40+ years.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

That goes for the Packers/Bears and anyone else.There is a certain threshold.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

That doesn't make it a "better" rivalry or a more intense rivalry.  That just makes it more "hyped".To hype is to "Promote or publicize (a product or idea) intensively, often exaggerating its importance or benefits."permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

That's bullshit.Misread your sentence, my bad.Every legitimate rivalry compares to the intensity.  ALL OF THEM.  Just because your teams were good doesn't mean you hate each other anymore than we hate the Falcons or they hate us, "trust me".permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

Time, geography, certain games, etc.Go look up the Big ben plays in the 78 season.  Go check out the divisional playoff game in '91.  Just because YOU are personally unaware of the history of our rivalry doesn't make it less real.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

Go look up the Big Ben plays in the 70s.  Go look up the divisional playoff games in the early 90s.The Saints-Falcons rivalry has been around for a long, long time and has been heated for a LONG, LONG time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

Just because you haven't heard about it on ESPN for the past 30 years doesn't mean it isn't there.Go look up the Big Ben plays in the 70s.  Go look at the divisional playoff rounds between the Falcons and Saints in the early 90s.  It's deeply ingrained and has been for 30 or 40 years.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey so this Falcons fan thinks ATL/NO is a greater rivalry than Bears/Packers.

Just as I won't believe that Saints/Falcons hate is greater than Bears/Packers hate.I don't care how long the Bears and Packers have been in the nfl.Everything else is just a pissing contest.  Nothing more.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKliff Kingsbury makes his first interview upon being named Texas Tech's Head Coach.  by  monalisas-madhatsin  CFB[+]thedeuce53 8 points9 points10 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]thedeuce53 8 points9 points10 points 2 days agoKliff with his stupid sexy deep voice.. stupid tech.. stupid tubbs.Stupid :(permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
