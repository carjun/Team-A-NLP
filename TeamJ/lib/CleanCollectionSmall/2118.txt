The only reason people THINK it's underrated is because everyone keeps CALLING it underrated. Its a shit movie that had an unfortunate release date/theme, so people like to pretend that it made sense so that when the subject of movies comes up, they can pretend they know what they're talking about. And yes, because you're going to ask, I did watch the Director's cut, and i do understand it. It's just bad.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is one thing you hope your parents never find out about you?

We need to stop sticking our noses in everyone else's damn business and fix our own broken country. No one in this day and age is going to launch an all-out nuclear assault on anyone else.  The first country to do this would have the entire rest of the world up their ass in the space of 8 hours. We didn't get anything done in Iraq, we're not getting shit done in Afghanistan, and we won't get shit done in Syria.  America needs to stop throwing weapons and money at other countries and sort itself out. Its no surprise we're this far down the tubes financially.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFirst Ender's Game Movie Still Released!  by  appletreehighin  movies[+]Demontaco 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Demontaco 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoSTOP I'M GETTING GOOSEBUMPSpermalinksavecontextfull commentsHow did you get that scar?  by  conorclearshotin  AskReddit[+]Demontaco 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Demontaco 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM6xVQwIOYQpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is one thing that you've never done, that would be surprising to most people?  by  BiscuitMiscuitin  AskReddit[+]Demontaco 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Demontaco 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoSame.
