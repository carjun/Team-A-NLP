But so far, the suggestions range from ill-informed to probably irrelevant. Some demand measures to keep mentally ill people from buying guns. But we don't know if the killer was mentally ill, much less if he could have been detected as such. Mayors Against Illegal Guns demands that we take "automatic weapons out of our neighborhoods." But automatic weapons are so strictly regulated they are almost impossible to get, and there is no evidence that one was used in this case. The shooterreportedly used a semiautomatic rifle, a type of gun that is very comon and no more destructive than other conventional firearms.

The suspect in the Aurora shootings got four guns from retail stores, where the "loophole" doesn't exist.It's worth keeping in mind that despite gun laws that are allegedly too weak, violent crime and homicide have plummeted from the levels of 20 years ago.I've heard no concrete proposal that would hold out much hope of keeping a determined killer from going into a school, mall or movie theater and shooting people en masse. Until someone does, the discussion is mostly pointless.Copyright  2012 Chicago Tribune Company, LLCRECOMMENDED VIDEOChicagoNowElf on the Shelf: For adults onlyYou be judge: Which is the "Most Festive Pet" this holiday season?Join ChicagoNow...Metromix30+ things to do this weekendSend us your event information.More Chapman columnsSlaughter in Newtown: What to do?The irrelevance of right-to-work lawsGun rights, even in IllinoisConcealed-carry in Illinois, at lastRaising the Medicare age is no solution            More ResourcesCato at LibertyCafe HayekAlthouseDaily DishThe Daily KosGreg MankiwSlateNational Review OnlineAntiwar.comReason.comMarginal RevolutionThe Volokh ConspiracyTalking Points MemoHoover InstitutionKausfilesInstapunditOverlawyered.comSecular RightManage SubscriptionHome deliveryAdvertising ServicesConnect With UsSite IndexMobileTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyAbout Our AdsChicago Tribune, 435 N.
