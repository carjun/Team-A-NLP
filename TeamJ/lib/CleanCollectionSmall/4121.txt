Sunday December 16, 2012        EntertainmentLarger / SmallerNight Mode    Party of the week    Dec. 16, 2012, 3 a.m.I come out of most David Lynch films scratching my head and mumbling, ''Well, that didn't make a lick of sense.''  So when Dom Perignon unveiled a new advertising campaign photographed by the out-there director, I wasn't sure what to expect.The ivy Penthouse was blacked out to create a moody atmosphere as guests walked in. Allowing our eyes to adjust, and clutching black flutes of the appropriate bubbles, we were directed into the bedroom section. A still from the ad campaign loomed large while a Lynch-designed bottle carrying his dramatic silver signature was suspended under a spotlight.The shower was converted into a small room lined with blackboards so guests could imitate Lynch and sign their name in chalk, which glowed in the ultraviolet lights. We then shuffled to the dark (and consequently steamy) main room for speeches and a video featuring Lynch.Shot in his typical troubled and mysterious way, he said, ''I like to experiment and one idea leads to another and you discover something new and beautiful  It's all about knowledge and experience. Once you have those two things together - BOOM!'' How that relates to Dom Perignon, I'm not sure. But everyone around me nodded, so I figured, as with his films, I'd missed the point.Then the balcony doors opened to reveal rocker Tim Rogers, resplendent in a gold jacket, belting out a number or two. Everyone gasped, but not from surprise - just to gulp the fresh air. Rogers seemed a strange choice for Dom Perignon, so kind of a perfect choice for David Lynch.Shelly Horton is editor-at-large of S and a regular on Channel Seven's Sunrise, The Morning Show and Weekend Sunrise.Tweet      Print StorySaveLatest News Funding boosted for 'carbon and capture' project Killer forced his wayPerfect pupil's next big test - finding a jobMan dies as inflatable raft upturnsClass heroes save lives Editor's Picks Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireFun at the Clunes show.Newlyncouple shocked by truck accident Popular Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeMemories flow of Daylesford's Boathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesFloats needed for DaylesfordNew Years Eve GalaDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireMultimediaGallery: The Boathouse Cafe burns      Gallery: Keele BreenHannah Knight catches up with local artist Keele Breen.
