Thewhole world believes he is reddits CEO and he even made a blog post... but wait theres more...!!The real RedditCEO was in the restroom while all this happened, he managed to escape barely with his life while, shoeless and shirtless RedditCEO now roams the building trying to get his job back, crawling in air vents and hiding in empty rooms browsing reddit while everyone thinks yishan is the CEO.After an epic fight RedditCEO managed to throw one of yishan's evil henchmen from a window and got the attention of a great team of professionals, people who support the cause and want to see reddit restored and RedditCEO back in control of Nakatomi P...er... I mean REDDIT HEADQUARTERS.We immediately started The Official Movement For A Better Reddit Experience which sponsored the yishan sucks subreddit, within 24 hours, we had over 300 members and will not rest until yishan and his henchmen are gone!How can you help?Show your support everytime you see a thread where yishan is mentioned, post a quote from yishan or things he plans to do with reddit. Invite others to join the movement and maybe we can regain control soon and get RedditCEO his job back!Disclaimer, rules, terms, etc.In case you still dont get it, the purpose of this subreddit is humor... stop sending me private messages asking for proof, verification, etc. I am not trying to impersonate anyone. I am RedditCEO and I am not yishan.Do NOT post any personal information.We reserve the right to remove ANY post for any reason.The goal is to have fun, NOT to offend or actually hate anyone.Here is an example of a good comment:"yishan kicked my dog" <--LOLHere is an example of a bad comment:"yishan is a fucking idiot"  <--NO*p.s. yishan stole my shoes! *created by RedditCEOThe victim in all thisa community for 9 monthsSubmit a linkto anything interesting: news article, blog entry, video, picture...message the moderatorsMODERATORSRedditCEOThe victim in all thisFlairAdministrator1232425Dump your life savings in RIM stock - Yishan (self.yishansucks)submitted 3 days ago by CuseTown4 commentssharecancelloading...2838485"Sometimes when I'm feeling better than everyone else I like to link everyone to this image." - Yishan (i.imgur.com)submitted 8 days ago by Michael_J_Fuckscommentsharecancelloading...3141516Help spread the message of Yishan's evil by voting for /r/yishansucks as Best New Community over at /r/truebestof2012 (reddit.com)submitted 7 days ago by NoveltyAccount59281 commentsharecancelloading...4242526"I was extremely disappointed to discover that Reddit isn't written in VB." -Yishan Wong (self.yishansucks)submitted 9 days ago by NoveltyAccount59281 commentsharecancelloading...5234"Airplane! was a stupid movie and I hate everyone who likes it." - Yishan Wong (self.yishansucks)submitted 24 days ago by I_smell_awesomecommentsharecancelloading...6878889Yishan at work (i.imgur.com)submitted 25 days ago by saveredditnow4 commentssharecancelloading...7697071We are now officially the smallest MOST POPULAR subreddit in the known universe.
