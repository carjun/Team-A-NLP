Arsenal will NEVER win the Premier League again?  by  DreDayAFCin  Gunners[+]JokesPokes 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]JokesPokes 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours agoArsenal is a profit maximizing club, not a win maximizing club. The shareholders demand an annual return on their investment, which is what they are getting with Arsene Wenger at the helm. By qualifying for the UEFA CL, and making it through to the play-off stages for the past thirteen seasons with "cheap" teams, Wenger has made the club more money than most people know. Arsenal is also the only "big" club in the EPL who, overall, has made money in the transfer market during the last decade, rather than having spent. The fact that this money can't be seen on the field has been explained by Arsenal having some nobel goal of not spending "silly money" and buying affordable quality. And when we're lucky enough to have found some cheap talent, we spend time and resources on building for the future. But when our talent reaches world class levels and start making a name for themselves, Arsenal refuse to pay them wages close to their market value. "That's not how we do things". Wenger was for a long period of time the highest payed member of the Arsenal team, until they agreed to pay Fabregas 140 000, about half of what he was worth to the club. "No one player is larger than the club." They just want to keep things status quo. Stay as the "classy" big club , with no real shot, while make money hand over fist for the board.Clubs like Chelsea and Man City don't bother with profit as long as their owners break even, maybe even lose an acceptable amount. As a result, more of the clubs revenue is reinvested in talent, which is what drives performance in the league.I don't care about Arsenal being classy and economical. You can shove that right up your ass! I want that unbeatable team that takes a piss on the competition, that plays with style and an air of arrogance. Like in the days when Arsenal was feared by their competition, when our team didn't rely on teenagers to win matches for us. But that's not going to happen. Any talent we grow, we sell. Any cheep talent we buy doesn't preform. I'm just tired. Watching Wenger build a team is like watching someone building a sandcastle where the tide comes in.sorry for ranting.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that 50 Cent has set a goal of feeding 1 billion people in Africa by 2016.  by  spedmunkiin  todayilearned[+]JokesPokes 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]JokesPokes 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago...or die tryin'permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy cousin was in a motorcycle accident last month, has no insurance, and spent 4 days in the hospital.
