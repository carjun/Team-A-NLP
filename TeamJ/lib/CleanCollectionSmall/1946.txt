Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]xiacidfireix 12 points13 points14 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]xiacidfireix 12 points13 points14 points 23 hours agoI live around 10 minutes away from Newtown.  Some of the teachers at the school I go to had kids that went to Newtown.  I don't think I'll ever be able to wipe away the fear that I saw on their faces.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Oatmeal destroys the recent Buzzfeed article about him, point by point  by  mofroein  funny[+]xiacidfireix 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]xiacidfireix 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoThe BuzzFeed article tried to make Inman appear to be an evil, rape-mocking, devil beast.  In order to show the contrary, he provided examples that showed his kindness. permalinksavecontextfull commentsVote for Carl for TV.com's Best Kid Character  by  _mAn_in  thewalkingdead[+]xiacidfireix 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]xiacidfireix 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoI highly recommend them.  I feel that Arya in the TV show wasn't portrayed nearly as badass as she was in the book.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsVote for Carl for TV.com's Best Kid Character  by  _mAn_in  thewalkingdead[+]xiacidfireix 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]xiacidfireix 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoI was all ready to vote for Carl until I saw her.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy friend's new cat, cutest little demon  by  liz0k0kin  aww[+]xiacidfireix -1 points0 points1 point 14 days ago (0 children)[]xiacidfireix -1 points0 points1 point 14 days agoIt looks like a leather car seat.

(Recent Episode Spoilers)  by  Goofyfacein  thewalkingdead[+]xiacidfireix 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]xiacidfireix 0 points1 point2 points 16 days agoKilling the National Guard squad was logical, as was the almost-rape.If there was an armed force that could possibly pose as a threat to the town in the future, you would want that threat annihilated.  As for the almost-rape, he tried to threaten her with rape in order to extract information.  When that didn't work, he used the one thing that would: her weakness for Glenn.I really don't see the Governor as that evil in this series.  Slightly creepy, yes.  But not inherently evil. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs this wrong to want?  by  Scuba_steve25in  skyrim[+]xiacidfireix 11 points12 points13 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]xiacidfireix 11 points12 points13 points 22 days agoAs an XBoxer, I feel that the deciding factor was price.
