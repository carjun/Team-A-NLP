Mass killings are terrible and atrocious.  Add to that the fact that the large majority of the victims were so many young, vulnerable children.  My heart just aches.I understand that the media needs to report something.  (After all, I'm sure many of you were checking all of the major news outlets to get some sort of update or bird's eye view of the situation as it was unfolding.)  So I get that they needed to release information as they gathered it.  And in times of chaos, it's easy for someone to hear something and just run with it.  Unfortunately, that kind of swift release leads to misinformation.  But rather than point fingers (news, media, social networking, gun laws, lack of gun laws, bad parenting, what have you...) we should all take this time to open our hearts to the ones we love, and also to pay attention to those around us.  Remind our friends and family how much they mean to us, take the time to let them know how important they are in our lives.  That tiny step alone could prevent another situation like this from happening in the future.  Of course, there are individuals and groups who have a negative agenda (whether brought about by mental instability, political propaganda, religious zeal, etc.) but perhaps by using love and compassion as a preventive tool we can come together during this time.  My entire heart goes out to the families and loved ones who are now suffering from this unspeakable tragedy.  And I truly wish them all a healing process that allows them to grieve and remember the lives of those lost without fear or hatred or bitterness.  There are no magic words to take away their pain, but hopefully they can all gather strength throughout the aftermath of this terrible event.  permalinksave[+]vsal 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]vsal 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoA great message in a sea of media, emotional, and political chaos -- and an even greater message for the holiday season. permalinksaveparent[+]mariod505 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]mariod505 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoWe need to focus on the shooter to move forward.  What, exactly, was wrong with him mentally...  How did he, having mental issues, get 3 guns ...and why the hell didn't his friends or family report any homicidal behavior in advance.The point is to look past the emotional knee-jerk reaction, and logically think how to stop this from happening again.permalinksaveparent[+]Hessmix 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Hessmix 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoYou...to the top with you, cause your post needs to be read.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
