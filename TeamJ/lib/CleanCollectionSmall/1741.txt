The best way to fight ignorance is with knowledge. The GOP are dangerous that way because they embrace ignorance of the masses, and are voted into office by the same.permalinksaveparent[+]silverscreemer 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]silverscreemer 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoA video link would be great. permalinksaveparent[+]Mr_Titicaca 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Mr_Titicaca 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoIt just happened.

Forget your own religious beliefs, forget what you think is acceptable entertainment for teenagers-focus on the fucking problem which is guns and mental instability. Not saying that's the issue here, but again it'd be nice to fucking start somewhere logical.permalinksaveparent[+]ECrownofFire 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]ECrownofFire 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours agoWhy not blame the mental instability?

Assault weapons are weapons that is designed for killing people. Others are more for hunting that need to be reloaded more thus not as good for killing many people at once. The basic difference is reloading and barrel length. permalinksaveparent[+]KGrizzly -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]KGrizzly -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours agoOf course it's the lack of god and video games!
