Back in college, I was a team leader on a robotics team and we would train our new members to solder by giving them some old circuit board from some device we no longer cared about (think old remote control or a broken XBox) and told them to desolder every component.  Then they'd solder them back on.  By the time they're done with that (with some guidance) they'd be pretty skilled.Advice:When desoldering:  If the solder cools and hardens before you can suck it up, add more solder.  The solder will then stay hotter longer allowing you to remove it.  When soldering: use a hot iron, apply heat to the component and bring solder in very quickly (don't burn the component), then count to 3 and release.  This should leave a smooth, shiny surface on the solder.  If the surface isn't smooth, or is rather dull, you may have a "cold" solder joint, which are susceptible to mechanical failure from stress (drops or other pressure) or vibration.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDoctors!

IMO, /r/math should be an overarching subreddit for things Mathematics, and some other subreddit, /r/MathJokes , should be for these things.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is your perfect Brewery, Bar or Brewpub.

You claim that they have a lack of self control as if the goal is to avoid sex like the plague, but perhaps you don't see that maybe the goal is in fact to have sex.  Much of society doesn't see sex as a problem, but those who do tend towards religious fundamentalism.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGunmen kill senior womens activist in Afghanistan  by  Corporate_Hoin  worldnews[+]oursland 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]oursland 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoWe should also educate our children not to participate in contact sports and to avoid risky behavior like skateboarding, rock climbing or bicycle riding,.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGunmen kill senior womens activist in Afghanistan  by  Corporate_Hoin  worldnews[+]oursland 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]oursland 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoMy point is that education is happening.  It is well understood.  The education received in Afghanistan is one that is shrouded in religious and cultural indoctrination.  My second point is that Americans are quickly moving towards the same sort of education.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGunmen kill senior womens activist in Afghanistan  by  Corporate_Hoin  worldnews[+]oursland 6 points7 points8 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]oursland 6 points7 points8 points 5 days agoWe understand that.  Which is why there is a push to support faith based education initiatives, teach Creationism, teach abstinence only sex education, remove liberal elements from standardized textbooks, etc. here at home.  At this rate we'll be the most educated nation with the same value system as the uneducated Afghanis.I'd argue that education isn't the only thing that matters, what is taught matters a lot as well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPSY Rapped About Murdering Americans Before Becoming An International Sensation  by  akademgorodokin  worldnews[+]oursland 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]oursland 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoYou go tell Ice Cube that his anti-Asian song about attacking them and destroying their property is using incorrect language.

Much of your data cache and some of the code cache can be dominated by pointers.
