I could even deduce the subreddit you are looking at. EDIT: Actually I can tell which specific page you are looking at because of the Referer Header.In the end it's a matter of how paranoid you are. If, as /u/MegaDomo mentions, your goal is to avoid detection from evil governments, then this insecure data has just blown your cover.Also, TIL RES's sprites are pulled from /r/Enhancement.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDefault HTTPS  by  MegaDomoin  ideasfortheadmins[+]rram[A] 18 points19 points20 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]rram[A] 18 points19 points20 points 2 months agoIt's in the works, there is no ETA. There are still several things in the code to work on to make sure if you're on SSL that we're only serving you SSL content. For instance, previously subreddit stylesheets were hardcoded to HTTP. Now they are on Amazon S3 which removes this limitation for stylesheets.On the infrastructure side, we use Akamai to globally distribute the site. Currently, Akamai does not handle SSL for us. We'd have to pay for that, and that doesn't come cheap.pay.reddit.com is only supported for purchasing self-serve ads. In fact, it does not ensure you are receiving secure content and you should be getting SSL errors. (are you ignoring them?) It was an oversight that it allows you to browse the rest of the site.We realize SSL is important. We're working on it.
