(Photo credit: Jennifer Bendery)Get Politics Alerts:Sign UpFollow:Elections 2012, Video, Newtown Elementary School Shooting, Obama Gun Control, Newtown, Newtown Gun Violence, Newtown School Shooting, Newtown Shooting, White House Gun Control, White House Vigil, White House Vigil Gun Control,Politics NewsWASHINGTON -- Friday's shooting in Newtown, Conn., put the spotlight on President Barack Obama politically and, for many people, it was personal, as dozens turned up outside the White House gates begging him to take action on gun control.Activists, sympathetic parents, and those affected by gun violence in the past gathered to collectively grieve at the impromptu vigil. They chanted, lit candles handed out by advocacy groups, and pleaded for political action in the wake of the latest episode of gun violence to afflict the nation.The shooting of a reported 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School left people looking for not just answers, but an outlet.Jennifer Oko was among those who came to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to light a candle and call on the president to move gun control legislation. A New Yorker who now lives in D.C., Oko is the mother to a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old who are in kindergarten and first grade, respectively. She said she was torn as to whether to go home and see her kids immediately after work or come to the White House to attend the vigil. "I felt I needed to show solidarity," she said.But the unstated reason may have been her nerves over how, exactly, to talk to her kids about what had happened in Connecticut."Isn't that the question?" she said, when asked what she would tell her children. "The 5-year-old, I don't know how much she can understand it. I think we may just need to tell them that we will do everything we can to make sure they will live safe lives."Toby Hoover, director of the Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence, said she lost her husband to gun violence when she was 30 years old. She had an 8-year-old and a 4-year-old at the time. Asked how she explained the death to them, she was quick with an answer: "You don't. And they've grown up and I'm still trying to explain it." After news broke of the shooting in Newtown, she said that her son texted her, asking how something like this could happen again. She said she couldn't even contemplate what it was like to have a child of her own in that classroom on Friday. Instead, she said she was troubled by the inability of the political process to address these instances."What are we talking about here? Have we raised the gun to idol status?""The president's tears were nice," she added. "But he was supposed to lead us. He told us that if we elected him, he'd give us hope. I need hope."She didn't have to go far for answers. Walking among the crowd, outside the gates, was Jon Carson, Obama's director of the Office of Public Engagement. He told The Huffington Post that he had a 4-year-old and had stepped out to take in the scene of the Sandy Hook vigil. Several progressive advocates, including those pushing for the president to tackle gun control legislation, were pleased with his presence there.At least two people on the scene were overjoyed to see dozens of others turning out in the name of gun control. Barbara Elsas and Linda Finkel-Talvadkar, both of whom identified as "children of the '60s," regularly set up camp outside the White House on Mondays and talk to passersby about the need to urge politicians to revisit gun laws. The two women, along with a handful of others, said they've been doing this ever since the July shooting spree in Aurora, Colo.  "We are constantly here," said Elsas, who runs a preschool in Washington, D.C. "We talk to people and we educate people. We try to change minds one person at a time."The two women were easy to spot in the crowd: Both were wearing large, colorful signs with messages like, It Is Too Easy To Buy A Gun In The U.S.A -- We need to change this!! Elsas said they got involved in gun control advocacy because they kept hearing about people getting killed in shootings and said there wasn't much of a sustained public response.The only time people talk about gun control is when things "happen like this," said Elsas, motioning to the mourning crowd around her. "Then everybody comes out and holds a candle and sings, 'We Shall Overcome.' That's wonderful, beautiful. I'm here to do that, too. But what about tomorrow?""What are they going to do the next day? And the next day?" chimed in Finkel-Talvadkar, a former high school principal.Despite all the calls for action on gun control, next to no one at the vigil had specific requests for Obama or congressional leaders. Rev. Michael McBride of PICO National Network, who led prayers over a megaphone and demanded Obama to act, said only that the president needs to show leadership," and avoided questions about what, exactly, should be done. Similarly, Andy Pelosi of Gun Free Kids, who also spoke at the event, avoided specifics when asked what he would like to see happen.Todays the day to start that dialogue, Pelosi said. Theres so many different things. Weve had so many years in this country where nothings been done on the gun issue. Absolutely nothing. So this is the opportunity now. The second term is starting.Elsas could name something specific, though."The assault weapons ban needs to come back in five seconds," she said. "That's number one."See pictures below from the White House vigil, snapped by HuffPost's Brandon Wetherbee.Also on HuffPost: Loading SlideshowLinda Finkel-Talvadkar and Barbara Elsas protest for gun control every Monday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. outside of the White House.

However, when it comes to gun control- I am proven wrong. There is no gun law that would have stopped this school shooting short of a complete ban. On all guns. With the gun control issue- it is all or nothing- and it would probably take a                                                                            Read More... constitutional amendment so that's not going to happen. PEOPLE kill people- its that simple. The piecemeal agenda of the gun control group will only work to frustrate legal gun owners, get them organized against liberals- and once they gain control they can enact their agenda of putting guns in the hands of kids going to school. The gun control folks are offering all the wrong policy prescriptions.  Apparently, the kid did try to purchase a gun and was denied because he didn't have the proper credentials for a purchase. Connecticut has some of the more stiff gun laws. How did that work out? Why not a super-tax on the gun industry? I think I could support that- with the revenue going to education and healthcare? Tax breaks only for sales to military/law enforcement. All other arms sales having a huge tax on them. Just a thought. That's the best idea I can think of aside of a complete ban  and I don't really think this would work either.Malcolm_Jazz: I usually like to think (and there is great evidencehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Malcolm_Jazz/white-house-vigil-gun-control_n_2304278_213860299.html                                    View Thread                                |                                    Share it                                                213860299,213790167,213829919,213855823,213826931,213815920,213826913                                          This user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program                     NorthernObservations88 Fans27 minutes ago ( 4:26 PM)not a hope.NorthernObservations: not a hope.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/NorthernObservations/white-house-vigil-gun-control_n_2304278_213925715.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

The only possible firearm that may of fit into this category(some undisclosed variety of .223 caliber rifle) was sitting in the back of a car in the parking lot.Neither of the 2 hand guns were likely to have high capacity magazines(again undisclosed as of yet, but highly unlikely).Most gun owners are not members of the NRA.Most gun owners support criminal(and mental health) background checks.  The main stumbling block to mental health background checks is caused by states not providing this information to the database(NICS).Numerous gun laws are currently on the books but not enforced.

Criminals are just that because they have no rules and we have all the rules. What is needed is that old saying "it takes two to fight" has to go because it only takes one to fight and one to be a compliant victim. Over the years too many people "don't want to get involved." You can not sanction a machine as it does nothing without a person. Dealing with the bully issue has been handled this way. Someone becomes overbearing so you teach the compliant victim not to do anything but run away and tell someone else. As soon as someone stands up to the coward they back down. If someone challenged any of the shooters in recent events it is doubtful they would have stayed to fight as each event was in a venue where nobody was in position to fight back. Video games teach children killing is a sport and they hone their skills in simulation games but there is no legal or moral result for how many you kill. The news media gives these people great notoriety so they can say I'm all over the world news I made it big time. Instead of blaming the spoon for making you fat put it down. Instead of writing more rules how about more people get involved and take a stand against criminal behavior in our society as a whole?borozone: This person did not obey existing laws what makes anyonehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/borozone/white-house-vigil-gun-control_n_2304278_213901525.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

They're the ones who really pass the laws. The President can suggest new laws, but it's the Congress and the Senate who have the final say and most of the time they'll reject any new law cause gun lobbyists will be stuff cash down their throats saying don't pass the law and the cash will keep flowing into your pocket. If people are really serious about changing gun laws harp on them. If they don't bend to the people's will, as they should, then vote them out the next time they're up for re-election. That's how things actually get done, not by simply asking for change.GundamMars: Asking the President to do something about gun control laws,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/GundamMars/white-house-vigil-gun-control_n_2304278_213890559.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itVikingQuest1096 Fans3 hours ago ( 2:12 PM)"The President can suggest new laws, but it's the Congress and the Senate who have the final say"As always, it's the President's job to lead.VikingQuest: "The President can suggest new laws, but it's the Congresshttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/VikingQuest/white-house-vigil-gun-control_n_2304278_213891967.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.
