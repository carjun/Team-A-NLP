It's universal, the suffering. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20723910Edit: I was trying to point out how humans cause human suffering and we all share the brunt of insanity, not arguing it's comparative severity. It reminds me of the writing: "No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main...... any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee." -- John Donnepermalinksaveparent[+]evercharmer 39 points40 points41 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 39 points40 points41 points 23 hours agoWell fuck.permalinksaveparent[+]TheStudent44 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]TheStudent44 4 points5 points6 points 20 hours agoMy literary response:I hate all pain,Given or received; we have enough within us,The meanest vassal as the loftiest monarch,Not to add to each others natural burthenOf mortal misery, but rather lessenLord Byron, SardanapalusThis is the reason why I study literature: empathy.permalinksaveparent[+]tillicum 21 points22 points23 points 23 hours ago (16 children)[]tillicum 21 points22 points23 points 23 hours agoI saw on another thread where some gun nut pointed to this to point out knives are weapons to.  But there is one glaring difference between Sandy Hook and what happened in China they will never acknowledge in their quest for equivalency:Henan province: 22 woundedSandy Hook: 28 killedpermalinksaveparent[+]the_sleepless -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours ago (14 children)[]the_sleepless -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours agoAnd yet in previous knife attacks, 20 were killed in Henan Province. permalinksaveparent[+]sharkus 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours ago (8 children)[]sharkus 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours agoCompare that to the amount of people killed in gun attacks in the last few years.permalinksaveparent[+]the_sleepless -1 points0 points1 point 14 hours ago (7 children)[]the_sleepless -1 points0 points1 point 14 hours agoIn China? You want to get a true census of homocides from China? Yeah, let me get the CIA on that. You're missing the point, they grabbed a weapon and hurt a bunch of people. It doesn't matter what rules are made, assholes and crazy people don't follow them. permalinksaveparent[+]inittowinit3785 1 point2 points3 points 12 hours ago (2 children)[]inittowinit3785 1 point2 points3 points 12 hours agoThe actions don't change (picking up a weapon and attacking people) but the results are different.

It's not something I can see an argument against in any logical fashion. permalinksaveparent[+]the_sleepless 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (2 children)[]the_sleepless 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoI dunno where you live, but here in California, I can't even shoot a .22 rifle on my farm without letting the Sheriff know. Anything larger and I pretty much have to go tell everyone within 1/4 mile radius. permalinksaveparent[+]easytiger 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]easytiger 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoyea but you can still own it. Doesn't mean you have to play by the rulespermalinksaveparent[+]Yousaidthat 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]Yousaidthat 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoUm, maybe for certain people, but there are SO SO SOOOO many loopholes that allow people access to guns through various means. The idea that guns are essentially scattered about the land, in different people's homes and gun lockers, just waiting for that 1/10000000 chance that the son of the family will do something like this and take the guns. I mean you can't argue that guns are not exponentially more likely to inflict grievous casualties than knives. You just can't, without downplaying how much more deadly a gun is. permalinksaveparent[+]kidkolumbo 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (4 children)[]kidkolumbo 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoGoogle only brings up the recent stabbing.

I bet you're a hit at parties.permalinksaveparent[+]--Heisenberg-- -3 points-2 points-1 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]--Heisenberg-- -3 points-2 points-1 points 22 hours agoI've had gun nuts use that tired excuse in the past too.  What they fail to mention in the Chinese stabbing sprees they've have over the past few years, is that they're all very young children.  They equate stabbing a small child to shooting an adult, it's ridiculous.permalinksaveparent[+]TrolleyPower 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]TrolleyPower 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago...shows how easier access to guns make it easier to cause fatalities.  permalinksaveparent[+]UrMomsA_ThrowAwayAct 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]UrMomsA_ThrowAwayAct 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoGuns, knives.. It doesn't matter. It's all this nonsensical violence that has to end. It really is universal and i feel like it's getting worse.permalinksaveparent[+]OccamsHairbrush 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]OccamsHairbrush 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours agoIt matters that in today's gun attack, 20 children are dead. In China's knife attack, all 22 children are injured, but alive. There is a clear and important difference and it's stupid to pretend there's not.permalinksaveparent[+]prdelgobbo 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]prdelgobbo 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoI can't agree with you enough.  We will never be able to stop these sorts of catastrophes from occurring, but we can control their severity.permalinksaveparent[+]MattRix 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours ago (11 children)[]MattRix 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours agoBut at least that was with a knife so there are 22 injured but 0 dead. permalinksaveparent[+]the_sleepless 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]the_sleepless 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoIn a previous attack with a knife, 20 children died. I don't know if you know what it's like to die from a knife wound, but it's not fast. It's really slow and painful. permalinksaveparent[+]Frankeh -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours ago (3 children)[]Frankeh -1 points0 points1 point 21 hours agoIf I had to die, I'd choose a gun. But if someone said 'Okay, I'm going to either shoot a bullet into you or you get a stab' I'd choose the stab for sure. permalinksaveparent[+]the_sleepless 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (2 children)[]the_sleepless 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agoHave you ever been stabbed, dude? It fucking sucks. It's a real hit or miss if you're going to go into shock. I haven't been shot, but I have a friend who has been shot 3 times. You ALWAYS go into shock when shot. It's nice that you'll at least not be in as much pain. Getting stabbed or cut open is fucking awful. permalinksaveparent[+]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (1 child)[]Frankeh 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoI have not, but you've got to question why you go into shock when you're shot. It's because of the extreme amount of damage a bullet did. I'd rather not go into shock and feel the pain because at least that means there's likely less damage actually being done. permalinksaveparent[+]the_sleepless 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]the_sleepless 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoWhoa whoa. Depending on the caliber, the bullet can bounce off of you. 9mm can bounce off your ribs, actually. There's a dozen different factors at play here, bro. Bullet grain, caliber, powder, quality of bullet, etc. Was it fired from a handgun? Rifle? Etc. Anyway, point being, regardless of the round, you'll always go into a blissful shock. I've been stabbed and comparing that to my friend who has been shot, I think I'd rather have been shot. permalinksaveparent[+]punkchick210 -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (5 children)[]punkchick210 -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoYea but the sad thing is even though there were no deaths injuries can leave people handicapped , have irreparable damage, or have a more suffering and prolonged death... And to think this happened to children makes it all the worse.permalinksaveparent[+]--Heisenberg-- 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]--Heisenberg-- 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoBut they're alive...permalinksaveparent[+]punkchick210 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (3 children)[]punkchick210 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoTrue, but they can become forever scarred mentally and physically. They may have wanted to become a football player or a dancer, but now because of this attack they may have been constricted to a wheelchair, changing their future forever. For some it could take maybe days of pain in a critical condition before they finally pass away. Not to mention the psychological problems that can arise from just witnessing something this terrible. I am not saying at all that it is beyond a tragedy the death of someone so young, but there can be things more difficult than death that will follow you throughout your life.permalinksaveparent[+]--Heisenberg-- -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]--Heisenberg-- -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours agoThat's pure speculation.Andy Murray has done alright, despite being at the centre of the handgun last mass shooting in Britain. Just to note, it was the last mass shooting because it led to a complete ban on handguns.permalinksaveparent[+]punkchick210 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]punkchick210 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago...again i'm not saying that it's not a tragedy, I was just explaining that when the news says something like "10 killed, 20 injured" I always think of the injured who are probably in the worst mental and physical pain of their lives. I know someone who has come back from the military injured after an attack. After this happened to someone I know I always think of those who are injured and just how terrible it can be dealing with something like that. It changes you forever.permalinksaveparent[+]--Heisenberg-- 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]--Heisenberg-- 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoIt will, and the unfortunate thing is that they're in the US, where they won't necessarily get access to mental health treatment, which is a huge factor in why shootings like these occur in the first place.  To me, it's no surprise that there are so many murders in the US, given that:Ridiculously easy access to gunsNo universal health care systemVery little employee rightsVery few paid holidays from workThe stress on the average American must be huge, and it's no wonder it gets too much and people snap.  With easy access to weapons, and bad health care, it's just a bad combination all round.permalinksaveparent[+]HarlawTheReader -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (1 child)[]HarlawTheReader -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoCorrect me if I'm wrong but this (sadly) isn't the first time something like that has happened is it? I feel like I've heard of a similar incident from China not long ago. permalinksaveparent[+]--Heisenberg-- 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]--Heisenberg-- 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoIt's an epidemic, it happens regularly in China.  Always small children too, I think it's more of a protest than random violence.
