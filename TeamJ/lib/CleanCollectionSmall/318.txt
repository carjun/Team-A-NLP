A police spokesman, Lt. J. Paul Vance, said investigators had produced some very good evidence, but he provided no explanation for a massacre that unfolded with chilling speed as Mr. Lanza opened fire in one classroom and then another, turning a place where children were supposed to be safe  an elementary school with a sign out front that said, Visitors Welcome  into a national symbol of heartbreak and horror.        Lieutenant Vance said the victims bodies had been taken from the school, Sandy Hook Elementary. He said the one survivor of the massacre, a woman who was shot and wounded at the school, would be instrumental in piecing together what had happened. He declined to describe what evidence investigators  who combed through the one-story school on Saturday  had found.        Officials said the killing spree began early on Friday at the house where Mr. Lanza had lived with his mother, Nancy Lanza. There, he shot her in the face, making her his first victim, the authorities said. Then, leaving her dead after taking three guns that apparently belonged to her, he climbed into her car for the short drive to the school. Two of the guns were semiautomatic pistols; the other was a semiautomatic rifle.        Outfitted in combat gear, Mr. Lanza forced his way into the school, apparently defeating an intercom system that was supposed to keep people out during the day unless someone inside buzzed them in. This contradicted earlier reports that he had been recognized and allowed to enter.        He was not voluntarily let into the school at all, Lieutenant Vance said. He forced his way in.        The lieutenant said the authorities were investigating the history of each and every weapon that Mr. Lanza carried to the scene of the rampage and said that the guns were found in the school, in proximity to where Mr. Lanza shot himself to death.        A federal law enforcement official said the three guns recovered at the school  Glock and Sig Sauer pistols and an M4 .223-caliber Carbine  were bought legally by the gunmans mother and registered in her name. Other weapons were recovered from her home, the official said.        The dead included the principal, Dawn Hochsprung, 47, law enforcement officials said, and even before the medical examiner had released the identities of the victims, some were being mourned on the Internet. One was Ana Greene, the 6-year-old daughter of the jazz saxophonist Jimmy Greene, who moved to Newtown in July. Several other jazz musicians express condolences on Facebook, and Mr. Greene posted a response in which he thanked them.        As much as shes needed here and missed by her mother, brother and me, he wrote, Ana beat us all to paradise. He added, I love you, sweetie girl. (The Ottawa Citizen quoted a family member as saying that Mr. Greenes son, who also attended the school, was fine.)        Dorothy Werden, 49, lives across the street from Christopher and Lynn McDonnell, who lost their daughter Grace, 6, on Friday. In an interview Saturday morning, she said that several other families who had lost children lived close by, and that the Lanza household was a block away.        Ms. Werden said she saw Grace getting on a bus Friday morning, as she did every day at 8:45. Shortly afterward, she received a call that there had been a lockdown at the school  something that happens periodically, she said, because there is a prison nearby. It was only when she saw police cars from out of town speed past her that she knew something was wrong.         1  2 Next Page  Get 50% Off The New York Times & Free All Digital Access.Get Free E-mail Alerts on These TopicsNewtown, Conn, Shooting (2012)Lanza, AdamSandy Hook Elementary School (Newtown, Conn)Newtown (Conn) 36 hours in Sarasota, Fla.
