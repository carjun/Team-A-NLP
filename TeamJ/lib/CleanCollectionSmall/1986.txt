Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]vincentkun 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago*(0 children)[]vincentkun 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago*Not really.  The reason we get all angry when this kind of stuff happen in the US is because of how rare it happens, and how many massacres there have been in 1 year.  Look at the middle east where it happens at least once a week.  Literally one or two weeks ago a school bus full of children got blown up...Take this for example.  It literally happened TODAY in China: http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-man-slashes-22-children-near-china-school-20121214,0,6383015.story  That's 22 children dead, and it is not even the first of these events over there.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Some parents where just yesterday worrying about how much money they had to waste in buying their children games and toys.   Hell, some of them even bought it and have them wrapped under the tree even!  I think that this situation, though horrible any time of the year, is just unreal at this time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Go to a city and look at the sky, you'll see no stars.  This is because of the light radiation, the moon is so reflective it basically emulates this light, causing light radiation in the same way a brightly lit city does.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAwesome video footage of the Moon that I didn't even know existed.  by  Deku_nutin  videos[+]vincentkun 9 points10 points11 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]vincentkun 9 points10 points11 points 1 day agoYeah man, you'd think the Soviets would be the first to call out if it was fake.

The biggest problem is when unfertile people get to have babies, this degenerates the genetic pool.  There is little natural selection going on with humans right now other than things like irreparable infertility, people very prone to cancer and death at birth.  Thankfully, where we've slowed evolving genetically, we've been evolving way faster culturally and technologically.  So much that for now, we develop solutions to problems faster than new problems arise.  Because of this we can have the luxury of having humans  with infertility problems have babies, and people who should have died at birth survive.  It's truly amazing what we've done as a species.I seriously doubt this will be a problem for now, more people with deadly genetic conditions die even with treatment, and most infertile people stay infertile.  It is just not enough to make a dent on our population, maybe in the future when(and if) we can heal every condition it will be a problem(and only if by some chance we suddenly stopped having technology).Also as someone mentioned before, Gattaca will probably happen before this becomes a problem.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTerran HoTs is just meh.  by  RedbullThiefin  AllThingsTerran[+]vincentkun 1 point2 points3 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]vincentkun 1 point2 points3 points 15 days agoI kinda understand where you are coming from because some game developers use the beta very loosely.  But a real beta (betas Blizzard tends to do) are not ready for retail release.  Blizzard betas are there to eliminate bugs, glitches, unbalances etc....  Often times there will a bug in beta where if it isn't game breaking they'll intentionally leave it there and fix it on the actual retail game.permalinksavecontextfull comments13161718Another article talking about an old runecape exploit (Read #4).

The thing I hear about hellbats though, is that they tend to clump up, making them susceptible to AoE anyways.  Specially considering they can't stim.  It also adds the problem that most battles with hellbats you'll have to commit to the battle because the hellbats can't escapes easily.Haven't played HotS, but it makes me wonder how long hellbats take to transform into hellions.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFree WoW battle chest for playing D3?  by  imnotabusin  Diablo[+]vincentkun 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago (0 children)[]vincentkun 0 points1 point2 points 27 days agoIf you are referring to the monthly fee, I have no problem with money in the long run, I have problem with money for the next 3 weeks.

About the same speed if you use momentum with the enemy weakness (mage against a melee monster).  Slightly slower if you use momentum with wrong combat type (mage a range monster).All tasks you could afk before you can afk now with momentum.You can buy a off-hand rapier to dual wield, or an off-hand cls.  I wouldn't recommend the staff in its current state.In a way its actually better now.  Use rejuvenate to heal up, along with typical summons.  If you use protection prayer you'll probably be able to afk tasks as easily, haven't tried  it.Using a shield now grants ridiculously high defense, and in combination with rejuvenate and resonance(heals for what you would have been dealt) you'll probably even last longer in tasks than before.Worth noticing, if you use abilities on slayer tasks, you will kill at a ridiculously high speed considering AoE abilities, multi-combat and new defensive measures.   I don't know if this stands true for all tasks but at least metal dragons, hellhounds, greater demons and gargoyles I tested were much, much faster than in live game.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIsraeli Tanks and Troops Move Toward Gaza Border  by  Datumin  worldnews[+]vincentkun 4 points5 points6 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]vincentkun 4 points5 points6 points 29 days agoIt is, indeed, their land.
