The White House gave a stronger signal of President Obamas support for reinstating a ban on assault weapons. (Washington Post)New at Think Tanked:Open for Discussion! After Sandy Hook: What can be done to curb gun violence in America? Four experts discuss what policy measures can be taken to combat the complex problem of gun violence. (Washington Post)Buy back guns, boost the economy: Everyone knows we need to reduce gun violence in America. Everyone knows we still need to boost the economy, too. Usually these goals are debated in completely different policy silos. But what if there was a way to boost the economyandshrink gun violence? Wouldnt that be the holy grail at this hour? Might that not answer the presidents call for new ideas?Allow me to propose a massive, debt-financed gun buyback program, writes CAPs Matt Miller. (Washington Post)AEIs Jonah Goldberg: On Newtown: Mourn first, then act. (National Review)Boehners backup tax plan shakes up fiscal cliff negotiations: House Speaker John A. Boehner(R-Ohio) veered off the bipartisan course he had been charting toward a broad tax-and-entitlement deal with President Obama and instead Tuesday pushed a GOP package to extend tax cuts for income up to $1million.The move shook the Capitol after several days of significant progress between Obama and Boehner, who had moved closer to a pact raising taxes on the wealthy and curbing government spending, including on Social Security. (Washington Post)The fiscal cliff offers: Dueling White House and GOP perspectives. (Washington Post)The endless lies about tax reform: Almost everyone thinks we should broaden the tax base; that is, reduce the number and size of tax deductions, exclusions and credits.The Bowles-Simpson fiscal-reform plan went after tax breaks so aggressively it was able to slash the deficit and still cut tax rates. Thats the position GOP leaders in the House and Senate have taken, too.As pleasing as it is to find a consensus in this polarized era, this one is mistaken. It would be either undesirable or politically impossible to reduce the largest loopholes, writes AEIs Ramesh Ponnuru. (New York Post)Politicos Arena asks:Should Congress have to work on solving the fiscal cliff through the holidays?Manhattan Institutes Diana Furchtgott Roth: Three lost issues in the fiscal cliff debate. (Washington Examiner)Manhattan Institutes E.J. McMahon:By the time they near the end of their second year in office, its not unusual for first-term governors to shift their focus from tackling problems to taking bows  and Gov. Cuomo certainly has been no exception. (New York Post)Room for Debate asks:So many Americansend up in prison for so long, and sometimes findlittle or no supportafter they are released.A recent Times editorial called for measures that wouldreduce spendingon prisons. Aseries of letters to the editorfollowed up with proposals for sentencing reform.Now Room for Debate is asking: Given that most inmates will one day be released, how should incarceration change to prepare people to rejoin the outside world? How can a prison sentence change a person for the better? (New York Times)Think Tanked gets a facelift DeMint: Move to Heritage 'a homecoming'Do Democrats have a plan for entitlements?
