Your problem might also have to do simply with a drop in testosterone as you get older, maybe try eating a lot of meat and eggs and see if that has any effect, cholesterol is the precursor to a good number of hormones, including testosterone.permalinksavecontextfull commentsA candid inquiry for males (sexuality)  by  erwycin  Drugs[+]Goofy_fucker 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]Goofy_fucker 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoNope...What have you been taking?permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama: Pot users not 'top priority'  by  strangerzeroin  obama[+]Goofy_fucker -4 points-3 points-2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]Goofy_fucker -4 points-3 points-2 points 4 hours agoBro.

The same sites that do the reuptake do the releasing as well, so by definition a drug with strong dopamine release will have re-uptake inhibition.

In all liklyhood as long as the saddle is about in the middle of it's rails(things on the bottom that attach it to the post.) it should be fine for the distances you are going, unless you are long/short femur'ed , than it might be off a bit.Here is a video showing fore aft adjustment, the guy uses a laser, but you can use either a string with a weight tied on the end, or just eye ball it.To check for level. Well look at the saddle. And if either end is pointed up or down, make it not do that anymore.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCycling in cold + squats = quad tendon pain?  by  mackstannin  Fitness[+]Goofy_fucker 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Goofy_fucker 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoCyclist here. There is very little chance that the cycling is causing your problems, if you position on the bike was egregiously bad (knees in chest saddle height on a BMX) you could maybe cause trouble with a joint, but such a short distance won't upset a tendon/muscle group,with the quads being the strongest link in that chain. Also most all problems you would run into would happen with in a week or two of starting the distance, not after you have had time to adapt.Temps in the 40's won't hurt your legs unless you are doing 200 miles a week in them or over 65 years old. I have had acute pain before in my quadriceps, but that was on a sub zero day and as soon as my legs stopped trying to constrict all of the blood out of themselves to keep my heart warm, it stopped hurting.You might want to reconsider your squatting weight, reps or frequency.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat drug do you find the most addictive?  by  Nowistimetopretendin  Drugs[+]Goofy_fucker 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Goofy_fucker 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoAlcoholI have never had a "problem" with any substance, but I could see myself going down a ugly road most easily with alcohol. I have a glass of wine at night before bed, but some times I like to start reading and have a few(ten) more, and sometimes I like to do that for days in a row. I also find myself liking other novel alcohols such as 2M2B and ECX a bit more than I would like.Other than that I haven't really found most substances to have any draw for me after the first few dosages, from Oxycodone to Cocaine to whatever random research chemical I happen to be playing around with at the time. I have just never felt the need to keep going with something after the initial novelty wore off.WellEtizolam is some really nice stuff.Just saying.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWoman has 1.4kg of Cocaine in her BREAST IMPLANTS  by  sennaonein  Drugs[+]Goofy_fucker 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Goofy_fucker 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoWell, someone really tweaked her nipples.If someone insufflated all that coke they would be high as tits!I should really go to sleep.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMarijuana dealers of Colorado and Washington , how has the new law changed your business?
