Memes, comics, funny screenshots, direct links to web games, arts-and-crafts, etc. will be removed.When submitting a link, the content submitted must be necessary, not just a "visual aid". For example, starting a discussion about a particular game would be a fine topic for a self-post, but should not be initiated by posting an image of its box-art.Posts about any type of game (video, board, card, etc.) are allowed, but not sports.End of 2012 Discussion ListThis Week in Gaming - Nov 25 - Dec 1Other Gaming Subreddits/r/gamernews - News/r/truegaming - Discussion/r/gaming - Absolutely everythingSpecific game subreddits and moreGame RecommendationsExtremely general "what games are good?"-style recommendation threads will be removed, as will overly-specific or personal ones like "should I get Game A or B?".Detailed recommendation requests that have the potential to initiate a discussion are allowed, but please use the resources below for general recommendations.Recommended games for all systems"Essential" games for older systems"Hidden gems" for older systems/r/gamingsuggestionsSubmission RulesNo submissions just seeking an answer or solution without any real discussion potential.
