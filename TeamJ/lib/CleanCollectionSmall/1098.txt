These people are elected on our behalf to serve the country, us, not to improve their financial conditions. While many of their constituents suffer financially, it's Christmas time for those that take advantage of information that benefits their personal coffers. The SEC has know about this for years but if your a member in the private club, go for it!

The Iranian, Thailand and Malaysian brought drug to this country and give to stranded Africans to sell on the street for them, the police and government know these things but no arrest for these people but just the Africans, arrest in their homes, street, churches, clubs and malls.Secondly, Passport issues for the those who has expired passport were arrested along side with those who has a valid passport and visa but there are some issue I would to let the world know these things happen even if are not an African but you skin color can get you to trouble here in Malaysia.Beware and wish.            December 10, 2011rajshankar Kashmir  An Orphan Child Of India There are not many places on the face of this earth that can challenge the beauty of Kashmir. Yet, in the last couple of decades, Kashmir has become an Indian widow who is not supposed to dress up. I happened to visit this beautiful place last year. It was a painful time for some of the people inside and across the border, due to the natural calamity - earthquake of 2006. I had only seen this place in movies and T.V. programs. However, my visit was a revelation. People of Kashmir has learnt to live in the shadows of guns, it seems. I did not count, but there might be a hundred thousand army personnel on duty in the state. Yet, there are bomb explosions once in a while. The famous lake of the valley was not well maintained. I heard the same lame excuse. We do not have funds. An international tourist place does not have funds to maintain its source of revenue. Huh.People were afraid to talk on the issue of terrorism, when I talked to the locals. There is an element of doubt in the minds of people. For all they knew, I might have been a terrorist or a government agent in civil dress. However, they did not have to tell everything. In the evening, no one wants to be found at places that are not very crowded. Transportation will come to a halt in the evening. When I decided to hit the earthquake-affected area, I barely survived two possible deaths. My shikara (boat) fellow told me that there will be an accident today and he literally ran into other shikaras. I could have lost my rib or good portion of my bone. Later on, he purposefully pulled the canoe back when I was getting off. I almost drowned in the water of the lake. The lake has some weeds that make it difficult for someone to swim. Luckily, I survived. However, I was a man on purpose and I had to visit the earthquake-affected areas. After my written requests to senior police officials and their consultation with the army officer of the rank of colonel, I was allowed to visit the last post of Indian Territory. You have to go to Srinagar to Baramula to Uri to Samabad. From Samabad I decided to hit a village called Dachhi. Approximately 1000 people had died in the earthquake. Before I talk much about the earthquake, let me share an experience. The military personnel seem to think that anybody and everybody in that area is a terrorist. I was a new comer to that place but their language was very rude if not abusive. They seem to have a free license to handle the civilians the way they wish. Unfortunate but true. While I understand that given the situation they should be alert and cautious, I cannot comprehend why they would treat everybody as a suspect. It seems like the people in that vicinity don't care much about their civil rights. For a stranger like me, their behavior was boorish. The senior army officials should look into this and educate their platoon to behave. Every citizen of India has the same right of dignity the military think they possess, by virtue of the guns in their hands and the power vested in their uniform. In democracy, you don't rule by putting fear in the minds and hearts of the innocent people. Be as stern as you can, when you have found someone with malicious motives. Nevertheless, a little restrain sometimes does wonders for the confidence of innocent civilians. I will comeback to this topic a little later. Lets move forward.We are bent upon proving to the rest of the world that corruption is part of our day-to-day lives. We can make Shylock proud when it comes to biting the flesh of not so powerful citizens of the country. The Dachhi village was just another example of our greed and deep-rooted corruption. The government had decided to give Rs. 60000 to every earthquake victim of the village. According the locals, 60-70% people had received only half the money. They claimed that they were asked for bribe if they wanted to get the relief money. One villager who identified himself as Manjoor Ahmed, S/o Mira Gujar was very disgruntled and revealed that he had been openly asked for bribe. When he refused to pay the bribe, money he was not offered any further help. Luckily, for him, he had the compensation money for the son he had lost. Therefore, the lesson for us is, "get your son killed, eat with the relief money and live without roof." Another villager by the name Mohammaddin claimed that he is not getting his share of the relief money because he is not paying the bribe. Mohammad Husain of the same village gave his tacit acceptance to the statements made by the two villagers and their family members. Several not for-profit organizations (N.G.O.) had done the survey and provided some temporary relief. C.O.V.A., S.E.C.O.P., Help Child, Jamat E Hind & P.S.I. Tech Support to name a few.However, the villagers mentioned that some of these organizations were enjoying and C.G.I. Sheets bought for them were not distributed. A few of these not-for-pro            December 11, 2011123wills new to the world of reporting ...........wish me            December 12, 2011desaint19 this is great...new ways to report             December 17, 2011rodquin 2:00 pm 12/17/11 - Just got a call from family in PR.

Instead of Occupy each state lets stand together to get everyone out of their seat and start fresh with a new team of politicians! I am really tired of them not coming to any agreement about an issue and it is truly time to do something about it.

January 4, 2012NavySailor97 I cannot post my name due to the Navy will not appreciate that I am putting this out to the media since they are trying to make this whole situation go away as fast as possible and I am included in this. The navy and the government have recently decided to let go or lay off 3000 sailors with little to no help. They are making seem like they are giving us all this help but on top of all they are not helping us. I, like many others have served this country for the past 15 years and have given multiple years to deployments and holidays and all other sorts of valuable times away from my family. About a month ago we all found out that we have been given a pink slip to get out of the Navy. The Navy has offered us a severance pay package but we are not allowed to continue service in any type of military branch or we loose the severance pay. We will not be allowed to retire and out medical benefits are all gone unless we opt to go reserves retire at 60 and pay 70% of our retirement pay of $1469 for medical coverage that equals to $1049 monthly premium. Congress passed into law that we will be able to retire at 15 years but the people that are affected by this Enlisted Review Board are not eligible for this. We have been trying to do something about this so that it will include us and we can get our retirement benefits but no one is willing to try to help us. This is the wonderful treatment that we as veterans deserve from the US. I hope that this will air on CNN and the rest of the country sees how badly we are treating our veterans.            January 4, 2012miredagain My husband was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal in November 2011 - but never received it. We found out that it is sitting on a desk waiting for "funding" to be approved. He did this op 32 years ago and is now being recognized - kinda. Congress gets paid - HOW MUCH? BUT They can't send a medal to a well deserved Veteran? What is wrong with this country ?

January 6, 2012SunnySue2k I would like to know why we don't hear anything about this on CNN.            January 10, 2012sonnyg1304 my name is frederick w. graves. i go by the name of sonny graves. i,v,e sent messages to us . gov . org but iv,e never any response. to begin with , iv,e never meant no harm or disrespect. i,m trying to keep this short. iv,e written messages to aarp with no reply. and probaly won,t get a reply here also. my situation is that i fall into the doughnut hole as so many others. i have an 80 yr. mother that i try to help on a monthly basis as well as myself. i,m on social security disability. i have had 5 heart attacks, 2 triple by-passes & 7 stints. i pay $ 40.00 a month for part D & even with the part D i have to pay $ 350.00 for my heart meds that comes to about 4 400.00 a month for my meds. keep in mind i,m trying to help my mother on a monthly basis also. with my monthly $40.00 partD monthly ins. premium & the $ 350.00 cost of my heart meds that comed to $ 400.00 a month. i get medicare but i have to pay about $ 150.00 for blue cross blue shield for a supplement to pay what medicare dosen,t cover. then you take monthly utilities, taxes, gas, ins. food ect. you get the idea.but in the doughnut hole, i,m told i make to much to qualify for extra help & yet i,m helping my elderly mother that makes about $800.00 a month i bring in about $2300.00 a month but i,m told i make to much to get extra help. to be honest, about the 3rd & 4th week of each month, i,m lucky to be able to eat once a day. i,m sorry if i seem to be complaining, but i,m just trying to survive & be honest & law abbiding while doing so. iv,e tried to bring this to the attention state, & federal officials that you & we voted in, but it all seems to fall on deaf ears. i don,t want a hand out or something for nothing. but after having 5 heart attacks i just don,t know where to turn to . maybe some one out there has a solution. i,m open to about anything. i hear about pepole suffering in other countries. but myself & others like me are suffering as well. if i may suggest an idea for myself. get the message to elected officials & drug companies. please do away with the doughnut hole all togather, & stop worrying about getting elected. because you can,t save your ass & your face at the same time. take care of the pepole first. then worry about saving your face & ass next. thanks for your time, & sorry if i offended anyone. frederick w. graves. aka- sonny graves.            January 11, 2012jhonnie5 Help help I have found the answer to concussion problem in N.F.L. No joke Dead serious Want to save our football players from needless injurys anybody want to make millions.Idea will make you say why didnt i think of that            January 15, 2012BaronGeorg I have been traveling for years on the MS Europa , a German Ship. It is mandatory for all passengers and crew to learn and do safety drills every 14 days. The crew go thru additional drills; Fire, Medical, Safety, etc. every month.When the passengers come on b, it is within hours that we all go thru drills, where to go, what to do, assigned to what boat or raft, etc.It does not sound like this is the case with this recent grounding/sinking. One interesting thing is that even those drills do not cover the aspect of a ship tilting left, right front or back.The point is that we do not wait a day for safety, only a couple of hours before the cruise starts.            January 15, 2012mipolitic with the sinking of the cruise ship mishap , i was leaning towards inssurance , because of bad euro and economy, but another fact is that within the last ten days there have been a lot earthquakes in that area that possibly resulted in dislodging some rocks in a underwater slide or upheaveal? worth looking into. i follow the usgs site            January 16, 2012seeitnow Quick question?

February 1, 2012UBUIMI I am a retired computer engineer who served in the Army during Viet Nam. I see no changes in how government is destroying this country and believe politics as usual is not going to bring the changes needed to right this Ship. The following is something I wrote to sum up politics in the world today called "There is a Fire in Us".There is a Fire in us.A Fire that sees the injustice, of yes, even our own, past and present, governments to do that which is right for the future of the people that they claim they represent.Yes, a Fire in us.A Fire that sees the injustice of those who would use mockery, language, thought and deeds against others hoping to put those others into social positions below themselves. Yes, a Fire in us.A Fire that sees though the false proclamations of those who would have us believe in them.There is a Fire in us.A Fire that sees the injustice of those who do not meet the responsibilities given to them by the elections that placed them into the position of responsibility. A Fire that sees the injustice of inequalities, corruption, graft and greed by those in positions of power who would have us believe that they have special rights to be in their positions of power.Yes, There is a Fire in us.A Fire that sees the injustice of those protesting when having to give up their bounties collected by unjust policies, mandates and actions. A Fire that sees the injustice of those who use unjust actions to maintain their position of power over those who they are oppressing. Yes, There is a Fire in us.A Fire that sees the look of love in the eyes of those who have it and knows the look in the eyes of those who do not.A Fire that sees the false heart of those who have it - those nations, businesses, religions, societies, members and individuals who believe they can mask the intentions of their false hearts from those that can see. There is a Fire in us.A Fire in us that raises us to stand for the rights of those who are exposed to the injustice brought to them by the unjust.A Fire in us that raises us to stand though any hardship, through any injustice, through any policy, through any mandate and through any failure to make right the injustice brought to us and to others.There is a Fire in us that does not diminish, even through death.Those who would have us suppress the Fire of Truth in us, have us suppress that which is Just and Right in us, have us suppress the Fire of Liberty in us, have us suppress, in us, the very responsibilities of our Creation; will find that the Fire that burns in the heart of us will smother the inequities created and brought to us by all who cling to falseness.Yes, Just is the Fire in Us.

February 14, 2012Atmasphere Obama: This Is It! Campaign.Blessings President Obama,I have been trying to find a way to send a letter to you Sir. Just want to let you know, so many of my friends, family and business associates are behind you. I truly believe that you are our best hope to turn America around. Sometimes we all get caught up in the energy of the moment, we become reactive, we are expected to respond to criticism and opinion that is not always as popular as the media plays it up to be... We sometimes forget, that it is in the quiet moments,those times when we can sit alone, meditate, only then can we hear the voice within. The same voice that guided you toward the 44th Presidency of these great United States. You are the one Sir, to help find our way through the matrix. I have a possible solution that may help move us toward a brighter tomorrow, if I may share it with you.I believe we should privatize the rebuilding of America, we offer a real opportunity for our citizens that can afford it, to get involved. Instead of punishing those that are fortunate enough to have prospered in this economy, we offer them better tax incentives for re-investing their wealth toward a better America.We promote spending, investment and job creation by taking the responsibility of fixing a broken America out of the hands of our government, by way of bailouts and short sighted solutions, and offer the re-building of America back to American's not only as a financial investment, but as an actual investment in a better tomorrow.Instead of increasing taxes of our financially successful American Citizens, we reward them for their progressive thinking by offering them "Incentivized" investment opportunities, by way of competitive return rates and tax breaks for re-investing their wealth in the rebuilding of America. Our wealthier Americans spend more time trying to hide and shelter their financial success than actually enjoying the blessings they have received... Here is a solution that can create new jobs and economic opportunities while moving America toward a greener more responsible tomorrow...As an incentive to change, we offer the cost of conversion, converting those industry factories, plants and automotive manufacturing facilities to a more efficient, environmentally responsible form of production. We package the cost of conversion as aninvestment to Venture Capitalist and Private Equity Firms as means of revitalizing antiquated industries, thuscreating new jobs, new investments and increased consumer spending by way of new more efficient production and products."Ladies and gentlemen, the seeds of a greener tomorrow, must be planted today." by Don McDanielsWe create what I call Green Groups, of 25 or more, made up of a diverse team of engineers, IndustrialDesigners, Scientist and other industry professionals, who's sole purpose would be to analyze and report upon those industries seeking a new beginning. The Green Groups, to avoid the temptation of corruption will be transparent, chosen randomly in a recorded, open forum, then assigned to participating companies. All analysis and documentation will be published.What ever the cost of converting the company to a more responsible function, that cost as well as the costof the Green Group analysis will be sold to private investment firms at a predetermined investment rate,along with lucrative tax incentives. This will create more jobs, promote spending, help revitalize theeconomy, rid the tax payers of irresponsible government bailouts... and move America toward a greener more efficient tomorrow.The companies submitted to the program, once converted and functioning are responsible for repaying theGreen Loan Investments, the private investment firms.Don McDaniels President/CEOAtma'Sphere EntertainmentPeace!            February 16, 2012mrodden1 This is an election year and all parties want our vote. The economy, taxes, jobs, boarders, foreign polocies, even gay rights have been asked and answered (somewhat) but the question about domestic fuel and how to keep gas prices from reaching so high, that getting from one place to another means sacrificing buying food or paying your rent. As Americans, do we have a say or even the power to reverse this path we are forced to share?            February 17, 2012darkestnight You claimed that you want to post what they think makes them an American. Well, here's my story.First of all I am veteran of the Army. I have been overseas for three years. Most of the people who watch CNN and believe everything you guys report as truth, have likely never stepped foot out of the US. I am going to say no longer feel American, if by that term you mean an arrogant person who believes that the world revolves around this country only; and that nothing else matter. Also, I don't think that Mr. Obama has been a good president. Hell, he shouldn't even be president because there were several things that he did during the 2008 campaign and on election day that were totally illegal. If anyone had the guts call him on those things he would have been disqualified as President elect. One more thing, you and I both know that CNN actually stands for Communist News Network.I will not vote for Obama in November. You people ought to be ashamed at the tricks and lies you have been spinning lately about the republican race. I saw your story about "Panic in the GOP". It was utter garbage. Most likely you people along with Obama and his cronies, might be a little afraid because the candidate that you want to be GOP nominee; Mitt Romney might actually lose and not be the nominee. If Obama gets reelected I would be ashamed to call myself an American.             February 17, 2012darkestnight I saw some people talking about Iran. I also saw the story that was done on Iran's development of Nukes. Report the truth please. Most of their nuclear development has not been done by Russia. Russia likely has been sending them materials to aid in the development process. We will have war with Iran. Obama has made it clear that he believes Russia should be our friend. Since, Iran is a friend to Russia he wouldn't want to upset Russians by going to War with Iran.Also, why are we sending any aid at all to Syria, when it is most likely the Alqueida training capital of the world?            February 17, 2012darkestnight mrodden1 the question has been answered about fuel. We need that Canadian oil pipeline. If it takes getting rid of Obama to get it, all the better, and another reason not to vote Obama in 2012.            February 17, 2012darkestnight Every single person on Ireport who lives in the US, should vote, and also vote no to Obama in the election. More Obama means things will not get better.            February 18, 2012Ltkrisp I couldn't find an area that let's you share what it means to be an American to me. My name is Kris, and I am the great grandson of and Irish-Canadian immigrant who married a sailor during WWII. My Grandfather fought on the USS ST. Louis , the "lucky Lou" . She survived Pearl Harbor and went to tour the entire Pacific campaign. My Grandfather also endured the hydrogen bomb testing in the south pacific. That's one side. The other side migrated from Germany/Austria, and beca,e loggers and miners and helped found the state of Nevada before in went into statehood roughly around 1830. We still work Lumber and gold. My point is simple, they all worked very hard, to give me what I have, and I don't squander it either. I am a professional musician and artist. Be proud of whoever you are, you are a compilation of ,any genes whom got you to be who you are now regardless of gender. Freedom is the hard work and ingenuity to beter oneself competitively with enduring changes and struggles. Welcome to the USA. Believe in yourself, others will always try to bring you down, surround yourself with every ounce of positive energy you can. Remember being an American is ,ore than ideology like on the past. It is now a changing tide..            March 1, 2012YthemertY It's not possible post an article? Only videos or images?

My comments about YouTube ignoring their participants and starting a new ugly design and format have not taken root on CNN iReports.             March 4, 2012LovelyPiano YouTube has taken away our freedom of expression, creativity and individualism. Beginning March 7, 2012, everyone will have one uniform gray design that will be dull and boring. Our beautiful artwork will be totally eliminated and replaced with "dungeon death" on the face of our channels. YouTube also limited the Comment section, and placed them where they cannot be visible because all they want is for Tubers to click on their ads all day and lose the joy that was once a part of logging onto YouTube. The friendly face of YouTube will be terminated forever, and this has negatively affected numerous users. But they aren't concerned about that as long as they simply become a profit-making advertising conglomerate.  There is nothing wrong with profiting, but the LEAST they could do for supportive Tubers is to grant us COLOR FONTS so that we can make our channels partially alive again.  YouTube will be taking the enjoyment out of the "partnership" that once was.

March 13, 2012netta2012 Presidential Reform!As we enter a new millennium and technology will become the front runner in our daily lives even more so than ever, it is extremely important that the person who will have the World's destiny in their hands should be interview by we the people, just like we have to endure a job interview, background check, ahead of time so should the expected President. Every check should be done before even considered to become our next President. All of the skeletons out of the closet ahead of time.This will disallow all of the billions spent on candidates trashing each other, and 1 year of back and forth unwanted ads opposing each other, our lives would be easier and we would feel safe as a world. The best three candidates will then be considered, no matter what affiliation that person has. We the people will decide as a whole the person we want to lead us. This will prevent any crazies for ever getting into the power. This is a new era. If we the people don't exercise our rights to change our country for the better, and change with time, and our circumstances we will all pay the price, as we are doing so now. It doesn't matter how we got here what does matter is how we go forward from here on. We have the power to insist that whoever takes our lives to their hands will truly be for the people safety being number one, stability, and knowing that our freedom and our opinions matter.Things in Washington would change for the better!There will be more to come!            March 21, 2012childrenofth Once again the rally cry for freedom.The freedom word has been used a lot lately by the candidates. Freedom is the foundation that we built our great country on. Freedom for individuals to live without oppression and not to be the oppressor. The freedom to live, "not as prey" and to defend oneself from predators. The freedom to worship the way, "we as individuals" wish to. The freedom to make medical decisions for oneself and ones' dependents. The freedom to elect " CHAMPIONS " to protect us from ones who would wish us harm. Whether it be foreign, domestic or from our selves. Freedom is not a new rally cry. The most notable freedom rally cry came from the fascist party after World War one. Hitler rallied his people behind the freedom word to obtain the power to carryout his ambitions of domination. He singled out many a foe to be hated and feared including, anyone who didn't look or pray the same way they did. At the time I'm sure to the German people, he looked like the savior and champion. The one that would bring them out of poverty and protect them from the cold, cruel world that wanted to do them harm. It took most of the world pulling together in a "World War", to stop this man. So when we hear this " WAR CRY FOR FREEDOM ", with religious overtones. We wonder what kind of monster we might be dealing with and what freedoms we might eventually be giving up. For us to truly be free, we must protect our selves from those who would seek to enslave bodies, "and or" minds. If we are being convinced that our freedom will somehow be enhanced by less people "regulating" what groups of people can do that are governed by the bottom line,"MONEY"; let me remind you of where we are right now and who drove us here. Freedom we have. Jobs we need. The people we voted in office that refuse to do their job, "THE ACT OF COMPROMISE". They must be cast out and replaced by people that will do the job. There will be enough time to fix the deficit when we aren't still trying to pullout of a recession. That is just an excuse to make sure the current administration fails. I know this road we're on is a slow one. It would be faster if people would get out of the way of recovery or get on board. "OUR VOTE IS OUR FREEDOM TO CHOSE OUR DESTINY"!!! We should never allow our selves to give up that freedom to the fear of losing it and it is shameful to hear it used once again to rally a crowd.             March 25, 2012Nonaligned1 Cuban dissidents denounce dozens of arrests ahead of the Pope's arrivalMarch 25 - From Spanish news agency EFE: Cuban dissidents denounced arbitrary arrests of dozens of opponents, including 18 Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White) and threats and intimidation before the arrival of Pope Benedict XVI to the island."As a result of the papal visit, the Castro regime has increased its repressive actions and intimidation against peaceful dissidents," said the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN) in a statement.The CCDHRN says it has confirmed 70 arrests in the last four days especially in the province of Santiago de Cuba, where the pope will start his visit to the island Monday.The commission states that there have also been threats of arrest and intimidation against many dissidents warning them not to attend the Masses offered by the Pope while in Cuba.Las Damas de Blanco, who advocate freedom of political prisoners and human rights, confirmed today in Havana that 18 of its members have been arrested and many others have received threats.No matter the reppression, the Ladies in WHite will try to go to the Mass of Benedict XVI at the Revolution Square in Havana, Berta Soler, the leader of the group, told foreign correspondents.About 18 members of the Ladies in White attended Mass today at the Havana Church of Santa Rita, as they do every Sunday, and then march silently through nearby streets.A similar march last weekend resulted in dozens of them to de detained for several hours."Despite the threat of the repressive forces, we will attempt to go on March28 to the the Revolution Plaza to hear the Mass of the Holy Father, a right we have because no one has the right choose who may or may not participate in a Mass and be close to Good," said Berta Soler.Moreover, the CCDHRN also reported that in Havana and Santiago at least a hundred beggars have been arrested or interned "so as not to be seen on the streets by foreign visitors, including pilgrims and journalists, during the visit of Benedict XVI".The forced internment of these defenseless and completely vulnerable people is a disgusting violation of human rights", said the group led by activist Elizardo Sanchez.At the same time "the government is deploying its enormous bureaucratic mobilization capacity to fill the squares and other places where Benedict would go," according to CCDHRN.

"These are preventive arrests," he added.In addition "a similar number have been banned from leaving their homes or attend Mass or receptions where the Pope will be present", added the leader of the Commission, which is illegal but tolerated by the communist government. AFP (Spanish) Fox News: Crackdown on Dissidents Precedes Pope's Arrival in CubaMarch 26 - At least 70 dissidents including members of the the Ladies in White, a prominent group of wives and family members of jailed political opponents to the Cuban government, have been arrested by Cuban authorities in an effort to prevent demonstrations during the visit of Pope Benedict XVI, opposition organizations say.The Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission, a dissident organization, claimed that the arrests occurred in the city of Santiago de Cuba, the island's second city. Santiago is the home of the Virgin of Charity of Cobre, a tiny wooden statue that is revered by Cubans, where the pope is due to arrive on Monday.The pope will celebrate an open-air Mass Monday evening in Santiago's main plaza then pray at the sanctuary housing the statue Tuesday before heading to Havana, where he will meet with Cuban President Ral Castro  and presumably his brother Fidel.

I definite would like to be a guest on CNN so that I could share my life story to America concerning my past life as a gang member, and how it affected my life. Im now a Minister of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST, deliver from the life of gangbanging. I sent this message to my face book page; and afterwards, it came across my spirit to send it to you. Trayvons family and all the families of America that have teenage children needs to hear my life story before the situation gets ugly concerning the death of Trayvon. I have many more testimonies that could help the families of America in dealing with their teenage children. You can contact me through e-mail: clydebullockministries@rocketmail.com. Please read, and decide for yourself.First of all, my prayers in the Name of CHRIST JESUS our LORD goes out to the family of my Baby Brother Trayvon Martin. So to get my message across, allow me to share a testimony: As I was sitting in the CNN Center this morning, starting my day, watching the news concerning the death of Brother Trayvon, the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD brought a testimony to my spirit to share with Brother Trayvon family, and all the families across America who have teenage sons and daughters:I use to be a gang member in Richmond Virginia where I was born and raised. I am one of the original members of the infamous Main Street Gang that was birth out of the West End of Richmond, causing much havoc to the River City during the 70s. One summer night in 1971 (15yrs old), me and the rest of my gang members were involved in a physical confrontation with members of the Richmond Police Department. During the confrontation, police re-enforcement arrived, and we began running away trying to escape arrest. During the course of my escape, I decided to hide on the side of a building on the corner of Shields and Main Street, with a stick in my hand. As I was hiding on the side of the building, a white Police Officer came running on the side of the building with his gun drawn, becoming startle after spotting me hiding in the dark. These were his exact words to me, Nigger, what the hell is wrong with you? I almost shot you! You standing there, hiding in the dark, with that stick in your hand, I almost shot you! He begins to cry, screaming and hollering at me, saying repeatedly, I almost kill you, I almost kill you! Nigger, I almost kill you! I begin to cry also, seeing how serious he was. He touched me very deeply. He was for real! He was so upset with me, because he almost shot me to death because of my stupidity. He said, Carry your black ass home nigger, dont make no sense! I went on home crying, never telling my mother what had happened; in fact, I dont think I ever told my brothers and sister what happened. My mother went to sleep in CHRIST JESUS never knowing that her son was almost killed at the hands of a white Richmond police officer. The message of this testimony is this; I could have been another Trayvon in 1971, at the age of 16. And my mother would have been protesting on the behalf of her son because he was killed at the hands of a white police officer, never knowing the truth of what happened. All she would have known at that time was that a white Richmond Police Officer killed her son. But the truth is this; a white Richmond Police Officer saved the life of her first born son, through the grace and mercy of GOD. Im not saying that Brother Trayvon was in the wrong, because no matter what, his life was worth more than the situation. The point is, Brothers and Sisters, watch very closely your teenage sons and daughters; they could be involved in something that could cause them their life. Please dont be afraid to challenge and correct them. Nobody knows what really happened to cause Brother Trayvon death but Trayvon, the police officer, and GOD. The police is the only one who could verbally tell his side of the story, and that dont have to be the truth or a lie. But nevertheless, the truth remains with them three; Trayvon, the police officer, and GOD our HEAVENLY FATHER. If the police officer is lying, then he will not escape the judgment of GOD. I do pray that this testimony and the message that it contains made some sense. If I could touch base with the family of Brother Trayvon, I would personally forward this testimony to them. May the PEACE of JESUS be upon each and every one of them during their time of mourning! May Brother Trayvon rest in CHRST JESUS!

I have been a loyal student to the University of Phoenix. But there always seems to be problem with the money that is owed to me. For an example for the last 3 years I have had to remind them to deposit the money that is owed to me through my GI Bill. Not just once literally every time there is a credit on my account, I personally have to call them to remind them that they owe me money. I am now beginning to wonder how much money they have stole out from under me. I thought this is why we as students have financial advisors, so they can take care of issues such as these. For instance the last time which was about a month ago, I filled out a form which is basically stating that I am aware that they are going to release the excess fuds that are owed to me through my GI Bill. So I filled out this form requesting 2036.36 because this was the amount that was owed to me. So what do they do they deposit 4000.00 and now they are stating that I owe them money. This has not just happened one this has happened three times now. So now according to them I owe them 1900 dollars when I have the specific form that I faxed for 2000 dollars, as proof!! So is the University just unorganized or are they trying to steal students money??

That was when my ex-wife told me she just had a baby from her new boyfriend, my name is Michael Esacareno and I starting to think that since her boyfriend can't hold on to any thing. My ex-wife and her boyfriend are trying to scam the court and the childsuport into making Michael Esacareno pay the cost of a child that is not his, if you think, the babby was born in 2010. He turned 1 in 2011, that would make the child 2 in 2012 so there is no way Michael Esacareno is the father. If you ask, my view she is just a scammer.

Entrepreneurs thinking american labor is expensive but using better tools can also reduce the cost and if we use Americans brain its more effective (honest ,integrity etc..)Just My Thought what happens if Americans start thinking not to support who outsourced Jobs.(Taking one mutual Company who exclusively do business with Americans (Insurance , Bank, etc)They always say"We are Mutual Company""Our customers are our priority""Of-course we are doing business with American People"if no Americans no BusinessThink a minuteIf Americans start thinking who outsource their jobs not to buy products from that company meansdo the company exist or not?why every company like outsource model?why the entrepreneurs are not thinking about their country and their own people ..some outsourced jobs are acceptable but not who do business with exclusively by Americans...if company's follow this definitely min 5% reduce unemployment issue..Please comment on this???????            April 18, 2012mattbowen Hi my name is Matthew I'm southern Missouri on well watching cspan today I saw that the so called budget hawks in the majority of the house want to use US tax payers money to build a highway in Canada. I was wondering if there is already a story covering this or a reporter cause please look into it and report on it . Thank you .

April 21, 2012constancet Here is what happened in FL. Just when I think things are going fine, I'm senior out of work living on my social security only. My TRANE A/C unit starts making noise. Quality Control Air had put a flyer in my mailbox so I called them to check it out. They came told me I needed whole new A/C unit to tune of $6400. I asked if my TRANE (8 years old) wasn't still under warranty. They said no, too old, new technology and all I would have to replace whole unit. Lots of song and dance and what a great deal they were giving me for a CARRIER brand. Workmen came and started work, a few hours later I go outside and see that the unit they are installing is not the CARRIER I paid for but some other inferior off brand called Day and Night. I stop work on everything thinking they have messed up the order. Quality Air tells me no the "day and night" inferior brand is a division of CARRIER. Now my stomach aches, red flags flying, wondering what else they lied to me about. I call another A/C company who checks the TRANE compressor wh had been removed from the concrete pad but I would not let them haul away. Guess what, my TRANE is still under warranty and could have been fixed for less than $600. But now the attic TRANE handler which was working fine has been dismantled twisted up and hauled away by Quality Air. This is some kind of bait and switch, fraud scheme here. Quality Owner very threatening; I am in permitting hell with open permit so no other company can pull a new one. Would appreciate any thoughts. Owner of Quality Air has arrest record for Cocaine, DUI, and by some online reviews I found, I am not the first he's done this to. State complaint agencies do nothing except have me fill out forms. Have contacted BBB, FL State licensing board, state attorney, and senior abuse. I fear I will die of the heat before any of this gets settled.

Davila            May 3, 2012Tsixgun In approx 5 days the sentencing of Najarred Walker, will occur in Frederick, Md., as a result of being convicted of first and second degree rape of a 16yr old victim that occurred in Nov 2004, and the New-post so openly protrayed this man and al the forensic DNA, tying him to this crime. The original artical was in April 12, 2011,Frederick Newspaper edition and ultimately resulting in his being convicted due to this information portraying this individual as some form of a serial ratist......without investigating the entire story with folow-up during the Trial! In the court room where the Trial ocured there were no Defense presented in this individuals case and the investigator who initially took the statement from the victim documented two different versions of the victims statement of identification of the assailant. Neither two matched the defendents discription. In addition the defendent stated to the defense cousel that there were witnesses whom were never called upon as defense counsel stated they could not be found...and all the while they were in the Frederick City area....as one was recently arrested on other charges of their own! Additionally, the victim residence was on and near the residence of what was deem a "Party House", during this period in 2004, and that may lead to a very "Doubtiful Testimony", that the victim was attacked while returning from the county Library......speaking of the Library, there are rules and regulations in effect during this time that, a person using the Libray Computers must sign in and out! None of this was investigated to corrobrate the victims whereabouts just before this alleged attack occurred. Ultimately the defendent was not provided a proper defense as attested by several Jurisprudence profession who addressed their concerns to the defendents family members after the Trial. The DNA was evidenced as saliva present on the victims neck..that ultimately conviced the defendent who never denied contact with the victim.....however, not under the Rape circumstances.             May 4, 2012ddpeddicord I struggle daily with mental illness and the aspects of it, that could hinder my success in life. I have two children as seen in my photo...Zoe age 10 and Jadyn age 7. These two beautiful girls, are the driving force behind my every effort in life, without them it would be easy to give up, and slide into oblivion and just kill the time any way possible. Unfortunately, due to my inability to support them with financial stability, they suffer. My girls live with the barest of neccessities, and often do without things that most kids take advantage of and never think twice about, but my girls are strong, and they are fighters for sure...still I see an ever growing sadness and disappointment in their eyes when the look around them and see other childrens lifestyles. I want to stop their sadness as quickly as possible. I was in college last spring, my 2nd semester studying to be a respiratory therapist, but do to excessive abscences while recieving inpatient psychiatric treatment, I was unable to complete the semester. I now have to repay a portion of the financial aid I recieved( believe it or not there was no exception due to my hospitalization that would allow me to repay this money while continuing my education) I have been paying 80 dollars a month out of my SSI check, and still owe 1008 dollars. I do not like to ask for charity, but if it will shorten the time until, I can show my girls that life doesnt have to be all sadness and poverty, then so be it, I will swallow my pride. I am hoping organizations or individuals will help me pay this debt off more quickly so I can return to school and get my degree. ANY amount will be greatly appreciated and the donor will recieve regular updates on our acheivements and the childrens well being. I will not accept any donations personally...rather I will provide information so that the money can be given directly to the school or debt collector. I am not asking for this help for myself, only for my children. I have lived in poverty all my life...I'm used to it. Alternatively, if you cannot help financially, I also would like to recieve any moral support you are willing to offer me with my mental illness, parenting skills, financial skills and other problems that may arise, as my family should not bear the burden alone, Thank you in advance for any type of help you are willing to offer. If anyone can help me with this debt please contact me here on Face Book. THANK YOU For Reading!!!

Ready, 39, was the leader of a group of armed civilians that patrols Arizonas desert near the Mexican border for illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.In one of the 911 calls, Readys girlfriend is heard saying in a raised voice: Oh my God. Hes got a gun. No! before the sounds of two shots.In another call, a sobbing young woman tells a 911 dispatcher that my mom and my niece and my sister are all on the floor. Theyre hurt pretty bad.Asked by the dispatcher about the shooter, the woman said: Its my moms boyfriend, JT Ready.Besides Ready, Gilbert police have identified the victims as Lisa Lynn Mederos, 47, Readys girlfriend; Lisas daughter Amber Mederos, 23; Ambers 15-month-old daughter, Lilly; and Ambers boyfriend Jim Jambob Hiott, 24.Police released some of the 911 calls Monday.            May 10, 2012ryan6357 One of the best teachers that Ive had is My 4th grade teacher Mrs. Hubbell. She tries so hard to teach us. But, some of us zone out. Caleb              May 12, 2012Taviarose My neighbors are the nicest, easy going elderly couple in the world. The man is a ww2 vet and a professional golfer(24 hole in ones). His wife raised three kids and taught water arobics at the rec center. They met right before the war but didn't marry til he came home. The wife was adopted as an older child and moved around a lot before and after. For this reason I believe she tried to make up for that by always being there for her oldest daughter and the other two as well just not to the degree she went to for the oldest. She failed to realize her daughter wasn't missing any thing so making up for it made her a monster. She never suffered any consequences for her actions or learn right from wrong other then she's right everybody else is wrong. All the wife wanted was to be there for her daughter,unlike her mom who was not there for her. But since her daughter had both parents this must have confused the daughter. I guess all I'm trying to say is that parents cannot make up for their own childhood through their children.And if you try your robbing your child of their experiences which will, in the long run, make them resent you. Adopted people have this need to be the last person to not have a family and to let those that have one know how lucky they are to have one, no matter how disfunctional. Not sure who said this but it is true "there is only one thing worse then a bad mother and that is no mother at all.

May 24, 201212spinner Federal Debt  State and Federal Taxes -- the Federal Budget -- Raising TaxesWe, the American Citizens, are constantly complaining about the above mentioned items. They are a continued turmoil in our lives and will constantly be there. People discuss this issue with fear and hate and confusion and anger and frustration. So many different feelings come from this issue and yet at the same time we, the American Citizens, look for someone to blame for them. We unknowingly blame the right people but we dont seem to know who those right people really are. We blame the President, Congressman, and Senators, everyone that is working in a government office. We seem to think that these are the people that are at fault. In simple, we blame the government. Now the funny thing is, Abraham Lincoln said we had a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Okay, if that statement is true than we can only blame ourselves for our tax problems. What we should do now is stop complaining and help those that we put in offices to represent us, the American Citizens, correct the issue. If we were to do this, where would we start? We each have our own thoughts and ideas. My Idea is to take a look at it in this format --- (Federal Debt  State and Federal Taxes -- the Federal Budget. I wont say my full thoughts let me only bring up an issue I see as unfair to the lower class of people. People that dont at the end of a year owe $10,000 or more in taxes. People that owe $10,000 or more search for some loophole in the tax system to get some sort of relief on their tax bill. There is no relief for the lower class that dont owe the much they get the blunt of it by the government raising taxes the next year so that those that dont owe that much have to bear the cost of those that do. You hear on the radio and see on the internet and television that people owing $10,000 can save as much as $8,000 with this relief. Some have shown people owing over $100,000 have saved as much as $80,000. Lets take a look at some of these savings as if they paid the tax due. We will use some fake numbers because I am not sure of the number of people that use these loopholes. Lets use 2000 people using loopholes at an average $50,000 in savings. That would be $50,000 times 2000 people that would be $10,000,000 that could go toward the National Debt. My numbers could be off by 10 times that number of people if so that would be $100,000,000. If that were placed toward our National Debt would they need to raise our taxes? Are the fake numbers used that unrealistic? The size of our population is there and the number of people that make large amounts of money is there. You figure it out. I would strongly urge the American people to take a look at this issue.

I have been acted like a puppet in hands of my sponsor during the above mentioned span of time. Furthermore, I was unable to travel and missed lot of events that came to my life which includes ,death of my father, my family that suffered due to financial issues, looking forward I am pleased to have kind consideration from you to have an immediate action on merit about the cause that I have mentioned in supporting documents. My former sponsor Amhani Baeshin gave my passport to the representative Mahmood Saeed because I got a job under Mahmood Saeeds supervision. But having a problem in profession that was of watchman Mahmood Saeed was unable to have me under his influence. Then Mahmood Saeed advised me to change my profession in Iqama. Then being opined by some of my friends I came to Mr.Musleh Faisal Al Otaibi and requested him to help me out in changing my profession .He asked me to give SAR 6000.00 to him for implementing a change in Iqama. Afterwards without having any official documents from Amhani Baeshin (former Sponsor) in lieu of changing my profession he took me under the sponsorship of his mother. Then I beseech in front of him that, why you did so and on what grounds you took me under your mother sponsorship. Proscribing all my documents that abounds my passport and Iqama he forcefully ordered me to work for him as a taxi driver, I refused to do so but he threatened and projected me to do work as a driver, I started working with him and when the Iqama expiry period came near he took SAR 2800.00 from me as a Iqama renewal charges. Then I applied for my vacation and he refused then I bow before him to please give me vacation but once again he took my Iqama and license by force. Having bearing all this I contacted one of his friend Muhammad Al Shehri (policeman in Jama P.S) on the request of him he gave me Exit Re entry (vacation of 4 months).Spending those vacation in Pakistan and acknowledging the prevailing circumstance of unemployment and financial Crisis. I came back to Saudi Kingdom .I came to them and requested in a noble and decent demeanor that that please restore my sponsorship due to impairment in my health I am unable to continue it meanwhile I suffered from diseases like, High blood pressure, piles and diabetes. But still all my requests went off his ear .During driving taxi my profession on Iqama was watchman but I had LTV license. I got traffic fine approximately SAR 11000.00. Once again he asked me to arrange SAR 6000.00 in order. He will change my profession from watchman to general driver to avert from traffic fine. Having no way out I further paid him SAR 4500.00. Then he changed my profession from watchman to general driver .Bearing and tolerating all troubles I requested him to release me from his job. He refused and harassed me in his office. Reaching my limit, went for Justice in Labor Court .After filing a Sue against him he didnt appeared before the honorable Court in eight hearings consecutively . To fix my problem I decided to have a table talk with him. Then Mr.Kahlid Al Ghamdi called him for negotiation bringing the dispute between us on table.Mr.Kahlid Al Ghamdi contacted my sponsor and organized a meeting on the e17th Jan 2012 at sponsor office. The meeting was held between Mr Khalid and Mr Musleh the sponsor in my absence, the agreement was as follows.1.The sponsor will renew my Iqama and I will pay him amount,2.I am to withdraw the court cause against the sponsor; and3.I will give him the transfer paper in return from my passport.Following the agreement, I was asked to come into the office (as I was waiting in the car outside the office) and handed over SAR 6500.00 for Iqama renewal.The following day as per the agreement I withdrew the case from the Saudi Labor Court and submitted the withdrawal letter to the sponsor on the e18th Jan 2012. While I was there the sponsor asked me to pay SAR 1000.00 For additional coast related to Iqama renewal.After three weeks, the sponsor had renewed my Iqama, but has asked for SAR 1100.00 as additional expenses incurred. I visited his office on 15th Feb 2012 in anticipation of obtaining the passport and Iqama.At this meeting, the sponsor told me that I have to work for him as a Taxi Driver, I refused to work for him given his character and relationship history.The sponsor asked me to handover my license as well, which I refused to do. I was physically held and had my license forcefully taken off me. In addition the sponsor forced me to sign a blank piece of paper as well as got my finger prints on the same piece of paper.Esteeming high expectations and seeking justice from you honorable people, I and my coming generations will be thankful to you if you put an end to my miseries.THANKS AND REGARDS,SHAHMEER GADEHI Mobile:00966 501668250Email : shahmeergadehi@gmail.com            June 13, 2012YEMINTUN I have a question. How to delete uploaded iReport ?Please, I need to remove wrongly uploaded post.             June 15, 2012athreemg Myanmar Breaking News I have heard that the government set security force in Maungdaw, Arakan because of the current instability. The Bangali Rohingya torrists are burning houses and killing innocent people including government police and women and children in Maung Daw, Arakan. According to Laywaddy updated news, over 30 villages were burnt by Bengali Rohingya terrorists holding guns. There are currently fighting seriously with the government soldiers in Maundaw. According to a government official who is working in the Migration Department, there are 95% Bangli Muslim in Maung daw and 85% in Buthidaung, which are border area very close to Bangalish, only apart Narf River. Because of the rocket population growth and the huge amount of illegal migration of the Bangali Musilm, there are much more population different between the local people and Bengali Musilm. They had destroyed and fired nearly a hundred Arakan villages and killed thousands of Arakaneses during the conflict in 1942.Started from 1951 and 1952, they tried to build a Muslim State by trying to occupy Maungdaw and Buthidaung.The name "Rohingya" came into existence last 50 years ago and became well-known these years. I would like like to encourage all the local and international journalists to study historical background and the current situations of Arakaneses in Arakan. In my point of view, a journalist needs to understand the truth clearly to write. As most of the people from international think, we are not majority in our own State, Arakan. Bangali Muslim people become majority in Arakan.We are struggling people trying to survive in our own state.In Maundaw, the situation is very risky and the government servants are sent to government building. "There is no enough security in Maungdaw. Arakaneses villages surrounding Bangali Muslim villages are very risky. The situation may worse at night" said Local people form Maung daw.The government has to take fully responsibility for the security of its citizens before it is too late. And I would like to suggest the international community to form a special committee to conduct research on "Rohingya" as it is the root cause for all problems. In conclusion, I would like to request all the local or international journalists, writers, social workers, and leaders and broadcasting Medias not to give easy comments on "Rohingya" issue as it might lead to genocide like in Rwanda Credit To Si Hpyo Lin            June 16, 2012whitneyrain Hello everyone my name is Whitney Rain Denham, who is a 27 year old pre op transgendered woman in which am in transition to become the woman I was meant to be.

June 20, 2012calico02 Is it me, or is everything that we do these days over the top. Technology. It think it's wonderful, but it has it's place. Everyone steps around the fact that, PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED! When you can't walk into another room without your phone, something's wrong. If the first thing that you do in the morning is look at your phone or laptop... really...do I have to spell it out? How long will it take. What is to become of our young people. Take the blinders off!We're treading some dangerous water when it comes to politicians trying to make laws to "protect us". I don't think so. I don't need someone telling me what I can and can't eat. It's my decision. The American people will only take so much. Mark my words. Come to think of it, maybe the reason there is so much obesity is not because of "sugary drinks" but because we spend so much friggin time on technology, we don't walk or talk anymore!            June 22, 2012Victim2012 SILENCED IN SPRINGFIELD MOTrue Divorce Story;Most Recent 2012:Judgement on divorce entered;Security of this judgement entered increased to level 3. Consent judgement filed(June/20/2012). My position:"I did not consent to this divorce decree; True I want out of the marriage but I do not have a mental illiness that requires supervised visitation and nor do I need to be humiliated in a divorce decree that seeks to force me to see a psycologist and a psychiatrist inorder to have access to see my children under supervised visits."My Case:I was sent to whom Miss-diagonosed me was a friend of this Judge. I was ordered to see him and it was docketted that I requested to see him. Same Psycologist tricked me into being addmitted into a hospital for panic and high blood pressure symtompts I talked to him about. He led me to the hospital for check up and told them I was sucidal where I was kept for a week and released. I voluntarily signed up for a mental help study to proof that he was wrong and I got that proof after a year with no meds other than high blood pressure that the diagonosis was in full remission. Even though that, this diagonosis cannot be in full remission. Either u have it or you don't. It is called Schizophernia. Same Psycologist after he diagonosed me with this mental illiness said I would not be able to see my children after 15 years. Guardian on first visit with him had told me this; "Why did you get rid of the first judge because the second is less fair that the first". This rang a bell in my mind and still rings a bell. I have appeased the court, beged these people by send them email of jesus on a cross to indicate that I was a christian just like them and whatever was occuring needs to stop but this was used to indicate proove their point that I was hallucinating and planned on killing myself. June/18/2012; hearing was set when courts thought I was on meds for a mental illness and was considering to grant me Unsupervised visitations. I then decided to tell them so that I have not had any syntompts for a year and had not been on meds for this diagonoses. The courts then went 360 on me so did the Gardian. My Guardian-who told me that the male guardian will not reccomend me for unsupervised visitation because I was not taking any meds for this mis-diagonosis and it was pointless to have this hearing because it would be denied. I pushed into having this hearing as I was dead set on finding out more about what was going on in my divorce that have left me speachless. This hearing was a closed door and took place at 11.30pm where I was praised for my mental health progress which I really did not have then told that I will need to hire a attourney to modify. I played along with them. Fall/2010.Court ordered supevised visitation. I made my arguement that I did not do anything wong to go to a supervised visitation and there was no substantial evidence that requires me to be seeing my children in such a place. Court then made me a deal, "get a stable house and see my own Psycologist (Bradford) and I may considered unsupervised visitation.Fall/2010. Paid an attourney $500 retainer fee as agreed to take up my divorce and enter his appearance for me but he took my money and never did.Fall 2010, Sued and evicted a tennant noteriouse for not paying his rent. Tennat majical was able to afford an attourney whom at the end of trial De Novo gave the Judge (Cater) a high 5 while I await for a judgement against me. I felt setted up and a silent message filled my head after seeing this action. November/2010. Same attourney for tennant sued me and after a year long with an attourney provided by insurance company. Case was settelled and judgement as dismmised by both parties. "My position was firm and well asserted. This was a conspiracy even though I spent 1 week in a mental instituition which was a direct result of a trick pulled by (Bradford).New challenges awaite me while I fight for my right to be a father in an interracial divorce case that I have been silenced on with a treat of losing my children for good if I dear speak out. Facts and evidence are backed up. There is no such thing as false in this story. I am very concerned on my safety and safety of my family for being a witness against wired behavior from 3 judges in Green County Courthouse and One Guardian. Please help me. I am leaving in fear in this city and if I move, I will not be able to see my children. My new greatest Challenge is finding an employer who will not judge me by looking at casenet. I am innocent in all cases on casenet. I have fought for my right to see my children, evicted a tennant noterious of not paying his bills. Place a liens on my house to avoide it being taken by the bank while I went through a divorce. The protective order against me by my ex-spouse was granted on default and asserted when I got misdiagonoses. My arrest for violating a protective order was an attempt see my child            June 22, 2012Victim2012 ren by getting their mother back.

WASHINGTON  D.C. police have stripped an officer of his police powers and gun as they investigate his alleged threat against Michelle Obama, the District's police chief said Friday.Police and the Secret Service have not yet determined precisely what was said by the officer or his intent, Police Chief Cathy Lanier said Friday. During a Wednesday breakfast with other officers, police officials have said, the officer threatened to shoot the first lady.A genuine threat would be a crime and referred to the U.S. Attorneys Office for prosecution, Lanier said. A comment made in jest would be disciplined as conduct unbecoming an officer, she said."If it was a threat, it was criminal," Lanier said.The officer under investigation, whom authorities have not named, works on motorcycle escorts and has been with the force for about 17 years, Lanier said. She said he was put on paid desk duty and his badge and gun were revoked after the alleged threat was reported to a supervisor by another officer.The comments were said to have been made Wednesday morning over breakfast at a downtown restaurant with at least five officers present. They allegedly involved shooting the first lady, according to police officials.A group of officers from the Special Operations Division were at the restaurant when the conversation turned to the first lady, the police officials said.Several police officials said they had received initial reports the officer used his mobile phone to display a picture of the firearm he intended to use. Those officials later said he may have used an application on his phone that makes the sound of gunfire.Lanier declined to address whether a photo of a gun was shown or other details. She also declined to discuss where the conversation took place or how many officers have been interviewed during the investigation."It is very early on," she said. "We are not 100 percent sure what the statement was that was made."On Friday, Lanier addressed the possibility the officer's alleged statement was intended as humor."There's absolutely no place for jokes that could be perceived as a threat to the first lady" or anybody else, Lanier said. "That's not funny," she said, adding that her department's officers "get it."Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan declined to comment on the investigation Friday.The Special Operations Division performs escorts for the first family and other dignitaries. The department takes pride in that work and does it "flawlessly," Lanier said.The allegation of a threat has left officers across the force frustrated and angry, she said. If proven true, "the outrage and hurt" in the department "cannot be overstated," Lanier said."You don't say things like that, especially when you have access to the South Grounds of the White House and a gun on your hip," said a Special Operations officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. "It's a black eye to our unit. It's an embarrassment."            July 23, 2012Akuruka My Motivation is to become a transformational leader, am the type of person that motivates and inspires people to perform at levels far beyond anything that they had previously thought possible.Keep People In the Know?Transformational leaders empower others by keeping them "in the know," by keeping them fully informed on everything that affects their jobs. People want and need to feel that they are "insiders," that they are aware of everything that is going on. There is nothing so demoralizing to a staff member than to be kept in the dark about their work and what is going on in the company.Leadership experience as suchLeadership experience is something that encourages to doing your best. It is like an impulse to some actions that determines the type of human behavior. The stronger your leadership experience is the better result you will get.Leadership experience is usually presented by specific emotions that may have either positive or negative characteristics. Basically, it refers to a complex of tangible and intangible factors that provide high-quality and highly productive work.Goals of leadership experienceCommonly leadership experience can be considered as an abstract object or as an economic category. All of the above describes leadership experience in general. As an economic category, it refers to systematic phenomena derived to stimulate workers to perform well.? To attract new employees;? To reveal workers' potential and hidden talents;? To retain good and perspective employees.Leadership experience typesAs we have already mentioned, leadership experience can be positive and negative. Although both characterize leadership experience well, neither the first nor the second one reveals the entire features. Thus, there exist other types of leadership experience.? Intrinsic and extrinsic leadership experience;? Positive and negative leadership experience;? Stable and unstable leadership experience;? The motive of self-affirmation;? Motif identification with another person;? Power leadership experience;? Procedural content motifs;? The motive of self-development;? The motive to achieve;? Pro-social (socially important) motives;? Affiliation motive. Plays a great part in our everyday life. Once an individual sets any goal, he or she will not succeed without reasonable ground. Thus, writing, one should describe its importance and express it as an essential lever to successful performance.To make a good explanation of how to compose a good and appropriate, we shall deepen into the core of leadership experience concept. We will try to show guiding lines and supporting features that may help enhance your motives.

August 8, 2012DCTOT Hello my name is Curtis E Mozie aka C-Webb, I have been filming street gang violence in Washington DC since 1981 with my video camera. I created a safe house where I mentor youth at risk. There I interview them with my video camera as they give their living confession. Then later on I film these same young men out laying in the streets gunned down from gang violence, I then record them in the emergency rooms as they die from their gunshot wounds as the family members stand over top of their dead loved one crying calling out their names. With that said I have written a book memoir"Beyond The Yellow Tape: Life & Death On The Streets Of DC" which I will release this fall maybe in September. I will be posting my book trailer on ireport soon so stay tuned and witness this historical critical acclaimed book memoir trailer its gonna shock you on what I've captured on tape over 27 year time period up to now. Along the way I gained the support of NBA all-star and TNT NBA host Chris Webber and rap star Nasir "NAS" Jones together were trying to make this world a better place free from gun violence.

August 21, 2012UallRwrong Even though I am not an Obama fan, I am a registered Democrat. I voted for Hillary, because I knew it would be Bill all over again. I felt she would have had the support and loyalty that she deserved. I was wrong. Republicans had stayed loyal to their party. Why couldn't we have done the same? Democrats chose an unproven over the chance to make a bold statement. I dislike Obama because of what came out of his own mouth. I can't over look the obvious and it has nothing to do with what others have said. His own words and the actions he has admitted to are not at all what I'm about. We talk about Romney's past, so we should be fair and hear it from both sides now. You can try to get people to see the light and some will choose to put on shades.            August 21, 2012UallRwrong Wow! Some of these posts are..........Did some of these people fly over the Coo koo's nest, or what? Whirling birds and crayons don't have anything on these people.....            August 21, 2012UallRwrong I can see why some people have a problem with guns. My uncle was shot by his best friend on accident. My mother flat out hated guns, but my dad was different. I had the best times with my father going out to the property to shoot at targets. It was great and I loved the time my dad spent with me. I grew up collecting guns and I didn't know it was such a touchy issue with many, until later in life. I chose to be a good negotiator and to see to it I never use a gun in any way to settle arguments, or to use them as a control item. They are my life long hobby and an art form. People have a right to their own opinions, but as long as they don't force upon other's what they consider wrong we will all get along peacefully. I can't stand cats either, but even though they destroy my wife's flower beds, ruined the paint jobs on my trucks, and breed diseases and more cats, I don't go knocking on everyone's door that own cats and tell them they need to get rid of their disgusting animals. I just take out my trusty bow and pop em in the head and throw em in the nearest river. PFFF!!! Just kidding. I just have to live with it like everyone else. Please do the same with your cats as a responsibled gun owner does with their guns. Keep em inside and keep everyone unaware of their existance.            August 29, 2012tweetiepie Watching CNN 2nite, GOP..red pop ups under video are bothersome. Some issue statements are not appropriate.There is ONE issue I would like to address: Who does OBAMA THINK HE IS , GIVING AWAY 7 ISLANDS IN ALASKA TO THE RUSSIANS ? BY WHOSE AUTHORITY ? THESE ARE OIL BEARING SANDS. I AM SHOCKED AND APPALED ! WE NEED A CHANGE, VOTE ROMNEY !             August 31, 20125rod Mitt Romney as CEO/Principle Owner of Bain Capital, over recent years, bought KB Toys for approx. $18K, built up a huge amount of debt by purchasing products from small vendors on credit, Romney then sold the products that he bought on credit and didnt pay the small vendors back, Romney withdrew approx. $120mil. And then declared bankruptcy and only paid the vendors .10 cents on the dollar for their products. My brother was one of the toy vendors that Romney stole approx. $2mil. from. The court papers were filed sealed. But my brother has copies...Mitt Romney as CEO of Bain Capital bought up companies and then destroyed them. Stealing millions of dollars from middle class people like my brother. This is not how we want our country run Mitt Romney is a Bastard!Mitt Romney belongs behind bars!!!

One thing about those folks who are over-dosing on their dental creams and getting zinc poisoning? Ah...knock it off. The story about the kid who found his stolen bike in the homeless person's tent, but thought they were probably at work, because no one was there...good thinking.            September 4, 2012gb9000 What's the maximum size of a story?            September 10, 2012alainsojourn how can i delete entries?            September 14, 2012beltempo I'm amazed, special interest experts, politicians etc. are asked "Did you think the USA, Pres.Obama, should have been more prepared for violence against those Americans in our Embassys"? What a stupid question, we were not the perpatrators of the Horrific events of 911,why should we be afraid of violent protests? Muslims are inbred with violance, cut off hand-stealing, stone a women for adultary, kill members of the sect you are not a part of and suicide bomb or car bomb any one to prove a point,a point they're not even sure of.            September 14, 2012commonsalism How ironic it is in our world today!were freedom could be spoken felt expressed as a right above the price on which it is was bought!that actually some thought that the first amendments is mightier than the ten commandments and that it is a grotesque thing to publish a nude photos of mere mortals and is also a violation of their privacy as royal couples not saints not prophets,or even honest in deeds or action!such a shame that i a christain feels so betrayed today that we have gone too far to acknowledge a man made law over the golden law proclaimed by JESUS Do unto others what you will have them do unto you!amen isnt that also an interpretation of the fisrt amendments and why is antisemititism more powerful than the first amendments please we should always remember that there is always a price paid for freedom and we should always think about its cost. is it worth it.my heart goes to all who lost a loved one in this time of searching on what is right and what is not.

ANY CANDID VIEWER MIGHT THINK THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS GETTING FREE MEDICAL SERVICES AND A FREE HOUSE IN VENEZUELA, WELL, SADLY ENOUGH, ITS NOT TRUE. LAST WEEK HOSPITALS IN VENEZUELA WERE SHORT BUDGET TO RUN CT SCANS AND X-RAYS ON CANCER PATIENTS, AND OUR CRIME RATE IS 18000 MURDERS A YEAR. WONDERLAND, HAH?            October 1, 2012GOLDSHINE THERE IS A WISE POPULAR SAYING IN VENEZUELA THAT FITS PERFECTLY THE WHOLE BEHEMOTH CHAVEZ PROPAGANDA: NOT EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE OUT OF GOLD SHINES.             October 2, 2012Pan1971 My story many might not care for and many might be going through the same as I. Im on a fix income that is not a lot. I have many medical problems. I take 19 or more medications and I required many yearly tests that is required do to my heart problems, diabetes and some medications that are very dangerous to me but I need them to live. I have many other health issues that are so many to mention here. I have Medicaid insurance that requires a very insane spend down that I have to pay but cannot afford. It eats up half of my income. I have rent utilities, food and other medical expenses that Medicaid does not cover. I have to make a decision. I pay the spend down to buy my life saving medications or I can have a place to live, eat and pay my bills but not be able to buy my medications, go to my many doctors and procedures. I cannot get any full coverage insurance because of my pre-existing medical problems. When you pay spend down it is basically buying very expensive insurance that a well to do person can afford but a fix income person cannot. I have gone months without insulin, heart medications, not going to my doctors or dialysis because I cannot pay this expensive spend down. My doctors are concerned because this is causing damage to my body. I usually end up in the hospital because of complications. I then of course create a bill that will meet my spend down but this is where the problem begins. The billing hospital department sends everything that is required to show I met the spend down but social services seems to find something wrong and they denied coverage. They never call the billing department to say hay we need this to activate his coverage. It just sits there and I have no coverage. I call every day to both places. Billing department tells me that they are sending everything Social Services is asking and they send me a bill. I send this bill that clearly shows everything they need to activate my Medicaid. Guest what is next, I responsible to pay this Spend Down that I cannot afford. Again I am stuck in this insane cycle. I want to live but this Spend Down is putting an early headstone in my life.            October 4, 2012lynn1423 rommney needs to quit now            October 6, 2012steelers0307 Hello, I have been trying forever to get some help with this matter, but nobody seems to care at all. There is a very serious problem of fear of reporting unfair labor practice in Walmart. I worked there for almost 10-years with an excellent work history, up until we got a new store manager who was extremely verbally abusive to employees including a mentally handicapped female who he would bash until she was hysterically crying. You could hear her wailing across the store, and when I suggested to employees that we report it they said they were afraid they would be fired. I said we have rights and laws in this country and we do not need to be afraid to report abuse, especially of the handicapped. They said I was naive, and that everyone knows Walmart controls the government and everything with its money and lawyers and prides themselves on being able to get away with doing anything they want, I had more faith and trust in our system than that. I told myself from the begining, do the right thing, tell the truth, follow the rules, and trust God, and i began reporting the abuse to upper management. Before you know it the abusive manager started letting me know he was angry with my reporting him and fired me. That was just the begining of the mess. I went to the NLRB and they filed a charge on walmart for firing me for engaging in protected activity.  Walmart then forced me to drop the charge before they would reinstate my job, and then harshly retaliated on me in many ways including false write ups and 2 more wrongful terminations shortly after i returned. When I went back to the NLRB as they had told me to do should this occur, Walmart gave perjurious testimony to the NLRB and told numerous extremely slanderous and defamatory lies in order to have the case dismissed. I have struggled very hard through 2 dismissals before obtaining my NLRB files through FOIA and managing to prove so many lies that walmart had told the NLRB, that i believe that is why The Deputy General Counsel finally told me to re-file my case. It is now back open, but not going well. Despite the sheer obviousness of Walmart's gross ILLEGAL retaliation against me, along with eyewitness statements, including a police report and absolutely solid documented proof of Walmarts deliberate obfuscation and outright lying to the NLRB all the way through the investigation, the Regional NLRB has somehow inconceivably again dismissed my case. It is now back under appeal to the NLRB General Counsel in Washington, DC again.  Walmart has gone to great lengths, by doing things like what they did to me, in order to instill an atmosphere of fear of reporting in the employees. Everything is not fine at all in Walmart, in fact nobody has any idea how bad it really is because walmart has carefully ensured that the employees are so afraid to report wrongdoing that they won't even say anything when they hear a mentally handicapped female hysterically wailing across the store and hiding in the break room from the ongoing extreme verbal abuse of the store manager, and when the one guy naive enough to say something speaks up, he is promptly fired and subjected to many forms of retaliation up to and including false terminations and having his name defamed and slandered to the NLRB. I could go on and write a book about everything that I alone have been through, not to mention what others have been through with this evil tactic used by walmart to keep their employees quiet about the truth of what really goes on in those stores on a daily basis, but it seems nobody would probably even care. If you could please get back to me to at least confirm that you have recieved this I would appreciate it. Meanwhile I have lost my job, my career of nearly 10-years, and probably any chance at ever retiring in my lifetime all because I reported employee abuse including of a mentally handicapped female by a store manager in our walmart store.

Rza, this morning (10/08/2012 @0845PT) was really " dissecting almost every word of Romney during the debate.How about doing the other way around or are you also an extension of MSNBC or the government? I didn't know you "bend" that low; that you have lost the real meaning of journalism.I don't really favor being like obama pleasing the jihadist or anybody who wants to kill the American people. If you are, then you belong to other countries not here. Does that offend you? Europe and the Middle East are literally "laughing" at us! Middle East will tell us in our face, "We don't want Western ideas" in our country. So what's wrong in us telling or making comparison with other countries? Just asking?We rely on you to give us facts, not your opinion. We have our own reasoning to decide as long as we're given the right facts, but DON'T MISLEAD US please.Thank you.MS            October 9, 2012juanvalle DENUNCIA ENTREGADA A CAPRILES RADONSKY.DENUNCIA ENTREGADA A ANTONIO LEDEZMA.ANTONIO ECARRI.AL SECRETARIO DE PRIMERO JUSTICIA.

October 10, 2012rcgsr THANK YOU FOR TRYING, MR. PRESIDENT, BUT The last four years are proof, we cannot afford Pres. Obama any longer. If he is re-elected the national debt and our trade deficit will continue to go up and the country go down and out. . D.C. will not be able to borrow and the whole system will melt down. There will be food lines in America that will make 1932 look like the good old days. How did this happen? As the greed in D.C. increased, honesty, dignity and integrity went out the window. The Democrats want to win so badly that all they can think to do is to call one of our most honorable, ethical, intelligent and unselfish men, Mitt Romney, a liar. This, in fact, makes Obamas group the liars. Obamas supporters did not even have enough time to study Gov. Romneys proposal before they were calling him a liar on CNN and other networks. Their party, Harry Reid, Nasty Nancy and friends should all be called on the carpet for all their lies. Harry and Nancy should resign their positions. I voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and never will again. He has had his chance to do what he said he would do and by no stretch of the imagination did he do anything to stop the downward skid. We must accept Mr. Romney on November 6, 2012.Richard Geisland Sr. Davie, FL Ph: 954 474 3660 Fx: 954 957 5710 rcgsr2@msn.com             October 12, 2012aracely21 kklp[-,=]            October 12, 2012Wilco3456 Southfield Police Officers car jack me,2 of them threw me on the ground face down,got on my back,handcuff me.

I never understand how voters, like me, cast their votes. Here is my view about favorable and unfavorable candidates. Favorable presidential candidate is first elite of knowledge because of the ability to dissect principles to get the right judgement. Unfavorable presidential candidate is elite of power or asset. Thinking how to gain $n is not leadership.             October 16, 2012Jeddallebach Why can't Romney admit that most of President Obama's initial focus after taking office was to prevent the collapse of the US and global economy and was prevented from championing his own policies and plans that would have made an even more productive recovery than what we have seen so far. Considering where 2008 started, we ARE much better off than where we could have been!!!!!!! We were destroyed by 'W' and the GOP's policies for 8 years!!!!! DON'T LET THE GOP start us again on that ridiculous downhill trajectory!!!!!!!            October 16, 2012Jeddallebach Richard, from Davie: Please wake up.......            October 16, 2012Jeddallebach Romney's interests lie only with his own. He will say, or lie, anything that will provide a path to his end, regardless if it the truth or not. It simply gives politicians a bad name! At least Obama speaks the truth; detrimental or not. Shame on you, Romney!!!            October 16, 2012onyx4me All Romney did was attack the President. Romney certainly does not know what National Security means. No Tax rate was offered, especially since there are more retired,disabled and poor that pay 28% plus in Social Security Taxes and income up to $36,000, or so, dollars, and that is twice what Romney paid in taxes. I did not hear anything but middle class. People are receiving "$13.00 dollars A MONTH" in food stamps. What are you going to get for that? Maybe a couple gallons of milk and a package of cheese? It will spoil before the month is up.             October 16, 2012onyx4me Another thing is where does Romney think he is getting off saying 60% taxes for the rich will stay, when he only paid 14%? WTF? Jobs Creations need to talked about in millions not hundreds of thousands. Obama is correct on every count of the issues stating he also could not pass some legislation because congress has been so lame. I thought there was no religion in politics. How and what does he base his decisions on?             October 16, 2012onyx4me Was Romney actually ordained to ministry and When? He was never specific about anything.            October 17, 2012A66hawk How can Romney blame the Whitehous and the Obama administration for the Lybia incident. That is like blaming Bush for 911. That's not american. Then blame Kennedy for vietnam. Thats not very american to point blame, it's american to seek justice. I am a 8 year veteran, and Romney's comment is disingenuous.            October 18, 2012MadMax Testing 1 2 3........            October 18, 2012MadMax OBAMA2012Moving us  FORWARD            October 20, 2012Glenwit Twelve years ago, I developed pain in my right hip. It took thre years to convince an orthopedic surgeon that it was my tendon instead of my back. By the time they did the surgery, I had necrosed 80% of my abductor tendon. The pain didn't stop then and I required a morpine pain pump. When this was removed, the dura would not hold a stitch so they had to remove bone, visualise the dura, and oversew it. I spent four days in the ICU and lost litres of CF through the right lower quadrant wher the pump was placed. I finally got relief, and when I had pulled out the atrophied gluteus medius. I then lost the rotator cuff of both shoulders including tendons that attached the bicep to the bone. No-one thought that this may be more that a coincidence, except me,so I began to reseach. I had it down to genetics or an autoimmune disease. Because my birth mother had dropped dead at the age of thiry-five for no apparent reason, my first priority was genetics. After a lot of research, I went to a genetisist who diagnosed me with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. I think this goes above and beyond being an empowered patient I had to become my own doctor as no-one thought that these symptoms may be more than a coincidence. I think my story may help other people. By necessity, doctors have to specialise because there is too much knowledge for one person to comprehend. At the same time, no-one is willing to think outside the box. I am an RN, so had a working knowledge of medicine, but what of the peoplethat don't. I almost think that a patient needs an advocate when they go to the hospital for a procedure other than the simple ones. Can you give me and others some answers. Because of what I have been through, I would like to turn this into a positive experience that may help others. Than-you. G WithellPS; I am lucky enough that I live very close to the Texas Medical Centre, where the best care in the world is given, once a diagnosis is made.

Thank you to everyone involved            November 3, 2012melbee9999 Domestic Animals as well as birds,bunnies,turtles,snakes,lizards are being sold at fleamarkets. They are subjected to horrible conditions. Hot/Cold weather depending on what state you live in. These poor animals live in cages from the time they leave their place of confinement to the time they leave their place of sale. The cages are dirty, unkept, no or dirty water/food. Law enforcement simply do not understand the laws alot of the times regarding fair animal housing. According to (Florida State Law Ordinance 828.29) Birds must have a perch of a specific diameter. Only a certain amount of birds allowed in cages. Dogs/Cats must be able to turn around freely and their paws should not be on the bottom of a wire cage. They should have a platform to stand on.The dog/cat sold should also have a notice of the"Lemon Law" document . This document should ALWAYS be included in the sale of the animal. This states that a Vet has cleared with a "Bill of Good Health"! Unfortunately, the fleamarkets only care about the minimal fee for the space rented. They DO NOT require licensing of the individuals selling these helpless animals. Most dog/cats come from puppy mills or trapped by the seller for free. In some cases, the dogs have been stolen from their loving owners, especially if they are a rarer breed. The laws state that the seller MUST have a current Vet certificate of good health and proof of vaccinations of all domestic animals sold. THEY DO NOT!! Most of the animals are sick, dying and starved to death especially if they do not get sold.Since the overwhelming majority of retail pet stores are exempt from federal law, the primary authority on retail pet store regulation is state law. There are fifteen states that do not have any laws regulating Retail Pet Stores. They are: AL, AK, HI, ID, KY, LA, NM, ND, OK, SD, TN, UT, WA, WV, and WY.In some states, sellers who intentionally or knowingly misrepresent an Animal's health or fitness may also face additional civil or criminal penalties. Some unscrupulous pet stores have lost their licenses and the ability to ever sell animals again! If you live in any of these states I have listed above, this is more of a reason to get involved! Please sign this petition to help STOP this inhumane treatment.Thank you,Melody F.            November 4, 2012DaveRome75  DID Romney go to jail for the Rape of that little girl ???

Well, to pour salt on their wounds, the US Postal Service is charging outrageous fees to do so. The initial cost to start-up mail forwarding is $14.99. Thereafter, it's $14.99 per week. I know the USPS is hurting, but to take money from people who who lost everything and who are hurting is criminal and is flat out price gouching.Is this legal?

We are both 30, we both have a child of seven. We both go to sleep the night in bed with the woman we love, not before we covered the child duvet that is beginning to be cool, eh? We both kiss the girl on the forehead, go to bed and hug the woman, you are in Gaza and I in Tel Aviv. Before we fell asleep, we both think the next week at work, and the heavy responsibility of providing for our families. To feed the child, and more importantly - the woman will know that we are real men, eh Khalil? ;-) We both probably think about sex and fall asleep again only with this thought.We are just alike, Khalil, but there is something different.Your child will die tonight.You will not find it in the morning. You wake up in the night the sound of an explosion. Your whole house tremble. Parts of the ceiling fall on you. You tear off the girl's room, and find the northern wall of her room is gone, and she is lying on the floor, completely burnt. Do not worry, you Khalil, she does not was burned alive. She died at the scene of the explosion blast waves, and then flared. From acting on you? Not? And suddenly a guy will introduce himself Jamil, and will start filming her.Come on, before you get angry at Zionist pigs murderers have children, let's talk about Imad, your neighbor.You remember he came to apply for a loan a year ago? Yes, I know you give him if you had more money. But do not worry. He came out. Someone offered him 2,000 shekels a month, if he will rent one of the rooms in his house for him. So last year, not seen, one room apartment of Qassam rockets Imad filled. Know? Tube length of 2 meters, it contained about ten pounds of explosives? So in this room were 50 rockets. And this room, Khalil, shared a wall with your girl's room. It says half a ton of explosives attached pillow. How did you sleep quietly at night? Imad did not tell you?But wait, do not get upset about Imad. Is in financial difficulties, and all he can think of is to buy food for his children. He was desperate. Jamil, the guy who pays his rent, convinced him that the room is just a warehouse, and not to use these rockets. So forget Imad. Let's talk a second about the fire, and understand why they are bad.What rockets, Khalil? A rocket is like a bullet. Where directing it where it hits. Only unlike a rifle, it has an engine that burns all the way and extends its range. Fire, for example, comes up about ten miles., And how you can adjust the gun shoot ten miles? You can not. Devalue. And to be sure, shoot ten rockets together. We call it "volley". Rocket users do not care what hurt, what missing. Shoot a lot of the city, and hope that something will fall on a kindergarten. World call it "terrorism." And Israelis do not like terrorism. We have a kink in my brain, and we want to keep our civilians. So we spend millions of dollars and buy missiles, it's like a rocket but they hit it, you allow us to hit the warehouses of rockets and launchers. We can fire rockets and shells in a general ammunition but then we hit a lot of your citizens. And we do not want. So we are very costly missile launchers and very precise on your ammunition depots. And what to do, sometimes old little girls with head adjacent to the warehouse rockets.But wait, before you get angry at his missiles Zionist pig still hurt you girl, let's talk a moment about Jamil.Jamil is a Hamas activist, and his role is to "warehouses" such as that of Imad, and care will be stored in the rocket. That's it. We call it "quartermaster", but a bit different. Jamil received some instructions: first, that warehouses are not close to each other. The other, that they are in residential neighborhoods. At kindergartens. At the hospitals and the elderly. Close to the wall of your daughter. And you know what? That do not really care Jamil your daughter die. In fact, it will come with its iPhone, photograph the burnt body of your child, and will YouTube. As they did on the first day of the "pillar of cloud".Now you can get annoyed. Yes, Jamil.But Khalil, my friend. Not enough to worry about the Jamil. You need to get upset at Hamas. Is a sovereign you, and he decided on this strategy. Hamas invests the majority state from militarization your house, build a launch of the Hospital, and to do everything to civilians will die. Here, too, and you. Hamas should fall.How to get angry about Hamas? Important Internet. Important members. Important demonstrations. It is important to Mary. It is important to review. Important to the organization. Important blog. It is important interviews. It is important that Hamas should fall and should get a government that you, your job, your future and your child a top priority. Think of your girl. Important peace.I assure you, that when you stop guide us weapons and we proffer a hand of cooperation, this is the day where you can be sure your child get up in the morning for another day builds her future.And it starts star you, Khalil.Go            November 20, 2012babyglove carl Azuz we need you back. we miss your punts and we need you back!!!!!!!!!!

A 2 year old mysteriously dies in the care of a babysitter who changed her story 10 times. Has over 30-100 dcfs cases against her. Filed a false clame that her child was bullied and the bully broke her daughters arm, when the mother did it herself. Maybe she was coming on clean about the 2 year old who died in her care. He was suffocated and hit in the head and she couldnt keep her story straight. Now she is claiming her children are being abused in foster care when she is the one who abused her children. With towns and towns of people who are on the side of the mother of that 2 year old who thought the babysitter was sane and not insane and crazy.

I am a teacher working in China. I am emotionally saddened and compassionate to those broken in Newtown and asking WHY HERE?, but ask WHY? no more, and deal with this unacceptable and terrifying daily reality in the USA.            December 16, 2012Stefi78 To the question how to avoid this mass killing is not so easy. Although you raise a good point yourself. "people need to be better parents". We need a driver license to drive a car but we do not have a rule that says to get a "parents license" to raise our kids. "We just do", as animals do and are expecting to "know". We think to see and overlook the emotional and physical balance and imbalance of ourselves and OUR children. We PRETEND to know ourselves and THEM very well. Do we really??? WE DO NOT!!! and we need to ACCEPT this fact. We are NOT fully conscious, aware nor conscientious in raising them and raising ourselves. In Europe the law on guns is far more stricter than in US and it is more difficult to give access to them. Nevertheless I am astonished that no one wonders why a woman loves guns and collects them. Even worse keeping them in house being aware that her son has emotional instabilities. Is this stupidness or just indifference, ruthlessness?? Are we then consciously busy with raising our children or is this only superficially to preserve our face to the public opinion?             December 16, 2012Scintillate Having lived in, both, Canada & Australia, I can assure you that the U.S. is NOT the best nation in the world regarding gun violence. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment is misinterpreted. EVERY human being has the right to self-protect, but NO soul, outside law enforcement, needs a gun. EVERYONE must disarm! The U.S. MUST wake up to the FACT that guns are evil. NOW is the time to grow up, evolve, & progress.Other, more responsible nations have taken the necessary steps to prevent & control gun violence. If the U.S. can achieve greatness by abolishing an evil like slavery, it can, also, abolish guns.
