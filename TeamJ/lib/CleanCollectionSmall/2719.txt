Don't do that. It's dangerous to heat nonstick pans to the temperature needed to sear."There's a whole chemistry set of compounds that will come off when Teflon is heated high enough to decompose," says Wolke. "Many of these are fluorine-containing compounds, which as a class are generally toxic."http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/nervous-about-nonstickpermalinksavecontextfull commentsUpon seeing the "Steak from butcher - super rare" post. And excuse my ignorance, but what's it taste like?  by  carpeggioin  food[+]amkkhan 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]amkkhan 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoI've found that for a good quality steak, medium rare is much better than rare. When its rare, the fat is still solid and can taste a little chewy. Once the fat starts to liquefy and render out, the inside is crazy juicy and tender. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCowboys NT Josh Brent being held in jail on allegations of intoxication manslaughter  by  Donnerzin  nfl[+]amkkhan 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]amkkhan 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoAt that's the worst part...it was 100% COMPLETELY avoidable. Instead of paying, what, $50? $100? for a cab, a 25-year-old is dead and a baby is going to grow up without father. All because the guy was too stupid to call a cab.
