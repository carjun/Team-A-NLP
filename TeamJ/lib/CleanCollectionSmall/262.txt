You're not alone. Media coverage and social media posts from across the nation reflect the sentiments of parents who are reeling after an attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., left 20 first graders and six of their teachers dead. It's enough to make you want to wrap your kids in bubble wrap and lock them up where no harm can come to them (of course, that move would be impractical, ill-advised and unhealthy). The shooting serves as a reminder of how fleeting life can be, and how sudden and unpredictably it can come to an end. As a nation, we mourn with the same question many ask in their grief: "Why?" Of course, the answer at the core of that simple question may never be known -- the person who could tell us took his own life rather than answer it. But there are plenty of other questions that people are seeking answers to. Chiefly, how can we stop this from happening again -- not just in a Connecticut school, but in a Wisconsin temple, an Oregon mall, an Aurora movie theater? That question may be just as difficult to answer. Some think school security protocols need to be more stringent, although the Sandy Hook shooter broke in to the school by shooting out a window and bypassing the electronic lock. Some are calling for more gun control and bans on certain kinds of weapons, even while in Colorado applications for concealed weapons permits have skyrocketed. Some say the nation needs to improve mental health services; others say it is a sign of decaying moral fiber in our society. Still others blame bad parenting or overexposure to violence in games, movies and TV. We think it's most likely that all of those issues need to be addressed as the nation seeks to make the changes President Obama called for when he addressed the grieving community Sunday. "Can we truly say, as a nation, that we're meeting our obligations? Can we honestly say we're doing enough to keep our children safe from harm? I've been reflecting on this the last few days and if we're honest with ourselves, the answer is no, and we have to change," he said. Of course, the process of changing our nation, our society and our laws is going to take time. In the meantime, we'll have to find solace in holding our own children close while we can, and sending them out into the world with a hope and prayer that they'll come back to us.Copyright 2012 Journal Advocate.
