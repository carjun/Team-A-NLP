Most of the time we're supplying the alcohol so we don't want a bunch of randoms in drinking it. As for your "roofied freshman" claim, that never happens and if it is it's taken very seriously. Most fraternity guys don't need roofies in order to get laid.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKD Formal at Vanderbilt.

You won't find a better screen than the retina on the MBs and same goes for the touchpad and build quality. A lot of people are willing to pay a little more for these things, myself included. If I was struggling to get by, yeah I probably wouldn't get a Mac, but I'm not.Same goes for the iMacs, nice all in one design with an extremely nice screen.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Game Thread]SEC Championship Alabama v.

If price isn't an issue and I like heavy bass but more importantly audio quality  by  open225in  headphones[+]RollTide09 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]RollTide09 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoI tried these and they are very close to Sennheiser IE80 in term of soundquality, signature but these Denon AH-C300 offers more rich deep impactful bass like i can only compare to UE SF5EB. The mids, highs are clear and detailed with wide soundstage and they are big in earbuds (even bigger than bose IE2). So they are amazingly bassheavy IEMs and highly recommended to those who likes to subwoofer like experience on the goTaken from Head-Fipermalinksavecontextfull commentsScraping my windshield before work in the morning  by  jnotein  funny[+]RollTide09 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]RollTide09 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI think he meant how many mornings does a bottle last with every day use.
