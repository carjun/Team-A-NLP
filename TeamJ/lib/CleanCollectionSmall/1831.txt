The speed of light is the fundamental link between space and time, so it's not really a "barrier" you can break. There are proposed ideas like the Alcubierre drive that would expand spacetime instead of actually accelerating, but iirc it would take planet-sized amounts of negative energy (when it's nearly impossible to get a gram) and there's no way to turn it off once you turn it on so you'd still be fucked if you were inside it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis man knows where his towel is.  by  thatselcnain  atheism[+]BlazeOrangeDeer 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes ago (0 children)[]BlazeOrangeDeer 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes agoYou sure it wasn't a paraphrase or similar passage?permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuantum networks may be more realistic than we thought  by  Boris740in  science[+]BlazeOrangeDeer 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]BlazeOrangeDeer 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoIt's a linear combination (or superposition, or weighted sum) of 0 and 1 states with complex coefficients. This is theoretically an infinite number of possible combinations. But when you measure it you will only get 0 or 1, so you can't "store" more than 1 bit per qubit. You could say that you're computing with an infinite number of possibilities, but it's not like a regular computer with multiple states.permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuantum networks may be more realistic than we thought  by  Boris740in  science[+]BlazeOrangeDeer 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago*(0 children)[]BlazeOrangeDeer 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago*In special relativity, we think about events as being points in space and time (having a real value for x, y, z, and t). Because of time dilation, two observers moving relative to each other will see events happening at different places and times because of time dilation and length contraction. Because of these effects, if you have two events it is not possible in general to say which one happened first (someone at one speed will say event A happened first, another speed will say that B happened first). You'd think that this would be disastrous for our notions of cause and effect. But we can define a kind of "distance" between two events called a spacetime interval "s" such that s2 = (ct)2 - x2 - y2 - z2. The spacetime interval is the same no matter what speed you're going (that's why it's a useful measurement)If s is zero between two events, that's a "lightlike path", meaning that light can go from one event to the other. If s2 is greater than zero, it's called a "timelike separation" and objects with mass can travel from one event to the other. If s2 is less than zero, there is no way for light or matter to get between them. This is important, because only events separated by s2>0 can have a consistent direction from past to future. No matter what speed you're going, you will agree that one happened before the other. However, the time difference between two events separated by s2<0 can be changed to anything depending on your velocity, and there is no saying which happened first. So either a. no influence whatsoever can travel from one to the other (prohibiting faster than light travel or communication) or b. effects can precede causes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis website I signed up for measures password strength by how long it would take to crack it  by  JohnWeezin  mildlyinteresting[+]BlazeOrangeDeer 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]BlazeOrangeDeer 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoThen you can put a couple of numbers in there somewhere.
