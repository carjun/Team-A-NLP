Our server costs also continue to grow, so we have a choice to make: we can start running a bunch more ads, or we can give you, the community, more reasons to support the site with your own money through reddit gold. Advertising will probably always be a part of our revenue, but we want to be ultimately beholden to you, the users.  reddit gold was started a couple years ago to great initial success. While many people have continued to purchase gold, gift reddit gold to each other, or send in postcards, weve never really promoted the program, so a lot of active redditors dont even know about it. Today we want to announce a recommitment to reddit gold, a program wed like to expand and promote. So what are we doing to make reddit gold better?First, for those whove never heard of reddit gold, here are some existing benefits: Highlight unread comments since the last time you visited a threadSee up to 100 subreddits on your frontpageView your karma per subredditTurn off the display of adsAccess to a special members-only lounge that may or may not exist... and more!Were also launching some new things:An oft-requested feature: comment saving and filtering saves by subredditAbility to give gold to other peoples' comments you really like (we call it gilding)Some upgrades and fun stuff in the members-only lounge that may or may not existWe might add a remote-controlled office robot you can drive.Under construction.We dont always intend to make these features gold-only  in cases where it would be beneficial for everyone to have them, well eventually migrate the features to the whole community.But for reddit gold members, you get first peek.We also want to make reddit gold a membership that confers real benefits that are worth what you pay for it, so were talking to some reddit-friendly companies to provide special perks or access to stuff for gold members.Stay tuned for more.And, were looking to hire a generalist engineer to help build out these features faster. If you think youre the one, take a look at the job description and join us to help make reddit better, more golden. Finally, we would like to thank all our current reddit gold members. You're the ones who first made reddit gold possible and allowed us to run a site backed by its community rather than catering primarily to advertisers. We hope you enjoy the new stuff!"The desire of gold is not for gold.  It is for the means of freedom and benefit."  - Ralph Waldo EmersonTuesday, October 09, 2012Introducing Three New HiresPosted bythe reddit adminsat10:04|Labels:knitting,new admins,redditgifts,right into the deep end,what's reostra looking at?,your gold dollars at workAhoy!We are super excited to introduce three new members of the reddit team. Please join us in welcoming these outstanding new admins, and as always, ask them anything in the comments!David A. Croach(/u/Dacvak) -Community ManagerWhat's up, reddit? I'm Dac, a humble gamer from the wondrous land of Pittsburgh, PA. After spending most of my adult life in various parts of the gaming industry, I shifted focus to the enigma that is reddit, and applied to become the Community Manager. A week after being offered the job, I was unfortunately diagnosed with leukemia, which put me out of commission for 8 months. But now that I've punched cancer in the face, I'm back in full swing. (But damn - I sure have a lot of work to catch up on!)Lesley Brownlee(/u/weffey) -Programmer (redditgifts)Hi! I'm from Canada's capital city, but made my way here to Salt Lake City via Seattle's eastside. As many of you know, I've been involved with redditgifts and/r/secretsantafor a while now, first as an award giver in the gallery, starting last fall I joined the mod team, and successfully lobbied for ayarn exchangeearlier this year. When I'm not at the computer, you can usually find me with a ball of yarn and knitting needles or my spinning wheel. I'm really excited to have joined redditgifts full time, we've got some really fun things planned for the future.Roger Ostrander(/u/reostra) -ProgrammerI'm a 33 year old programmer from Georgia, Michigan, and Maryland (inthat order). My hobbies include making games in my spare time andwriting novels every November. I've been a redditor for years, butfigured I'd create a new account for admin duties.Aforementioned admin duties include helping out with the anti-spamefforts. I'll thus be working on the non-visible backendportions of the site, so chances are you won't see me a whole lot. Ido lurk in/r/ideasfortheadminsand/r/theoryofredditand occasionallyeven comment, however!We'll likely have a few more job openings to announce this year, so if you're interested in joining team reddit, keep checking out the blog. As always, these new additions would not be possible without your continuing support. We deeply appreciate it and are working hard to keep improving reddit for you.Tuesday, September 25, 2012Join us to play games and heal kids - Extra Life 2012Posted byJason Harvey [alienth]at13:12|Labels:extralife,fundraisers,gaming,sleep deprivationI am happy to announce that reddit will be participating in the 2012 Extra Life gaming marathon to raise money for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.Last year we had a small gathering in the office to participate in the marathon. With that group of 10 people playing games for 24 hours, we raised $2,740 for our local hospitals. Together, Extra Life participants raised over $1.2 million to help kids. This year we'd like to go much bigger.What is Extra Life?The Extra Life marathon works a lot like other charity marathons. People sign up and get their friends and family to sponsor them to raise funding towards a cause. But instead of running or biking a marathon, we play a marathon of games for 24 hours.Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a non-profit international organization that treats sick kids, regardless of a family's ability to pay. CMN is a very reputable charity program, and has been rated highly [charitynavigator.org] by evaluating agencies.How to participateTo join, go to extra-life.org/team/reddit (or another team of your choosing) and click "Join This Team". During the sign-up you will choose which CMN Hospital you will be raising money for. Follow that up by spreading the word and asking friends and family to sponsor you for the marathon. Also, visit /r/ExtraLife to chat with your fellow teammates.On October 20th at 8AM your local time, sit down (or stand, if you're into that) and play games for 24 hours. You can play anything you like, be it console, PC, board games, or tabletop. Play from your home, or meetup with others. If that specific day and time doesn't work, you're welcome to marathon when it is convenient for you.We'll also be live streaming from the reddit office during the event. Take a peek at our hallowed dungeon while watching us fight off sleep and otherwise embarrass ourselves.As a thank you for participating, any member of team reddit that raises over $100 will receive 2 months of reddit gold for free. Any team member raising more than $300 will get a free reddit t-shirt of their choosing.How to donateTo donate simply choose a player from the team roster and click "Support Me!". Please note that each member chooses the specific hospital that he or she is raising money for.Further InfoAbout Extra LifeExtra Life FAQAbout CMN HospitalsTeam reddit/r/ExtraLifereddit office livestreamThursday, September 20, 2012reddit Dedicated Day of Service (rDDoS)  This Saturday, September 22ndPosted byjenakalifat07:39|Labels:a community of communities,altruism,courage wolf,do it for splashy,meetups,rdd/r/clarksville service meetupOn Saturday, September 8th, a group of intrepid, paintbrush-wielding redditors in Clarksville, TN woke up at the ungodly hour of 8 am to renew Vivian House, a single family home that provides shelter for mentally and emotionally disabled adults.This week redditors all over the world are planning to serve their local communities by organizing potluck fundraisers for local charities in Northern Virginia, a charity concert in Houston, TX, a beach clean up in Savannah, GA, and more!What are you going to do to serve your community?

Start-ups, localgovernments, small businesses and web savvy individuals across the country are using the platform of the Open Internet to start new businesses, learn new skills, earn extra income, and make their budgets go further. If you have a story like this, please post it to /r/Internet2012. The Internet 2012 Bus Tour will collect, document and share these stories from the American heartland. We will have 10 journalists from major outlets on the bus, as well as our own documentary crew to capture and tell these stories.We need your help to make this happen.reddit is covering the hard costs of the trip (gas, bus, driver etc), but we need your contributions to get a proper graphic wrap for the bus, host events across the country, and properly document and share the stories we find with the whole Internet. Please consider participating in our Fundraiser on IndieGoGo. We've got some great perks like a DRM-free documentary of the whole campaign trip, a chance to have your face inside the bus, a sentimental postcard or even an equally sentimental drunk-dial. You'll also be part of a fun and powerful project to protect the Open Internet. If you can't contribute, please help spread the word. We've already gotten awesome tips and connections from redditors at /r/Internet2012 and we'll be updating/r/Internet2012with details and stories from the road.Here are a few examples of the types of stories we're going to highlight:Local Motors: The Internet 2012 Bus will be escorted by the Rally Fighter from Local Motors, a badass rally car designed online and built in the USA. Local Motors is an example of new Internet fueled business models in traditional sectors.AgLocal: AgLocalis a start up based in Kansas City that makes it easy for anyone to buy or sell locally raised meats. An entrepreneur from AgLocal will be joining us on the bus, and we'll be visiting some farms and restaurants that benefit from their service on the tour.IndieGoGo: Not only are we using IndieGoGo to raise funds for the tour, but we're also going to be visiting individuals, small businesses, and organizations along the tour that were able to thrive based on the crowdfunding platform.Here is the partial Bus TourItinerary:October 3 - Presidential Debate watching event - Denver, COOctober 4 - TBD - Boulder, COOctober 5 - Event at Raikes School, UNL & Event with Hudl.com - Lincoln, NEOctober 6 - Event with Dwolla on The Future of Civic Engagement - Des Moines, IAOctober 7 - Startup Weekend Demos - Iowa City, IAOctober 8 - Event at Kauffman Foundation on The Future ofEntrepreneurshipKansas City, MOOctober 9 - Start Louis Tech Meetupat TREX- St. Louis, MOOctober 10 - Event with Fark on The Future of Local Communities - Lexington, KYOctober 11 - VP Debate watching event - Danville, KYThere are many details to come. If you are in one of these cities or an area in between and have a story about how the Open Internet has helped you or your community, please share it in the tour's main subreddit /r/Internet2012. We will also post event details and tour updates in /r/Internet2012(as well as local subreddits). Hope to see many of you at tour events!The Open Internet is about the freedom for Americans to help themselves, and it's an enormous engine for economic growth. Lets make sure both political parties, media everywhere, and localgovernmentsrecognize it this Fall!TL;DR: reddit is launching a bus tour through the Midwest to campaign for the Open Internet.

Tens of thousands of people actively participated by voting and/or commenting and millions watched, and The President even broke some news in the Q & A (by suggesting a new amendment for the first time). Did it go perfectly smooth? Nope. Is this the absolute perfect format for politicians to answer questions? Nope. But it worked, and it was a big step, not just for reddit, but for online communities everywhere. No matter how you feel about the IAMA, reddit, the President, or politics in general, we hope that what took place this past Wednesday will inspire other online communities and start-ups, and encourage other politicians to seek out more ways to talk directly with their constituents. We thank the President and his team for making this happen.Key figures from the IAMA:2,987,307 pageviews on the day of5,280,441  pageviews so far in total (as of 9 AM PT 8/31 -- not accounting for stats lag).In the first five minutes, there were 37 comments. By the ten minute mark, redditors had made 278 comments. Within half an hour that number jumped to 5,266 and was over 10,000 by the end of the first hour.The only link in recorded history to have surpassed the front page.At any given time, the front page of reddit (http://www.reddit.com) has around 15-20% of active visitors. An extremely popular submission may have 2-5% of visitors at any given time. In the recorded history of reddit, weve never had one single submission get more visitors than the front page at any given time, until the Obama IAMA. The Obama IAMA received over 30% of all visitors to reddit at its peak./u/PresidentObamaThe Presidents account was given 5 years, 9 months of reddit gold! (Suppose someone will have to figure out how to declare virtual gifts if they havent already).PresidentObama's user pagereceived 428,004 pageviews on the day of the IAMA.As many speculated, the username /u/PresidentObama was not actually publicly available. That user deleted their account a while ago, so when this event arose, we made the username available for the President. If you are not a current or former head of state, dont ask us for a deleted username.The whole siteThere were 865,092 unique visits during the first hour after the IAMA began -- up from 518,312 before it started. At peak, Google Analytics showed 198,000 active concurrent visitors. At the peak of the IAMA reddit was receiving over 100,000 pageviews per minute.Map of Barack Obama AMA traffic by City and Hour - August 29th 2012Technical bitsIn preparation for the IAMA, we initially added 30 dedicated servers (20%~ increase) just for the comment thread. This turned out not to be enough, so we added another 30 dedicated servers to the mix. At peak, we were transferring 48 MB per second of reddit to the internet. This much traffic overwhelmed our load balancers which caused a lot of the slowness you probably experienced on reddit.This IAMA gave us a lot of information on what we need to do next not only to handle the next megathread on reddit, but also to make reddit faster in general. Were going to redesign our load balancer system to be more flexible under this kind of load, and weve got a bunch of things we need to do to make our code more efficient for giant comment threads. Both of these improvements should make day-to-day reddit use faster as well.Older PostsSubscribe to:Posts (Atom)the reddit blogKeep up with the latest development updates, community announcements, and general reddit tomfoolery.Blog Archive2012(30)December(1)WW1 Books, LennyBot, Zombie Jesus Pizza, Confronti...
