If dempster was getting paid 13m per year, I don't think that's an unreasonable salary for the reigning cy young winner. provided that the deal is short obviously. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBlue Jays, Mets Close To R.A.

I couldn't roll my eyes harder when I first saw it.  by  heymitchin  atheism[+]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agolol I used to live in a predominantly jew town, and of course the condo I was renting was no exception. I was so confused when I first saw one of these elevators that had all the buttons lit up and I was wondering if that was a prank or if it was a service elevator or something. I had to Google to find out why that is. even though it only happened during weekends, still annoyed the fuck out of me that the building caters to one religious group over others. permalinksavecontextfull commentsJosh Hamilton agrees to 5 year deal with Angels  by  gwords16in  baseball[+]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoguess someone's gotta step up with the crazy, over-the-top contract.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsDempster signs with Red Sox - 2 years/26.5 million  by  CydoniaKnightin  baseball[+]mug3n 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mug3n 7 points8 points9 points 1 day agomets ownership are doing some serious character assassination to make sure that doesn't happen.permalinksavecontextfull comments[s]Team 8's BaBy absolutely dismantles TSLSymbol in Code A Ro24.  by  Everdeverin  starcraft[+]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoi just love how the kespa guys know exactly how much they need to make.  game 1 was a thing of beauty to see a terran that knows how to play aggressively with a handful of mech unitspermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are those moments in games that made you yell "Aw, bullshit!"  by  MojoLesterin  Games[+]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoat least barrett (1st boss) had a bunch of gas cans that you can throw at him while you scuttle around and he writhes in pain.  that was actually kinda fun.  the other bosses, not so much.i just said fuck it and ended up using a typhoon or two every boss fight after that point.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are those moments in games that made you yell "Aw, bullshit!"  by  MojoLesterin  Games[+]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agooh no, i eventually managed to get it, but it nearly sucked the fun out of the game for me.  i rather spend time crushing blitzball.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElectronic cigarette smoker wants end to ban in Canada  by  brianpeirisin  canada[+]mug3n 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mug3n 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agodevices aren't banned, it's the liquid that you have to use in them that is (if they have nicotine).permalinksavecontextfull commentsGraph: How Canada's internet costs stack up internationally  by  bopolloin  canada[+]mug3n 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mug3n 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoISR=israel and ISL=iceland i believepermalinksavecontextfull commentsAuditor General says Presto smart card cost has ballooned to $700 million  by  AwesomeNameGeneratorin  toronto[+]mug3n 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mug3n 4 points5 points6 points 2 days agoit's annoying how ttc has got into this quagmire where they have one foot in and one foot out with presto.  over nearly the last 2 years we've seen the presto machines at a handful of stations.  and it's supposed to take another 2-3 years for it to roll out to the remaining subway stations, streetcars and buses?  you've gotta be fucking kidding me.  the ttc should enlist some help from the yrt and go who HAVE implemented it without taking years.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are those moments in games that made you yell "Aw, bullshit!"  by  MojoLesterin  Games[+]mug3n 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago*(0 children)[]mug3n 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago*the damn chocobo race in final fantasy x where you had to pick up red balloons or something to that extent to get the race time UNDER 0:00.0.  had to be under.  not just on the dot (the game clock won't show negative time, but if you picked up only just enough balloons to offset the time to 0, you won't get the sun sigil you need to make tidus' ultimate weapon).  and let's not forget the seagulls that fly in during the straight stretch in the race that will stun-lock you for 2 seconds. i remember i rage-threw my controller so many times doing that race.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCarlos Boozer after being called with a charge  by  MrJoehoboin  nba[+]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agohe's really going for that bosh look there.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTeksavvy being taken to court by LA film studio in bid to get names behind 2,000 IP addresses  by  k_garpin  canada[+]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago*(0 children)[]mug3n 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago*guess you haven't been aware of what's going on lately. a popular indexer just got shut down and things on Usenet are being dmca'd faster than ever (I see some <24h posts that got the takedown) . it's only a matter of time before usenet is riddled with incomplete posts. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHume: Police response to pedestrian hits: clothing advice - thestar.com  by  iltin  toronto[+]mug3n 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]mug3n 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agodoes grade school ever teach kids to look both ways before they cross?  i'm not blaming the pedestrian here (i am one most of the week), but come on, people in the GTA have such low road awareness that it isn't even funny.  maybe we can start doing something at the education level.start being aware of your surroundings, even if you do have the right of way - the number of people having their eyes on their phone or mp3 player these days while they cross, without even taking an eye off them, is just unbelievable.  having your principles about being right isn't that useful when you're minced meat on the pavement.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
