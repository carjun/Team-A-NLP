Traveling in a big group was not as hard as you think.  One of our friends organized the whole trip and had a pretty straight forward itinerary for the first 8 days.  The last 4 were spent at Ao Nang beach where we were free to split off and do what we wanted.  But we still met up a lot for meals and drinks.Also these guys had traveled together before.  This was my first big trip, not to mention my first time out of the country.  It was amazing!permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy boyfriend and I spent 12 amazing days in Thailand with 16 of our friends. Here's a video of our trip.

I'm not sure if I'm more bummed for the guys or the fact that someone made this and kind of exploited them. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPark Avenue: Money, Power & the American Dream  by  nickaromain  Documentaries[+]bye_button 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]bye_button 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoThank you for posting.

Dude gives off ZERO body heat. I get held like a teddy bear when we drift off to sleep.  It's awesome. Although he does tend to snore. And his cat snores. His CAT. I sometimes wake up from it but the site of both of them sawing logs is too silly to be mad over it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm sure you all remember these guys.

Instead of the band acting like pissy, insensitive assholes with all their shitty little fans running to defend them, can you imagine if they put their "Well, this is the hardcore scene. DEAL WITH IT" attitude aside, stepped up, and at least offered to help? Even if they didn't take full responsibility for what happened, their record label could at least raise some money to help with her medical bills.  You know these same little shitty fans who are licking their wounds now would be like "Man, did you hear that YAITW are helping that girl out who got hit at their show?  They really look out for their fans.  That's awesome". I mean,  that girl is (or was) a fan of theirs who came to see them play and lost her fucking vision in one eye FOREVER.  And their attitude is "Pshh, DEAL WITH IT"?  I guess being in the "hardcore scene" means it's totally cool to be insensitive fucktards.permalinksavecontextfull comments25001My friends didn't believe me when I said I REALLY love pizza...
