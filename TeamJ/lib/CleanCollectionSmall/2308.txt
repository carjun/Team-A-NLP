There have been two occasions where I've been stuck 4 and 5 times. Nobody's perfect, and they don't like putting you through pain any more than they have to. I've given up on my right arm ever getting an IV again, it's too scarred from Remicade infusions. I'm afraid my left will get that way so now I have them stick me in my hand.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMust be a crazy secret  by  jesuzin  pics[+]pimfram 1053 points1054 points1055 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]pimfram 1053 points1054 points1055 points 1 day agoIncisor?
