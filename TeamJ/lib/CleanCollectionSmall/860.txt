I have depression and once I figured out that i have it, it took me about 5 years to go see a doctor about it.  Men have a tendency to hide and it and let it go untreated.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]PizzaTits -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]PizzaTits -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoI'm not sure about therapy, but I'm on meds for depression (Wellbutrin) and it costs something like $15-20 a month and usually a $20 co-pay to see my doctor.  Also the $150 a month I pay for insurance (single, no kids).  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Some people don't want help or even know they have a problem.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsLast weekend, I was passing a complete stranger on the street and he decided to assault me for absolutely no reason. He fractured my face in 3 places, and I had to get 2 metal plates implanted in my cheek.

In fact I loved her passive-aggressive disappearing during season 2.  She put up with his lying and stayed by his side until he accidentally admitted to his 2nd cell phone and lied about seeing his mother.  I'm not married but I can't imagine how other people's wives would deal with their husband turning from a quiet, passive teacher into an ego-maniacal, murdering drug kingpin in the span of 1 year.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsBill Clinton asserts Democrats create more jobs.
