He served as the Eagles' secondary coach in 2007, after leading the Eagles' special teams for nine seasons (1998-2006).Under his leadership, Harbaugh's special teams units were consistently ranked among the NFL's best. From 2000-04, Philadelphia was the only team to rank in the top 10 in the comprehensive annual special teams report created by The Dallas Morning News' Rick Gosselin. (Gosselin's report is recognized by NFL teams as the special teams measuring stick.) In 2001 and 2003, the Eagles were ranked first by Gosselin, who compiles his report based on 22 kicking-game categories. Following the 2001 season, Harbaugh was voted the NFL's Special Teams Coach of the Year by his coaching peers. He was also named The Dallas Morning News Special Teams Coach of the Year that season.Background: Harbaugh played defensive back for four years at Miami (Ohio) from 1980-83, while earning his degree in political science. He coached on the collegiate level at Western Michigan (1984-86), Pittsburgh (1987), Morehead State (1988), Cincinnati (1989-1996), and Indiana (1997).Personal: Born in Perrysburg, Ohio, on Sept. 23, 1962, Harbaugh and his wife, Ingrid, have a daughter, Alison. He is the son of longtime college coach Jack Harbaugh and his younger brother, Jim, the current Stanford head coach, played 14 seasons as a quarterback in the NFL, including one season in Baltimore (1998). John's brother-in-law, Tom Crean, the Indiana head basketball coach, is married to his sister Joani.Assistant CoachesNFL SHOPNFL 940 Tri Chroma Stuct Adj BALTIMORE RAVENS19.99NFL JF Script 2 Hit HD BALTIMORE RAVENS49.99RAV R.Lewis Game Jry RAVENS TEAM COLOR99.99VISIT NFL SHOPTeam ProfilesSelect a Team...Arizona CardinalsAtlanta FalconsBaltimore RavensBuffalo BillsCarolina PanthersChicago BearsCincinnati BengalsCleveland BrownsDallas CowboysDenver BroncosDetroit LionsGreen Bay PackersHouston TexansIndianapolis ColtsJacksonville JaguarsKansas City ChiefsMiami DolphinsMinnesota VikingsNew England PatriotsNew Orleans SaintsNew York GiantsNew York JetsOakland RaidersPhiladelphia EaglesPittsburgh SteelersSan Diego ChargersSan Francisco 49ersSeattle SeahawksSt. Louis RamsTampa Bay BuccaneersTennessee TitansWashington RedskinsPlayer Name --%>RB Rice, 7-yd, run, TDPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 06:24 a.m.(4:52) R.Rice left guard for 7 yards, TOUCHDOWN.00:41RB Pierce, 21-yd, runPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 05:32 a.m.(9:14) B.Pierce right guard to WAS 26 for 21 yards (D.Hall; P.Riley).00:24QB Flacco to TE Pitta, 14-yd, pass, TDPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 04:30 a.m.(8:46) (Shotgun) J.Flacco pass short left to D.Pitta for 14 yards, TOUCHDOWN.00:34Ravens defense, fumble recoveryPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 04:25 a.m.(9:39) (Shotgun) A.Morris left end to WAS 27 for 3 yards (M.Kemoeatu).
