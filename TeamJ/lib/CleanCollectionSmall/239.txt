Video by WSJ's Evan Simon. Both members of the community and visitors in and around Newtown, Conn., are erecting makeshift memorials to honor the victims of the shooting spree on Friday at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Their fear wasn't that he was dangerous. "It was completely the opposite," said Richard J. Novia, the director of security at Newtown School District at the time in 2007. "At that point in his life, he posed no threat to anyone else. We were worried about him being the victim or that he could hurt himself."Long before Mr. Lanza allegedly killed his mother and then blasted his way into a Connecticut elementary school on a rampage that left 27 dead, authorities were concerned about a young man who was unusually withdrawn and socially maladroit. The scrawny teenager with a mop of brown hair evoked feelings of sympathy, not fear, from teachers and the few classmates who even noticed him.Authorities have declined to discuss a motive for the shootings, and those who knew Mr. Lanza, 20 years old, said they are at a loss to even speculate. Marsha Moskowitz, a retired school-bus driver, said Mr. Lanza stood out simply because he never smiled. "He was so quiet," she said.Latest UpdatesFollow the latest developments from the elementary school shooting in Connecticut.Town United by Grief Searches for AnswersPortraits of VictimsLawmakers Weigh In on Gun ControlSuspect, Mother Come Into FocusMuch remained unknown about Mr. Lanza on Sunday, including whether he had ever been diagnosed with a mental-health illness or if he had graduated with classmates at Newtown High School. Few remember him well, though he showed some academic promise, making the honor roll as a freshman, joining a technology club and taking college-level courses at age 16. Friends and acquaintances of his mother, Nancy Lanza, a gun enthusiast who grew up in rural New Hampshire and took her kids to target practice, said she rarely spoke about Adam, her younger son. But when she did, there were indications their relationship was fraught."It got to the point where she did not have a close relationship with her son," said Dan Holmes, a local landscaper who worked on her property and who would see her from time to time at a local bar in town called My Place.But another friend of Ms. Lanza's, Tom Phillips, said she was a devoted mother who doted on her youngest son, Adam. "She said he was special, that he required a little extra attention," Mr. Phillips said.Others who knew the family said Mr. Lanza wasn't close with his older brother, Ryan, 24, who lives in Hoboken, N.J., and works for Ernst & Young. Mr. Lanza's parents divorced in 2009 after a long separation, according to public records and family members. Adam Lanza's father, Peter, who lives in Stamford, is a tax director and vice president for GE Financial Services.In a statement released Saturday night, Peter Lanza said the family is "heartbroken" and "in a state of disbelief," the Associated Press reported. After the divorce, Adam Lanza remained with his mother in their upscale Newtown home.Deadliest Mass ShootingsFrom University of Texas at Austin to Columbine, take a look back.View InteractiveShock, Tragedy at Connecticut SchoolView SlideshowGetty ImagesA flag flies at half-staff outside a residence near the Sandy Hook School on Saturday.His high school classmates took little notice of Mr. Lanza, but school officials did. Newtown school officials assigned a permanent psychologist to Mr. Lanza in his freshman year of high school in 2007, and flagged him to the school's security chief when he was still in middle school, a former school official said. "He was very withdrawn and meek," said Mr. Novia, who left the district in 2008. He said Mr. Lanza "was one of those freshmen coming in very much in need of watching."Mr. Novia said it wasn't unusual for school officials to meet about troubled students, but Mr. Lanza's problems were more severe than most. He said he told the school's three security staffers who reported to him to carefully monitor Mr. Lanza, concerning "where he was, who he was with, and what he was doing."To help Mr. Lanza become more socially adept, school officials directed him to a "tech club," a broadcast class that filmed school events for a public access channel in town. While many students thrived there, Mr. Novia said Mr. Lanza didn'teven though his older brother, Ryan, had done well in the same group.At Western Connecticut State University, in nearby Danbury, Mr. Lanza took classes, but he was also an outsider there. In an introductory German course in spring 2009, two classmates recalled him sitting alone, towards the back of the class, often in a hooded sweatshirt. It was an evening course, and Mr. Lanza was the youngest person there."We tried to say 'hi' to him every so often, and he just seemed nervous," classmate Dot Stasny said. "He didn't have anybody to connect with because we were all older."At one point, a friend of Ms. Stasny and another classmate, Gretchen Olson, invited Mr. Lanza to join them at a bar after class, Ms. Olson said. "No, I can't, I'm 17," Mr. Lanza responded, according to Ms. Olson. "We were like, 'Oh, OK,' and then he went home."Mr. Lanza dropped out of that class, and the professor, Renate Ludanyi, didn't remember him when asked by a reporter, but found his name in her records. He received a D on one test, she said. Mr. Lanza excelled in computer science, with an A and an A-minus in two courses in summer 2008, when he was just 16, according to Paul Steinmetz, a university spokesman. During the following term, in "Philosophy 101: Introduction to Ethical Theory," Mr. Lanza got a C. John J. Blom, whom university records show taught that course, said he had no recollection of Mr. Lanza. Mr. Steinmetz said the university had no record of any disciplinary issues with Mr. Lanza, who studied as a part-time student and wasn't pursuing a degree. The last classes he took in 2009 were "American History Since 1877," in which he received an A-minus, and an introductory macroeconomics course, in which he received a B. His final grade-point average was 3.26.Mr. Lanza's history professor declined to speak, according to Burton Peretti, history department chairman. "They certainly were shocked" to realize Mr. Lanza had been in the class, Mr. Peretti said of the professor. History classes have around 40 students, Mr. Peretti said. Other history professors said it would have been possible for Mr. Lanza to get a high grade without saying much of anything if his written work was strong.Ms. Stasny also remembers Mr. Lanza as an occasional customer at a local branch of GameStop,   the videogame retailer, where she worked. "He was one of those customers that came in, got his stuff and left," she said.Danny Gold contributed to this article.Write to                 Tamara Audi at tammy.audi@wsj.com and Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.comA version of this article appeared December 17, 2012, on page A7 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Shooter's Persona Drew Concern in School.Copyright 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
