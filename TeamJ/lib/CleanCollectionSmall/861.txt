Some people don't want help or even know they have a problem.  permalinksave[+]Itseemedfunny 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Itseemedfunny 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours agoUpvoted. The access is there for many, but there is a huge stigma with regards to actually getting it and following through with it. Meds take a a long time to work.permalinksaveparent[+]PizzaTits 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]PizzaTits 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoYeah.  I have depression and once I figured out that i have it, it took me about 5 years to go see a doctor about it.  Men have a tendency to hide and it and let it go untreated.  permalinksaveparent[+]ANTI_Hivemind 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago*(1 child)[]ANTI_Hivemind 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago*What's access?(1) I have had a relative who was gravely mentally ill. I tried to get her committed. The hospital authorities told us that they could not take somebody in against their will unless they had already been dangerous to themselves or others. Apparently sawing at your wrist with a razor blade in front of your 15 year old kid just isn't enough.(2) I have another step-relative, a guy with bipolar disorder and fucked-up past who spent time in one of those abusive teen programs they scream about over in /r/troubledteens. He's tried to get himself committed pleading suicidal thoughts. They take him in for 24 hours observation and kick him right back out again - and he has insurance! They also keep doinking around with his meds.(3) Our own son is mentally handicapped with cerebral palsy and autism. He's in his teens and completely non-verbal. With two parents fighting and clawing through the system to get every service we can for him, he gets a tiny disability check, special-needs schooling, meds to help control his behavior, and Easter Seals charity that gives him a respite camp every once in a while. Special equipment to enable him better, in-home care, extended outpatient care, all of this has been denied. We've had to hospitalize him three times this year with a digestive problem, and they wouldn't even do an Xray on him because they couldn't sweat justifying the expense to the insurance company. We have to fight, claw, and scream at the health care system every singe step of the way to get anything done for him, and then they keep taking it away every other month.You understand the situation a little better now?permalinksaveparent[+]sevenalive -1 points0 points1 point 18 hours ago (0 children)[]sevenalive -1 points0 points1 point 18 hours agoThis. My dad had paranoid schizophrenia. We were told nothing they can do unless they do something dangerous.People only give a shit when they go on killing sprees.There is no easy access to mental health care. It's almost impossible to get someone committed or a forced evaluation. And they expect the crazy to help themselves.permalinksaveparent[+]racecaracecaracecar 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]racecaracecaracecar 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours agoAccess isn't the issue. It's the stigma associated with seeking it.permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (6 children)[]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI'm not from the US... how much does therapy and meds associated with mental health treatment cost? I know that even in Canada, if I didn't have a way to get cheap meds, I wouldn't be on any because I barely have enough money to pay for the cheap ones I get as it is. He may have gotten treatment and not been able to pay for the treatment for the diagnosis. permalinksaveparent[+]eyeseayoupea 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]eyeseayoupea 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoWith insurance my deductible is $1400. Then you pay out of pocket 20% up to $2000. Then they cover 100%. This is in a calendar year. You start over every January. So you could possibly have to pay $3400 a year not counting the $30 or so a month to have the insurance.permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoAnd that's WITH insurance? Holy crap. permalinksaveparent[+]eyeseayoupea -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]eyeseayoupea -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoYeah. It's ridiculous.permalinksaveparent[+]Itseemedfunny -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Itseemedfunny -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoIt can vary widely, from free community groups to therapists that are $500 a session. I know my insurance covers a good deal of mental health costs (40% even out of network providers, 100% in) and most SSRIs will run you $10-$40 a one month dose. But I also know that I am very lucky and the cost is higher for many,permalinksaveparent[+]zombieTankGirl -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]zombieTankGirl -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoDepending on the insurance, and the type of person you're seeing, you could be paying $100+ out of pocket per visit. I only speak from my experience with a psychiatrist. I have a difficult time affording it and I make a pretty good living. permalinksaveparent[+]PizzaTits -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]PizzaTits -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoI'm not sure about therapy, but I'm on meds for depression (Wellbutrin) and it costs something like $15-20 a month and usually a $20 co-pay to see my doctor.  Also the $150 a month I pay for insurance (single, no kids).  permalinksaveparent[+]thekick1 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]thekick1 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agothis is a valid statement, upvotepermalinksaveparent[+]mdguy429 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]mdguy429 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoThe problem is that we don't take mental health seriously in this country, especially in males.  It's often seen as a sign of weakness in men, and a lot of men are told to get over it and carry on and are actively dissuaded from seeking the help they need.permalinksaveparent[+]AirsoftIsMyLife 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]AirsoftIsMyLife 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoThank you for finally finding saying this!!permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
