One day I heard him overtalking on the phone with his doctor and he mentioned he had a pacemaker. You know what comes next reddit. I went online and bought a high end highly sensitive  electromagnet that some physics professor from Auburn University was selling on eBay for just $50. Sold. Of course I didn't kill the guy, I just had faced it towards his cubicle on a really low setting. Needless to say  he just stopped coming to work because he had really bad feelings and discomforts he just couldn't explain and had never felt before in his life. I will say though I did have the urge to crank that shit up. Since I have an electromagnet, I guess I've always wanted to buy Iron-Neodymium-Boron dust from some chemical outlet store and sprinkle some on some person's hair or something and crank my electromagnet up and see what happens. The composition of the metallic grind/dust is of the most magnetic out there. Other's that I've been tempted to try are replacing my coworkers water in water bottle with part highly concentrated chloride and part ammonia to create pre-mature mustard gas. But I'm too scared they'll be stupid enough to drink it.If you've ever seen it on youtube, it's a popular chemistry experiment. Liquid potassium chlorate (a little amount) + a gummy bear equals a pretty big heat/flammatory explosion. I'd like to fill a water bottle with liquid potassium chlorate and stick a gummy bear under neath the cap (red ones work best) and carefully screw it back in and leave it on their desk. Lastly I've always wanted to have a wireless remote operated release mechanism (or maybe I can attach a remote activated power supply to my electromagnet and stick a heavy metal object to it.) Either way I'd hide it in the ceiling on top of their cubicle for this mechanism to drop the ceiling onto their heads (can't be that heavy right?) and on their desktop I will have taped a green bean with a warning label "Do Not Remove!" Once they do plop. That shit will fuck with their mind for days to come. Then just tape a green bean to their car door just to fuck with them a week later.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some products that people use incorrectly on a daily basis  by  Knight_Cameronin  AskReddit[+]Sir_George 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]Sir_George 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agohaha funny story. One time I got drunk at my friends house and made chloroamine gas (better known as cheap mustard gas). I found  ammonia and highly concentrated bleach in block form (74%+ yield) in his bathroom and remembering o-chem lecture in my drunkedness I decided to mix it in his bathroom sink....man we had to evacuate his house, there was a yellowish fog pouring out of his windows and the fire department had to come with gas masks to clean it out and fine him. Needless to say I'm not allowed at his house anymore :-(permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's one food you have tried and will NOT ever touch again?  by  pinkwaff1ein  AskReddit[+]Sir_George 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Sir_George 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoGreek person here and I must say Greek Yoghurt.

Because at least then I believed that I was loved, that I wasn't so small and insignificant in the world, and most of all because I believed in a loving God and afterlife. I guess there's comfort in ignorance. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHospital-Acquired Infection Rates in Greece, Already Among Worst in Europe, to Rise Due to Shortages - .

If there was a crisis, it would have been purely domestic and the rest of the EU wouldn't be getting pissed. Also who cares if they lose imports? They have the resources to build most of the stuff they need for crying out loud.

Also the solution to democratic problems isn't deal with it since you voted for them, that's what China says to mock democracies.

Greece is an insignificant country which only makes up 1.5% of the EU economy... so clearly some people at Brussels fucked things up if a little country like Greece could cause that much trouble. I can only imagine what the havoc would be if it were Italy or France. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHospital-Acquired Infection Rates in Greece, Already Among Worst in Europe, to Rise Due to Shortages - .

Politicians come out as corrupt after they're elected, it's not like their going to make their campaign slogan "I hoard money into a hidden Swiss bank account, vote for me!" Also I pay taxes, don't call the Germans Nazi's, and don't vote for them. Also aren't medical supplies free under universal healthcare anyway? Unless you're referring to the doctors. Greece doesn't need sympathy, in fact "sympathy" is what got us into the mess. How about Germany stops giving Greece mega loans that we can't possibly pay back and let us fail and start over? I was against the first bailout even, in what universe does it sound rational to give a country that makes up 1.5% of the EU economy that much money??? permalinksavecontextfull commentsHospital-Acquired Infection Rates in Greece, Already Among Worst in Europe, to Rise Due to Shortages - .

I believe social Darwinism will continue to play a role in the future, whether it be in class struggle, healthcare, education, etc. Also as many redditors point out the future might also be open to a eugenics program if overpopulation becomes a serious problem...that's a hammer into equal rights. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
