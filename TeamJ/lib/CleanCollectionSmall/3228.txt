Israel - Sympathy, Security Advice for Newtown, Connecticut, US On Guns, School SecurityIsrael                   - Sympathy, Security Advice for Newtown, Connecticut, US On                   Guns, School SecurityBy                   Joel Leyden                  Israel News Agency Newtown,                 CT. --- December 15, 2012 ... As one who has served in a combat                 unit, Israel border police and is the director of a father's organization                 in Israel, I know something about children and security. As Israel                 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel President Shimon                 Peres offer condolences to the children, parents and staff of                 Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, they should also                 be asking if Newtown, Connecticut and other communities throughout                 the US would care to benefit from the most experienced and respected                 nation in regards to school security.Because                 of the deadly threat of Islamic terrorism that faces Israel on                 a daily basis, this small, democratic nation has been forced to                 implement the most effective security measures for civilians on                 the planet.First                 piece of advice to the US - wake up!You                 have a problem and your children are being murdered. To say that                 this is not Israel, New York, Detroit or Iraq no longer works.                 When terrorism hits a sleepy, tranquil, wooded town in the heart                 of Connecticut, a town which was once listed as the fifth-safest                 city in America, claiming the lives of 20 young, innocent children,                 you should now know that no place is safe in the US where children                 congregate.In                 Israel, no one carries a weapon without the Israel Ministry of                 Defense knowing about it. The person carrying the gun or assault                 weapon has gone through a security background check, trained in                 the use of gun safety and is registered with either the Israel                 Defense Forces or the police that he bears a weapon. The right                 of Americans to bear arms is a US Constitutional right which has                 not been reformed nor updated since it was written over 200 years                 ago when Americans were killing turkeys and buffalo to stay alive.To                 ask the US public to ban all guns would not be realistic with                 over 300 million guns in circulation. But gun control must be                 implemented to screen out those who have mental health issues.                 As political leaders discuss gun control on both a state and federal                 level, your school does not have the luxury of doing nothing.                 There are psychotic, copy cat killers on the loose and whether                 it be a school in Connecticut or a movie theater in Colorado -                 the sick idea is out there for a few to use guns and or assault                 rifles to get even or resolve a problem. How                 do you make a school safe?You                 hire at least two, armed security guards and place them at the                 entrance of the school. Forget the camera and buzzer. It does                 not work. If you doubt this, ask the parents of the murdered 20                 children in Newtown.You                 have the children and their bags go through metal detectors. This                 can be fast and effective. If you feel that this is inconvenient,                 then ask yourself what price would you pay for your child's safety?                 Airlines employ this measure, not just to save lives, but to save                 aircraft.The                 use of video cameras both in and outside the school are needed                 to both prevent and document illegal activity.Lockdown                 and evacuation procedures must be taught and drilled at every                 school. Panic buttons must be placed in every room.                Teachers must be prepared for almost any crisis that could materialize                 - either by nature or man made. School need safe rooms and safe                 procedures. The                 use of a combination code rather than keys are suggested to secure                 outside doors and classrooms.Off-duty                 soldiers or police must be hired to provide security during field                 trips and they do typically carry a weapon when performing these                 duties.But                 perhaps the best line of defense are the parents. If you detect                 and or are knowledgeable about your child or other children who                 have mental health issues, report this immediately, in confidence,                 to the school principle and school psychologist. Preventing a                 massacre is preferable to attending a funeral.Security                 guards, metal detectors, locked doors and windows do not make                 a prison. They make for a safe school facility where your children                 can learn, laugh and grow without the threat of being hit by bullets.You                 need to ask yourself one question.                What price would you pay to keep your children safe?Israel:                 Canada An Example To Global Democracy In Cutting Diplomatic Ties                 With Iran Change.org|Start                   an Online PetitionJoel Leyden,                 journalist, media consultant, social media and SEO pioneer                 working with both the Israel Defense Forces and the US Army in                 Haiti.Marketing                 Social Media, SEO Professionals ask:Can                 People Find Your Website?
