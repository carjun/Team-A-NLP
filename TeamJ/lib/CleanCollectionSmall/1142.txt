Now you have a constitution that makes women not even 2nd-class but 3rd-class citizens. This constitution is tailored for one specific group (the Muslim Brotherhood). It's a shame."  by  anutensilin  worldnews[+]mb526 -2 points-1 points0 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]mb526 -2 points-1 points0 points 2 hours agoSee what the Muslim Brotherhood really should have done is have multiple drafts of a constitution. The liberals and secularists would be divided over competing versions and the Muslim Brotherhood with its better organization would rally behind the one they want. Let time period extend for the opposition to go at each others throat, vote, the more liberal documents will be eliminated, have a run off against the Muslim Brotherhood document and a divided opposition which most likely won't vote for their competitors document and boom you get what you want.Or engage in some good old fashion ballot box stuffing.   permalinksavecontextfull commentsEgyptians Vote on Islamist-Backed Constitution - "At one point in our history, Cleopatra, a woman, ruled Egypt.

I don't even think there were dinosaurs 1 Billion years ago. Other than that this is a really, really cool comic and very well done. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMike Riley to interview at Wisconsin?

As much as Reddit loves to get on the anti-American circle jerk the internet in its current form has been in the hands of the US for decades now and unless I'm missing something the flow of information has been continuing pretty freely. Sure you get your SOPAs and PIPAs but remember they died because of the efforts of American representatives like Sen. Ron Wyden, American companies like Google, American non-profits like Wikipedia, other American founded web entities like Reddit and 4chan and the efforts of thousands of Americans who didn't want the interent controlled. The US and Americans have played a massive role in the formation of the internet and its development as one of the most important means of communication and as much crap as the US does do, it should be commended for it's role in promoting the free development of the web around the globe. permalinksavecontextfull commentsUS nuclear test condemned by Iran and mayor of Hiroshima  by  waggawaggain  worldnews[+]mb526 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mb526 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI saw this posted before a couple days ago.

I'm not sure which "us news" you're referring to but if Fox News is the propaganda mouth piece for the interests of the current US Government  they should all get freaking canned for being the worst propaganda machine ever.Also, using a parallel argument is really, really stupid.   permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Snow Bowl (1950: Michigan vs. Ohio State).

You don't have the "reasonable expectation of privacy" for public conversations required for 4th amendment protection to apply, primarily because anybody around you could hear them. When you go on a bus do you really think that nobody can hear your discussions? Do you think that it is reasonable to discuss private matters on a public bus? Do think a public bus is private space?  permalinksavecontextfull commentsCraft vs. Crafty: A Statement from the Brewers Association  by  maxvonsydow3500in  beer[+]mb526 9 points10 points11 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mb526 9 points10 points11 points 2 days agoI prefer to buy from local breweries which isn't that hard since I live in Oregon.

Incredibly, Incredibly stupid. The amount of legal liability to the 10 different schools who are slated to join starting next year would be massive. Not to mention they're getting some real power football program in the conference with Boise State in addition to 9 other new schools, dissolving the conference doesn't make any sense. Further the author implies that because three schools that "tried to get a invite to the ACC" , two are supposedly ok with a move to kill the Big East. That makes a lot of sense if you believe that its a good idea to burn your home down cause you might be invited to the new gated community. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
