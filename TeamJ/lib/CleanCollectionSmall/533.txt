Everyone from California to New York watched as the story unfolded of a school massacre that is fast becoming the second worse in US history.  US citizens were glued to their television and internet screens waiting for any small update.  It was reported that 27 were dead once the scene was secured by police, later in the day it was reported that 20 of the dead were children (most of them in kindergarten).  It was reported that someone came out of the field dressed in camoflage and said "I did not do it" and the news media reported this became a "person of interest" and was being questioned by police.  It was reported that the gunman was found dead on the scene.  Shortly afterwards the gunman was named by the media as Ryan Lanza.  According to the Associated Press this fact and a few others were wrong. The new report says that Ryan Lanza was at work in New York City when this shooting took place.  As social media lit up, he sent status updates to his Facebook account that read:Newtown sign inspires hope      Photo credit:        getty images      "IT WASN'T ME I WAS AT WORK IT WASN'T ME""I'm on the bus home now it wasn't me."Then profanity and the statement "it wasn't me"While his name was being ran across the news media as the suspected gunman and it was being reported that his brother was in custody answering questions realization was unfolding for Ryan Lanza that his mother was dead. As the story continued to unfold there was a report that a body may have been found at Ryan Lanza's apartment in Hoboken NJ, which was later refuted and added to the list of incorrect reports.  Ryan Lanza was interviewed by the authorities and is believed to not be involved with the shootings.  His brother, Adam Lanza was then named as the culprit by authorities.  The story reports Ryan had not seen his brother Adam since 2010. Now as the story continues to unravel the question on many people's mind is who was the young guy who came out of the wooded area by the school stating it wasn't him and who was the brother that was in custody answering questions - is the suspected shooter really deceased?  So many questions are still unanswered in this case.
