The 27-year-old teacher hurried her first-graders into a bathroom near Classroom 10, just beyond the schools main glass doors. Two students stood on the toilet. Others huddled on the floor. With no space left, Soto stepped out of the small room herself, a witness said. A 20-year-old man wearing black stepped into the classroom and shot her before quickly exiting the room.She got those kids to a good place and then told them they were safe, said Robert Licata, the parent of one of those first-graders who survived. She knew them well enough to make them feel okay.Others did the same. Music teacher Maryrose Kristopik barricaded her students in a classroom and blocked the door with xylophones. First-grade teacher Janet Vollmer read her kindergartners a story. Art teacher Virginia Gunn told her class to be quiet and used her cellphone to call police.Caitlin Roig, a 29-year-old teacher, told ABC News that she turned the lights off in her classroom and tried to explain the situation to her first-graders. There are bad guys out there now, she said. We need to wait for the good guys. The students whispered in the room, speculating about their Christmas presents and wondering if they could defeat the bad guys with karate. One of them began to cry. Show me your smile, Roig told him.Im thinking, as a 6-year-old, 7-year-old, what are their thoughts? she said. So I said to them, I need you to know that I love you all very much and that it is going to be okay. Because I thought it was the last thing they were ever going to hear.Instead, they heard a knock on the door, and Roig walked closer to it. Police! people on the other side shouted. Roig didnt believe them. The policemen slid their badges under the door, and Roig opened it. Some of her students walked into the hallway about 9:45 a.m., into the aftermath of a shooting.In the language of the police report: Teams encountered several students and staff suffering from gunshot wounds. Eighteen (18) children were pronounced dead at the scene, two (2) children were transported to Danbury Hospital and later pronounced dead. Six (6) adult victims were also pronounced dead at the scene.In the language of the emergency radio traffic: Ive got bodies here.In the language of the Sandy Hook hallway: Walk with a partner, a policeman instructed. Shield your eyes. Hold hands.As the students filtered out of the school, they walked past a flier on the wall that kindergartners had posted there some weeks earlier. It was an annual class prank, a Christmastime school tradition. The class had lost a gingerbread cookie in the school oven, and now they were searching for it. WANTED, the sign read. Missing Gingerbread Man. But now that sign was obscured by SWAT teams and stretchers and the harried assembling of a makeshift morgue. The students continued through the hallway, passing the security camera and exiting through the glass doors.One complained of a stomachache. Another would later tell his father that he had wanted to run from the school like Forrest Gump. Another, who waited out the shooting in the bathroom, would be too scared to go to the bathroom alone at home.The waitingOutside the school, 17-year-old Mergim Bajraliu scanned their faces and looked for his sister, Vanessa, a fourth-grader. She had left for school in a pink jacket and jeans. Bajraliu saw one girl exit the school splattered with blood. He saw two more, their bodies limp and their faces pale, carried out by state troopers. One of them looked like his sister.I got close to the state trooper to get a good view, he said. The poor girl was not my sister.His mother joined him in the school parking lot. Then an uncle came, too. They waited outside as hundreds of children passed by, standing near where the bus had dropped Vanessa off for school that morning. If I could describe it in one world, it would be hell, Mergim said.Finally, after 20 minutes, he saw her  healthy, pale, walking out of the building with her art class. She searched the parking lot for her family and then collapsed in her mothers arms.In the hours ahead, children would begin to ask their parents a series of difficult questions about the shooting, and parents would try to distill a tragedy in the language of childhood. Are we safe? Is it okay? Are the bad guys gone? said David Connors, the father of third-grade triplets.Are they dead? Are they in heaven yet? said Licata, the parent of a first-grader.One of the questions  the most simple and the most persistent, the quintessential question of childhood  would also become the most difficult:Why?But first, in the hours after the shooting, police directed students and families to a nearby firehouse, a low-slung building that was decorated with Christmas lights. Firefighters moved out their trucks to make more space for the families. In one room, parents gathered to wait for their children. In another, children gathered to wait for their parents. Cartoons played on TV, and volunteers passed out Christmas cookies and juice. A local pastor and a few school officials stepped in front of the room holding several pieces of paper. It was a printed list of children who attended Sandy Hook.We are going to need to take attendance, said Robert Weiss, the pastor of nearby St. Rose Church.And this time, so many names were unaccounted for.
