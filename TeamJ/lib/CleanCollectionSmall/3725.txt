He went on to guide a Dallas team that had started the season with a 1-7 record to a 5-3 mark down the stretch. In the season's second half, three of the Cowboys five victories were against teams that posted 10 regular season wins, while the three Dallas defeats were decided by a combined total of seven points.Since the 2007, season Garrett had been the Cowboys offensive coordinator under head coach Wade Phillips, and in 2008, he was assigned the additional duties of being the club's assistant head coach.Garrett returned to Dallas in 2007 as the offensive coordinator after spending the previous two seasons tutoring the Miami Dolphins quarterbacks. Garrett, who was a back-up quarterback to Troy Aikman in Dallas from 1993 to 1999, rejoined the Cowboys with a great understanding of the championship heritage of the organization. As a player in Dallas, he was a member of teams that won six division titles and three Super Bowl championships.As a player, Garrett worked under highly successful offensive coordinators Norv Turner and Ernie Zampese in Dallas while providing sideline assistance to Aikman for the majority of his Hall of Fame career. After moving to New York in 2000, he helped guide starting quarterback Kerry Collins and the Giants to an NFC Championship and a Super Bowl berth while working along side current Saints head coach Sean Payton, who was the team's offensive coordinator. Garrett also gained valuable experience in absorbing Head Coach Jon Gruden's offensive philosophies during a stint with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the closing months of his playing career in 2004.He entered the coaching profession in February of 2005 as the quarterbacks coach for Nick Saban's first Miami Dolphins club.As a senior at Princeton University in 1988, Garrett was named the Ivy League's Player of the Year and honorable mention All American. He earned his degree in history in 1989, and moved on to the NFL as an undrafted rookie free agent with the New Orleans Saints developmental squad. After being released prior to the 1990 season, he spent the fall of 1990 as an assistant coach at Princeton. In 1991 Garrett moved on to play in the World League and the Canadian Football League before joining the Cowboys practice squad in 1992.Garrett, who prepped at University School in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, followed in his family footsteps in 2005. His father, Jim, spent more than 30 years in the NFL as a coach and scout.Garrett was born on March 28, 1966.Assistant CoachesNFL SHOPCWB T.Romo Game Jry COWBOYS TEAM COLOR109.99CWB Splitter 950 Snapback DALLAS COWBOYS31.99CWB Ws Legend Logo Tee - Grey DALLAS COWBOYS29.99VISIT NFL SHOPTeam ProfilesSelect a Team...Arizona CardinalsAtlanta FalconsBaltimore RavensBuffalo BillsCarolina PanthersChicago BearsCincinnati BengalsCleveland BrownsDallas CowboysDenver BroncosDetroit LionsGreen Bay PackersHouston TexansIndianapolis ColtsJacksonville JaguarsKansas City ChiefsMiami DolphinsMinnesota VikingsNew England PatriotsNew Orleans SaintsNew York GiantsNew York JetsOakland RaidersPhiladelphia EaglesPittsburgh SteelersSan Diego ChargersSan Francisco 49ersSeattle SeahawksSt. Louis RamsTampa Bay BuccaneersTennessee TitansWashington RedskinsPlayer Name --%>Bailey, 40-yd FGPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 06:51 a.m.(:04) D.Bailey 40 yard field goal is GOOD, Center-L.Ladouceur, Holder-B.Moorman.00:54QB Romo to WR Bryant, 27-yd, pass, TDPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 06:32 a.m.(6:44) (Shotgun) T.Romo pass deep middle to D.Bryant for 27 yards, TOUCHDOWN.00:40RB Murray, 1-yd, run, TDPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 04:21 a.m.(10:39) D.Murray up the middle for 1 yard, TOUCHDOWN.00:23Cowboys defense, INTPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 04:17 a.m.(12:16) A.Dalton pass short right intended for A.Green INTERCEPTED by B.Carr at DAL 36.
