We are watching the news. We are horrified. We are all sobbing. 'm currently in one of the class rooms of the neighboring school and we're in lock down. So far we have heard nothing from the administration. We know that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook School (the elementry k-4 school). There were 2 shooters alledged. One kid (confirmed with multiple sources) is wounded and carried out of the school. The shooters are still out there, not caught. One teacher was shot.My town is trending on every major news site and it's scary as fuck. Update: 3 patients admitted to danbury hospital  by ambulance and the number of people shot is up to 4 (no ages yet). Update 2: one shooter reported dead (unconfirmed but multiple people are saying that)Update 3: One child dead. One shooter still on the loose. Yale hospital has opened a triage for victims. Update 4: Unconfirmed repoet that the principle is dead. The shooter is heading down river-side (the road). Update 5: Swatt team is sweeping the school Update 6: they've taken one woman aside and she's crying into a firefighter's arms. This could mean update number 3 about a kid dead is true. Update 7: We were released back to class. There was an announcement that said the area was safe, so we are conducting classes. I need to get back to class, so I will update later. We're watching the news, it's last period but we were forced to turn it off. One of the reporter's said,"and just think that these kids were seeing santa claus last weekend." We turned the audio off and we're all crying still.This is hell. Some kids are bawling in the bathroom, there are only 10 or so (out of 25) that remained in class). Nobody has a dry eye right now. Some kids are angry and swearing, others are staring at their feet. We don't know how to deal with this. This town has virtually no crime, we were unprepared. permalinksave[+]Ace_of_Diamonds 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago (2 children)[]Ace_of_Diamonds 11 points12 points13 points 1 day agoStay safe man, update if you can, please, but do whatever you can to stay out of danger.permalinksaveparent[+]a_monster_ 20 points21 points22 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]a_monster_ 20 points21 points22 points 1 day agoShooter is in a black honda currently (as far as I've heard) and they are still shooting. permalinksaveparent[+]Bitter_Britches 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Bitter_Britches 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoWTF.

My guess is there was a problem with a student and the parent wasn't happy about it. Instead of seeking proper help and opening a line of communication and active participation for the student they turn to some bullshit like this. Ultimately this is an extremely tragic and scaring event for the students and families at this school.

The shooters do not think of themselves as terrorists, but the public reacts to them as if they are. There are gang shootings on the 11pm news every night, and I don't notice much, because I'm not in the "bad" part of town, and I'm not in a gang. There are domestic shootings on the news all the time, and I don't notice much, because my spouse is mentally healthy and we have a good relationship. A shooting in a school or movie theater really rattles us because it seems random, and it makes people afraid to just be out and about.

We periodically re-test drivers to make sure they are sane(ish) and physically capable of safely operating a motor vehicle.  Vehicles themselves are registered and their ownership is tracked, in part so that stolen vehicles can be recovered.Thanks to the recent Heller and McDonald rulings, the current SCOTUS has created a new individual right to own guns.

You get people who don't always agree, groups are marginalized, anger seethes, and some are willing to resort to extremism for whatever purpose they rationalize. Right now, the most urgent conversation is the immediate either or demonization of us versus them, splitting sides. This happens no matter what and death, anger, destruction is used to push whoever's agenda best. My country is devolving into a state where there's no right or wrong anymore, just how many people you can get to agree by screaming the loudest.I think these incidents are indicators of an overall trend of the general unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Happy people don't do these things. But you can't guarantee everyone's happiness forever at every moment, only try to provide for an environment for anyone to pursue happiness. But remember where we came from. We live in USA, an experiment from 200 years ago that through the generations have been built through trials and errors, blood and sweat. These are the costs and collateral damage of freedom. There are some that strive to keep the bar high but there are also people willing to kick the bar lower each day.If you are angered by any of this the very most important you can do now is do everything you can to keep raising the bar and help everyone else be there too.

You can call them rare if it makes you feel better, but relative to every other civilized society on Earth (and also the uncivilized ones), they're not, even when you adjust for population size.Guns are a complicated issue all around, as is mental health care in the US and how it plays into these issues, but those are the numbers.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago (24 children)[]StrahansToothGap 11 points12 points13 points 1 day agosource?permalinksaveparentload more comments(24 replies)[+]derrick81787 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day ago (9 children)[]derrick81787 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day agoI second StrahansToothGap's request for a source.Additionally, I consider other ways of meeting a violent death to be just as bad as being shot to death.

I've used everything from .22 wheel gun up to an M-1 carbine, owned a .12 gauge Mossburg for pheasant hunting, and have been through many safety courses.  I've also grown up with gun enthusiasts who think that shooting in a controlled environment at paper targets gives them some sort of equivalent judgement to a professional trained in stressful, chaotic, and escalating situations where real humans are between the muzzle of your firearm and your target.  I'm not afraid of guns, but there comes a point where you need to realize that they are not magic crime eradicators, and that there is a serious gun problem in this country.  The answer to this problem can't be "more guns for more people", because if it was, we'd be pretty much crime free.permalinksaveparent[+]Bloodysneeze 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago (11 children)[]Bloodysneeze 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoThen why do places like Utah and the Dakotas have such a lower crime rate than places like California and Illinois?

Harsher sentences, interdiction, and/or higher rates of gun ownership have very little downward influence on the overall crime rate.

The shooting, which was reported around 9:40 a.m., had taken place in the main office of the school, leaving at least one person with multiple gunshot wounds. Authorities recovered 2 handguns from the scene and are still searching the school grounds.

And that people who want to commit the crime will find out other (illegal) ways to get guns anyway.

It's been that way for a long time. The elementary school is a gun-free zone; it's not even supposed to have guns. The point is that increasing our laws in violation of the second amendment does nothing to affect crime. Reasons being that you cannot affect the lawless by legislating the law-abiding. One would think that all these guns are just going around murdering people but that's not the case at all. Our homicide rate with a firearm in the U.S. is 2.7 per 100,000 as of the most recent FBI statistics. It's very, very small and much less compared to many countries that outright ban guns. But I also want to know why these shootings happen. Why are people going crazy, hitting the breaking point, and committing these atrocities. What was wrong with the Oregon shooter? His GF and him split, he had been evicted, his flight got canceled/missed, etc. He was so hellbent on leaving this world and taking people with him that he stole a gun to do it. So he illegally murdered and wounded people, and stole a gun which is also illegal. That guy is a pretty typical case of who does shootings in the U.S.. IE crazy people. The only way to stop them is a combination of making people alert and willing to get involved when they see someone in such obvious distress (what about his friends, family, etc?). Just being evicted should put up warning signs that the guy isn't going to be stable. The other solution that works now and has been gaining popularity is to arm the lawful populace. Self-defense shootings rarely make it past local news but they happen often. I myself carry a gun concealed because I simply do not want to be at the absent mercy of one of these crazed lunatics. I suggest to everyone feeling competent enough to do so to actually partake. Even Illinois is readying to pass a CCW statute because they've tried all the bans and it doesn't do anything. Criminals and crazies keep committing murder and meanwhile their victims remain unarmed and defenseless. Like I've said before, when seconds matter, the police are only minutes away.permalinksaveparentload more comments(3 replies)load more comments(1 reply)[+]Thirtydegrees  comment score below threshold (3 children)[]Thirtydegrees -14 points-13 points-12 points 1 day agoFuck you. permalinksaveparentload more comments(3 replies)load more comments(12 replies)[+]Kreeker 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Kreeker 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoFrom CBS News: Several Children DeadThis is disgusting.permalinksave[+]meow315 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]meow315 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoThis is absolutely horrific.

There are ramifications to the whole community. Maybe they need to look at the school system or the mental health system, maybe it is entirely unrelated. I have researched a lot about Columbine and there is never one answer; there are a lot of twisting paths, some of them obscured or less defined than others. I expect that there will be no real clarity in this situation too.I also expect there will be a fruitless debate about gun laws. The main argument I see is, "people kill people!" but it is a lot easier and impersonal to shoot someone. Impersonal in the sense that you pull a trigger and that is that, whereas stabbing someone for example involves a lot more activity. I don't mean to sound callous, but I'd be interested to see if it was two shooters. It is a rare scenario for school shootings. Interesting dynamics. permalinksave[+]exedore6 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (2 children)[]exedore6 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoAlso (and I'm not sure stricter gun laws would have helped here), guns make it very easy to kill several people).permalinksaveparent[+]t0nkys 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]t0nkys 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI was going to essentially say that, but I thought it might be flippant of me to do so. Because there is that element of a "kill count" of sorts. It is one of the ways as a school shooter that you don't fade into complete obscurity. On the gun law side of things, I don't live in the US so I don't really have much grounding to argue for and against, because it is a different culture. I can't claim to know what is right or wrong. But if you really want to hurt someone, you can do so whatever country you are in with whatever tools.
