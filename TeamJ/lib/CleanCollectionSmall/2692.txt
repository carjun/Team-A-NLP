Most CC people are trained.  You don't need to be trained to buy a gun legally.  And not having a CC permit isn't going to prevent you from going and shooting up a school.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago (11 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours agoI'm not sure what you're saying.

If everyone who bought a gun have to go through what you have to to get a CC permit, I would be happier with gun laws.Edit: Someone tell me how requiring training to buy a gun is fucking unreasonable? permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours ago (9 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours agohardly even get a background check to buy a gun.Background checks are required for gun purchases from FFLs.I'm fine with requiring reasonable training to buy a gun(maybe just handguns), as long as there are no waiting periods, and the training must be paid for by taxes and provided for free to American citizens.But this will not reduce crime by any means. Not at all.Why? Because criminals will buy illegal guns and not go through the training.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 hours ago (8 children)[][deleted] -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 hours agoTell me why waiting periods are bad?  It seems perfectly reasonable for someone to have to wait to buy a gun.permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]Butthole_Scientist 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoIt is annoying, and doesn't prevent crime. Criminals do not pass background checks, and don't usually buy their guns from FFLs.I often buy two or three guns at one time, it would be really annoying to have to wait.permalinksaveparent[+]fishsounds 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (6 children)[]fishsounds 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoWhat purpose do they serve?

You ever wonder why the chilling security footage of these criminals always shows them calmly walking through their target school, shooting at will?  It's because no one is armed and capable of stopping them.  "gun free zones" are the ONLY places these things happen in.Even if the odds of an armed civilian stopping a lunatic shooting up a school are only 25%, I'll take those odds.  If the choice is certain death or a chance at survival, I'll take survival every time.permalinksaveparent[+]derrick81787 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoWhy is the evil gunman always the more skilled one in these examples?  You make it sound easy, like Gadsden doesn't even have a chance.Also, the gunman already has guns.  These things never end because the shooter doesn't have a gun he can use.  They end when the shooter is killed or when the shooter chooses to stop.permalinksaveparent[+]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (1 child)[]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoThey're called gunmen because they already brought guns.Nope, just let them finish.

Presumably, people with criminal records and mental illnesses wouldn't pass the background check.  If they do, then the background check system needs fixed.  Also, whether they pass the background check or not, it's illegal for them to own a gun.What law would prevent these people from doing an already illegal thing?permalinksaveparent[+]SutekhRising 0 points1 point2 points 55 minutes ago (0 children)[]SutekhRising 0 points1 point2 points 55 minutes agoI disagree. What happens when something like this takes place is a lot of conjecture, but no facts. So you get people saying "This is why we need to regulate guns more" but the argument to that is always "when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns" its a difficult discussion compounded by the intensity of it being so recent. What is needed is a logical discussion of why it happened and how it can be prevented. But that has to take place at least 24 hours later. Trust me, this will bring the whole gun debate right to the forefront of everyone's mind no matter what.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
