Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoThis is absolutely horrifying. Families have been forever ruined. I know for a fact too that this is a very small, normally peaceful community, so the impact is even more magnified. I wish everyone affected the very best.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that CSX's Help Desk's phone number is 1-800-CHESSIE.  by  crazytiger94in  trains[+]murjax 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]murjax 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoThey will always be part Chessie, no matter how much they try to hide the  meaning of their name.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNYU student's documenting of US drone strikes reveals harrowing trend  by  dominicuin  news[+]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoHell, we nuked two civilian cities without warning!!Actually we did warn them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFirst full trailer of Pacific Rim  by  KashK10in  videos[+]murjax 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]murjax 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoGlaDOS would be in a movie involving portals.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhite House wants black boxes in all future cars  by  IamSlammaJammain  news[+]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoCan we substitute the black box for a dash cam? Then we can have all those car wreck videos like the ones that come from Russia regularly.permalinksavecontextfull comments12y mistakenly takes "racy" picture in locker room, shows person the picture was taken of, deletes the picture, but is then arrested.  by  TooOldToBeHerein  news[+]murjax 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]murjax 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoWell actually my point is that some schools are better environments than others. Some are enjoyable places to be; friendly students and excellent teachers. I know some people however who go to schools that keep lowering the staff's pay, and it results in miserable teachers, unfair grades, unhappy students, and complaining parents. That kind of environment is as equally vast as the one you had. The one you get depends on where you live I suppose.permalinksavecontextfull comments2 University of Colorado students arrested for feeding pot brownies to classmates, professor  by  twolf1in  news[+]murjax 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]murjax 4 points5 points6 points 4 days agoThey probably figured that since it was just legalized, they may as well pass it around. They should have thought it through though. You can't trick people into eating the poisoned apple, even if it's not a deadly one, and even if it is slightly enjoyable.permalinksavecontextfull comments12y mistakenly takes "racy" picture in locker room, shows person the picture was taken of, deletes the picture, but is then arrested.  by  TooOldToBeHerein  news[+]murjax -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)[]murjax -1 points0 points1 point 4 days agoYou my friend, were very fortunate then. permalinksavecontextfull comments12y mistakenly takes "racy" picture in locker room, shows person the picture was taken of, deletes the picture, but is then arrested.  by  TooOldToBeHerein  news[+]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoI have no regrets about having been home schooled.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCalifornia School District Owes $1 Billion On $100 Million Loan : NPR  by  TooOldToBeHerein  news[+]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]murjax 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoThere is probably something I'm missing with this story, but aren't state school districts subsidized? If so, why would they be taking out a loan that they lack the ability to pay back?permalinksavecontextfull commentsTexas keeps mentally retarded man locked up for 30 years with no conviction  by  jstohlerin  news[+]murjax 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]murjax 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoMy gosh, just give him the retrial. It can't hurt, and clearly he wouldn't be a threat to anyone if set free. Being set free for him most likely means being put into a mental institution. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGrand Central Station completely barren  by  DaBushmanin  pics[+]murjax 4 points5 points6 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]murjax 4 points5 points6 points 1 month agoFirst picture is just outside LIRR's West Side Yard, 5th picture is Penn Station, 6, 7 and 8 are Times Square.

There are many people who trash up their homes like this, you just don't see pictures of it very often. I'd say it's more likely plain old procrastination than mental illness. We'll never know for certain though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHoly shit thats brutal. Incredible Korean Taekwondo.
