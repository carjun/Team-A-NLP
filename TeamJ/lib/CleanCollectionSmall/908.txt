In all cases, either authorities declined to comment on motive, or the motive was just unknown.  I find this very odd.  I mean, is it acceptable to assume that we've just had a rash of psychos who are all copying each other because of the media attention they get?  Or are the motives suppressed for some (legal) reason?permalinksavecontextfull commentsFull body knitted suit for those harsh winter mornings.  by  gummersin  pics[+]darkroastbeans 8 points9 points10 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 8 points9 points10 points 7 days agoNot bad, Marked One.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLooking for some company in St. Louis.  by  helpme81in  StLouis[+]darkroastbeans 4 points5 points6 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 4 points5 points6 points 8 days agoHow often do people meet at Lemmons?

Glover is the best of the lot, mostly because he doesn't take himself too seriously and can be genuinely funny.   (Max on Movies is really good too, and Dr. Tobler can be interesting.)  Pretty much everything else is abysmal, religious-right propaganda.  NPR is a much better source for actual news.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs learning ASP.NET a bad investment?  by  become_awesomein  webdev[+]darkroastbeans 1 point2 points3 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 1 point2 points3 points 11 days agoHere is a possible alternative approach:Send the request via ajax. Have the server generat a token (guid) that represents the rendering process and return this token immediately to the client.Have the client poll the server (assuming no websockets here) every so often with the token, asking if the task is done yet (task state can be saved in the DB with the token).If the task is finished stream the PDF to the user.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs learning ASP.NET a bad investment?  by  become_awesomein  webdev[+]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoAgreed, but enterprise development is not for everyone.  There is a huge demand right now, but I think part of that is due to the fact that developers are fleeing the enterprise space because of dissatisfaction and stress.  At least, that's what I've experienced.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs learning ASP.NET a bad investment?  by  become_awesomein  webdev[+]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoI used TFS for over a year, and in my experience it is a huge hindrance to productivity.  It is good for managers who need to produce reports for CYA purposes; it is horrible for actually dealing with complex code bases and distributed teams, which is how startups are usually arranged.  Now all I use is git and github (even for .NET projects) and I am much more productive.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs learning ASP.NET a bad investment?  by  become_awesomein  webdev[+]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoAh, then the program has changed since I last investigated.  That is certainly a more appealing deal.  At some point you have to scale licenses or upgrade though, and there will be a cost associated with that, but this certainly makes it easer to get to a profitable point before those costs are incurred.  Still, open source upgrades are free :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsTarantino Calls Death Proof His Worst Film  by  fred_is_nicein  movies[+]darkroastbeans 4 points5 points6 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 4 points5 points6 points 15 days agoWhat!

Learn from Chrome (WebKit) and Firefox, and add some really kickass dev tools of your own.  Make life easier for developers.For fuck's sake, give us a decent plugin model so we can extend the browser with things we find useful.  BTW, the number and quality of plugins available for your browser is a big incentive for people to switch.Developers need to run multiple versions of IE without downloading 4GB virtual machine images that expire in 30 days and only work in Virtual PC. I realize IE is tied to the OS (some former Netscape engineer is laughing about this as I type!), so sandbox it in an emulation layer.  Do something.  If the pain of testing multiple versions of IE is too great, developers will just stop doing it, which means their sites won't work in multiple versions of IE, which means people will blame IE.  Its in the best interest of MS to deliver on this front.If these three things were nailed down, a great deal of IE criticism would disappear completely.permalinksavecontextfull commentslooking for good remote-work locations  by  darkroastbeansin  StLouis[+]darkroastbeans[S] 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans[S] 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoCool, I might give them a try.

That takes a significant amount of value away from the IDE as a tool.  And programs like BizSpark, while intended to give startups a jump start, are still costs waiting to be incurred.  I just don't see the competitive advantage I would get by using MS technologies over open source technologies in a startup.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs learning ASP.NET a bad investment?  by  become_awesomein  webdev[+]darkroastbeans 18 points19 points20 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 18 points19 points20 points 16 days agoThis depends greatly on what kind of web development you want to do.Many enterprise companies use ASP.NET (WebForms and MVC) for internal web applications because it integrates with their existing MS infrastructure.Most startups don't use .NET because it is cost-prohibitive and much of the tooling and overhead of .NET gets in the way of rapid development.  (There is a trade-off here; the tooling can be very good in enterprise environments, but startups are usually looking to deliver and iterate on extremely tight timelines.)I've been doing .NET development for five or six years, and I would say that MVC4 is the place to start.  Avoid WebForms like the plague.  WebForms makes certain things "easier" at the expense of making other, normal web-development tasks stupidly difficult.  And ViewState.  Worst idea in the history of web platforms.  MVC is pretty solid though, and the web dev tools in Visual Studio have gotten significantly better with the 2012 release.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy mom painted this for me [Fallout 1]  by  Mimilokiin  gaming[+]darkroastbeans 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 1 point2 points3 points 17 days agoMom... mom never changes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood lunch spots in Downtown?  by  joetown75in  StLouis[+]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago+1 for Monty's.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre there any heavy metal radio stations?  by  bigDean636in  StLouis[+]darkroastbeans 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago105.7 is about as close as it gets.I think Lindenwood (89.1) plays Christian metal after midnight on Saturday :)  But probably not what you're looking for.permalinksavecontextfull comments20234looking for good remote-work locations (self.StLouis)submitted 17 days ago by darkroastbeans to StLouis4 commentssharecancelloading...Ron Paul's Farewell speech - C-SPAN Video Library  by  Todamontin  Objectivism[+]darkroastbeans 4 points5 points6 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 4 points5 points6 points 29 days agoSometimes I really just don't understand Objectivist politics. The only two critiques I hear from Objectivists against RP are: he doesn't believe the federal government should have any position on abortion, and he doesn't believe we should be proactively bombing the shit out of every country in the Middle East.  But then Peikoff, Biddle, et. al. will go and reluctantly endorse Romney and Ryan because, hey, at least they mentioned Rand once in passing with a semi-positive connotation, regardless of the fact that they are both vocal mystical statists who flagrantly disregard rights and want to prop up the aristocracy of pull.  I mean jesus folks, for as much as Objectivists rail against Pragmatism they sure practice it an awful lot when it comes to supporting political candidates.  I realize RP isn't an Objectivist but I cannot comprehend any line of reasoning that justifies support for Romney/Ryan over RP.  It just does not compute.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy War Room - if I waited till it's "perfect" I'd probably never post pictures.  by  larsonccin  battlestations[+]darkroastbeans 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoObviously not married.EDIT: But seriously this is boss and I am jealous.permalinksavecontextfull comments23123Why I Voted Libertarian (nicholascloud.com)submitted 1 month ago by darkroastbeans to Libertariancommentsharecancelloading...What's a line or passage from a book that still sticks with you?  by  Fictitious_Pulpin  AskReddit[+]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]darkroastbeans 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark.
