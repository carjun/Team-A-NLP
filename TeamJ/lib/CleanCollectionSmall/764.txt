I don't really have a palate for brandy in the way I have for scotch and whisky. I can however tell you what I liked and why.Carvalho Ribeiro FerreiraThis is Brandy, and this is what I drank first. The nose was very good, of white grapes. There was also some balsamic vinegar (which actually made it better) but also a slight hint of plastic. The palate was crisp with a finish of honey. After revisiting this after the tasting I say that this was still solid. As I would discover, all of the bottles we chose were very different.Hine Rare VSOPThis was my favorite of the bunch, but this is probably because I like really obnoxious in-your-face flavors (Oh hai Laphroaig 10). Honestly the nose was very light and a hint of floral notes. However the palate really shined. It blasted me with fresh blackberries. We had a blackberry brandy that was sickly sweet and tasted of nyquil. This was not that. This was quite amazing. There was also a flavor of a certain candy that I couldn't pick out, but it was very familiar. The finish was, sadly, short.Courvoisier VSOPThis was delightful for the price range and we are looking forward to trying the Napoleon next month. There isn't much to say about this one, it was like drinking champagne. In fact, the finish even left a "bubbly" mouthfeel even though it clearly isn't carbonated. The fine champagne grapes really shined. If I had a better palate for this I'm sure I would have picked out more, but overall it was just very yummy.Rmy Martin 1738This is where I discovered that you should not leave cognac in the car on a cold day. At first this was really disappointing. I picked up cinnamon and the ginger right away but the "ample chocolate" was lacking severely. I was downtrodden. It wasn't until later that I had more from my glass after it had warmed up a bit that I finally tasted the full bouquet. I was then pleasantly surprised, but I was still expecting more from this. I'll have to try again at some point to pick out more flavors.permalinksavecontextfull comments7111213First Dive Into Cognac (i.imgur.com)submitted 3 days ago by 12side to cognac2 commentssharecancelloading...Disappointed with Google. Is there anything that I can do further?  by  ArpeggioBikerin  nexus4[+]12side 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]12side 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoWhile I agree with most of your concerns,charged me for a 2-day shipping serviceIs exactly what it states, two day shipping, at no point should it be assumed your order goes right out the door as soon as you make it. It is still being delivered in 2 days after being released from the warehouse. What sucks is you have no option for a cheaper shipping, knowing your order won't make it through for several days (weeks?) anyways.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReview #12 - Glenlivet 18  by  Hailchaosin  Scotch[+]12side 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]12side 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoand non-chill filteredpermalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter Earth (2013) Trailer  by  ddelrymplein  movies[+]12side 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]12side 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoI have a 25% success rate on building coconut raftspermalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter Earth (2013) Trailer  by  ddelrymplein  movies[+]12side 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]12side 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoI'll admit it is interpretation, but I beleive it is wildly accepted. Just re-watch that scene at the end and pay close attention to the conversation between him and Mark Ruffalo.

At least to me, but then again I make a challenge out of predicting movies.
