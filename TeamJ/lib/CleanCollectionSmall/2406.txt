I should have gone more into detail, I guess.  The injuries that Codey received from the car accident were pretty terrible.  He never fully recovered from them.  Even when he was able to walk, for the short time he could, he did it in pain.  The complications from his injuries were entirely too much for him, and Codey spent much of those five years in and out of the hospital.  I don't know exactly how I'd prove to you that Codey was real.  I think it would be a pretty amazing charade to keep this whole story up for five years, well, what, ten years now, because I still talk to Tim.  And for what purpose?  Just to fuck with me?  It's not like it was a pedophile pretending to be a kid to get naked pictures of me or some shit.  Unfortunately, I don't have these anymore, since I have a new computer, but Codey sent me pictures often of when he was in a wheelchair, when he had the leg braces on, pictures with Tim, so on. You could tell, as the years went on, he looked more and more unhealthy in his pictures, as you would expect from constant hospital visits, being bedridden at times, and so on.And then to create a website based on his writings/life?  And to keep up the charade with the hundreds of people on that website about his health, his life, all that kind of shit?  That would be a hell of a lot of work to continue a story like that.So, I can't exactly prove to you this whole story I guess.  I just know.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe inspiring story of my friend Codey  by  pearljammin10in  gaybros[+]pearljammin10[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]pearljammin10[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoI'm supposed to be TJ.  At the time he wrote this, I identified as straight-curious and was only ever with girls, so I guess that's why he made me straight in the story.  Tim is Tony, Codey is Jeremy.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOnly gay people will get it. . .  by  overthink1in  gaybros[+]pearljammin10 27 points28 points29 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]pearljammin10 27 points28 points29 points 14 hours agoThat's friggin' genius/creepy.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe inspiring story of my friend Codey  by  pearljammin10in  gaybros[+]pearljammin10[S] 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]pearljammin10[S] 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours agoHaha.  I'm not much of a believer, but he was.  And Codey always valued his privacy, so he's probably cursing at me right now, hahaha.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe inspiring story of my friend Codey  by  pearljammin10in  gaybros[+]pearljammin10[S] 5 points6 points7 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]pearljammin10[S] 5 points6 points7 points 15 hours agoYeah, Tim is awesome.

Plus, changing this guy's mind isn't very likely. He won't come to our store Christmas party simply because he doesn't celebrate Christmas. The boss asked him if changing the name to a "winter party" would change his mind, and he said it is still associated with Christmas, so he would not attend.  He seems to be pretty set in his ways.His beliefs don't bother me to the point where I can't talk to him for work purposes, so there's no issue there.  He hasn't brought up anything on the topic since, and rarely talks about his religion in general, so while it's not a great solution, I think I'll just carry on normally.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat sex myth(s) did you believe as a virgin?  by  Pube_Sprinklesin  AskReddit[+]pearljammin10 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pearljammin10 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThat if you don't use it, you lose it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsfantasy football playoffs!  by  VyseVicein  gaybros[+]pearljammin10 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pearljammin10 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI was in three leagues this year, and somehow managed to narrowly miss the playoffs in all of them.

But here, since, it's work, I just don't know if I want to get into it.  It just could be a lot more trouble than it's worth.  HOWEVER, it's not like this guy is my boss, so it wouldn't really matter.  My boss, I know for a fact, would be fine.  (He's a Facebook friend.  I'm an Eagle scout, and of course I made quite a few posts on Facebook about the BSA's bullshit, and he brought it up at work and agreed with me.)

The job itself isn't all that exciting, but I get paid well, and I work with a lot of hilarious people, which makes the day go by quickly.  Plus I recently got my own office, so there's that!As far as eye candy, though, there's not much.  The highlight of my day is when these two cute Latino twins come in....fuck.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMNF  by  toughlucktonyin  gaybros[+]pearljammin10 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pearljammin10 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoI was hoping the Texans would have a shot but it's not looking good.

Looking back, how he did it was hilarious, and he totally got me.  But, in the moment, I flipped a shit, said "I'm not fucking gay!" and stormed off.  Total overreaction.  Luckily, my friends are cool and just laughed and told me to calm down.Now?  Couldn't give a shit.  I'm not out to everyone, just my dad, sister, and bunch of close friends, I identify myself as bi but more interested in guys, but fuck labels.I go to the gym with one of my coworkers after work and he definitely notices where the hell my eyes are going.  One day, while we were benching, I wasn't exactly focused on spotting him. He pulled me in close and said "I don't care if you like to look at other dude's packages, but if you don't spot me when I lift, I'm going to beat the shit out of you."  I just laughed it off.  A few weeks later, he said, "I don't care if you're gay or whatever, but if you are, I'm going to have to make fun of you more."  (He meant it as a joke, you should hear the shit we say to eachother.)  This probably would have been a perfect time to tell him...but I'm guessing it doesn't really need to be said, haha.  Point is, I'm comfortable enough with myself, even though I'm not totally out, I just don't care anymore.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
