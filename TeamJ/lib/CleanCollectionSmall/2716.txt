The only crime to have increased over the last decade is knife crime.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

You can't expect 1st gen immigrants to be carbon copy images of the average brit and it goes against the tide of globalisation. Immigration is  overwhelmingly a good thing and its only when it is badly managed that you start to find problems.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBBC News - Nick Clegg calls for royal commission on drugs reform  by  nonlinearmediain  unitedkingdom[+]ezekielziggy 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoA week is a long time in politics. permalinksavecontextfull commentsUK Deputy Prime Minister says "Time to re-think drugs".  by  ezekielziggyin  worldnews[+]ezekielziggy[S] 6 points7 points8 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy[S] 6 points7 points8 points 5 hours agoCynicism comes cheap.permalinksavecontextfull commentsUK Deputy Prime Minister says "Time to re-think drugs".  by  ezekielziggyin  worldnews[+]ezekielziggy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoIt's the source of the interview and the most popular newspaper in the country.

It gives a false impression to suggest that it was just religion that messed up Iran, a number of rulers have done so and some with our help.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat things about Singapore irk you?  by  notbeforelongin  singapore[+]ezekielziggy -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days agoThis is present everywhere in the world and in the mind of almost every 18 year old male in university.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat things about Singapore irk you?  by  notbeforelongin  singapore[+]ezekielziggy 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI think its more to do with the use of an offensive term.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMusic Industry Threatens to Sue UK Pirate Party over Pirate Bay Proxy  by  ajehalsin  unitedkingdom[+]ezekielziggy 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoI might have only started using torrents and pirate bay as a result of the ban in the first place...not as a statement but I was getting rather annoyed at the other methods I was using.permalinksavecontextfull commentsUK: No Religious Affiliation 25% from 2011 census  by  davidpbrownin  ukpolitics[+]ezekielziggy 9 points10 points11 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy 9 points10 points11 points 3 days agoLondon is a global city, it doesn't play by the same rules as the UK and it never should.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some sequels you have been waiting for that are probably never happening?  by  tommyvodkain  Games[+]ezekielziggy 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoTeam Buddies (ps1); It was bloody difficult to market it in the first place and was a massive flop.

"I don't know what our status is with him."  by  brtwin  entertainment[+]ezekielziggy 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoI believe that anyone and any organisation has a moral responsibility to make the world a better place. In the UK we have a public broadcaster the BBC which does produce quality content and encourages other channels to follow suit (but then the US has AMC, HBO ect which produce quality shows). Basically I think they have a moral responsibility to show quality but should never have a legal obligation.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLord Sugar takes on Donald Trump on Twitter  by  Interceptorin  unitedkingdom[+]ezekielziggy 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]ezekielziggy 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoIn fairness I've only had it once, I was doing some volunteer work with some handicapped children and one of the parents bought us KFC as a way to thank us...

Those in the industry want to make money and the only way they can do that is by appealing to consumer demand (ie what people want to watch). The reality is that people have pretty shitty taste and that's why shitty shows do so well. If there was more demand about shows with socialist utopia's you can guarantee someone would be trying to profit from it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe "half-man" may not be coming back after lashing out at 2-1/2 men, "We have other plans," said CBS CEO Les Moonves.
