For some reason, states refuse to submit information to the background check system.  permalinksaveparent[+]vvelox 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (9 children)[]vvelox 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_System#Persons_subject_to_prohibitionHas been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institutionBecause the proper court stuff for people with mental issues is rarely gone though.Also mental illness does not mean one is a danger to society, it has to be one in which they can be proven to be in a court of law.permalinksaveparent[+]Jodie_Sweetin 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (8 children)[]Jodie_Sweetin 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoHe was drawing pictures and talking about killing peoplepermalinksaveparent[+]vvelox -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (7 children)[]vvelox -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoI was not commenting about the specific case in question in any way other than providing information on the process you asked about.permalinksaveparent[+]Jodie_Sweetin -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (6 children)[]Jodie_Sweetin -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoWell then that's what I'm saying, the restrictions need to be tighter so people like him can't go buy guns after they told their psychiatrist they want to kill people.permalinksaveparent[+]barrett51bmg 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (5 children)[]barrett51bmg 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoYou don't take away somebodies inalienable rights without very good cause. permalinksaveparent[+]SutekhRising 0 points1 point2 points 51 minutes ago (0 children)[]SutekhRising 0 points1 point2 points 51 minutes agoI would think, "Im going to kill a bunch of people" is a pretty good reason to prevent someone from getting firearms.Problem is that even with regulation, people will still get guns if they wanted.permalinksaveparent[+]Jodie_Sweetin -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Jodie_Sweetin -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 hour agoOwning a gun is someone's inalienable right?!?!

Presumably, people with criminal records and mental illnesses wouldn't pass the background check.  If they do, then the background check system needs fixed.  Also, whether they pass the background check or not, it's illegal for them to own a gun.What law would prevent these people from doing an already illegal thing?permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
