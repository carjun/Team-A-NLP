In Nevada, you are not required to have a front license plate on your car. I was driving up north for a wedding and got pulled over by Utah Highway Patrol. "Yea, I pulled you over because you're missing  front license plate." Me: "Well I live in Nevada sir." Him: "....." Me: "...and they don't legally require you to have a front license plate." Him: "Yes, but you're in Utah now." Me: "So am I supposed to pull over and put a plate on every time I cross the state line?"  Him: "No." Me: "Uhm...ok." Him: "How fast were you going?" Me: "Uh...75." Him: ".....have a nice day." permalinksavecontextfull commentsWere about due for this to happen again.  by  Jaroidsin  oaklandraiders[+]InferiousX 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]InferiousX 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoChrist do I miss Gruden right nowpermalinksavecontextfull commentsAs Bears go cold, Lovie Smiths seat is getting hot  by  1908Cubsin  nfl[+]InferiousX 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]InferiousX 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoIn response to this, Lovie stared weepily at reporters and blinked twice in five minutes...permalinksavecontextfull commentsRaider Roundtable: Why, Raiders?

I agree with the idea of passing on a QB this year in the draft and just focus on building the OLine and the Pass Rush.
