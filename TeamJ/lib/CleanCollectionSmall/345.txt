HALBFINGERPublished: December 14, 2012    He carried a black briefcase to his 10th-grade honors English class, and sat near the door so he could readily slip in and out. When called upon, he was intelligent, but nervous and fidgety, spitting his words out, as if having to speak up were painful.

He did all he could to avoid attention, it seemed.        Until Friday.        The authorities said Mr. Lanza, 20, wearing combat gear, carried out one of the deadliest school shootings in the nations history. He killed 20 children and six adults at the elementary school, they said. He then apparently turned his gun on himself. Earlier, the police said, he also killed his mother.        In his brief adulthood, Mr. Lanza had left few footprints, electronic or otherwise. He apparently had no Facebook page, unlike his older brother, Ryan, a Hoboken, N.J., resident who for several hours on Friday was misidentified in news reports as the perpetrator of the massacre.        Adam Lanza did not even appear in his high school yearbook, that of the class of 2010. His spot on the page said, Camera shy. Others who graduated that year said they did not believe he had finished school.        Matt Baier, now a junior at the University of Connecticut, and other high school classmates recalled how deeply uncomfortable Mr. Lanza was in social situations.        Several said in separate interviews that it was their understanding that he had a developmental disorder. They said they had been told that the disorder was Aspergers syndrome, which is considered a high functioning form of autism.        Its not like people picked on him for it, Mr. Baier said. From what I saw, people just let him be, and that was that.        Law enforcement officials said Friday that they were closely examining whether Mr. Lanza had such a disorder.        One former classmate who said he was familiar with the disorder described Mr. Lanza as having a very flat affect, adding, If you looked at him, you couldnt see any emotions going through his head.        Others said Mr. Lanzas evident discomfort prompted giggles from those who did not understand him.        You could tell that he felt so uncomfortable about being put on the spot, said Olivia DeVivo, also now at the University of Connecticut. I think that maybe he wasnt given the right kind of attention or help. I think he went so unnoticed that people didnt even stop to realize that maybe theres actually something else going on here  that maybe he needs to be talking or getting some kind of mental help. In high school, no one really takes the time to look and think, Why is he acting this way?        Ms. DeVivo remembered Mr. Lanza from sixth grade and earlier, talking about aliens and blowing things up, but she chalked this up to the typical talk of prepubescent boys.        Still, after hearing of the news on Friday, Ms. DeVivo reconnected with friends from Newtown, and the consensus was stark. They werent surprised, she said. They said he always seemed like he was someone who was capable of that because he just didnt really connect with our high school, and didnt really connect with our town.        She added: I never saw him with anyone. I cant even think of one person that was associated with him.        Mr. Baier, who sat next to Mr. Lanza in the back of their sophomore-year honors math class, said Mr. Lanza barely said a word all year, but earned high marks. He said he knew this only from peeking at Mr. Lanzas scores when their teacher handed back their tests.         1  2 Next Page  A version of this article appeared in print on December 15, 2012, on page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: A Gunman, Recalled as Intelligent and Shy, Who Left Few Footprints in Life.Get 50% Off The New York Times & Free All Digital Access.Get Free E-mail Alerts on These TopicsNewtown, Conn, Shooting (2012)Lanza, AdamAsperger's SyndromeL'Wren Scott: Fashion, Mick Jagger and now a fragrance      Also in Fashion  Follow the bargain houndsGround rules for a shopper            Inside NYTimes.com        Business On Instagram, a Thriving Bazaar Taps a Big MarketU.S. Wild Horses Are Running Out of RoomOpinion Editorial: A Step Forward in the Euro CrisisEuropean Central Bank oversight of euro-zone banks is just one piece of the puzzle.Music Different War Horse Does the TrickOpinion  Op-Ed: Yuletides OutlawsFashion & Style Ugly Holiday Sweaters Are All the RageHealth  Fat Dad: Hanukkah With My GrandmothersDance Breathtaking Feats of Footwork in MontclairT Magazine Case Study | Cups of Good CheerOpinion Letters: Americas GunsReaders horrified by the latest school violence call for gun control.N.Y. / Region Haitian Rhythms You Can Hear From the StreetOpinion  Disunion: History of Fredericksburg in Objects 2012 The New York Times CompanySite MapPrivacyYour Ad ChoicesAdvertiseTerms of SaleTerms of ServiceWork With UsRSSHelpContact UsSite Feedback
