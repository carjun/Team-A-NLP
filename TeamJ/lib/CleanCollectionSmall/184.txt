The N.R.A. is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again, it said in a statement.

Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut on Tuesday called on residents to participate in a moment of silence on Friday at 9:30 a.m., exactly a week after a gunman massacred 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School.Mr. Malloy also asked that houses of worship and government buildings ring bells 26 times to commemorate the victims. He wrote a letter to all governors in the United States asking that they also participate.Let us all come together collectively to mourn the loss of far too many promising lives at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Mr. Malloy said in a statement on the governors Web site.  Though we will never know the full measure of sorrow experienced by these families, we can let them know that we stand with them during this difficult time.4:28 P.M. |N.R.A. Pledges to Help Prevent Similar Attacks8:24 p.m. | Updated  In its first official statement since the Newtown, Conn., school shootings last Friday, the National Rifle Association said Tuesday that it was shocked, saddened and heartbroken by the murders and would weigh into the growing public debate about guns and violence at a news conference this Friday.The four-million-member gun rights group, one of the countrys most powerful grass-roots lobbying organizations, had stayed silent in recent days, issuing no statements,  deactivating its Facebook account and declining interview requests since the killings of  20 schoolchildren and 7 adults, including the mother of the gunman. Its Facebook account was reactivated on Tuesday evening.In a statement sent by e-mail on Tuesday, the group said, Out of respect for the families, and as a matter of common decency, we have given time for mourning, prayer and a full investigation of the facts before commenting.In the wake of the Newtown shootings, gun opponents and others have called for tighter restrictions on the sale of weapons and better background checks on buyers, measures that are sure to face an uphill battle in Washington. The N.R.A. said Tuesday that it would participate in the debate, but it did not provide details.The N.R.A. is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again, the statement said.Full text of a statement released from the National Rifle Association on Tuesday. The National Rifle Association of America is made up of four million moms and dads, sons and daughters  and we were shocked, saddened and heartbroken by the news of the horrific and senseless murders in Newtown.Out of respect for the families, and as a matter of common decency, we have given time for mourning, prayer and a full investigation of the facts before commenting.The N.R.A. is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again.The N.R.A. is planning to hold a major news conference in the Washington, D.C., area on Friday, December 21.Details will be released to the media at the appropriate time.www.nra.org Nicholas Confessore4:13 P.M. |Murdochs Support for Gun Control Echoed in His PaperWhen Rupert Murdoch spoke out on Twitter in favor of tightening gun control in the wake of the Newtown shootings, other Twitter users wondered if his media empire would take an editorial stance in line with Mr. Murdochs evolving personal views.The holdings of News Corporation, of which Mr. Murdoch is chairman, include The New York Post, The Wall Street Journal and Fox News.Terrible news today. When will politicians find courage to ban automatic weapons?As in Oz after similar tragedy.  Rupert Murdoch(@rupertmurdoch) December 15, 2012Nice words from POTUS on shooting tragedy, but how about some bold leadership action?  Rupert Murdoch(@rupertmurdoch) December 16, 2012@rupertmurdoch Such as increasing the regulation of guns? I hope you will use your media power to push that. You have to.  Dave Jones (@welsh_gas_doc) December 16, 2012@rupertmurdoch are Fox News going to back action on gun controls then, if Obama suggests it?  James Wickham (@JamesWickham) December 16, 2012An answer arrived in an editorial on Tuesday in The New York Post, Adam Lanzas Weapons, that made its point with characteristic bluntness. Has technology rendered the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution obsolete?That is, has the application of modern military design to civilian firearms produced a class of weapons too dangerous to be in general circulation?We say: Yes.The piece acknowledges that the cow is well out of the barn, with enough privately owned guns in the country to arm nearly every adult citizen, and political will for gun restrictions likely to fade as the Newtown shootings recede from the nations consciousness. But that wont negate the need for reform, the editorial says, concluding:Weapons designed expressly to kill human beings, and then modified (wink wink) to meet the federal machine-gun ban, have no legitimate place in American society.Time to get rid of them.The response from The Posts online commenters was largely negative.The entire premise of the article is ridiculous, wrote one reader. The idea that the writers of the constitution would look at the weapons available to criminals today, and then say law abiding citizens should only have bolt action rifles is ludicrous in the extreme. The first responsibility of a gun owner is to secure that weapon when not in use or in your custody. Mrs. Lanza? wrote another.The usual knee jerk reaction by the news media wrote a third, putting The Post in some unfamiliar company indeed.Even some of the few who applauded the editorial expressed surprise. Wow! one reader wrote. One of the few times I agree with a Post editorial.

LabThe damaged hard drive that authorities took from the home where Adam Lanza and his mother lived, and where he fatally shot her, has been sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigations computer lab in Quantico, Va., for further analysis, according to a senior law enforcement official.Investigators have been unable to get any information off the hard drive, which they believe Mr. Lanza, who had taken computer classes at a local college, smashed in an effort to prevent the authorities from determining what he had done on the computer.Within the past few days, the F.B.I. had the hard drive hand delivered to bureau personnel and agents in Quantico who specialize in data retrieval, according to the official.It is going to be tough to get anything from it, the official said. If they are able to do so, it is going to take quite a while. But it is going to be tough.The F.B.I.s technology division, national laboratory and training academy are in Quantico.The official said that he did not know of any other electronic devices  like the computer console that was taken from the house  that had been handed over by local authorities to the F.B.I. for analysis.The investigation of the shooting is being led by the Connecticut State Police.The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be identified discussing an ongoing investigation Michael S.
