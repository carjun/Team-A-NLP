She says shes learned that the mother of the suspected shooter, Nancy Lanza, was found dead in the suspects home in Newtown.Earlier we had information that she was found in the classroom. However, now Im being told that in fact her body was found at the suspect's residence," Candiotti said. "We don't know whether she also lived there. We also don't know the timeline  when was she killed? Was she killed before the shooting began at the school?

It is not clear what caused the confusion among investigators.His older brother, Ryan, was taken into custody for general questioning from a home in Hoboken, New Jersey. Officials did not label Ryan Lanza as a suspect. It is unclear when he may be released.One of the officials say Adams father was also taken in for similar questioning. There is no indication that the father will be charged. The official noted the father has remarried and lives with his new wife in a residence in the general area of Connecticut not too far from where his ex-wife lived.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Extremely unlikely.Edit: As a current high school student, the most security entry procedure that I have ever seen/heard of is a sign that says, "All visitors must report and sign into the front office". It's an elementary school. They have hundreds of parents that walk through those doors every single day. No way in earth that someone has to look at every single one through a camera to be admitted.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Personally what I am thinking (completely speculation) is that something engaged him enough this morning to kill his mother AT HOME, and then he was still so full of rage that he went and took it out on her class at school. TOTAL GUESS on my part. Guess we will see as new info comes out.Edit: But she defiantly is a teacher at the school.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
