Numbers up to twelve now, at least. Real time updates thanks to User mygrapefruitEDIT: More than 20 dead likelyEDIT2: 27 dead, 14 students, one of two gunmen. Other gunmen apparently arrestedEDIT3: One gunmen thought to be a father of a studentEDIT4: Now 18 children dead out of 27, including gunmanEDIT5: Gunmen thought to be in 20s, wearing bullet proof vest and carrying 4 firearms. No word on second gunman, if there was one.EDIT6: Shooter identified as Ryan Lanza, with known connections to Newtown, CTEDIT7: Man found dead in Lanza's home in New JerseyEDIT8: Suspects mother, teacher at the elementary school, dead at the sceneEDIT9: Suspect in custody is are Ryan Lanza's younger brother roommates. No information on whether it is simply for questioning or for greater motivesEDIT10: Man killed in Hoboken was brother. Two roommates of Lanza believed to have no connection to massacre questionedEDIT11: Media says name of shooter has not been officially released. Speculation is now that the shooter was Adam Lanza, Ryan's younger brother. It is believed that Adam stole his brother, Ryan's, identity. Information is still hazy thoughFinal thoughts (11:40 PM EST): Sorry all, had to go to work. This isn't exactly how I pictured my top comment to be =/ it's eerie how much harder something like this hits when it's a ten minute drive down the road from you. I'm sure all of the information has been released since I left for work so I won't bother updating. Keep these families affected in your thoughts and prayers, as well as those families affected by the attack in China,  and let's hope we can finally find a way to keep psychopaths away from not only our children, but from all innocents. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your useless talent?  by  IamSofaKingIttyin  AskReddit[+]mattyg313 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mattyg313 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoNice try, Dilophosaurus.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIts Time to Fix the Pitifully Slow, Expensive Internet Access in the U.S.  by  maxwellhillin  technology[+]mattyg313 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mattyg313 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoRelevantpermalinksavecontextfull commentsOn my first cake day, I Honor my recently deceased puppy, Madison.
