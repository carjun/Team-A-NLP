It's the stigma that keeps people shammed and too embarrassed to get them or worse, they want help but if they are underage their family won't let them for fear of embarrassing the family.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Just a heads up!My two gynos both say they use cups with IUD and couldn't see how a tampon would be any different than a cup with an IUD. They say if it comes out with the cup it was going to come out anyway but people will blame the cup. Just get the strings trimmed short and they won't be in the way. Every other cup company says IUDs with cups are not a problem, no more than a tampon.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat sex myth(s) did you believe as a virgin?  by  Pube_Sprinklesin  AskReddit[+]I_PISS_HAIR 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]I_PISS_HAIR 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoOh my god i laughed so hard at "penor".permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
