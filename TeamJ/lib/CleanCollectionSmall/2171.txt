I still give the edge to Ruth as the greatest player ever (even without considering his pitching), but it's a fair fight.  Ruth is a distant #1 to everyone if you either consider steroids (which kills Bonds) or consider the fact that Ruth was also a pretty damn good pitcher (which simply makes him even more incomparable).permalinksavecontextfull comments"It's become evident that this Hamilton deal was made over the head of the Angels' baseball operations department. -Buster Olney, Twitter  by  BahstenSawxAllDayin  baseball[+]kavorka2 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]kavorka2 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoAll that means is the guy writing the checks felt that it was worth it, which is fine.  Your GM and baseball operations job is to build a team based on the confines of a budget range.  If the owner decides "fuck it, just drop an extra $125m because I like this Hamilton fella" then nobody is going to complain.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho has a better lineup now Detroit Tigers or the Los Angeles Angels?  by  ThemBastardsin  baseball[+]kavorka2 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]kavorka2 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoI agree with you on both counts.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that even if Barry Bonds had gotten zero hits in 2004, he still would have had a higher OBP than the player who led the league in hits  by  misty_mountain_hopin  baseball[+]kavorka2 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]kavorka2 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoNot saying they are equal.  But both could of been transcendant athletes unequaled in accomplishments.  Koufax was the best pitcher in baseball but only for a brief moment, and missed out on being one of the greatest pitchers of all time.  He was a borderline HOF candidate (though a unique one).  Bo never got anywhere close to that in terms of numbers, yes.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen I saw my girlfriend's 411 charges on our phone bill  by  brad995in  AdviceAnimals[+]kavorka2 23 points24 points25 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]kavorka2 23 points24 points25 points 4 hours agoGot into a huge fight with the wife over this once.

Your argument for Cobb appears to be that he could have been a better hitter if he had tried differently.  Even if true... so what?  Ruth finished with a much higher OBP and SLG.  He destroyed every single record of the day.  Use any stat except batting average and he crushes Cobb.  And I'm not a total "new stat" guy.  But there's no credible argument for saying Cobb was a better hitter than Ruth.  And to top it all off, Ruth probably was a borderline Hall of Famer as a pitcher if he had never picked up a bat.  He'll never be surpassed in baseball greatness.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that even if Barry Bonds had gotten zero hits in 2004, he still would have had a higher OBP than the player who led the league in hits  by  misty_mountain_hopin  baseball[+]kavorka2 7 points8 points9 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]kavorka2 7 points8 points9 points 20 hours ago13.4 K/9Unreal stat.  All-time record for a starter and might never be broken.   Pedro #2 at 13.2 (1999) and after that it drops to 12.5.  And here's the best part... Randy has 7 out of the 10 best seasons of all time.

It's really not even close.

Title insurance.  What a fucking scam.  You even have to buy title insurance when you refinance, which is surprisingly not illegal.  I mean... you are forced to buy something you already have.  It's not like the title insurance policy you bought the first time expires just because you refinanced.  I realize this will get buried and never seen.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJosh Hamilton agrees to 5 year deal with Angels  by  gwords16in  baseball[+]kavorka2 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]kavorka2 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoEither they did, or the GM and every single lawyer they used to negotiate and draft contracts should be fired.  Even if there's a low chance it happens, including something like that shouldn't have cost them any other bargaining points -- and could save them from blowing $100 million on a guy in rehab.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJosh Hamilton agrees to 5 year deal with Angels  by  gwords16in  baseball[+]kavorka2 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]kavorka2 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoIt'd be soul killing to trade Zimmerman and all of those guys -- except Posey -- are earning at-or-near market value for their services so not sure they are really worth all that much anyway.
