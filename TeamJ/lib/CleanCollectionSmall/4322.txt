What are your thoughts on distance?  by  ServedwithoutShoesin  AskMen[+]Durinthal 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]Durinthal 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*They're possible but may take considerably more effort than local relationships, particularly at your age.College is notorious for breaking high school LDRs and for good reason: you're suddenly surrounded by hundreds or thousands of new people your age 24/7 with less supervision and more access to alcohol. It's harder to remember how much you care about someone hundreds of miles away with so many new opportunities in front of you. And you're choosing to miss out on a lot of the socialization that happens (with new friends, not just romantic interests) so you have time to call or have a video chat.There are a lot of successes and a lot of failures, just take a look at /r/longdistance for that. It's just rougher when you're in a transitional period of your life.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWooden Map my GF and I made [OC] [1440x1440]  by  gorillapitin  MapPorn[+]Durinthal 13 points14 points15 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Durinthal 13 points14 points15 points 2 days agoThink of it as map BDSM. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNon-natives: how did you make friends when you moved to the Boston area?  by  manderpin  boston[+]Durinthal 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Durinthal 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoDefinitely, I met most of my friends here through the PAX community.
