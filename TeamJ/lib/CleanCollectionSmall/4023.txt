As a fraction of the medical professionals on hand swung into action, the rest waited tensely.Overseeing it was Dr. Patrick Broderick, the hospital's chairman of emergency medicine. Around midday, as the unbearable scope of the tragedy was becoming clear to the world, Broderick received another call. There would be no more patients. Full story here.
