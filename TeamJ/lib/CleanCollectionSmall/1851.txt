Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]soothfast 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]soothfast 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoThis is true.  However restricting access to them, particularly to semi-automatic weapons may have some effect.  Strict laws about where and how guns are stored for example.  There must be a middle ground that can be found that ALL states can adhere to.  Because the current status quo on guns is NOT WORKING.  And I haven't even got onto mental health services which clearly has a part to play as the young men who carry out these crimes are clearly slipping through the safety net.  Something is going very wrong in the US.  Time to deal with it rather than turn a blind eye.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]soothfast 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]soothfast 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoTotally agree with you.  Knee jerk "ban guns" isn't the whole problem here, it all goes much deeper and mental health issues are another key factor in all these incidents as far as I can tell.   Each and every time the individual/s who carry out these atrocities are not well.  Not excusing them (not AT ALL) but it is a truth: they are all deeply disturbed individuals.  The fact they have access to weapons just adds to the deadly mix.   No doubt in my mind there needs to be restrictions/bans on semi automatic weapons but also there needs to be something done in the area of mental health support services.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]soothfast 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]soothfast 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoYou know that Andy Murray the tennis player was at Dunblane when that happened when he was a little boy at that school.  He hid from the gunman in a cupboard.  I thought of him when I heard this news because of that.  Just a horrible tragedy and so sad to see a primary school shooting happen again.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen and why did people start leaving home for short vacations?  by  ihabtomin  AskHistorians[+]soothfast 7 points8 points9 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]soothfast 7 points8 points9 points 19 hours agoHere's some more info on this, specifically "wakes week" where the factories would close and allow working people to go to the seaside for a week's holiday:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakes_weekpermalinksavecontextfull commentsMy cousin was in a motorcycle accident last month, has no insurance, and spent 4 days in the hospital.

A terrible tragedy and it reminds me of the Dunblane killings that happened in a primary school in Scotland some years ago.  Amidst all of this and my sadness for the loved ones of the dead, my heart also goes out to the men and women of the emergency services who have to deal with these things. The ambulance crew and police who had to go into the room and be confronted with what must have been a scene from hell.  I cannot imagine how awful that must be.  They are amazing people and I hope they get the support they need to deal with what they have gone through.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOfficial 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' Discussion Thread  by  SomeCalciumin  movies[+]soothfast 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]soothfast 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoSo glad to hear Martin Freeman nailed it.

As someone who has struggled with mental health issues myself and seen family members hospitalised by them this whole story has saddened me. So very many people struggle with depression and never seek help. I am a woman and feel its easier for my sex to talk to friends and loved ones about it but its that bit harder for men. The stupid macho thing about being in control and together makes it that much harder for blokes to speak out and /or confide n others if they are struggling with their feelings and emotions. Guys, don't bottle it up. It really is good to talk.  There is no shame. In all honesty it's a strength in my opinion to talk to someone and be honest about your feelings. A problem shared is a problem halved . permalinksavecontextfull commentsNorth Korea plans rocket launch within days  by  vigorousin  worldnews[+]soothfast 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]soothfast 1 point2 points3 points 13 days agoBut it's true ! A rocket at a firework display is as deadly as the rubbish fired by N Korea. Which is a good thing and something to be glad about. No one would crack jokes if there was any serious potential for harm. The whole thing is farcical. And tragic. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNeed help saving an injured squirrel!!!! Hole in his side and back legs don't move!  by  nomfakechowin  pics[+]soothfast 1 point2 points3 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]soothfast 1 point2 points3 points 14 days agoYou do need to find someone who can really as it won't survive in the wild if its paralysed and it won't have any quality of life if you keep it as its a wild animal.  Are there any wild animal rescue centres locally to you who could take the poor thing to and do the deed.  I fully appreciate how killing it will be difficult.  Not everyone is cut out for that sort of thing. If all else fails, take it outside and leave it somewhere under a bush or something.  It will get predated.  Which is what would have happened to it had you not found it. Nature red, tooth and claw and all of that.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat were the popular games during your period of expertise?  by  pieoncarin  AskHistorians[+]soothfast 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]soothfast 0 points1 point2 points 14 days agoWhist is still played.

Quite often with these  the skin colouring is not very subtle and its overdone and it spoils the whole effect.  But you have got it just right and done justice to the lighting etc - Also the beard and hair, nicely done.   It looks like a colour photograph rather than a colourised photo.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsAmerican Viewer Q: What's the difference between UK Channels? BBC Three vs BBC One?  by  HiHeyHaiin  BritishTV[+]soothfast 2 points3 points4 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]soothfast 2 points3 points4 points 14 days agoNo one had a satellite dish back then.  Seriously, it was something only rich people would even consider.   So to all intents and purposes for most people channel 4 was the 4th option available and it was a BIG deal when it happened as you didn't need anything extra or new fangled (for the time, remember) to receive.  So everyone was glued to their screens when the new channel 4 logo came up.  Unlike for sky ;-)permalinksavecontextfull commentsMCNY Collections Portal - Worth and Mainbocher.
