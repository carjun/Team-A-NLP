Sadly, liberals are trying to make political hay out of the situation by clamoring yet again for more gun control.Connecticut has the fourth most strict gun regulations in the country. In view of that, I would like to pose a question to those who so rabidly rant for the expulsion of guns from law-abiding citizens. How is it that those laws did not protect the children and teachers at Sandy Hook school?If gun control laws, which created a gun-free zone (aka, a defense-free zone), did not protect those people, how is it that more of the same will protect them further? Also, since the school was a gun-free zone, how is it that the shooter found his way into the school with a gun?The answer is quite simple. The perpetrator knew he could do his thing without serious resistance. When the cops arrived, he killed himself rather than face resistance. How much faster might he have stopped shooting had there been a teacher with a gun to take him out, thereby saving countless lives in the process?
