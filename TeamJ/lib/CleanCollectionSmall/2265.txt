You can already see how people are insulting me and putting words in my mouth, though.It's basically impossible to do a one-to-one comparison to Europe.  Compared to particular EU member countries, the US has a larger population and more cultural and economic diversity.  Compared to the entire EU, the US has a smaller population.My point is that all of the people who love to say "We've had X number of shootings in the UK/Germany while the US has had Y number of shootings," aren't comparing apples-to-apples.  My US to EU comparison isn't apples-to-apples either because no apples-to-apples comparison exists, but it's a different viewpoint which is just as valid as the other comparisons.As I said in another post, it's just not as simple as sayingThere are so many fucking shootings in America. People don't want to acknowledge that, though, and they would rather just insult me and downvote me for pointing that out.permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: How evolutionary theory is compatible with Biblical teaching if at all.  by  Nwmguyin  Christianity[+]derrick81787 1 point2 points3 points 45 minutes ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 1 point2 points3 points 45 minutes agoI'm not trying to start an argument, but I don't see how it is hard to make that compatible with a spherical earth.

Is this willful ignorance on your part?I addressed why physical size is relevant in a reply to another person who pointed out the same thing but in a much nicer way.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

That is why I recommended comparing the US to the EU, not to particular member countries.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

There are very few mass shootings in my particular state too, but guess what, my state is nothing like Connecticut and is 1,000 miles away from there.Size comes into it because a large size implies a large set of different cultures and circumstances.  Basically, like I said in a reply to someone else, it's much more complicated than the over-simplifiedThere are so many fucking shootings in America. that so many people like to express.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 59 minutes agoThat is a useful measurement but not the only useful measurement.  A larger physical size implies different cultures and different circumstances.  Just lumping the entire United States into one broad generalization is very similar to blaming the entire EU for problems that rarely pop up in certain areas of certain member countries.It's much more complicated than justThere are so many fucking shootings in America. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs God evil for destroying entire nations in the Old Testament?  by  WertFigin  Christianity[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI just like to stick to facts.  You implied child sacrifice in the case of Abraham, and I wanted to point out that it didn't happen and was never going to happen.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]derrick81787 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoI second StrahansToothGap's request for a source.Additionally, I consider other ways of meeting a violent death to be just as bad as being shot to death.  If your numbers turn out to be true, and hypothetically, there were 2 mass stabbings in the US but 50 mass stabbings in the other countries, then I would think that the US comes out on top here.  However, things like that are not taken into consideration with the numbers that you present.permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: How evolutionary theory is compatible with Biblical teaching if at all.  by  Nwmguyin  Christianity[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWell, I don't want to start a war with the Catholics in this thread, but I have my own opinions of the Catholic church.  These would not be the only verses that they've twisted around, IMO.I appreciate you presenting both sides, though.  Personally, I think that the greater evidence from the Bible would point to a round Earth, as "circle of the earth" is not a common figure of speech.  However, I don't think that any of these verses is strong evidence for any particular shape.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRaccoon problems/solutions  by  manfromthenastyin  guns[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWell, then I defer to you.  I've never actually shot an animal with them.  I just knew that looking at the numbers, it is a lighter bullet traveling at a slower speed.  They are quiet, though, and I like that.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

School should be let out after the ordeal is over.  People shouldn't be wandering around while a shooter is on the loose.permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: How evolutionary theory is compatible with Biblical teaching if at all.  by  Nwmguyin  Christianity[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoSo you're using a very common figure of speech as your basis?  Do you think that anyone who has ever said "ends of the Earth" honestly believes that the earth is flat/square/not spherical?permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs God evil for destroying entire nations in the Old Testament?  by  WertFigin  Christianity[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoThe people of Israel have very nearly been destroyed numerous times, leaving very few survivors.

No child sacrifice took place, and that was because God prevented it.Abraham was from Canaan, where child sacrifice was an accepted practice.  That was just a test to see if Abraham was committed to God.  Of course Abraham didn't know this, but at no point in time was God ever going to let the sacrifice take place.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Just in case you aren't American, I'd like to point out that America is more than twice the size of the entire European Union.  These shootings are actually quite rare.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

You make it sound easy, like Gadsden doesn't even have a chance.Also, the gunman already has guns.  These things never end because the shooter doesn't have a gun he can use.  They end when the shooter is killed or when the shooter chooses to stop.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Presumably, people with criminal records and mental illnesses wouldn't pass the background check.  If they do, then the background check system needs fixed.  Also, whether they pass the background check or not, it's illegal for them to own a gun.What law would prevent these people from doing an already illegal thing?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]derrick81787 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour agoWhat about them?  How many gun laws are already being broken by these shooters?  So far, I see attempted murder and violation of a gun-free zone.  If it turns out that either of these people have committed crimes in the past, then there's illegal possession of a firearm.What proposed gun law, other than a total ban of guns from everybody, would prevent this from happening?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Heck, it's even a Friday.

Genuinely curious here.  I've read the entire thing and don't remember anything in the Bible that attempts to describe the shape of the earth.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the point of the "wavy" metal to the right of the front sight in this picture?  by  DrDooneStruttsin  guns[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoI don't think that each notch represents any specific distance, as that would depend on the ammo.  Through trial and error, you can determine what the distances represent for the ammo that you use, though.Personally, I just use mine for sight adjustment.  Adjust so that your rifle shoots to the point of aim at whatever range you want, and after that just aim slightly higher or lower depending on the distance to your target.  For .22lr with basic rifle sights, this is the way to do it, IMO.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
