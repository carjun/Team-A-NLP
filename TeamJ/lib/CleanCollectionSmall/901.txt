They are just fueling their bodies because they are doing tons of conditioning. Plus it's hard to gain weight when you do all of that conditioning. permalinksavecontextfull comments10000 Hours, Episode 1 - Two brothers from California test out the 10000 Hours Theory on their pursuit to becoming NBA players.  by  amsidin  videos[+]tuxedomask100 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tuxedomask100 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoGreat little docu series. Was thoroughly entertained by their dedication and hard work. I am Asian like them, about 5'9 and played basketball in high school. I didn't work as hard as them but I had natural talent where I could shoot the ball really well. Both of these guys are good shooters, but you can tell they acquired their shooting from hours upon hours of practice. They could hoist 1 billion shots but they'll never shoot as well as Ray Allen. Point is no matter how hard you work at something, there will be a talent ceiling you can't go beyond. I don't run nearly as many sprints as these guys (if any at all) but I'm willing to bet I can step in a gym right now and beat them in a shooting contest. They are definitely maximizing their skills which I give them props for, but they will reach a talent ceiling because certain people are just born more talented or gifted than others.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWeek 15 Team Defense (D/ST) Projections  by  eink21in  fantasyfootball[+]tuxedomask100 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tuxedomask100 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoNice call on Cincypermalinksavecontextfull commentsWho else got effed by the Seahawks D?  by  airhamin  fantasyfootball[+]tuxedomask100 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (0 children)[]tuxedomask100 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoI wouldn't mind if they got rid of defenses from fantasy football since that's the one thing that can turn the tide for any team. permalinksavecontextfull commentsOFFICIAL THURSDAY WDIS THREAD: WR  by  FantasyModin  fantasyfootball[+]tuxedomask100 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tuxedomask100 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoStandard scoring Pick 3:Cobb @ ChiWallace @ DallasAustin vs PittAndre Johnson vs Indpermalinksavecontextfull commentsOFFICIAL THURSDAY WDIS THREAD: RB  by  FantasyModin  fantasyfootball[+]tuxedomask100 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]tuxedomask100 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoBryce Brown vs Cin or Chris Johnson vs NYJ?
