I figured since there are addons to turn of melee sounds, maybe there would be an addon to turn off spell effects, but no dice. :(We're working on Wind Lord 25 right now, and when all the adds get clumped up and the AoE/cleaving begins for the first time, BOOM, 4-5 seconds of seriously low fps.Once it clears up after that 4-5 seconds the rest of the fight goes fine. But when you're trying to go all out to get the first pack down, 4-5 seconds matters.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHad a 90 degree scoliotic curve.

I wouldn't say he stalked me, but he definitely made me feel uncomfortable when he was around and he liked "walking me to class." I was being VERY sure not to give any vibes that would make him think I was remotely interested in dating him, though he expressed interest on multiple occasions. I recall telling him to leave me alone on several occasions after it got to the point where he was just constantly wherever I was.I transferred schools and he didn't have my number or anything, so I put him out of my mind.Two years later I was at a party with some friends from the original school, and when I went to leave he was outside. He tried to force me into his car. I fought back but he had me at a good angle - a group of people happened to leave the building at the same time and they came over to help.He said he was just trying to talk to me ("it would be quieter in the car," I remember him saying). I like to pretend this was true, and not think that he was going to take me off into the night and make a suit out of my skin.Turns out (and this is the creepiest part imo) he made a fake facebook profile with the name of one of my (female) friends. He got pictures of her, made profiles for fake friends for him to add, the whole nine yards. He made regular status updates for OVER A YEAR to make the profile look convincing, and then added me as a friend. He used it to figure out I was going to the party (among other things), and that's how he found me.Needless to say, he is one of two reasons I now refuse to have a facebook.TL;DR: Creepy guy from college faked a friend's facebook page for over a year to stalk me and try to kidnap me (sort of/maybe).permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy front page had some advice for a redditor in distress.  by  octobereighthin  funny[+]octobereighth[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]octobereighth[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoYes, I know chocolate doesn't help all ladies with an angry uterus, but I know I always want some (maybe it's the iron content?).permalinksavecontextfull comments25234My front page had some advice for a redditor in distress.
