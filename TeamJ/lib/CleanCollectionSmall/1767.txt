Another man dressed in camouflage  was taken out of the nearby woods in handcuffs. Unknown involvement at this time but you would think he would have to be involved in some way. permalinksavecontextfull commentsOne of the best spots in Rumble History, Kofi handwalks and saves himself  by  jimmy_dokiin  SquaredCircle[+]zeppelin1023 17 points18 points19 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]zeppelin1023 17 points18 points19 points 1 day agoMorrison's spot the next night in the raw rumble was also pretty fucking cool as well permalinksavecontextfull commentsOne of the best spots in Rumble History, Kofi handwalks and saves himself  by  jimmy_dokiin  SquaredCircle[+]zeppelin1023 16 points17 points18 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]zeppelin1023 16 points17 points18 points 1 day ago*two of my favorite moments came from Royal Rumble 2000 (maybe a bit biased since i was there live) one was with Kaientai running in several times throughout the match (and of course when Taka  landed on his face and was taken out of the match) and of course this moment. I was a huge Too Cool fan as a kid so you can probably imagine  how much i freaked out when this happened. And honestly, it was one of the biggest pops of the night. permalinksavecontextfull commentsS08 e09 The Gang Dines Out DISCUSSION  by  zeppelin1023in  IASIP[+]zeppelin1023[S] 9 points10 points11 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]zeppelin1023[S] 9 points10 points11 points 1 day agoReally? wow I'm surprised.

Check out Pinky And The Brain, Anamaniacs, and movies like Shrek. Great  jokes that could be considered childish but they're still just as funny and pretty brilliant at times. It's the writing that is just awful and lazily written. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlright kids. End of the year awards are nearly upon us.
