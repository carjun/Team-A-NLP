Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]thesorrow312 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]thesorrow312 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoDo you believe that gun rights should be completely unregulated?Should people be allowed to have RPGs? Machine guns? Arctic warfare Magnums?   It is funny that the people who care about these types of freedoms being taken away, highly correlate with the same people who want to take reproductive rights freedoms away, social / welfare programs away,  and want to implant their religious beliefs on others. But when it comes to guns, it is all of a sudden the most important thing in the world.   I don't buy these arguments. If they cared about freedoms, they would care about more important freedoms than being able to have an AR-15 as a personal defense weapon. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I still think something was off with fantasy, between that kind of noobish move (everyone knows high ground on Antiga is extremely important to have control over, and you dont just walk your army up onto it without scouting first) , to his failure to literally make units for 20-30 seconds and hovering more than 1k gas and minerals. He must have had something else on his mind, or for some reason been very nervous.  It doesn't make sense coming from an extremely hardened Esports pro with amazing wins and stats under his belt.I want to see him get past the up and downs, as well as flash and Jaedong. I really want to see these guys' play improve. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNY Times: "It is a dark day for the rule of law. Federal and state authorities have chosen not to indict HSBC, the London-based bank, on charges of vast and prolonged money laundering, for fear that criminal prosecution would topple the bank and, in the process, endanger the financial system."  by  madcat033in  TrueReddit[+]thesorrow312 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]thesorrow312 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoNothing's easier than controlling a population that thinks they're doing fine. Give them some luxury items, a little house, and a car and they'll do what you say.This why we lefties consider liberalism such a dangerous compromise ideology.  Also why many have philosophized that there can be no peaceful revolution to lead to a socialistic society and system of economy.  Orwell said it perfectly when he said that it will never be possible to convince the ownership and liberal (middle) class of socialism morally, because it would be convincing them against their interests, and that will never happen.  The proletariat must rise up themselves.We will never be able to merely convince those who own land and means of production that they should give it up.   This is why I believe that Ghandi is so glorified in our history and culture.  Let me be preemptive here, I am not saying Ghandi is not deserved of great respect, so let me explain.   I am saying that it is in the benefit of the status quo to teach the population that non violent protest is the only way for activists to get what they want.  In "The soul of man under socialism", Oscar Wilde succinctly says that "the worst slave owners were the ones who were kind to their slaves", because in doing so, they made the terror of the system harder for people suffering and people contemplating it to fully understand.   This same thing can be said about capitalism.  Liberalism, in its slow (too slow) progressive reform of a system that we the left believe should just be removed and started from scratch, is in the benefit of the capitalist class because it slows down the inevitable revolution.  Slavoj Zizek refers to this as "capitalism with a human face". Without social and welfare programs, people would revolt faster and in higher numbers.  So in a sense, it would actually be better in the long run (from our perspective) to vote for republicans so that they run the country into the ground faster, and thus the collapse of the system.   permalinksavecontextfull commentsA new species of tarantula has been named after Dave Mustaine  by  Machinaxin  Metal[+]thesorrow312 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]thesorrow312 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoProminent on Wake Up dead, and another of Megadave's excellent songs, "Ride the Lightning". permalinksavecontextfull commentsjust sayin'...  by  tobbsnin  socialism[+]thesorrow312 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]thesorrow312 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoComrades, lets not allow libertarian to be defined as anarcho capitalism.Libertarian classically has been anarcho-socialist / libertarian - socialist.
