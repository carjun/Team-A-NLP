A heavily armed gunman opened fire on school children and staff at a Connecticut elementary school, killing seven adults and 20 children.REUTERSTragedyVideo: Obama describes 'overwhelming grief' at Connecticut school shootingAsking the children to close their eyes as they walked past blood and bodies was an important first step in helping the youngsters  aged 5 to 10  deal with such an enormous tragedy, said Kevin Cameron, an Alberta-based trauma specialist. Now is the time for reassurance and psychological first aid, he added, not for deconstructing one of the deadliest school shootings in American history.We do not want to be forcing kids to talk about what they saw, what they experienced before theyre ready, said Mr. Cameron, who trains crisis-response teams in Canada and internationally. Instead, what we really need to do is emphasize that they are now safe, that were going to keep them safe, he added.And by nature we can lay the foundation to work with them in the weeks and months to follow.Profound trauma can have lasting effects on children, the trauma specialist noted, potentially influencing their brain and emotional development. Mr. Cameron has been on the front lines of helping Canadian schools and students cope with devastation. He was invited to Grande Prairie, Alta., after four high-school football players died in a car crash last year. He aided Bathurst High in New Brunswick, which lost seven students and an adult in a van crash in 2008. And he led the crisis response to a school shooting in Taber, Alta., which occurred only eight days after the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, where 15 people were killed.In the days ahead, Mr. Cameron said its important for police, school and health officials to keep a close watch for copycats.We know that high-profile violence intensifies already existing symptoms in other troubled individuals, he said. We identified this post-Columbine and in other incidents.Criminologist Ray Surette, who teaches at the University of Central Florida, is also worried about copycats. He said the intense media storm that accompanies mass shootings can fuel other heinous crimes.My concern is there is going to be people out there who are going to say Wow, so this is all I have to do to get my moment of infamy and I can go out with a bang.Mr. Cameron that in times of grief, children often take their cues from adults. Like the children, the adults of Newtown will need counselling and guidance to cope.If the adults, who know they need to be there for the kids, are actually beginning to fall apart, their own recovery will be very complex as they struggle with guilt, Mr. Cameron said.Because of how severe this situation is, you know this is going to be years for people to really be able to get back to anything even close to a normal life.More Related to this StoryA town and nation mourn in wake of Connecticut shootingBrother of gunman in Conn. shooting wrongly cited as killerConnecticut town stricken by grief in wake of shooting that claimed 28 including gunmanThe 10 deadliest mass shootings in U.S. historyComments closedPrint /LicenseAAEditors' PicksOUR TIME TO LEADWhy China is a genetic powerhouse with a problemGlobe InvestorWhy Buffett is bullish on Buffett - and not much elseReport on BusinessHow upscale department stores are reinvigorating themselvesGlobe InvestorDividend stocks: Eleven winners and losers from 2012Most popular videos  NewsNew condom rules threaten L.A.'s adult film industry NewsSandy Hook principal was a 'guardian angel,' parent says NewsGrieving Obama says American hearts 'heavy with hurt' NewsAerial view of the Lanza home in Newtown NewsObama describes 'overwhelming grief' at Connecticut school shooting NewsHillary Clinton recovering from concussion NewsStudents, staff shot at Sandy Hook Elementary School, police say LifeShould gyms be allowed to ban skinny people from joining?More from The Globe and MailMost Popular StoriesShooter forced his way into school, and killed with chilling efficiencyPicture of shooters family begins to take shapeHillary Clinton sustains concussion after fainting, spokesman saysHow the Liberal Party lost Mark CarneyPolice say they have good evidence of the shooter's motivesMore Top Stories FootballBrady, Belichick and Bob: The Patriots Way works CommentaryWhy schools are a target of choice FootballFormer Dallas Cowboy Jerry Brown remembered at funeral TelevisionA great horse story for the holidays, and true ManagingYoPRO owners meet with Loblaw chief over yogurt dispute Number CruncherREITs lose their magic for leading dividend fund managerVideoNewtown residents coming to grips with school shootingHosting a holiday party?
