If you want to leave the company be due to TBTF, fine, but at least charge the actual individuals who made the crime so.You know a crime was committed, and you know what individuals are responsible. This should be academic.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAs an improviser, is your ideal audience reaction a laugh or a cheer?  by  justeatquichealreadyin  improv[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoThe audience can react however the hell they want.If I go in wanting or expecting a particular reaction I am only setting myself up for disappointment.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes agoI guess this would be another one of those times where it would be inappropriate to talk about gun laws.You would be correct.The important topic is the motive of the shooter. Guns or no guns, someone made the active choice to walk into a school and kill people. What led that person to decide this was a good idea?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]HeroicGomez -8 points-7 points-6 points 55 minutes ago*(0 children)[]HeroicGomez -8 points-7 points-6 points 55 minutes ago*Seriously, I heard about this and the only thing I found as sick as the fact that someone decided to kill a bunch of kids is that I knew the gun control activists would go off everywhere and drown out the real discussion, which is what led someone to decide that shooting up a school was a good idea.EDIT: We can have both discussions. Most will only choose to have one.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat warrants a player's value?  by  lyee01in  baseball[+]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoIt's not so much value as supply and demand.There is a shit-ton of TV money in baseball right now, and MLBPA makes sure a healthy portion of that trickles down to the players who bring fans to the ballpark. That's why the average MLB player pulls in $3.2 mil and why a star like Hamilton can pull down $25mil a year.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWas this a good play?  by  tekn04in  poker[+]HeroicGomez 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago*(0 children)[]HeroicGomez 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago*If you decide you're short you don't reduce the size of your raise. You become more selective about getting involved, and then be more willing to get involved more aggressively.EDIT: You are overthinking leverage at the Micro level. You may have a point if we're talking higher stakes, but a minraise at the micros may as well be a limp.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy tipping feels like an obligation?  by  dota2invokerin  poker[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoITT: Cheap, tight-ass and self-absorbed online playerspermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy tipping feels like an obligation?  by  dota2invokerin  poker[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoIt's a dollar a pot.If it's that big a deal to your bottom line to tip a dollar or two per pot to the dealer, you're probably not a good player.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWas this a good play?  by  tekn04in  poker[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoTanking and checking after a scare card hits, when you had been previously active, is usually a red flag to opponents, even at the micro level.Hero got away with it because villain stupidly bluff-shoved the river, but typically checking a scare card after that line kills your action dead.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWas this a good play?  by  tekn04in  poker[+]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoYou don't have to go crazy, just 3xBB or 4xBB, and if you can't do that at 50BB then you're playing the wrong game.The minraise is far too light.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFormer prisoners of reddit, what are some misconceptions that many people have about prisons/ the prison system?  by  errd21in  AskReddit[+]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoProbably fibbing for karma.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOoba Tooba might be a funny name but I just had one of the BEST BURRITOS on capitol hill  by  Themaxlongin  Seattle[+]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoAte there recently. It takes them a loooooong time to make burritos that competitors can make in a fraction of the time. And while good it's not so much better that it's worth the wait. Hard sell, especially in that neighborhood.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy do many partners of cheating people tend to blame the "other person" more than their own partners?  by  Bristenain  AskReddit[+]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoIt's easier to blame someone else for your problems than to accept responsibility.This should be obvious.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey r/frugal, I could use some budgeting advice.  by  heartwellin  Frugal[+]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoWhere do you live and why do you live there?Cutting your rent expenses to 30-40% of your income is a good start.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDiscussion: Cash tournaments?  by  10J18R1Ain  poker[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoOut of 20 players, that's top 25%... still pretty good.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama: "It would not make sense for us to see a top priority as going after recreational users in states that have determined that it's legal."

In fact, the law itself only governs personal possession of an ounce. Dealers obviously hold way more than an ounce.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust curious about the town.
