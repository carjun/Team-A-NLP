For the next several hours, the numbers climbed until police confirmed later in the day that 28 were dead in all.Confusing things was a mistaken identity of the shooter. Police sources finally said it was Adam Lanza who was the gunman while his brother, Ryan, was being questioned. Their mother, Nancy, worked at the school with kindergarten children.Late Friday, authorities confirmed that the body of Lanza's mother, Nancy, was found at the secondary crime scene.AlsoPhotos:Massacre at elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Who they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsGeorgeann Manfredonia, a volunteer at the school, said she spent part of Thursday wrapping presents for the teachers and the school's principal. Her 6-year-old daughter attends the Sandy Hook.When you walk in there, its just a happy, happy place, she said, in a telephone interview Friday with The Los Angeles Times. Its a wonderful school run by an amazing principal. Shes just the most positive, energetic person youve ever met.You always felt safe here. The last crime that took place was years ago, Manfredonia said.On Friday morning, her husband, Chris, went to help make gingerbread houses in the first-grade class of the couples daughter. As he approached the school, he heard popping sounds, then smelled sulfur.He attempted to reach his daughter by going around the side of the school. Police had arrived by then, stopped him and briefly handcuffed him.Georgeann found a neighbors child and held that child and her own son. A parent came running out of the school cradling a little girl.I covered them so they couldnt see anything," she said. "I couldnt see if the little girl was hurt.News still had not filtered out about the shooting and few parents were around. Police and firefighters began leading the children from the school to a nearby firehouse.Susan Birge, trained as a mental health disaster responder for the Red Cross, spent the afternoon counseling the 15 to 20 family members huddled in the firehouse. "They are just devastated," she said.Because the crime scene is so extensive, victims' families will not be able to see their loved ones until tomorrow at the earliest, she said. Instead, they're in the firehouse with food, clergy and each other.Standing outside the firehouse, where officials were delivering terrible news to parents, Msgr. Robert Weiss of St. Rose Church said he had been comforting grieving families.I just had a situation where a mothers alarm went off and it was a notice to take her son to Cub Scouts, Weiss said. And then she realized she wont be taking him to Cub Scouts anymore.Weiss said he had to tell the boys sister that she would not be able to play with her brother again.A memorial for victims was scheduled Friday evening at St. Rose. Another memorial was planned for Trinity Church.The shooting is just the latest to stun a nation still reeling from such tragedies as the 1999 Columbine High School massacre that left 15 dead. Last summer, more than 12 were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. And earlier this week, three, including the gunman, died in a shooting at a shopping mall in Portland, Ore.The only mass shooting in the United States with more than 27 killed since the 1950s took place on April 16, 2007, when student Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in Blackburg, Va., before shooting himself.Susman reported from Connecticut, Serrano from Washington and Muskal from Los Angeles. Times staff writers Sam Quinones, Robin Abcarian, Alana Semuels, Ashley Powers, Andrew Khouri, Marisa Gerber and Matt Pearce contributed to this report.michael.muskal@latimes.comCopyright  2012, Los Angeles Timesprevious12|  single pageComments96Comments (96)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQfoodguy2 at 9:35 PM December 14, 2012                My condolences to all the families effected by this horrific tragedy.Unfortunately such acts will continue within our nation because are laws are weak and do not address suicidal and homicidal individuals. It should be noted that Connecticut already has strict gun control laws.In California where I reside Welfare and Institute code 5150 allows the government (police) to detain persons of mental illnesses who are an immediate danger to themselves and others (the Community) for ONLY 72 hours for a psychological evaluation and treatment at a hospital. Unfortunately we have many individuals that pose a danger to themselves and others for a longer period of time than 72 hours.Until Californias 5150 w.i.c. law, and such similar laws in other states, are corrected with longer detention periods for medical treatment, of individuals that pose an immediate threats to themselves and others where these individuals can receive the treatment they need these tragedies will continue.Gun control laws alone will not deal with suicidal and homicidal individuals. When these welfare and institution laws are corrected then along with reasonable and fair gun control laws that limit the sale of guns to mentally ill individuals along with extensive background checks will work.Stevie Noho at 8:41 PM December 14, 2012                DO Something to..Protect your Children! Melt all the guns and build cars in Detroit and sell them to help the economy.... OR Use the Military, NRA activists, Veterans, ex Cops, parent groups to arm themselves and patrol the schoolyards, malls, and public areas so that if someone wants to go out in a blaze of Glory in a suicide... they can do it on the OUTSIDE of the building.. But DO something to protect your children DodgerBlue63 at 8:28 PM December 14, 2012                I'm not going to suggest we should repeal the 2nd amendment, I believe responsible adults should have the right to bear arms, but let's be honest: semi-automatic weapons serve no redeeming purpose in our society. Noreasonable person canstate a valid case otherwise. If not ban them outright, then make it much, much more difficult to obtain them. The fact that this sick a-hole was able to get his hands on weapons like that so easily isa problem that needs to be addressed.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
