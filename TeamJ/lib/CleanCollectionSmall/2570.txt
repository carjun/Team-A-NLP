Please don't take this chance to politicize this and start wailing on gun control. This isn't the time. This is huge. 26 dead and more than 10 children in that casualty list.

When I was playing through the theif guild quests, I sucked hard. I decided at one point "screw it, I'm just going to leave the guild by maiming every motherlover I come across in this mission." I did so and went back to the handler only to get an angry lecture before he sent me on my merry way again.What?Even in Oblivion I had to do a quest or something to rejoin the guild. It learned me good when I first did so in Oblivion, but in Skyrim it was no challenge. No extra gold? Meh. No extra gear? Meh. But being able to hack apart everything in my path? More satisfying. Yet, there was nothing that gave me the feeling that I should play to my part as a thief. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy terrible PC games collection  by  Hapistoricin  gaming[+]rindindin 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]rindindin 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoHave you played any of them?

They're isolationists to the core and believe that everyone is literally out to get them - even the Chinese. The only thing that'll put them down is nothing short of everyone at the top dying, or an invasion from all sides. These folks either live in extreme poverty, or extreme luxury. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMen planned to Castrate and Assassinate Justin Bieber  by  hestonkentin  worldnews[+]rindindin 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]rindindin 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoWhy is this at the top of World News?

Imagine having to craft the entire landscape through and through. That'll take forever or we get a half mediocre game that we won't like. I think focusing on one location is the best way to go.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCensorship: As of past two hours, Google images safesearch is MANDATORY for US IP's (XPost to /R/WTF)  by  MileyRay-XOin  technology[+]rindindin 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]rindindin 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoWhat the fuck is the point of this? People can choose to use the filter option if they wanted to. It's not protecting kids, they'll get at pornographic material no matter what. This is censorship at its finest right there. There's absolutely no reason for it, and now it's happening.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAmsterdam police will turn a blind eye to foreigners buying cannabis in its famous "coffee shops" when a national ban comes into force next year, the city's mayor said on Wednesday.  by  Libertateain  worldnews[+]rindindin 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI know a few chaps who went to Amsterdam just to get a taste of these coffee shops themselves. I can imagine what a boon it is for tourism. It'd be stupid to enforce this.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis is how I play Pokemon on the go  by  Casval4in  gaming[+]rindindin 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI've been playing an emulator on my phone, and the battery is not appreciating it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsJulian Assange confirms bid for Australian Senate  by  whidzeein  worldnews[+]rindindin 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI've said it once, and I'll say it again: this man's just bloating his ego. Every time he does something, every time the cameras flicker around him, he just builds up his ego more and more, and yet, he's done absolutely NOTHING relevant since the whole wikileaks thing. Nothing. He's been running around and getting smacked by the authorities. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNorth Korea launches rocket  by  ch4mp1onin  worldnews[+]rindindin 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoImagine doing all of this while under the threat of probable imprisonment if they failed again. Do you know how much stress one has to be under to do this? Brilliant stuff for being able to do that under that much pressure. Not saying it was the brightest move on the regimes part, but wow.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShared Sacrifice: Hostess Used Employee Pensions to Fund Itself, While paying millions to its executives  by  1000000studentsin  politics[+]rindindin 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoI honestly don't know why they didn't take that stake in the company as a deal. It was a great deal: workers working for their own company, and getting a seat on the board? Count me motherfucking in. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSimCity: Casino City Gameplay Strategy using Multi-City Play  by  Flamovin  Games[+]rindindin 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 4 points5 points6 points 3 days agoThat's cool and all, but is the online necessary? It's just a DRM packaged to look better. I really wouldn't want this game if I was forced to sit there and have this online always thing, and the leaderboard isn't appealing either. I play Simcity to build the city as I like, not to stack a bunch of crap onto a building just so I can beat some random person on the internet. That's really unappealing. permalinksavecontextfull commentsUN seriously considering government control over the internet, and the meeting is in two days. This means that we have two days to collect as many signatures as possible opposing this. (link to petition)  by  Nissapoleonin  worldnews[+]rindindin 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoThe only thing I can really think any sort of UN noise can really make would be that law makers can maybe point to it in the future, giving themselves a little more fire power. Aside from that, I don't really see anything the UN does along with ITU can be actually relevant. Protip: the UN doesn't have jackshit on sovereign nations and how they handle their own internet issues. I'm sure every government would love to adopt a China-esque control over their internet ensuring that their citizens are nice little people online, but honestly? I don't think any UN mandate can bring that into effect.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat Great Helium Shortage? - Forbes  by  maineiac42in  worldnews[+]rindindin 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoThats a near 300 year supply at current usage rates.Right, as if there would never be a potential increase in Helium Usage along with the possibility that some of it may never be accessible. Not to mention that this guy is a supporter of fracking which takes up a lot of resources in itself as a method of extraction. But I mean he does have a point right? I mean, 300 years of usage! Who cares about that! I'll be dead in 300 years!

Damn you THQ, why do I have to love supporting you so much.Seriously, if Saints Row 3 didn't do the deal for you...BUY IT NOW. It's totally worth 6$ to sink in even if it's just a small number.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSega Suing Level-5 For $11 Million, Says Inazuma Eleven Infringes Two Patents  by  name_was_takenin  Games[+]rindindin 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]rindindin 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoSega hasn't been in the good with the community or financially either.
