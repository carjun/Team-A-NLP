NBC's Anne Thompson reports.By Tracy Connor, NBC News Updated at 7:19 p.m. ET:The 20 children and six adults killed in the Newtown school massacre were all shot multiple times, many with a rifle, Connecticuts chief medical examiner said Saturday.The children  12 girls and eight boys  were all 6 or 7 years old, Dr. H. Wayne Carver said at an afternoon news briefing.This is a very devastating set of injuries, Carver said. I believe everyone was hit more than once.He said all the victims at Sandy Hook Elementary died of gunshot wounds and all the deaths have been classified as homicides.Follow @NBCNewsUSAdvertise | AdChoices Carver said he personally performed seven autopsies and those children had between three and 11 wounds each. Two were shot at close range, the others at a distance.Asked whether they suffered, he grimly replied, Not for very long.He said he will perform an autopsy Sunday on the suspected gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, who is believed to have killed himself. He will also do an autopsy on Lanzas mother, Nancy Lanza, 52, who was found dead in her Newtown home.President Barack Obamawill travel to Newtown on Sunday to meet with the victims' families and thank first responders, the White House announced Saturday night.The president will also speak at an interfaith vigil for families of the victims as well as families from Sandy Hook Elementary School.The motive for the mass killing, the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, was unknown.Weve been doing everything we need to do to peel back the onion, layer by layer, and get more information, Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance said earlier."Our investigators at the crime scene ... did produce some very good evidence in this investigation that our investigators will be able to use in, hopefully, painting the complete picture as to how - and more importantly why - this occurred.Connecticut Chief Medical Examiner H. Wayne Carver provides an update to the media after he and his team examined the victims' bodies at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown following Friday's shootings.Four doctors and 10 technicians, plus a college student working her first day with the medical examiners office, toiled into Friday night to identify the victims.They took photos of their faces and then showed the pictures to families of the 12 girls and eight boys, all first graders. Its easier on the families when you do this, Carver said.He said that he managed to maintain professional composure during the work, but it was a challenge.Ive been at this for a third of a century and my sensibility may not be the average mans, but this is probably the worst Ive seen, Carver said.At the end of the briefing, authorities handed out a list of the victims, who included the school principal and school psychologist.Newtowns first selectman, Patricia Llodra, pleaded for privacy for the grieving families, each assigned their own trooper.We are a strong and caring place. We will find a way to heal so that all of our residents young and old find peace, Llodra said. Please know that we have suffered a terrible loss and we need your respect on this terrible journey.Although the bodies were removed from the suburban hilltop school, authorities said it would take at least two more days for investigators to finish combing over the crime scene.Police have determined that the gunman was not buzzed into Sandy Hook, where he was once a student.He forced his way into the school, Vance said. He did not provide specifics and said that broken windows at the school may have been shattered by police who responded to the emergency.Slideshow: Connecticut school massacreEmmanuel Dunand / AFP - Getty ImagesThe second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history sent crying children spilling into the school parking lot as frightened parents waited for word on their loved ones.Launch slideshowIn the confusing aftermath of the shooting, law-enforcement sources gave out conflicting information about what transpired.Several media organizations, relying on information provided by law-enforcement sources, initially reported that the shooter had been identified as Lanzas older brother. Officials later corrected that mistake.Advertise | AdChoices There was also conflicting information about what type of weapons Lanza had.At one point, law enforcement officials told NBC News that Lanza had four handguns while he stalked the halls of Sandy Hook, but that could not be confirmed. It appears he carried at least two 9mm handguns, in addition to the rifle, which was the primary weapon.Officials also told NBC News that Lanza unsuccessfully tried to buy a rifle at a Dicks Sporting Goods store in Danbury three days before the slaughter, but later said they could not confirm the report, which was based on tips from members of the public.Investigators and former classmates of Connecticut school shooter Adam Lanza say he was bright, but extremely shy and remote. NBC's Pete Williams reports.Police provided little information about the shooters state of mind. Lanzas brother told police the gunman had a history of mental problems, though a classmate from Newtown High School recalled him as a generally happy person.We would hang out, and he was a good kid,Joshua Milas, who had not seen Lanza in a few years, told The Associated Press. He was probably one of the smartest kids I know. He was probably a genius.Newtown Police Lt. George Sinkosaid the entire town of 27,000  a New England bedroom community some 60 miles from New York City and known for its good schools  was reeling.We never thought this would happen here, Sinko said. Our hearts are broken for the families of these victims.Of the many questions surrounding the tragedy,none was more poignant than those posed by the parentsof the dead children, who shared their worst fears about their childrens final moments with clergy consoling them.They were wondering whether the children knew what was happening to them, whether they were afraid, saidMonsignor Robert Weiss of St. Rose of Lima Church, whomet with the families.The Newtown school superintendent, Janet Robinson, said the body count would have been even higherif not for staff who rushed to protect their young charges.A lot of children are alive today because of actions the teachers took, she said.Below is the list of the victims' names released by the chief medical examiner's office.Children:Charlotte Bacon, 6Daniel Barden, 7Olivia Engel, 6Josephine Gay, 7Ana M.

I grew up on a cattle ranch and I had a close personal relationship with guns. But I grew up and moved to the city and I have never felt the need to carry a weapon. In fact the only time I felt that tingle of fear you people seem to live everyday with was a brief episode in Phoenix when I did out of peer pressure carry a 357 around. I felt safer the moment I got rid of that menace. That was 25 years ago and I have never felt that gun nutty fear ever since.39 votes#1.8 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:46 PM ESTBill-Austin Comment collapsed by the communitySome of you will argue you need an assault weapon and it's your 2nd amendment right. That is what the NRA does? Right? Justify slaughter in the name of the 2nd amendment? Nice job if you can stomach it.Well, then, you are either: (a) insane. (b) ensuring that you can pursue seditious acts, or (c) a terrorist. 'Cause assault weapons and multi-magazines have no other justifiable purpose. Hunter? Sure . . . insane hunters.If you cling to the idea that the 2nd amendment written in the 18th century by farmers could foresee the weapons of today, then you are also a moron. Following SCJ Alito bizarre logic, it seems arguments that follow  "reduction to the absurd" are also warranted here. In order to maintain a citizen militia relevant to the 21st century, you should also be entitled to own mortars, bazookas, and perhaps a tactical nuclear weapon. After all, a militia with only rifles doesn't meet the intention of those 18th century writers. It's I-N-S-A-N-E. But purse your assault weapon arguments until your children are all dead. Like the air and water you will pollute until they are unusable, all without thinking, this is only to be expected.Conservative logic -- an oxymoron.40 votes#1.9 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:50 PM ESTEldridgeafDeletedspike-322306Judging from the number of anti-NRA posts, I deduce that Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, etal....considering the number of homicides therein, must have a lot of gun crazy NRA members.8 votes#1.11 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:54 PM ESTJS in SDOnly a complete ass would go on some anti-NRA rant in response to this tragedy.  I am sure that every responsible gun owner out there is just as horrified by this as everyone else.  Sick people will always find some way to take out their anger an if it were not with a gun it would be by other means.  This 20 year old that did this was obviously an extremely disturbed individual.  Had it not been a gun it would have been explosives or gas or running them down with a car or something else.  To blame this tragedy on guns or the NRA is absurd.  I just can not understand what would drive anyone to do this to a group of innocent little children.  I am just relieved that he killed himself and saved all of the families and friends of those he murdered the pain of having to relive this over and over through a trial and the endless appeals that usually follow.My condolences to all of the families and friends who lost loved ones in this tragedy.  My heart also goes out to the people in the medical examiners office who had to do the autopsies on all of the victims.  I am sure that even though they are used to dealing with death they are going to need help to deal with this tragedy.  No one involved in this tragedy or the aftermath could help but be profoundly effected by it.  I give the medical examiner a lot of credit for being able to maintain his professional composure while dealing with all of the families.  I am sure that he will let it out later when he is out of the spotlight and hopefully has someone to help him deal with this the same way he is trying to help the families.21 votes#1.12 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:55 PM ESTbnbreillyListen, I've seen people blame the mother because they were her guns legal and registered. Now I see people blaming the NRA, bullets etc.... Do any of you REALLY think that this wouldn't have happened if they ban gun and ammunition sales???? You're all delusional if you believe that, you'll only create a LARGER criminal element in gun trafficing... Anyone remember learning about prohibition??? Telling people they 'can't' own or do something is rediculous and down right communistic/socialist.... THIS country wasn't founded on those principals.I as well as everyone else is shocked by this tragedy, but knee jerk reactions are not whats needed... How about we stop all the political correctness and get people with mental illness the help (or incarceration) that they need???? Maybe if this kid recieved help from adults apparently too politically correct to hurt his feelings he wouldn't have been out on the streets to kill his mother and these kids....16 votes#1.13 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:55 PM ESTecorbitt2121Dave, the fact of the matter is that in order to operate a motor vehicle there are a lot tougher rules in place - even in regards to the selling of it. Titles are needed, there are records kept. I am all for the legal right to own guns in regards to what the second amendment of the Constitution allows, but that calls for "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Our guns are not being well regulated. It is too easy for any one with ill wishes against others to obtain them. Gun shows are a major loophole as is individual selling. No, I am not blaming the NRA itself. I am blaming the fact that guns are easily accessible. And before you start the argument that guns don't kill, people kill, the 22 children that were stabbed in China yesterday are all still living. There is something to be said for that.That being said, there are many other issues regarding the circumstances of yesterdays horrific massacre. Mental health care is overlooked in this country and is still taboo in many places. The mental health care professionals are over worked and under paid. Most are solidly booked and have trouble intaking new clients and seeing clientele regularly. I know that many in the area I live in are seeing clients that should be going for treatment once a week only once every two weeks because they can't fit them in any other time. The VA is having an even harder time seeing people; veterans with mental illnesses are being told they can be seen once every SIX MONTHS. This is not safe. On top of this all, it is cheaper to buy a gun than it is to see a therapist for a month. Something has to change on both fronts or the number of gun related deaths are going to increase. The laws are not being enforced and are not strict enough and the people who need treatment are not being seen. Please inform your congressmen that this country needs change and soon.25 votes#1.14 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:55 PM ESTpiglizard420Haas, you are really the epitome of non thinking violent prone idiots. You are so sure of your position that you would ask someone with whom you disagree to "kack" themselves? You and you attitude are the problem. Once again, comparing cars and guns is like comparing apples and oranges. cars, not produced to kill, are continuslly improved to reduce death and destruction. Guns, produced to kill, are improved to cause more death and destruction. Believing that more guns makes the world safer is like the old cold war attitude that more nuclear weapons makes the world safe. Ludicrous.14 votes#1.15 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:56 PM ESTMichael-3842950Well said, Tyrants. I too, grew up on a farm, and was very familiar and comfortable with the guns we had, a 30-30 deer rifle, a shotgun, and a .22. Nobody owned these high capacity military weapons back then. I made a career of the Army, and became an expert with an array of military weapons. I know how devastating they can be. Since retiring from the Army, I have never felt the need to carry a gun, and have never been in a situation where I would need one. I wonder about these folks who feel the need to carry a gun everywhere, and seem to see threats around every corner. Where does that come from? There is no reason for a civilian to own a weapon like an AR 15. I can disassemble and reassemble an M-16, the military version of the AR 15, in under 60 seconds. I shot perfect scores every time I went to the range. I know the devastating power of this weapon. It is crazy for a civilian to have a weapon like this.33 votes#1.16 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:58 PM ESTRandom pennsylvanianThis is not the NRA's fault.

You can actually buy one online here.Please tell me why anyone would need one of these.  Twenty-eight victims, shot between 3 - 11 times each, means a minimum of 6 30-round clips, which is what he was using.  Why does a person need an assault weapon with 30-round clips?  Only to do something like this.Shame on the elected officials who let the assault rifle ban lapse.  That ban, written by Biden and signed by Clinton (but allowed to lapse under Bush) would have made yesterday's events virtually impossible.It's time for some common sense - and the only thing standing between us and that is the NRA, an organization that I myself belonged to for many years (along with my father and siblings) until it became a political lobby.  It's all about the dollars and power.Enough.35 votes#1.18 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 5:02 PM ESTCharles McManusHow many American Children must die for the love of guns? What needs to change in America is the irrational attachment to the pubescent, John Wayne individualism that underlies the American Gun Culture. You have not been a frontier country for over a hundred years for god's sake. It is time to leave your adolescence identity behind, stop thinking in black and white terms, and start thinking in a rational, common-sense, mature and adult way when it comes to guns.  Making changes to who can own guns and what guns need to be not available may not rationally prevent atrocities but it will have the effect of starting to change the American mindset. AT THE VERY LEAST THERE SHOULD BE A BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES. Several of these poor wee children were riddled with bullets from an assault rifle.

The blood is most certainly on the hands of the NRA and its supporters.  They killed those children as surely as if they pulled the trigger themselves.  There's a legal principle, "but for action X, thing y would not have occurred."  But for the actions of the NRA and its co-conspirators, not only those twenty six and seven year old children, but many many others would be alive today.  The desperate sound of the fallacious, insulting, and infantile argument I quote above is the sound of a person who participated in the murder of twenty six and seven year old children and is incapable of taking responsibility for it.  The people who fought a ban on assault weapons are all child murderers.  The ones who are still fighting desperately to preserve their ability to kill more children are the most pathetic of the bunch.Yeah, go say something childish about smoking a joint.

The NRA is the organization that comes up with the tag lines gun fanatics spew out after these incidents - ie- guns don't kill, the attacker would of found another way (but didn't), pry it from my cold dead fingers, the government is coming to take your guns.The NRA showed ZERO class or sympathy for the families of Columbine revealing their true colors which surely hasn't changed.  It's the politics of the NRA that make it so easy for these acts to occur.  The difference between the NRA and  Budweiser is Budweiser doesn't campaign against safer driving laws and stricter alcohol intoxication levels.  As a society, the overwhelming amount of people need a method of transportation but don't need a firearm.  Budweiser also wasn't responsible for the dependency on the private automobile but the politics of the NRA are responsible for the easy acquisition of firearms to people who do damage such as what happened yesterday.  I agree the weapons should of been stored in a safe but most aren't and too many gun owners are reckless with their firearms.  I am a gun owner but also a human being and a parent who doesn't want one of my kids shot at school or while out shopping. 12 votes#1.28 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 5:47 PM ESThbebeOh yeah, great idea Jose V.  With your GPS proposal, the criminals among us would know exactly which houses to burglarize to get an instant arsenal.

You obviously 'know' only what you are told.My guess is (I haven't heard how she was killed), but after killing her he found the key to the safe. (Hypothetically speaking of course, she may not have had them locked up. Where I live, they only need to be secure if there is a reasonable chance for a minor to get access to them)One of the several guns I own is strictly for stress relief. It is a High capacity "assault style" rifle, and I find few things more relieving than just going out and ripping off a couple of 30 round clips. But that's just me. Maybe Ms. Lanza  used her guns to relieve stress, I can imagine herding a bunch of kids around day after day can be a bit stressful.Maybe you should try it some time, it might get that bug out of your a$$. But that is you. I don't know what you do for fun and relaxation, but let's ban that and see how you feel. Oh. but my hobbies don't kill people. Mine don't either. Never shot anyone in my life.

I can only imagine how they suffered and how scared and innocent they were. I have a daughter the same age and i couldn't imagine. Honestly the only person to blame here is the killer. In fact, the gun was purchased LEGALLY it just was too available for someone to use it on the innocents. For those asking for more strict gun laws, exactly who would you sell the gun to if not by a law abiding citizen such as this woman? It actually discredits your argument by showing you that people WILL and HAVE obtained them illegally by either stealing someone Else's or taking their parents etc. People who want a gun will and have gotten them. It would just make the sale of weapons underground like any other object that is banned (marijuana) for example. Stricter gun controls aren't the answer. Making sure people are psychologically healthy is all of our responsibilities. If they aren't they will find a way to do their bidding. Granted guns make it easier but like i said, it was purchased by someone allowed to have a gun. We are given this freedom to overthrow a tyrannical govt and form a militia if need be folks. Not for the crazy hunters or gun enthusiasts we all think are gross. I don't want the govt in my business on social issues . I am a considered a liberal person, but i believe whole-heatedly that people will get guns no matter what. The mexican cartel has even gotten in on that market already imagine if all guns were banned. we already are making those bastards rich enough off weed and coke! This young monster of a man was seriously mentally ill... why were the signs ignored and there is signs?! why didn't his mother who was a childrens advocate realize how her son was? There are always signs, just sadly ignored. Furthermore, why did she allow a weapon to be accessible knowing that her son may be unstable.

That is a devastating round in such a small body. There is very little real world difference between semi and auto rate of fire because of the need to stop firing and re aim because of recoil, unless one is experienced enough to know how to hold it down.  I always fired short bursts. The rounds used in assault rifles really are not good for hunting.

Incredible.   Blame society.  Blame those that are mentally ill and fail to go for help, or to continue the help they may be getting.  Blame those that refuse / fail , or to take / continue the needed medication for the mental illness.  Blame the government who pisses away billions of dollars helping other countries, and fails to help at home.When Ronald Regan was Governor of California (A Democrat at the time) he began closing down the mental hospitals.  These people we thrown out into the streets.  No family and no place to go.  When he became President, he cut aid for federally-funded programs in mental health.  With  the increase in crime and brutal murders  committed by a mental health patient, state legislature passed a law that would keep Regan from closing anymore mental health hospitals.  But Regan would not be stopped.  Congress proposed new legislature that was drafted by Ted Kennedy, (PL 96-398) called the community mental health systems act . But the program was stopped by the new-elected, Ronald Regan.  That ended all the federally funded mental health centers / programs.So, put the blame were it belongs, at the feet of the government, not the NRA, and not guns.Why does it take a minute to say hello and forever to say goodbye?

There have been several clashes between the National Guard and civilians, especially during labor disputes, but other protests as well, witness Kent State and Mississippi. It is definitely not unheard of for the Government to use military forces to impose its will upon the populace. Thus far, it has been, relatively supported by the majority, but what about the day it isn't?Do a little research on labor disputes and National Guard, or Wikipedia "Union Violence" as a starting point.And do you know when the end of civilization will be? When the solar flare will strike? Youtube "Doomsday Preppers"I am not that paranoid. My guns are for putting deer meat in the freezer, and stress relief.

When these guys are all done shooting their "leads", I can make my own powder, ball and patch. (I can even make my own guns (if I can generate electricity)***Another NoteI CAN STILL MAKE MY OWN GUNS, all it takes is a mill, a lathe and a broach or 2. I have a mill, a buddy has a lathe. If you ban and confiscate guns, somebody is still going to make guns and sell them to "whoever", just like they do Meth. The difference is, only the Gangsters/Criminals will control the guns.And if I knew somebody, wink wink nudge nudge, with a CNC machine I could mill out a full auto firearm, with ammo being the only restraint. But if you leave hunting rifles, no problem, or better yet I'll call my buddy in the Marines, he can supply me a couple cases.

That means it isn't guns that are the factor making England murder more. So why is Canada so low, while England is nearly double that? Why is the USA more than 10 times higher than England?All of this is adjusted for population and total guns in society...so what is the factor making us so much more prone to murder (even if it is a tiny threat overall to life) here in the USA?THE DRUG WAR.In England they have a drug war, but they do not focus on possession. Meanwhile we lock up nonviolent criminals at the almost the exact same rate as violent ones in America. Canada has legal marijuana in some areas, and has for years, and takes a very relaxed attitude toward drug use in general (although they have laws which are largely unenforced).Just like during the Prohibition of alcohol, murder rates have soared under the Drug War. So has our incarcerations and incarceration rates...we now lock up more people in total than any other country in the world (yes, even the vastly more populated China and India)! That's total and per capita! "Land of the Free"? Think again. "Land of the prisoner" is more accurate. We arrested more than 800,000 people last year for just marijuana! 86% of those arrests were for small amounts; simple possession charges. It's not only tyrannical, it's a waste of resources which fuels a black market run by criminal sociopaths, and takes resources away from fighting actual violent crime like theft, property damage, assault, rape, child abuse, and murder.This War on Drugs (and personal adult freedom) has given us the street gang phenomenon on the scales we see today. Chicago alone has dozens of separate drug gangs. They also have a high murder rate to go along with super-strict gun control in comparison to other cities...because guns aren't the problem, the Drug War is. Many of their gangs can trace their roots to either the beginning of Prohibition, or the beginning of the modern Drug War.In Honduras where gun murders are most common and horribly frequent, they have gun rights...but they also have a country which is a main thoroughfaire for the illegal drug trade. By comparison, Uruguay has almost the same gun ownership rates as the USA and the same gun rights as well, yet they have a lower gun murder rate because they have no war on drugs. In fact, their govt is seriously considering selling marijuana to its citizens to get the drug trade completely above-board!If you want our rate of murder to decrease via guns you don't take away guns, you end the Drug War. If you have any doubts about this go look at the murder rates after alcohol Prohibition began, and then after it ended. Also look at countries that have already ended their Drug Wars.Crime rates in Prohibition rose immediately 78%, 24% in just one year from 1920-1921 (the first year)http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/0049...e_Rate.htmThe murder rate was cut in nearly half (40% decline), from 10 per 100,000 to 6 per 100,000 when Prohibition ended. This was directly caused by the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-...as-failureIf we want to half our gun murders, legalize drugs. If you want to further bring it down address the next major cause; domestic violence. Spanking children leads to many issues surrounding violence, but especially domestic violence. If domestic violence is how you raise children, then expect them to use it themselves as adults. A small number of those people will kill a domestic relative or partner. The gun simply facilitates it.The final point I'll make is that if only .026% of gun owners murder someone with a gun, then 99.974% of gun owners don't kill someone with a gun. It's hard to argue we need to punish the 99.974% for what the .026% do. That kind of illogic is used in schools to punish classrooms full of kids for what one anonymous child has done...and it leads to bullying, because children then ostracize their peers who are guilty (and they don't know how to ostracize responsibly, so it ends up in bullying). We should use a more logical approach on adults. In a nation of 315 million people, with a Drug War raging and domestic violence against kids being the norm, a 99.974% responsible gun owner rate is unbelievably good. Perspective, instead of irrational fear and knee-jerk reaction, is what helps here.It is impossible to eliminate all of these tragedies, but if it is the total gun murder rate you want to address, the problem isn't guns...it's the Prohibition of drugs. These mass shootings are vast minority of the problem (we average only about 20 per year, which is not a huge chunk of the 13,000 gun murders we had this past year 2012). I'm not belittling the dead or the suffering families' pain...but 13,000 deaths in a population of 315 million is a tiny number. The flu kills 33,000 Americans annually, for perspective.#2.26 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 7:59 PM ESTkpm58Adam Lanza, LWNJ, they are what needs to be restricted and regulated.#2.27 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 8:02 PM ESTthe TiGorAlthough larger issues that need to be addressed include mental illness and violence in society,Just about the time enough of the story comes together that one can infer some things that would make some kind of sick, perverted sense, the story changes again and the new details released put us right back to square one where none of it seems to make any sense anymore!These recent incidents over the past days, where the perpetrator seems to have little to no connection with the people he has wounded and killed nor the place he chose to do it does make me wonder if perhaps the underlying cause is some sort of Satanism or demon worship tied to the rubbish about the world ending on December 21st. If someone has an idea where they want to be in the hereafter and it isn't exactly a Utopian place, they may be motivated to 'buy' their way into hell by performing the most horrific and evil act they can contrive before killing themselves in an attempt to ensure they get to where they think they're going before the world has a chance to end on them, first. That seems to be the only thing that would make any real sense in some of these mass killings of late.PROPOSAL: GPS - buried deep enough within the manufacture of guns as to risk destruction of the 'toy' if the owner tried to pried it out - and web publication and alert to all neighborhoods where the nut owner lives to forewarn citizens on crazies in their mist. ALSO, to trigger alarms when said 'toys' are within given set miles of schools.Trust me when I tell you it just don't work that way!Now, I've dabbled with developing a way that much of what you suggest becomes a reality, in the form of security features that were part of what *should* be the ultimate home security firearm. I won't describe it in much detail, but the idea was that it was a home defense tool meant for the average (read that: novice) citizen who desired to keep a gun for such use but just did not have the desire to do everything that one really should do to keep a traditional firearm for that purpose, which involves a lot of education, skill development, and diligence. This weapon would be part of a local system that would be purchased by a municipality and the weapons would be leased to customers for a fixed period of time at a monthly or annual rate. The gun was a very large, heavy device (as far as guns go), and was to be closed in a transit chest at all times excepting an actual emergency. Opening the chest would trigger an alarm to notify law enforcement that a lesee had a situation where they were retrieving the weapon. Out of the chest, the gun was a sealed unit, mostly disposable in nature with a unit cost of less than $100. It would be mostly plastic with artificial weight incorporated to neutralize almost all recoil, to make it usable as a bludgeon, and to make it undesirable for conversion to any other use. The proprietary ammunition sealed within was to be large slugs of an odd size with an effective range of up to about 50' or so, as this was intended to be used within a house. A very long, heavy pull of the multistage trigger would not only fire one slug, it would first activate a bright light that would illuminate the area that the muzzle was pointed in and then snap a photo from a rudimentary digital camera - sort of a 'gun camera', if you will - of where the gun was pointed at the time of trigger pull. An digital audio recorder built into the gun would activate as soon as the gun was removed from its transit chest. At the end of the year lease, or in the case the gun was used, it would be exchanged for a different one. Unused, it would be inspected and serviced (new batteries, resealed, etc.) A used one would contain the vast majority of the evidence needed to process the scene of a home defense shooting. Part of the system was a 'trainer' version that wasn't sealed but that the lessee could take familiarization training with at a range under the supervision of a trainer. This was a gun for people who otherwise don't use them, or for owners of regular firearms who wouldn't ever want to use them for this purpose and have to surrender them as evidence in case they ever had to shoot a home invader.In any normal firearm as we know them, there just isn't any way electronic gadgetry would survive long. Heat, cold, severe mechanical shock, strong solvents, and other things make for a very harsh environment for electronics. Guns also tend to be around for a very long time - most of mine are approaching or long passed the century mark! Battery powered electronics, sitting in wait, largely unused, are good for how long? Believe me, the gun would typically be completely viable and perfectly usable long, long after the electronics have failed. The steel and aluminum in most firearms also does a pretty fair job of blocking radio signals, including GPS, providing there could even be enough room in a typical gun to tuck them away. I can think of no practical way in which any electronic gadgets could be placed in a firearm where they could not be removed or circumvented. A great many things have been 'tamperproofed' through the years, and there is almost always a way for people in the know to work around it.Sorry! A guy can always dream, though.  Hydraulic shock can kill. If a bullet hits a bone it may shatter, becoming an instant shotgun round.Secondary projectiles tend to be an issue with any bullet striking the human body at a velocity faster than about 1600 fps. That is just above top handgun velocities and at the very bottom end of centerfire rifle speeds, though a couple of the really hot .22 rimfire loads will get that fast.As far as hydraulic shock goes, the human body is a closed vessel containing fluids (both liquid and gas). Anything striking it at a high rate of speed, especially penetrating it, is definitely going to have a major impact on the fluids held within. Or it may ricochet off in another direction. There was one instance I know of where someone was hit in the shoulder and the bullet turned 90 degrees and exited out the hip.Believe it or not, one of the worst offenders for this is actually the little .22 rimfire cartridge. The small, slow bullet will very often hit a bone, deflect, and then scoot along before lodging or exiting somewhere else. Naturally, it can cause a lot of damage along the way. This, and the fact that a lot of people have always considered the .22 to be somewhat of a 'plaything' and not a real firearm, have caused a whole lot of problems for a whole lot of people through the decades.What a mess. This needs to end.Amen to that.1 vote#2.28 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 8:08 PM ESTDerrek243.Deletedfenderbluesjrdeerslayer, That's right. The murderers on death row have rights,we cannot execute them.

I fill out more paper work and have to have my licence renewed every year for owning two dogs and a cat. Owning a weapon takes less time, less paper work and once you have it no one cares. Gun owners are not responsible, God fearing people.. so put that to rest. Nothing will bring these lives back, but laws can be passed today to help make it harder for people that want a weapon. It's the right of people to own weapons, guns, but hold people that make them, sell them and buy them accountable for their weapons 24/7. All the gun wackos giving ballistics's, man you guy's are are on the wrong page. If congress wrote a Bill today, requiring all gun owners to pay a yearly fee, plus be held accountable even if the weapon is stolen, people might keep them locked away, or better yet not want one. My heart goes out to the family's, and my tears won't stop for the children, and I will write to who ever it takes to get stricter gun control..

More people die in car accidents in the US than are killed byguns.  However, I do not see the same emphasisbeing placed on going back to using horses. Or, perhaps we should? No..  I didnt think soNo one seems to understand why this and other senseless tragedies like this keep occurring in our society here in the US, the Greatest country in the world.  Oh, by the way, we should no longer look down our collective noses at third world countries in the same light anymore.  Since we appear to have the same trait of senselessly taking innocent lives, be it children or adults for no apparently real reason...  At least the third world countries has genocide as their excuse..So, what is the disease? My answer to the answer is basically simple; we (Meaning the majority in the US today) have excused God out of government, schools, homes, society and it appears we are preparing to cancel his visa and have him deported back to heaven.The atheists and the ACLU (Have gone too far) would have you believe that we (The human race) can set our own morals and determine what is right and what is wrong.  On the surface this may sound good, if you have a lot of money, love, friends, support system, and what appears to be the Good life? However, what about the other (Majority) people who live from day to day on whatever they can, and do not have a lot of money, love, friends, support system and no hope of being able to change their situation,and then we take away God as well?Lets look at this even closer  Without God and eternal life; who are you to decide what is right and wrong or good and evil for me? Secondly, what difference does it make anyway?  Since, we are just a freak of nature that appeared on an insignificant planet, in insignificant Solar System, inside of an insignificant Galaxy, in an uncaring, unconcerned, hostile universe that is dying.In case you are wondering, this means that there is no hope for anyone  Just hopelessness  Thats correct, your money, power and influence will be meaningless to the Universe..Understandably, the learned doctors and others so called experts will have a mirrored of other reasons for what is occurring; along with the reason why those evil guns that load themselves with bullets and then go on a killing rampage!!  Seriously???But take this into consideration as another option; if we stop the deportation proceedings against God, and we have the internal fortitude to return to him and seek his face, God will heal and save the GreatestCountry in the World 2Chronicles 7:14if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal theirland.Otherwise  The Disease...1 vote#2.38 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 1:45 AM ESTGofishus-3028005 People who say 'Don't take our guns away from citizens, cause criminals will be able to find guns anyways' just need to take a look at Canada and the UK, where guns are banned.

Unfortunatetly, I am familiar with a few devote christians who are also staunch supporters of the second ammendment. I would love to find a way to present your point to them. I suspect their response would revolve around self defense, hunting, and/or over-throwing a tranyical government, all of which are addressed (to a greater or lesser degree) in the Bible.But here's the thing I can't reconcile ... Where in the Bible does it address HOW? Does ANYONE really think the Bible was written with an eye towards the kinds of problems we're dealing with today? Do the Ten Commandments say "Thou Shalt not Kill." (period) or do they make provisions for the kinds of violent mass murder/suicides we've been seeing more and more?As an MSNBC talk-show host said ... 20 kids were STABBED in China on the same day 20 kids were shot in Connecticut. 20 kids died of MULTIPLE GUNSHOT SOUNDS in Connecticut ... NONE of the kids in China died. None of them!!!Say what you will ... crazy people will do crazy things ... If he hadn't done it with a gun, he'd have found som other way, if ... if ... if.

I think this should be approached from a different set of circumstances - it is the individual who commits the crime and from what I've seen - it's always a mentally ill individual who (in spite of gun registration, ownership rules, etc) finds some way to get hold of a gun and take out his sickness on innocent victims.  Funny thing is that no matter how sick these individuals are - many lawmakers say afterwards that these killiing sprees are meticulously planned - so they can't be that out of their mind that they can't think straight enough to plan in advance.  Why then don't we take into account that many of the mentally ill are not sane enough to take their medications to keep these demons at bay and to prevent occurences like this one - have a hotline whereby familes can alert authorities and have these individuals committed rather than live with the guilt afterwards that they should have done something sooner.  I think there are more sick people than we want to believe and this kind of thing will continue to happen (regardless of the weaponry) until we address this glaring fact.

Just because it has a cyclic rate of 600 rounds per minute does not mean it will fire that many. You have to stop and eject the magazine and put a fresh one in. That gives a school safety officer or teacher time to put a round or two in the little bastards head. If somone in the office had a weapon as he forced his way in they could have taken him down. You put a cop, safety officer, or other trained person in the office. They see someone coming with a vest and assault rifle come to the door they have someone call 911 as they are taking shots at the scumbag's head.And you do know that I could take my bolt action remington 788, buy extra mags, and put out a min of 21 rounds in under a minute. Or a .357 double action wheel gun and a couple speed loaders and do about the same. I no longer hunt as killing animals for sport is no fun for me. But I like to target shoot. And my shotgun is loaded at all times. A locked up gun with ammo locked away in a separate location is uselss if someone wants to break in and harm me. I might as well just take them on with the Bowie knife concealed on the headboard or the tanto in the arm of the loveseat.

First, the government requires companies selling body armor to go through an FBI check like the ones required for buying a gun.  Currently there is no requirement and anyone buying body armor is considering being in a firefight.  Maybe defensive, but possibly offensive.  Consider making video games such as CoD, DOOM or HALO having an 18 year old requirement to buy.  Thereby, limiting the influence on young kids.  My favorite is to reinstitute the US military draft.  The military will find people with violent tendencies and either put it to good use or drill it out of them.  They are the only entity that has a chance at stopping kids from doing stupid things like this shooter did.  They will find them.  They may use them because those tendencies have a use in a combat environment, but isn't it worth it?  Truth be told peeps like to ban things they don't value.  But they don't want to put forth the effort.1 vote#13.11 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 10:57 PM ESTThe LazaroDoes anyone recall the Oklahoma City Tragedy? Claimed 168 lives. I read the paragraphs about how we need to ban this and ban that.  Most sound like these folks make up the facts as they go along. How about the tragedies that take place all over the World. Suicide bombers that take 150 lives, road side bombers that take the lives and maim our soldiers. Start using common sense folks. These people are mentally ill. They will use whatever means necessary to carry out their heinous acts. We need to look at why someone in a Family with obvious Mental Illness doesn't get the help they need. Why they may not be taking their meds. Why they aren't being kept in protective custody. Look at the funding that has been cut from every program the last 20 years. I've done a lot of research and won't point the fingers at one Party or another, but their is a Political Party notorious for cutting the funding to much needed Social Programs. We all cry about our taxes, but we all cry even harder when a tragedy of this magnitude takes place. #13.12 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 2:50 PM ESTAdvertise | AdChoices Real Army WifeThe streets of heaven a too crowded with little angels today.6 votes#14 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:24 PM ESTDanmjwell if he used a rifle how did it end up in the trunk?5 votes#15 - Sat Dec 15, 2012 4:26 PM ESTInformedVoter5Two rifles; one he took in, the other he left in the car.

On October 1, 1997 at Pearl Highschool, there was another highschool shooting.
