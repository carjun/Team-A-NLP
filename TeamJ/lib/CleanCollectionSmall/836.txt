She has a kid in elementary school. She broke down crying and the kids behind me think it's the funniest thing. People these days don't know what sympathy is. Tl;dr I have lost all hope in humanitypermalinksave[+]zip_000 56 points57 points58 points 1 day ago*(1 child)[]zip_000 56 points57 points58 points 1 day ago*Past shootings didn't effect me that strongly - I was upset by them, but didn't feel too much. I've got a 5 year old now, and this story is just ripping my heart out.permalinksaveparent[+]16miledetour 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]16miledetour 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoI have a 6 week old son and I am crying like a baby. All of my friends went to columbine when it happened and this is so much worse for me. permalinksaveparent[+]wtf_shroom 29 points30 points31 points 1 day ago (3 children)[]wtf_shroom 29 points30 points31 points 1 day agoPunch those kids behind you in their fucking faces.permalinksaveparent[+]briangiles 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]briangiles 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours agoOr at least turn around and ask what the fuck is wrong with them. Then punch them in the face anyway. People laughing at a situation like this are almost as bad as the people committing the act.permalinksaveparent[+]Yousaidthat 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]Yousaidthat 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours agoHonestly this would be most effective. Don't give them a physical way out to avoid the situation. Ask them what the fuck is wrong with them and sit there, staring at them, until they blabber out all of the shit ass excuses they can think of, then realize that they really are fucked up and begin to feel the roots of shame and disgrace take hold. permalinksaveparent[+]quads24 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]quads24 4 points5 points6 points 22 hours agoor just speak up for what is rightpermalinksaveparent[+]fockface 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]fockface 11 points12 points13 points 1 day agoWhere the fuck do you go to school and what grade are you in.  You're telling me that kids are laughing at your teacher for crying because her kid was close to being killed today?  I mean, kids today suck, but I've never met anyone that cold.permalinksaveparent[+]daishiknyte 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]daishiknyte 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoProfessorProbably college.permalinksaveparent[+]MadeByMonkeys 59 points60 points61 points 1 day ago (15 children)[]MadeByMonkeys 59 points60 points61 points 1 day agoKids these days have zero empathy. It's not about sympathy. They literally cannot relate to other people nor internalize the feelings or needs of others. I blame isolation wrought by the internet as well as zero tolerance policies at elementary schools over things like holding hands or hugging.permalinksaveparent[+]Typical_Redditor_459 22 points23 points24 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Typical_Redditor_459 22 points23 points24 points 23 hours agoLiterally every generation has its share of ass holes. Today's kids are no different than they were when you grew up. Plenty of people from my generation (I happen to be 21) and those younger than us have no problem empathizing with others. It has to do with immaturity which is why as someone slightly older now you have no problem recognizing when someone is behaving inappropriately or being a twat. permalinksaveparent[+]Comeh 12 points13 points14 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Comeh 12 points13 points14 points 23 hours agoAs someone who has spent a huge amount of time growing up on the internet and on the computer, I have a rather big heart and a whole lot of empathy/sympathy.Don't give up yet.permalinksaveparent[+]Serinus 8 points9 points10 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Serinus 8 points9 points10 points 22 hours agoI feel like people have been saying that about "Kids these days" for hundreds of years, along with "they have no respect anymore".permalinksaveparent[+]MadeByMonkeys -5 points-4 points-3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]MadeByMonkeys -5 points-4 points-3 points 22 hours agoMaybe but I honestly think the empathy issue is getting worse. Then you have bizarre consequences like kids trying to be OVERLY empathetic to compensate and you end up with /r/SRS permalinksaveparent[+]ThePoose 26 points27 points28 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]ThePoose 26 points27 points28 points 1 day agoTheir parents. You blame their parents. permalinksaveparent[+]jaasx 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]jaasx 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoDon't most of these cases wind up having fairly decent and normal parents?  Society can do the damage even when fantastic parents are available.  But rejection from the opposite sex, lack of friends, bullies, being unpopular, all culminating in social awkwardness and withdrawal can really mess someone up.  Solution?  I don't have one.permalinksaveparent[+]mainsworth 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]mainsworth 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours agoThat's not an over generalization or anything. permalinksaveparent[+]kebo99 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]kebo99 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agopossibly desensitization as well.  these things are happening so frequently now.  not excusing the kids in OP's anecdote, but I can understand it.permalinksaveparent[+]Naajj 2 points3 points4 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Naajj 2 points3 points4 points 19 hours agoKids these daysOh for fucks sake, there have always been kids with zero empathy.permalinksaveparent[+]LemonSmasher 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]LemonSmasher 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoYou really think kids these days have zero empathy? Do you honestly think this? Not only does the internet and cell phones allow for constant communication with people, but you're basically just basing this off an anecdote of somebody you don't even know. Fuck you.permalinksaveparent[+]MadeByMonkeys -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]MadeByMonkeys -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours agoI think more people in the millenial generation have very little empathy than in generations prior. I also think that in certain sub-groups in that generation, having zero or near zero empathy is glorified and encouraged.I'm not basing anything on this anecdote, I'm relating a conclusion from many other sources to this anecdote.But again, your very respectful rebuttal sure reinforces my point.permalinksaveparent[+]LemonSmasher 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]LemonSmasher 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoI'm glad you can see that I'm a respectful, intelligent debater and person.permalinksaveparent[+]jjalsop 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (2 children)[]jjalsop 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoOh, please. Quit your stupid "everything was better when I was younger" bullshit that is rampant across this website. What you're replying to is an example of a small, specific group of young people who are assholes. Assholes existed when you were 20 and they'll exist when you're 80. It's not indicative of the attitudes and tendencies of an entire generation. permalinksaveparent[+]MadeByMonkeys -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]MadeByMonkeys -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours agoI'm fully aware of cognitive bias and I don't think that's the problem in this case.Case in point, look at this "respectful" rebuttal of yours. Very convincing.permalinksaveparent[+]jjalsop -2 points-1 points0 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]jjalsop -2 points-1 points0 points 15 hours agoRight, because arguing on the Internet is certainly indicative of a lack of empathy. permalinksaveparent[+]wrcftw 7 points8 points9 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]wrcftw 7 points8 points9 points 23 hours agoUgh, do us all a favor and turn around and punch them in the facepermalinksaveparent[+]jdgrafton 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]jdgrafton 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoBut at least ask what the fuck is wrong with them first, then punch them if/when they continue.permalinksaveparent[+]zyedy 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]zyedy 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoJesus I'm 21 and single and I'm crying over this. I can't remember the last time I was so upset over news...or anything. It think Oslo...the shooting is Olso was the last time. This is breaking my heart in much the same way.Your professor is a human and your classmates can die in a fire is what I'm saying.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 1 day ago (1 child)[][deleted] 1 day ago[deleted]permalinksaveparent[+]Generalosity 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Generalosity 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoOf course it's the case. It's extremely common, and there's always a self-righteous, outraged person who wants to attack them because they're worked up and can use the gigglers as a target for their anger.permalinksaveparent[+]ParadieseL 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]ParadieseL 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoCould be nervous/shock laughterpermalinksaveparent[+]DarthGamer 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]DarthGamer 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoPunch the kid behind you in the face, right now!permalinksaveparent[+]LovePugs 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]LovePugs 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoTurn around and tell them to show some goddamn respect. They need to feel mortified by their own lack of empathy. permalinksaveparent[+]Reptarftw 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Reptarftw 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoThis made me rage reading it.  I would have fucking snapped.  I don't care if it was a fucking stupid ass football player who did this, I would wheel around and tell them to get the FUCK out of the lecture hall before I hit them.Reminds me of 9/11 and when the jocks behind me were complaining that football class was canceled 'cuz of some stupid bombings.  Ignorant motherfuckers.permalinksaveparent[+]imperialxcereal 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]imperialxcereal 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoWhat a bunch of cunts.  Loudly ask them what is so fucking funny and then punch them in their dicks.  permalinksaveparent[+]InferiousX 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]InferiousX 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoI've lost a lot of my proper social filter and knowing that there really wouldn't be any immediate consequences, I'd turn around and tell those people to STFU and show some respect. permalinksaveparent[+]cyborgnyc 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]cyborgnyc 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoWow, these are people in college? WTF? I'm sad for our future.permalinksaveparent[+]marineaddict 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]marineaddict 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoPlease tell me you fucked up those kids. I have zero tolerance for that shit and i would have beat the living shit out of them.permalinksaveparent[+]flyingfresian 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]flyingfresian 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoI remember when the Dunblane Massacre happened.  I came home from school and found my mum in tears in the kitchen.  I didn't really understand it then.I'm older now and don't have kids, but this is heartrending.  I worry about the people laughing at your professor's empathy for the parents.permalinksaveparent[+]acousticbruises 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]acousticbruises 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoPunch them out, she won't report you.permalinksaveparent[+]Captian_Cocksmith -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Captian_Cocksmith -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoDo me a favor and punch them a few times. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
