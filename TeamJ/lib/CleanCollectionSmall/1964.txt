He's having his picture posted on every news source. Very coincidental, though, that he's from the exact same town.permalinksaveparent[+]laaabaseball 12 points13 points14 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]laaabaseball 12 points13 points14 points 22 hours agoThere was also another James Holmes that lived in Aurora, Colorado.permalinksaveparent[+]speakstruth 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]speakstruth 4 points5 points6 points 19 hours agoIt's his brotherpermalinksaveparent[+]Banana_Party 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Banana_Party 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours agoThis guy should be in police custody.

I knew something was wrong when they removed the article in question. I thought the thumbnail showed his face but alas it was the writer's (Max something).permalinksaveparent[+]GiantWhaleCannon 8 points9 points10 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]GiantWhaleCannon 8 points9 points10 points 21 hours agoJeez.

Google for facebook convo generator, you can make anything you want. permalinksaveparent[+]laaabaseball 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (3 children)[]laaabaseball 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoI think it's better to go by the doctrine of innocent until proven guilty, and assume the facebook page wasn't him unless it is actually confirmed by investigators that it is. And also, the facebook page has now been removed anyways.permalinksaveparent[+]bennybuckethead 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]bennybuckethead 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI totally agree with you. These posts, both yours and the people linking to FB, were pure speculation and against the Reddit rules, for good reason to protect people.permalinksaveparent[+]laaabaseball 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]laaabaseball 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI didn't post any private information, just a link to a publicly posted and available screenshot of an already published name denying involvement. The Facebook link was to a private profile that should not have been posted.permalinksaveparent[+]bennybuckethead 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]bennybuckethead 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoOkay that's true. permalinksaveparent[+]DocHopper_  comment score below threshold (1 child)[]DocHopper_ -8 points-7 points-6 points 22 hours agoI love how these are the same news outlets people on Reddit defend all day long, as they naively bash the Atlantic and Gawker..._permalinksaveparent[+]stormbeta -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (0 children)[]stormbeta -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoThe Atlantic is fine, but Gawker is kind of bad about some things.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
