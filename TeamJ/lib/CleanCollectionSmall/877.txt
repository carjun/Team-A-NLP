And they are... too polite about it.Sadly we are getting used to this kind of images.The official declaration from the police chief was "It was an accident when the police officer tried to hit the other boy, we didn't want to hit him". And they don't talk about the second officer hitting him in the floor, or officers beating one girl in the wall.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis happened today in Spain.

They HAVE TO show an ID on their chest.But they don't carry it because they don't want to get charges.So they say "we know we have to show an ID, but if we put our ID in our chest, people charge us with false accusations".If you want to press charges the judge dismiss it because "there is no way to identify the anti-riot police offer who did the agression."And the politicians support it.The big problem with spanish police is the total impunity they have.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis happened today in Spain.

In morocco cities many girs don't wear hijab, and they are muslims (she never had problems about it).Wearing hijab is a personal decision for muslims, not an imposition.  She complies more with her religion than 90% of "christians" do. She doesn't eat pork, doesn't drink, pray, respects the ramadan, etc.So if refusing to cover herself is making up her own religion...permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust saw "Skyfall."

She says that's an imposition coming from medieval society, not from her god. She doesn't drink alcohol or eat pork. And she believes in God, but she is so tolerant and open minded that is hard to believe that she is really muslim.I was used to people like your friend who only are muslims for make their family happy, but my gf actually believes in god.I respect that and she respect that I'm an atheist.
