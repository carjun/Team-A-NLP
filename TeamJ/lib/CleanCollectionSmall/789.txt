And when it happened, people pissed and moaned in the same way they piss and moan about any kind of gun control laws now.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsAt what point do we, as a society, say "enough is enough" with these random mass shootings?  by  chrispdxin  PoliticalDiscussion[+]incognitaX 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]incognitaX 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoSo you're against any gun control, regardless. The trend for the past several years has been to loosen gun restrictions.  No permit required in several states, no background checks at gun shows, and now the expansion of CC, to name a few examples.  Gun & ammo sales have been through the roof since Obama was elected in 2008, with the NRA and weapons manufacturers aggressively marketing their fear-mongering campaign of the "government is going to take your guns" and there's criminals who want to hurt you. Rather emotional, don't you think?  You yourself say you have CC in 5 states.  Why is that?  To protect yourself from crime?  When the rates have been falling since the 1970's?  Telling me I can't own, carry, or use a firearm is the same as telling me I can't play baseball because I could kill someone with the batWeak.  Bats aren't created to kill, period.  A person could kill another with a bat, but not easily.  A gun is created solely to kill whatever target it is aimed at.  Most of the people involved in school shootings in the US got their weapons legally and had no history of criminal behavior.  Right now, there are ~89 guns for every hundred people in the US, and they're readily available for anyone who wants one, legal or not.  I'm not in favor of banning weapons, but I do think they should be more difficult to get.  If we're going to have stricter gun control, it does need to be applied at a federal level.  It's meaningless to have strict gun control laws in say, Chicago, when one can step outside city limits and purchase & own guns.Personally, I would get rid of the gun show/private sale/internet loopholes, there should be background checks for every purchase, period.  Carriers should be required to get a license, and undergo training classes similar to driver's ed, along with a mental health evaluation.  Ban magazines that carry more than 10 rounds.  Maybe even limit the number of weapons a person can own.  And I would go further, and restore mental health programs which were gutted by St. Ronnie in the 80's, along with more real support for families, particularly single-parent families.  Not gun-control related, I know, but when a parent is working 2-3 jobs to make ends meet, who's raising the kids?  And no, I don't have much faith in other people.  I've worked with the public for too long, and most of them are idiots.  You say you're a responsible gun owner, I'm sure you are.  But even responsible gun owners can lose their guns, their kid gets it and tragedy happens.  A lot more times than any of us are willing to admit. I don't have much faith in the govt. either, but I think gun owners are deluding themselves if they think they can stop the govt. from 'taking away their rights'.  It's been happening steadily since 2001, and people are mostly content with losing them.  If the peasants do rise against the govt, ala Occupy, they get crushed, and Occupy was a non-violent protest.  (And there were a lot of idiots cheering the govt. on in that case too, whether or not you agree with what Occupy was trying to accomplish, we should all be defending their rights).  Since Columbine, there have been 31 school shootings in the US.  In the entire rest of the world, there have been 14.  A large reason for that is stricter gun laws and the difficulty of obtaining weapons.  For fuck's sake, there has been a mass shooting just about every week, and every day.  In non-suicide related shootings, 235 people get shot, 35 of them die every dayEnough is enough.  I'm not willing to sacrifice one more child on the altar of 'gun rights' (or really, it's about $$$, for the arms manufacturers).  Guns should not be banned, but it's time to rein how easy it is to acquire one, and to reduce the numbers on the streets.  Sure, restrictions won't be 100% effective, but stop signs aren't either.  If it's 50% effective, I can live with cutting fatalities in 1/2.  Fuck the NRA and their hysterical fear-mongering.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsAt what point do we, as a society, say "enough is enough" with these random mass shootings?  by  chrispdxin  PoliticalDiscussion[+]incognitaX 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]incognitaX 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoUmmm, no.  Violent crime rates have been falling for the past 20 years.  Yet people continue to want CC because they think they need to defend themselves from crime, due to fear-mongering.  Maybe we are in agreement, I took your statement to mean that you were not in favor of gun control.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsAt what point do we, as a society, say "enough is enough" with these random mass shootings?  by  chrispdxin  PoliticalDiscussion[+]incognitaX 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]incognitaX 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoYet how many people are getting CC permits because they want to "defend themselves from criminals"?  Violent crime has fallen to the lowest rates since the 70's.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Sure, criminals have guns and get them easily. Why is that? Because we have so many effing guns, period. The US is way ahead of the other wealthy first world nations in gun deaths. Why? Because we have so many effing guns.  And the NRA wants to remove any and all obstacles to ownership or even where people can carry.  Fuck them too.  IMO, we should have gun safety classes in HS, just like we have drivers ed.  For a start.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]incognitaX 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]incognitaX 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoGuns are specifically made to kill.  Cars may kill a total of more people, but the percentage of people killed by cars vs. the number of trips people make in cars is going to be a whole lot lower than the percentage of people killed vs. the number of times someone has aimed a gun at another person (or themself).  There may be times when having a gun saved someone (I assume you're talking about a civilian and not the police) but that are also a whole lot less incidents than the # of times when it didn't.   There was an incident in China where a man went into a school and attacked people there.  HE had a knife.  29 casualties, 22 injured, 2 dead.  This particular incident?  At least 27 dead, 18 of them children.  See the difference? permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Lots of examples of that particular tactlessness over the years, it's a big reason why I don't watch live TV news anymore. Edit - maybe this is a good time to start a writing campaign to all the news stations asking them to rein in their reporters from asking these types of questions.  The incident that did it for me was the Waco massacre.  A reporter was with David Koresh's mom and they were watching their compound burning on the news.  The fucking reporter asked "what are you feeling right now as you watch this?"  DK's mom just looked at her like she was insane and said "Those are my grandchildren..."  I turned it off at that point, don't know if the reporter got booted out or not.  I think crap like this is why so many people cheer at the reporter getting punched in the die hard movies. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHaving fallen into a hotel chimney man sends text messages to girlfriend; firefighters eventually free him but he died of his injuries.  by  keraneuologyin  news[+]incognitaX 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]incognitaX 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoCramped in a dark, airless space, had burns all over his body and probably broken bones or other injuries.
