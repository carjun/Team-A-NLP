Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 4 minutes ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 4 minutes agoThe biggest promise is that this is probably the best way to get live, updated information. For at least the first few hours. Twitter is a good option as well. But live news coverage is still necessary to some extent. After 6 hours though it's too much. And constant interviewing of fucking children, and mental health experts, and ex-swat commanders is a little too much. Another great way to get information, is to listen to the scanner online. Straight from the men and women on the ground without hyped up media bullshit. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDeadly shooting reported at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut  by  Matchboxxin  USNEWS[+]SubliminalHint -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes agoI'm not necessarily saying we need our children to grow up in a police state. I'm not saying schools need to have full time swat teams. I'm saying we could build schools in which each wing could be completely locked down with the push of button if something happens. It's already like that with fire doors, and not a single kid realizes or notices that. I'm saying better video surviellance could be set up to allow this situation to have a minimal impact if it does happen. The answer doesn't need to be national guardsmen posted at every door. I can't say that enough. The same statistics can be used when discussing car bombs in Iraq. Of all the millions of cars only maybe .3% end up being blown up in front of buildings. That doesn't mean nothing should be done about it. That's my point. This is America's form of car bombings. I don't possibly pretend to know all the ways to stop it. It's just comparable. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDeadly shooting reported at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut  by  Matchboxxin  USNEWS[+]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 33 minutes ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 33 minutes agoI completely agree that mental healthcare accessibility should be increased, we absolutely need to do a better job at taking care of those people. Not just for these types of situations but lots of other crimes. But that doesn't have to be a completely separate tactic to fight this. More security is also needed. We don't, I repeat DO NOT need drone coverage over our cities or National Guard men and women posted outside schools and malls. But we need tighter security. We need to make it much more difficult to get into a school with a weapon. We need to stop using no tolerance rules to indefinitely suspend kids who wear football jersey's that have gang colors or numbers. We need to focus more on the adults we let into those schools who are unauthorized and angry. We need to build schools that can be locked down completely wing by wing if a situation like this happens. There are many steps I think we can take to make this less likely. And most certainly mental health care is one of those steps. But not the end all be all answer. Like castellammare said below me, if people don't want help they won't be fixed. Not to mention the fact that it is way too early to know what kind of shit this shooter was dealing with, mentally, emotionaly, and physically. My point remains though, this is America's domestic terrorism. It's the second mass/public shooting this week. It needs to be focused on more intently than weddings in the mountains of Pakistan. It's no different than car bombings in Syria, in my opinion. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]SubliminalHint 4 points5 points6 points 52 minutes ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 4 points5 points6 points 52 minutes agoI posted this on another thread, just wanted to add it here:This is the saddest news story I've ever heard in my lifetime. I actually feel like throwing up right now. This is America's domestic terrorism just like car bombings in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya. As much as nobody, especially on Reddit, wants to admit this our war on terror needs to confront this new form of terrorism. Not with drone strikes on US soil or other inhumane tactics we use in other countries. But we need tighter school security, we need to isolate these individuals before they do this to innocent people. Especially to innocent fucking children. This country is changing in a dramatic way towards fear of domestic terrorism. So far we have been almost completely unable to stop these things before they happen.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDeadly shooting reported at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut  by  Matchboxxin  USNEWS[+]SubliminalHint 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoThis is the saddest news story I've ever heard in my lifetime.

That is un-fucking-believable to use Rex Ryan's words. Either he's the cleanest, best blocker ever or he does a great job of hiding his holding. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAs requested, I Am A 911 Public Safety Dispatcher. AMA  by  mrsmiller121810in  IAmA[+]SubliminalHint 5 points6 points7 points 26 days ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 5 points6 points7 points 26 days agoI am a volunteer firefighter, which in my area means I live and work in a township that is not big enough to have a paid department. I have had several jobs in this local area as well. I know a TON of the people who call 911 for me to respond. Probably every 3rd call is someone I know or recognize. Just had a lady last week that I knew well, who was an amazing person, die unexpectedly that we had to respond too. That shit sucks man. But you gotta keep on trucking because other people are counting on you. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAs requested, I Am A 911 Public Safety Dispatcher.

Thank you for all that you do for us. It makes it a million times better when we have a patient and helpful dispatcher vs. having one who doesn't give a shit.

He had two good games but he wasn't good enough to be the starter before that so how much can he really do? Definitely a bad loss but they're making progress at least. It was a big step forward to win all your non-conference games in a season. permalinksavecontextfull comments[Game Thread] Minnesota @ Iowa (12:00 pm Eastern)  by  IkLmsin  CFB[+]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoI too hate him passionately. Was not in any way wishing for him to come back. I listen to Glenn Mason on the radio every week and always come away from it wishing he was still at Minnesota. Brew took the organization back at least 5 steps. Embarrassing coach. "Get your god dang chili hot boys, get your chili hot." "Are you hungry? Or are you starvin." "If you're going to go bear hunting you gotta be ready to get the bear." Haha I love Brewsterisms even though I hate him. permalinksavecontextfull comments[Game Thread] Minnesota @ Iowa (12:00 pm Eastern)  by  IkLmsin  CFB[+]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoHave no fucking clue? I'd be interested to find out though. I was making a rhyme more than stating that I think he should be a finalist. This is the first I've seen him play. But judging by how he is playing today, and from what the announcers have said about him (7 TD's already? Wow) it sounds like he could have a shot if his season continues this way.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Week 5]OFFICIAL COLLEGE FOOTBALL TRASH TALK THREAD  by  blueboybobin  CFB[+]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoI think it may be the fault of all collective Gopher fans.

I didn't all the sudden start liking them after they won the National Championship. Was a season ticket holder way before they got to be any good. But you're right, it's a good thing I'm not from Mankato or St. Cloud. That would be shameful. permalinksavecontextfull comments[Week 5]OFFICIAL COLLEGE FOOTBALL TRASH TALK THREAD  by  blueboybobin  CFB[+]SubliminalHint 3 points4 points5 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 3 points4 points5 points 2 months agoYou sir are a gentleman and a scholar and for that reason I have accepted your request. May this weekend be much better than my gut tells me it will be! (P.S. It hurts me a little to have this flair because I am an ardent supporter of UMD hockey and therefore I despise UMTC hockey. Because of that it still stings a little bit having that M in front of my name. For football I'm a fan though. It's a good thing you asked nicely!) permalinksavecontextfull comments[Week 5]OFFICIAL COLLEGE FOOTBALL TRASH TALK THREAD  by  blueboybobin  CFB[+]SubliminalHint 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]SubliminalHint 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoOh hell no, you did not just say ABC rules.
