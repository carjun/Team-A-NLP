They were from Newtown. I can't get them off my mind and really hope she was not involved in this. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFresh from the fountain.  by  SAK767in  WTF[+]CoffeeTeaMe 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]CoffeeTeaMe 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoCow.permalinksavecontextfull comments3234Reddit, do any of you truthfully refrain from masturbation?

However, our duties pertain only to being onboard the aircraft. We have no training in issues gate or ticket agents deal with and honestly, we're not usually able to help with anything but very simple information. People constantly ask for directions or information specific to an individual airport and the majority of the time I know as much about it as they do, unless it's the airport I'm based at. When in the terminal, it's best to ask for assistance from someone not wearing wings or toting luggage. When you see us off the aircraft, we're not being paid and are outside our realm of duties...but will help if we can.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy GF works for an airline.

But I'd really love to keep my job more. Unfortunately, those flight attendants could be fired or disciplined by their company and fined by the FAA for what they did. And there's a lot of sour-puss passengers out there that are just looking for reasons to write in and complain.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy GF works for an airline.

If she's dealing with animals that are flying solo, she works on the ground. Unaccompanied animals do not fly in the cabin, therefor the people often cleaning toddler vomit (flight attendants) never see them. So since she works in the terminal, if a toddler barfs, they just call a cleaner to take care of it.When flying with a passenger, animals under 15 pounds may be brought into the cabin, but must remain in their carrier at all times according to FARs. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy GF works for an airline.

Flight attendants never see the dogs and puppies that are flying on their own. She is most likely someone that works in customer service or ticketing, sometimes dealing with precious cargo. Animals flying by themselves do not go in the cabin, they go in cargo. Flight attendants have nothing to do with cargo. Also, when animals do fly in the cabin, FAA requires them to stay in their carrier at all times (save for special circumstances like working service animals). We do not get to play with or cuddle the animals, unfortunately.permalinksavecontextfull comments12323334Seen driving through rural Missouri...
