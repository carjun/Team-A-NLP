Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]SoleusRex 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour agoThe two positions are not mutually exclusive. You can support better mental health services and still maintain that the wide availability of guns creates an unacceptable risk. I'm pretty sure no gun control activists think that our prevailing culture is peachy-keen and that it is solely the guns themselves that the reason for shootings.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Why do we have to assume that water vapor would be damaging to the aliens in the same way as liquid water? Liquid water obviously does lots of things (destroying electronics, say), that ordinary humidity doesn't. Why couldn't this plausibly be true in the case of the aliens, as well?permalinksavecontextfull comments[US-SC][PC] Trifecta gloves I found with 71AR  by  TheWajdin  d3loot[+]SoleusRex 3 points4 points5 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 3 points4 points5 points 5 days agoThe low crit chance hurts quite a bit.

I agree that we should needlessly demonize the man, but let's not pretend that he was honest or sincere.permalinksavecontextfull comments[PC] NA-SC Friend just found this amulet.  by  Uniplankerin  d3loot[+]SoleusRex 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 1 point2 points3 points 13 days agoThat's a hard sell.

At any rate, I'd be surprised if you ever found a study on a subject like this which happened to include subjects corresponding to every nation, age, ethnicity, class, etc. If that's your standard you'll likely never be able to draw even the most tentative general conclusions at all.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCoding should be taught in elementary schools.  by  janeesahin  technology[+]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoIt will have to replace something. If you implement it in a math class, as you suggest, it will have to replace whatever lesson plans or pedagogy that class was using before. One way or another, if you aren't extending school hours and work loads overall then something has to give.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCoding should be taught in elementary schools.  by  janeesahin  technology[+]SoleusRex 4 points5 points6 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 4 points5 points6 points 17 days agoI tend to think that studying formal logic does not serve this purpose. Most of the fallacies that people are concerned with in common discourse (ad hominem, post hoc ergo propter hoc, etc.) are not the subject of formal logic. It's true of course that the purported inferences designated by those fallacies are invalid in the technical sense used in formal logic. But then, so is nearly all scientific reasoning insofar as it relies on induction--and we certainly don't want to designate that as "fallacious" in most contexts. Don't get me wrong--I love logic. But I think people who say that studying logic helps reasoning in everyday situations tend to underestimate how specialized it really is.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCoding should be taught in elementary schools.  by  janeesahin  technology[+]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago*(0 children)[]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago*A lot of disciplines could be said to have general applications, to improve basic critical thinking, and so on. Talk to almost anyone in any university department and they'll be happy to explain why their field has central importance and should be of interest to anyone.Maybe the question would be better put this way: if you think programming should be taught in elementary schools, what should it replace? Unless you plan on extending school hours, you can't introduce programming without designating some other element of prevailing curricula as less important.permalinksavecontextfull comments[NASC] - Best Manticore US?  by  OriginalPheein  d3loot[+]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 18 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 18 days agoNot even close.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIchiro has cool handwriting  by  sonics_fanin  PenmanshipPorn[+]SoleusRex 1 point2 points3 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 1 point2 points3 points 22 days agoI'm even more impressed by his grasp of English, if in fact he wrote that by himself.

But whenever this conversation arises, I find myself wishing that someone would make the bolder argument that not everything must be useful in order to be valuable. Is it really unreasonable to think that a deep understanding of natural world is valuable in itself? Where is the romance in science if not in this? It strikes me that people Newton and Darwin didn't undertake their studies to advance technology, though they did of course accomplish that, but because they were curious. It would be great if all of NASA's research turned out to be highly practical, but I wouldn't be that bothered if much of it didn't. Science is more than just a means to better engineering.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen I was a kid I used to think KO in boxing stood for "Killed Opponent" and thought Mike Tyson had killed like 40 people. What naive mistakes did you make as children?  by  BaronOfBeanDipin  AskReddit[+]SoleusRex 1 point2 points3 points 24 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 1 point2 points3 points 24 days agoI used to think that the turn signals gave the driver directions, like a GPS. It seemed to make sense because I would see the arrows come on first, and then my dad would turn accordingly.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMark Twain - I Was Dead for Millions of Years Before I was Born  by  galencharlesin  atheism[+]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 26 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 26 days agoThis comes up in a lot of philosophical treatments of death--particularly, the question of whether death is bad for the one who dies. The point is made that harm (e.g. physical pain) is only possible for someone who is able to experience it in some sense. Therefore, being dead cannot constitute a harm. It doesn't seem like a bad thing that we were not alive before we were born, why should it be a bad thing to not be alive after we die? Of course, this line of thinking has some incredibly counter-intuitive consequences, such as that painlessly murdering someone does not harm or wrong them. For those interested, Thomas Nagel's essay is a great introduction to these questions.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCabrera beats Trout by landslide for AL MVP  by  Dorksidein  mlb[+]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago*(0 children)[]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago*Sometimes I can't tell if Cabrera supporters think that (1) the triple crown necessarily constitutes a superior contribution to the success of one's team, or that (2) the triple crown carries some kind of additional, special value over and above any such contribution. At any rate, (1) is false, and (2) seems more like religion than sports.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPC for INSANE Barb Shoulders (Friend's shoulders)  by  chrisblipsin  d3loot[+]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago (0 children)[]SoleusRex 0 points1 point2 points 27 days agoWow, those are excellent.
