Elyne Mitchell and her Silver Brumby.I wish I could say I had grown up with Elyne Mitchell's Silver Brumby books. But even though they were published in England, they didn't come my way. As a horse-obsessed child, my constant companions were Black Beauty, the My Friend Flicka series and another Australian book, Tam the Untamed, which seems to have vanished.I discovered The Silver Brumby when I arrived in Australia in my early 20s, and I fell hard. I devoured the books, enchanted by the stories of Thowra, the magnificent silver stallion and his family, friends and foes, and by the vivid descriptions of the landscape, flora and fauna of the Snowy Mountains.Next year is the centenary of Mitchell's birth, and HarperCollins has put together a three-book package to commemorate the occasion. There are four Silver Brumby titles in one book; an exquisite hardback and photographic record of the Snowy Mountains, On the Trail of the Silver Brumby; and the first biography of the author, Elyne Mitchell, written by her daughter Honor Auchinleck.The elegantly cool silver, blue and white covers of the three volumes are exquisitely designed and true indicators of the content, in which the Snowy Mountains play a starring role.The Silver Brumby Centenary Edition collection is the most straightforward but it, too, has special touches, including a long biographical note on Mitchell, photographs, drawings by Mitchell's eldest daughter, Indi, and a map. The collection includes four of the 13-book series, which was published across a staggering six decades from The Silver Brumby in 1958 to Wild Echoes Ringing in 2003.When I re-read The Silver Brumby and the other classics, I am struck by how Mitchell gives the horses a voice without overly anthropomorphising their characters. She knew horses. She knew how they spoke to one another in the language of ''horse''.Curiously, even though when she was writing many English authors were having huge success with talking animals - think C.S. Lewis and the Narnia series, or J.R.R. Tolkien, and earlier Lewis Carroll and Beatrix Potter - it was the ''talking'' horses and animals that Australians were initially reluctant to embrace. Not that it mattered, since children everywhere took her stories of the wild brumbies and the mountains into their hearts, and The Silver Brumby alone sold more than a million copies worldwide.Mitchell's stories are deeply embedded in the national psyche of Australia. Here is the strong, formidable countrywoman who survives disasters, and there were many - including the death of one of her children - who can run a homestead, breed and train horses, and still be an adventurer, champion skier and explorer. Some time after Harry's death in a car accident, Mitchell said of her life in the country: ''It is a marvellous life, terribly hard sometimes, but marvellous.''Auchinleck's biography of her mother is a feat of diplomacy. She proves herself as a writer and balances the almost-impossible task of being the subject's daughter and a detached observer with great skill and empathy. It wasn't easy being the daughter of the somewhat self-obsessed Mitchell.The third book, On the Trail of the Silver Brumby, is full of gems. It knits together a wonderful tapestry of photographs - many by Mitchell's grandson, James Auchinleck; the best of Mitchell's non-fiction writing, including her advocacy for environmentalism and conservation, snippets of poems and stories, and a history of the mountains, as well as brumby photographs matched with quotes from Mitchell's books.If there is one truism in the worlds of publishing and writing, it is that writers should write about what they love, and certainly Mitchell did that.Take, for example, the first words of The Silver Brumby. The reader is thrown head first into the story, and into the Snowy Mountains, Mitchell's constant inspiration for her writing: ''Once there was a dark, stormy night in spring, when, deep down in their holes, the wombats knew not to come out, when the possums stayed quiet in their hollow limbs, when the great, black flying phalangers that live in the mountain forests never stirred. On this night, Bel Bel, the cream brumby mare, gave birth to a colt foal, pale like herself, or paler, in that wild, black storm.''I love that paragraph for so many reasons. To begin with, it uses those magnificent words - ''a dark, stormy night'' - words not approved of by the literary academy, yet they set the scene so perfectly. It's almost a painting, so clearly has Mitchell drawn on her deep knowledge of the environment in which the book was set.Mitchell wrote 24 novels and nine non-fiction books, many of which presaged the importance of environmentalism. She also, in an almost-postmodern twist, wrote the novel of the screenplay of the film based on the poem The Man from Snowy River.The world, it often seems to me, is divided into two types of people: those who live life and others whom life lives. Mitchell was definitely in the first category. From an early age she took the chances she was given and transformed them into outstanding achievements. A somewhat lonely child, she wrote constantly. When introduced to life in the country through a farmhouse at Mount Macedon, she fell in love with horses and the bush. Those three touchstones remained with her for the rest of her life.Mitchell was a woman of extraordinary athletic ability and determination. She was born in Melbourne, but even in the city horses were already a constant presence. She rode with her father, General Harry Chauvel, of Beersheba fame, in South Yarra, where the family lived, and on the beach at Point Lonsdale. It was, perhaps, no surprise that at age 20 she fell in love with a young man who had country flowing in his veins. Tom Mitchell, a lawyer, educated at Harvard and Cambridge, came from a family that had been one of the first to settle in the Upper Murray on a farm at Towong Hill.In her husband, Mitchell found someone as athletic, determined and hard-working as herself. Tom was the Australian and New Zealand downhill-skiing champion, and taught Elyne to ski. She became the Canadian Downhill Champion in 1938.All her life Mitchell espoused the virtues of early rising, exercise and hard work. She often woke at 4am to work on her writing, and during the war years managed the estate on her own while Tom was away. She was lifted onto her last palomino pony, Thowra - named after her beloved Silver Brumby - three months before her death at the age of 88. Thowra led the funeral procession to the cemetery.Ironically, and somewhat sadly, with the ever-increasing push to remove cattle and brumbies from the mountains, Mitchell's way of life is fast disappearing. But the haunting power of the stories she leaves behind will be enjoyed for generations to come, and while there are horse lovers and readers, the legend of the Silver Brumby will live on.THE SILVER BRUMBY:CENTENARY EDITION Elyne Mitchell HarperCollins, 624pp, $32.99ELYNE MITCHELL Honor Auchinleck HarperCollins, 336pp, $32.99ON THE TRAIL OF THESILVER BRUMBY Elyne Mitchell andJames Auchinleck HarperCollins, 256pp, $49.99Tweet      Print StorySaveLatest News Funding boosted for 'carbon and capture' project Killer forced his wayPerfect pupil's next big test - finding a jobMan dies as inflatable raft upturnsClass heroes save lives Editor's Picks Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireFun at the Clunes show.Newlyncouple shocked by truck accident Popular Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeMemories flow of Daylesford's Boathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesFloats needed for DaylesfordNew Years Eve GalaDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireMultimediaGallery: The Boathouse Cafe burns      Gallery: Keele BreenHannah Knight catches up with local artist Keele Breen.
