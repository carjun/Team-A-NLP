Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the fourth-ranking House Republican, said Congress should be careful about suggesting new gun laws.We need to look at what drives a crazy person to do these kind of actions and make sure that were enforcing the laws that are currently on the books. And yes, definitely, we need to do everything possible to make sure that something like this never happens again, she said in a C-SPAN Newsmakers interview taped Friday.Any legislative effort could face stiff resistance not only among Republicans but also among some Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) has promoted his NRA support, as do many of the senators whose elections in 2006 put Democrats in the majority.In July, after the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., Democratic congressional leaders had a hushed response that illustrated how fearful they had become of the NRAs political clout. At the time, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who once sponsored the now-lapsed assault weapons ban, acknowledged that there was no political path for gun legislation.But now, after the NRA spent more than $11million attacking Obama and other Democrats only to see most win reelection, there are signals that their fear has ebbed.Perhaps an awful tragedy like this will bring us together so we can do what it takes to prevent this horror from being repeated again, Schumer said in a statement Friday.Ellison, appearing on MSNBC, said Saturday: Were not afraid of the NRA. Were ready to confront them.
