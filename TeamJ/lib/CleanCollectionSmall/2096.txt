Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]lankira 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]lankira 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoThe problem, there, is the definition of "mentally unstable". It means something different to so many people.I have rapid-cycling, mild bipolar disorder. At my lowest, I have suicidal thoughts and "intrusive thoughts" (I might be making dinner and see the mental picture of driving my chef's knife through my own arm, for example). At my highest manic peaks, I am up late cleaning, writing, cooking, etc. until I literally pass out from exhaustion and not eating.To some, this would qualify me as mentally unstable. However, when I am properly medicated (which is as often as I can afford my meds), I fit in with the rest of society just fine. No mania, no depression. Just the regular happy and sad.I am working on saving up to get lessons for my CCW (concealed carry permit). I have an ex who threatened to kill me when I left him. After attempting to rape me. My husband is a former Marine, and I still feel unsafe because of that ex. Especially when I'm driving home alone, at night. Or when I'm walking to my car after a party. Or when I'm back in my hometown, and see a car that looks like his across the street.The law says I can get my CCW because I've never been hospitalized for a mental illness, but if someone were to give me a psychological test while I was unmedicated, I wouldn't be able to own a BB gun in all likelihood. Fear for my own safety would be less important than the off-chance that I might, maybe, hurt someone (note: I'm almost entirely self-destructive when it comes to violence, and on the rare occasions I'm not, it's never physical, only verbal).I don't have a good solution, but I want people to know that there's a lot of different facets to the whole "mental illness/instability" thing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]lankira 14 points15 points16 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]lankira 14 points15 points16 points 22 hours agoI commented earlier, in response to someone I know now is a troll, in 100% agreement:This situation is horrendous, and I cannot even fathom how someone could wake up in the morning thinking "today I'm going to shoot up an elementary school".However, the mental health care system in this country is lacking. Insurance is only required to cover mental health care "equally" as it does the rest. What this often means is that the psychologists and psychiatrists who would be of the most assistance are treated as "specialists", requiring a copay of 2-3x that of a general practitioner, despite having to see psychiatrists and psychologists at least once a month, on average, for any semblance of quality care. While they are required to cover the care, they are also not required to have any caregivers in-network. They are also not required to treat psychiatric prescriptions in the same way that they treat non-psychiatric meds. Often, this places the psych meds in the "premium" or "non-preferred" category.What does all of this mean, really? It means that I, a gainfully employed, 24 year old woman with bipolar disorder cannot afford the help I need, even with the addition of insurance and my husband's income. Copay for a visit to my primary care physician is $25, no matter how frequently I visit. Copay to see a psychologist or psychiatrist is $60. And that's if there's an in-network doctor. There isn't, through my insurance, a single in-network mental health care provider that isn't part of a hospital. Psychologists and psychiatrists at most of these hospitals are there for consultation or to deal with the mental ward, not to take on patients of their own.All told, in order for me to get the care I need to be "normal", I need to spend, in-network, $300 per month on doctors (psychologist, for therapy, once a week; psychiatrist, for meds, once a month), and another 50% of the $500/month that my meds cost (because, well, they're non-preferred medications). Out of network? I'm looking at $100 per visit (minimum), with the meds still at $250.I'm lucky. I have insurance. Those who are uninsured are even less likely to be able to get the help they need. Let alone those who are homeless.We need to fix the mental health care system. I think it would help everyone, not just those like me. I think it would help us see less violence in our society.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

If you refuse the brethalyzer, you're presumed drunk and hit with a DWI (driving while intoxicated, or drunk driving). It's how my mom got out of a DUI (driving under the influence). Had she not refused the brethalyzer, she would have had a blood draw done which would have shown that she took a large quantity of Xanax. Instead, she refused the breathalyzer and got her second DWI.Why is she allowed to get her license back?permalinksavecontextfull commentsI woke up this morning to two surprises, one, that I was pregnant, and two, that I had miscarried.  by  PolyArmoryin  TwoXChromosomes[+]lankira 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]lankira 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoShe is, thanks; this was all four or five years ago now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI woke up this morning to two surprises, one, that I was pregnant, and two, that I had miscarried.  by  PolyArmoryin  TwoXChromosomes[+]lankira 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]lankira 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoThinking about it, you're probably right.

My mom was the one who told me about everything two weeks after the miscarriage was confirmed, and my sister still had over a week to wait before the procedure. I've been too afraid to ask my sister about it, as it's a really sore spot for her (her then-bf broke up with her, then emotionally manipulated her to come back afterwards, as if the miscarriage wasn't enough).permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo last night, /mlp/ had a thread where they watched MLP episodes on YouTube, turned on the captions, and screen-capped the misreadings...  by  MyOwnPathin  mylittlepony[+]lankira 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]lankira 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago My husband refuses to move north of the Mason-Dixon line unless it's to Seattle.

She felt some pain and went to the doctor. Doc found out that there was no longer a heartbeat. Since her body wasn't going to eject the fetus on its own for some reason, she had to wait about a month before they could do the procedure to remove it.TL;DR: sister had a miscarriage that was almost a stillbirth and had to walk around with a dead fetus in her uterus for almost a month.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo last night, /mlp/ had a thread where they watched MLP episodes on YouTube, turned on the captions, and screen-capped the misreadings...  by  MyOwnPathin  mylittlepony[+]lankira 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]lankira 3 points4 points5 points 4 days agoOh, Canada, I love you because you have loonies and toonies and Timmies and just so happen to be home to some of my favorite gamer friends.Also, you're kind of strange and have poutine.

A list of possible repercussions and a set of numbers is all that's really needed.For example, in a D20 system, one might roll a d20, and suffer one of the following.1: Death2-4: Lost (or broken) limb (roll a D4. 1-2 is legs, 3-4 is arms, odds are right side, evens are left)5-8: Knocked out (a friendly character must spend a turn to wake up a knocked out character, who regains 1hp)9-11: Bleeding out (character is slowly dying and has 1d6+1 turns/rounds/minutes to be successfully aided)etc.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are your favorite game mechanics?  by  joeslucherin  rpg[+]lankira 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago*(0 children)[]lankira 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago*I love the ailments and mental conditions system in Harnmaster (or, at least the version my Harn GM calls "three point MINE"). I've played a character who suffers from an addiction and an allergy, there's a pre-gen that the GM made who had multiple personalities (one of which was pyrophobic (only a little), the other had a violent temper), and then there's the pregen known as "Crazy Eddie". Crazy Eddie suffers from both pyromania and pyrophobia.ETA: Totally forgot to mention how the mechanic actually works. Harn is largely a percentile system, and this is no exception.Addictions and allergies are considered physical issues (just like birthmarks, scars, missing limbs, etc.). Allergies are handled in almost a purely RP manner, with a will check to see if your character can suppress the symptoms of a minor allergen presence; in the event of a major issue (eating shellfish if your character is allergic to it), it's handled in a largely RP way (your character needs help to not die), with skill challenges for things like the medic trying to keep your airways open.The mental conditions are handled slightly differently. During character creation, there is a roll to determine severity. Higher is better. In a situation that could trigger the mental condition, such as the pregen with multiple personalities being under large amounts of stress, percentiles are rolled, and if the number is less than or equal to the target, the character is fine. Over, and the character loses control and, in the pregen's case, the new personality takes over.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are your favorite game mechanics?  by  joeslucherin  rpg[+]lankira 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]lankira 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoThen there's always the "hey, you rolled 18!

Some large parts get destroyed, others are re-used for different things. Example: two of the Nautiluses were used at the snorkeling site for Disney Cruises for a while, but the portholes of most of them were stripped off and auctioned.After a while, salvagers are often given access to the Disney boneyard to strip down a lot of the old parts. Sometimes, the pieces will end up on eBay, but more often than not, the parts that are easily reused or recycled are grabbed.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDisney World 20k Leagues Gravesite [oc] (1792x1183)  by  ThatGuyinaHatin  AbandonedPorn[+]lankira 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]lankira 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoNot the one at Disney World.

He does all his own stunts and is a really awesome Muy Thai exhibition-er (is that the right word?) (also, I don't think he competes any more, as he's accidentally broken a couple of people).But, in most of his films, the English translation of the dialog leaves much to be desired.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
