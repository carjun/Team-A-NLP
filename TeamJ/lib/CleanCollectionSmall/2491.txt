Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago*(0 children)[]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago*Pro gun wants to elevate the conversation to be about freedom. Anti gun wants to elevate the conversation about public freedom. Either way it's an ongoing struggle for Americans of this current generation to define what freedom means, because quite frankly, after my service in the Marine Corps, after more than a decade of war, I don't believe anyone truly understand what freedom really means.As for the beauty of life, having socialized and hanging with the broken, misfits, the traumatized, and the suicidal the past few years... the one thing I learned is that just because you're not wrong doesn't necessarily make you right either. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]alaskamiller 27 points28 points29 points 1 hour ago*(0 children)[]alaskamiller 27 points28 points29 points 1 hour ago*Advocating for the other side, this is what happens when you live in the land of the free. You get people who don't always agree, groups are marginalized, anger seethes, and some are willing to resort to extremism for whatever purpose they rationalize. Right now, the most urgent conversation is the immediate either or demonization of us versus them, splitting sides. This happens no matter what and death, anger, destruction is used to push whoever's agenda best. My country is devolving into a state where there's no right or wrong anymore, just how many people you can get to agree.If anything I think these incidents are indicators of an overall trend of the general unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Happy people don't do these things. But you can't guarantee everyone's happiness forever at every moment, only try to provide for an environment for anyone to pursue happiness. We live in USA, an experiment from 200 years ago that through the generations have been built through trials and errors, blood and sweat. These are the costs and collateral damage of freedom. There are some that strive to keep the bar high but there are also people willing to kick the bar lower each day.If you are angered by any of this the very most important you can do now is do everything you can to keep raising the bar and help everyone else be there too. The rest is is just noise to scare you, to control you, to distract you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is Eminem viewed as such a pioneer for white rappers when the Beastie Boys were killin the mic like a decade before him?  by  sarcasm24in  hiphopheads[+]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoBeastie Boys were big for the older MTV generation. Eminem was big for the 80's kids then went pop/mainstream for the 90's kids. We live in a world where everyone has short term memory loss so we just repeat stories instead of history's winners.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNY Times: "It is a dark day for the rule of law. Federal and state authorities have chosen not to indict HSBC, the London-based bank, on charges of vast and prolonged money laundering, for fear that criminal prosecution would topple the bank and, in the process, endanger the financial system."  by  madcat033in  TrueReddit[+]alaskamiller -2 points-1 points0 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]alaskamiller -2 points-1 points0 points 16 hours agoI think denying watching the likes of news media but then only on YouTube videos to be the disingenuous part. It tilts to the other side of the extreme, like a Fox News viewer on the only end only caring about one perspective and eschewing multiple sources to maintain a filter bubble. permalinksavecontextfull commentsNY Times: "It is a dark day for the rule of law.

So now I'm curious.Do you not watch network news under the guise that they present you wrong information? So you use YouTube as some sort of reality window. But because it didn't have any glitzy well produced videos you just chalk it up as shiftless college kids with undefined goals that want to redistribute wealth.Did you have that feeling before? Did the YouTube videos confirm your bias?permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Simpsons calling this 10 years in advance (2012 election)  by  MulhollandDrivein  TheSimpsons[+]alaskamiller 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]alaskamiller 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoWell, sort of.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny stories from serial 'failed' entrepreneurs?  by  joshuamoronyin  startups[+]alaskamiller 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]alaskamiller 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*Sorry, I'm offering my perspective of what I saw and know.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Simpsons calling this 10 years in advance (2012 election)  by  MulhollandDrivein  TheSimpsons[+]alaskamiller 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]alaskamiller 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago*This actually makes me really sad because Matt Groening's early success came from voicing his cynical Portland opinions from the 80's. That momentum kept going through Life in Hell then peeking through bits and pieces of The Simpsons.I posit that partly why early Simpsons were so good was because it was edgy adult sentimentalities and cynical views done through cartoon forms, the ultimate Gen X comfort food. Something that South Park then took to a whole new level.Point is... the worst of the Simpsons isn't meant to be real. That's why it was a funny bit. But when they are real... it's funny sad, not funny haha.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOaksterdam Mural Gone  by  Matchstixin  bayarea[+]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoRemember Peter from Family Guy warning about gingivitis Remember here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYpzLZcuvq8Replace gingivitis with the word gentrification.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny stories from serial 'failed' entrepreneurs?  by  joshuamoronyin  startups[+]alaskamiller 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]alaskamiller 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago*Work long enough and you'll see this yourself eventually. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny stories from serial 'failed' entrepreneurs?  by  joshuamoronyin  startups[+]alaskamiller 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]alaskamiller 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoTech biz is a magic show. Some figured out some early tricks, made some money, the trick got stale so they sold it off as books. Same thing that's been done for generations.The other dirty secret is the two extremes of making money. The good stuff makes money, tons of money, but it's hard. While the evil stuff also makes tons of money.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny stories from serial 'failed' entrepreneurs?  by  joshuamoronyin  startups[+]alaskamiller 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]alaskamiller 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoI grew up in Silicon Valley. Been watching for ten years now. A few things I've learned:People that came from backgrounds don't understand what failure means, they take for granted that you just bounce back, like a wound healing itself automatically. For people that do come from bad backgrounds, failure to them means the end of trying, they don't get the benefits of trying multiple times.People play the odds but the numbers don't mean anything. It's like a game of roulette, the previous rolls don't actually affect your current roll. Learning something before just knows what you're doing now but doesn't improve the odds for something else. Most of the times you can do every single thing right, and still fail. You have to accept this. The tech biz is maturing. The internet is eating up a lot of mass media. That means it's starting down the same path as show biz maturing. Silicon Valley is very much like Hollywood, theres a system slowly forming. Understanding politics is getting to be the same if not more important as the idea or execution.No one listens. People say they do but they really don't. Or they only choose to listen to the anointed ones, ones with survivor bias, big social media followings. All you can do is work.The biggest thing I've learned is just that the universe is indifferent to you. That's all. A lot of times things just don't happen. Yet the dream gets sold year after year. If you start something, something will happen. That's not true. But this place is full of people who don't care that. That's who you're competing with.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMe and my partner are building a marketing/funding platform for nonprofits.

All of it. It's not bad, it's not great, it's just off. Reminds me of early 2000's when we're entering into the third internet wave. The colors, tone, and mood don't fit at all, too many elements crammed together.The copywriting is unprofessional. Hustle, as much kids keep trying to repurpose it still has negative connotations attached to it. You can be more creative, I believe in you.Move the navigation to the bottom, it's taking up precious above the fold real estate. On my 13" laptop I don't even see the sign up and reserve button. That's the action you want, why isn't it front and center?WePay has a pages product for charity orgs. Look into that. Which then brings up... how are you making money to sustain this? And even bigger question, given the dozens of crowd funding copycats popping up every day, and plenty of established options available to help service charities, why would orgs choose you?permalinksavecontextfull commentsI've finished working on my website project for a few months now. Having a hard time getting traffic.  by  timesliderin  startups[+]alaskamiller 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]alaskamiller 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago*When you can pay for a cheap script PHP package replicating a better, more well known website where all you gotta do is get traffic then that's pretty much a sign the party's over. You basically bought something that remade livejournal.Best advice for you right now is to kill this and find something else.If you want to persist...Fake content. Hire off Mechanical Turk and pay them to see content.Spam. Spam everywhere, read about emarketing and buy cheap traffic then hope some stick. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe most dangerous thing is a driven entrepreneur with a chip on his shoulder.  by  sikrcrin  startups[+]alaskamiller 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]alaskamiller 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoPeople that say this have no idea what they really mean.
