We got to see Lesnar v Cena, Sheamus/DB 2-out-of-3 falls, Punk v Jericho, Punk/DB, etc all in that time frame. I mean, not everything was good, but I thought the post-Mania shows were pretty damn good. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFedEx Overcharged Customers for Years -- FedEx has been systematically overcharging customers by billing businesses and government offices at higher residential rates, a company sales executive said in an internal e-mail unsealed in a lawsuit.  by  DavidCarrawayin  politics[+]jacksonattack 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]jacksonattack 5 points6 points7 points 3 days agoI'm sorry, but this has nothing to do with politics. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShared Sacrifice: Hostess Used Employee Pensions to Fund Itself, While paying millions to its executives  by  1000000studentsin  politics[+]jacksonattack -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (0 children)[]jacksonattack -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoI think PoliticusUSA should consider editing their articles once in a while. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWasn't 3MB supposed to address the WWE tonight?  by  Slyguy46in  SquaredCircle[+]jacksonattack 9 points10 points11 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]jacksonattack 9 points10 points11 points 3 days agoI miss them.

I just can't handle them putting him over as this unbeatable monster but them not being able to give him the title because of all the future booking nonsense with Rock, Punk etc. Let him do something with someone who matters where he won't bury new talent. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMonday Night RAW Discussion Thread - 12/10/2012  by  2xb1erin  SquaredCircle[+]jacksonattack 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]jacksonattack 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoThe fact that TLC is in Brooklyn makes me believe we're gonna get a Ziggler cash in.
