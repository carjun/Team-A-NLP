Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]zip_000 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]zip_000 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoYour point is bullshit. Having more guns there wouldn't have made anything better.Anti-gun control people always say, "people will find a way to get guns if they really want them." The same logic works against you: if they are intent on doing it, then they will do it. Having more guns there would only make it more likely that accidental deaths would occur at other times.Maybe the guy would have been a little sneakier getting in the building, but that is about the only difference.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Taking the time to think is almost always a good thing.I'm saying today is the wrong time to talk about gun control or any of the political arguments about this. When they haven't even released any real info about the case, etc. I'm not saying that it shouldn't be talked about tomorrow or next week. There is a good time to talk about gun control, it just isn't while people don't even know if their loved ones are alive or not.Maybe it isn't a good time to talk about anything right now, I guess we just need an outlet.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

WTF? Why are you talking about it in this thread if it doesn't matter if one was used or not?It matters. If we can keep this from happening by keeping something specific away from some specific kinds of deranged assholes, then it matters.I am all for more gun control, but it needs to be based on reason not on knee jerk reactions.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

And as corduroyblack said, assault rifle is more of a political term I think than an actual term for a weapon.That being said, we have to do something about this kind of thing, and I don't know what it is. Better gun control has to be part of it though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I think we need to have that conversation, and we need to have had it yesterday, but right now it will be reactionary which could cause more problems than it helps. It needs in depth thought and discussion.My personal opinion is that we need far greater gun control laws, but talking about it right now is too soon. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

The last time, I was already in the process of leaving the job, and had come to hate everything about it - not that that is a realistic assessment of the employer at all, just the place I was in personally.Anyway, I tried to answer with all of the positives I could come up with, which felt kind of dishonest. The person we hired - which wasn't the person I recommended - ended up only staying in the job for 6 months.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLPT: At the end of an interview, the interview will always ask if you have any questions.
