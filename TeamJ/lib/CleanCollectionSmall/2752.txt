Now, you're thinking "But nobody does that now" and you'd be right. They don't do it because they don't have the bandwidth.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs God evil for destroying entire nations in the Old Testament?  by  WertFigin  Christianity[+]TheIcelander 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]TheIcelander 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoGuess they should have sacrificed their children by nailing them to crosses.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElon Musks electric car company Tesla Motors is now cash-flow positive - a clear sign the market is growing  by  BuriesItin  environment[+]TheIcelander 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]TheIcelander 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours agoI get the feeling that my kids - ages 3 and 5 - won't ever own an internal-combustion car.

Child sacrifice is bad, no doubt, but the Israelite's god not only commanded that of Abraham, but also performed it by killing his own child.The terrible totality of the destruction was undoubtedly related to the prohibition of assimilation to pagan nations on Israels part. This isn't a defense, it's an excuse. These people were killed for gods insecurity.Second, there are many other ways of preventing this mixing. Create for the Israelites a new fertile land along the Red Sea, surrounded by natural walls that will defend the Israelites.Third, Numbers 31:17-18 refute the argument that they didn't want mixing. They were ordered to kill all the boys and women, but keep the girls for themselves. How is this any different from child sacrifice and ritual prostitution?permalinksavecontextfull commentsDiscussion Thread: The Gospel for Those "Broken" by the Church  by  TheRandomSamin  Christianity[+]TheIcelander 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]TheIcelander 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoI love hearing things like this because I don't fit into either case, but just about every other atheist I've met fits in with them.
