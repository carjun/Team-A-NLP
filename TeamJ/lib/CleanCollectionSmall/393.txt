All of these massacres are occurring where there are BANS on guns. This gives the evil person free range to commit murder. When guns are banned, the law abiding citizens turn them in and criminals keep them. This is a FACT. Do your research before you go around touting such nonsense based on nothing but your emotions.Better yet, read More Guns Less Crime by John Lott, or just listen to him on YT.Reply 3 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate dylan14570's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate dylan14570's comment.Sign inin reply to Xedome(Show the comment) RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Userj3rryas                1 hour ago"i know karate, i'll lead the way" kids are so awesome, how could anyone hurt oneReply 3 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate j3rryas's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate j3rryas's comment.Sign inAll Comments (740)Update automaticallyDisable automatic updatesRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserMrSerbia97                16 seconds ago@westwest yall what...

Get ready for the coming onslaught of knee-jerk, reactionary gun-grabbers who are never afraid to use a tragedy like this to blame guns as the cause, not the people who use them.
