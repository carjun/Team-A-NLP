Anyway, craigslist and kijiji are for selling in person. Plus, you can cancel paypal transactions, and do all sorts of weird-ass shit on there.

Ask me anything.  by  GigasVaporin  AMA[+]Djuret 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Djuret 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoHey,My old budgie died in February. We found him in his cage a day before he died, and he couldn't move his left leg, but everything else was fine after a while; we had him in a warm box, and he actually escaped, and was his usual cocky self. Fast forward to the next morning... he didn't make it through the night. Was this a pair of strokes? He was almost 9 years old.Also, my new budgie is somewhat unfriendly. How can I get it to warm up to me a bit more? I was able to handle him without a fuss, and he was very friendly to me for a while, but now that his flight feathers have grown back in, he won't have anything to do with me. Just looking for some info.Thanks a lot!permalinksavecontextfull commentsGirlfriend's trying to sell a Macbook Pro and we have some questions...(album in the post)  by  NigelxDin  Scams[+]Djuret 6 points7 points8 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Djuret 6 points7 points8 points 2 months agoPeople who reply on craigslist and want to pay over paypal and have it shipped are usually trying to scam you.
