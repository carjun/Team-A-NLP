Mr. Jobs decided to wait 9 months after the tumor was found to undergo the Whipple procedure, which would have been highly unneccessary if he had undergone the surgery to just remove the tumor 9 months earlier as he had been told by medical experts.  He regretted the fact that he made this decision.   In fact he waited so long to get surgery done that by that time cancer had also spread to his liver (which necessitated his eventual liver transplant).   If you read the biography, like you've said, then you would know this. He did live longer than average after the Whipple procedure (by getting the best medical care in the world), but the major point is if he just gotten the surgery to remove the localized tumor 9 months earlier like he was told to, he would not have to have gotten the Whipple procedure.   Instead he decided to try alternative therapies for 9 months, a decision he even regretted (although you don't seem to).http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-20123269/biographer-jobs-refused-early-and-potentially-life-saving-surgery/http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Rare-form-of-cancer-has-high-survival-rate-2736728.phpWhat about this is hard for you to understand?  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat do you think the TILs of the future will be about our era?  by  are_you_positivein  AskReddit[+]sp3000 9 points10 points11 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]sp3000 9 points10 points11 points 10 hours agoPlease do not pass around false information like this.  What you have said is simply not true.  According to Jobs's biographer, Walter Isaacson, "for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer  a decision he later regretted as his health declined."Jobs had an extremely treatable islet cell neuroendocrine tumor that was detected quite early.  If he had gotten surgery when doctors' recommended he would probably be alive.I suggest you stop talking about cancer as your knowledge seems very limited and you are making sweeping generalizations  and you might actually convince someone to make a fatal medical decision.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsGame Thread: New England Patriots (9-3) vs Houston Texans (11-1)  by  zestyscarabin  nfl[+]sp3000 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]sp3000 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoBrady's gonna win a super bowl this yearpermalinksavecontextfull commentsProve to me that a technological singularity is possible  by  Icemanrussianin  singularity[+]sp3000 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]sp3000 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoI don't think there is any controversy whether a technological singularity is possible.  Barring an extinction level event, it is inevitable.  The real issue is how long it will take humanity to achieve the singularity.  I'm not sure I'm as optimistic as Kurzweil, but I think it is certainly possible this century.   permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is it Okay for girls to drool over the movie Magic Mike but if a guy watches the Victoria secret fashion show he is labeled a pervert?  by  TheGingerKingin  MensRights[+]sp3000 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]sp3000 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoOf course they look at physical abilities as well.  Just to a much lesser extent than men do.  If you are feeling like you are lacking in the confidence department, hitting the gym is a great way to improve this, along with making you more attractive to woman physically.  And yes your second statement is true too, but just to a much lesser extent than men who can overlook a woman's physical qualities. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is it Okay for girls to drool over the movie Magic Mike but if a guy watches the Victoria secret fashion show he is labeled a pervert?  by  TheGingerKingin  MensRights[+]sp3000 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*(0 children)[]sp3000 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*As a male 17 yro you're much better off than a female 17 yro.  Woman's attractiveness is based much more on physical qualities.  Mens attractiveness to women is based much more on things like personality, confidence, humor, and how much money you have (this comes later).  How many times have you seen a smoking hot girl with an average or ugly looking guy?  Now how many times have you seen a hot guy with an ugly girl?  As a man we can always work on the qualities that make us attractive to women, even if we were born ugly.  If a girl is ugly she has a much harder time.As for you not getting laid yet, instead of complaining about how easy it is for girls to get laid anytime on reddit, maybe you should work on some self improvement. Hit the gym and learn some better social skills and confidence.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is it Okay for girls to drool over the movie Magic Mike but if a guy watches the Victoria secret fashion show he is labeled a pervert?  by  TheGingerKingin  MensRights[+]sp3000 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]sp3000 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoWell I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that its true that you have heard many girls say that watching it is perverted.  I had people over tonight and had the show playing on TV in the background.  All of us, including the girls (actually, especially the girls) enjoyed watching it.  So maybe the crowd you hang out with is the real issue.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is it Okay for girls to drool over the movie Magic Mike but if a guy watches the Victoria secret fashion show he is labeled a pervert?  by  TheGingerKingin  MensRights[+]sp3000 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]sp3000 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoI never said anything about what you believed.  I'm just making the point that there are double standards that exist and that they are pretty much the opposite of your original post.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is it Okay for girls to drool over the movie Magic Mike but if a guy watches the Victoria secret fashion show he is labeled a pervert?  by  TheGingerKingin  MensRights[+]sp3000 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago*(0 children)[]sp3000 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago*Because this issue only exists in your head.  If you're  really bothered by this you have some real problems.I've watched the VSFS with many women and no one thought any of us guys were perverts for watching it.  If there is any double standard it is the opposite.. why is it ok for men to hook up with as many girls as they want, but girls are called sluts if they do the same?permalinksavecontextfull commentsKilling Them Softly becomes only the ninth movie to receive an "F" grade from CinemaScore.  by  doogie92in  movies[+]sp3000 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]sp3000 1 point2 points3 points 10 days agoTo me the bar scene is the best in the movie.

Even people in his own party have realized some of the hard lines republicans had taken were just out of step wih reality.  Hell, even Sean Hannity now agrees with Obama on immigration and Bill Kristol thinks taxing the wealthy is not such a bad idea after all. Maybe its time for Romney to go back to the positions he held when he was governor of Massachusetts.  He wouldn't have won the Republican primary, but he might have won the general  election if he had been consistent with those views.  So the problem is really about the beliefs of the evangelical, neocon, Republican base.  Not because Obama gave 'big gifts'.  permalinksavecontextfull comments15142143144Redditor finds out that his sister is featured prominently on billboards about poop and buttsex[funny] (reddit.com)submitted 1 month ago by sp3000 to defaultgems5 commentssharecancelloading...So I just saw this driving home  by  Ricktheclamhammerin  funny[+]sp3000 297 points298 points299 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]sp3000 297 points298 points299 points 1 month agodon't worry too much about your sister dude, the billboard is not really about poop.  its about buttsex.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that not only was Albert Einstein unfaithful to both of his wives, he married his cousin Elsa the same year he divorced his first wife.

Arnold has denounced his father's views many times (in fact they never got along) and later on he actually commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Center to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of atrocities.He talks about this a lot in his autobiography, which is a pretty inspiring read.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsArnold Schwarzenegger the day he became a citizen  by  stubborn_icecubein  pics[+]sp3000 1010 points1011 points1012 points 1 month ago*(0 children)[]sp3000 1010 points1011 points1012 points 1 month ago*From his recent autobiography book jacket:THE GREATEST IMMIGRANT SUCCESS STORY OF OUR TIMEHe was born in a year of famine, in a small Austrian town, the son of an austere police chief. He dreamed of moving to America to become a bodybuilding champion and a movie star.By the age of twenty-one, he was living in Los Angeles and had been crowned Mr. Universe.Within five years, he had learned English and become the greatest bodybuilder in the world.Within ten years, he had earned his college degree and was a millionaire from his business enterprises in real estate, landscaping, and bodybuilding. He was also the winner of a Golden Globe Award for his debut as a dramatic actor in Stay Hungry.Within twenty years, he was the worlds biggest movie star, the husband of Maria Shriver, and an emerging Republican leader who was part of the Kennedy family.Thirty-six years after coming to America, the man once known by fellow bodybuilders as the Austrian Oak was elected governor of California, the seventh largest economy in the world.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNed Stark vs. Sean Bean  by  FearTheStache13in  gameofthrones[+]sp3000 29 points30 points31 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]sp3000 29 points30 points31 points 1 month agoI read the books before the show (like way before) and he was a very likable character in the books (even though he did some very frustrating things).  The impact of the Baelor scene would not have worked as well without him being likable.  Gladiator had just come out in theaters shortly after I read the first book and so I actually imagined him as Russel Crowe was in that movie - stoic and honorable.  I think Sean Bean captured that perfectly in the show and embodies the book's Ned Stark better than any other character in the tv show has  permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy moms copy of Fifty Shades of Grey.
