Paul Vance of the Connecticut State Police said 18 children and six adults were found dead in one section of the school, and two children later died at a hospital. One person was wounded but survived, and the shooter was found dead when police entered the school. Vance said one person was also dead at another crime scene, and Gov. Dannel Malloy said this victim lived with the shooter. This victim was believed to be the shooter's mother, Nancy Lanza. Police in New Jersey were conducting a related investigation in Hoboken, where Ryan Lanza was detained and questioned. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., has classes from kindergarten through the fourth grade, and the child victims were all 5 to 10 years old. Three weapons found at the scene included two handguns and a .223 Bushmaster assault rifle.Reports from the scene: Shooter didn't say a wordAs reports of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary spread Friday, parents raced to the school looking for their children. Police told students to close their eyes as they led them from the building. Robert Licata said his 6-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher. "That's when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door," he said. "He was very brave. He waited for his friends." He said the shooter didn't say a word. Richard Wilford's 7-year-old son, Richie, a second-grader at the school, told him he heard a noise that "sounded like what he described as cans falling." A teacher went out to check on the noise, came back, locked the door and had the kids huddle in the corner until police arrived. Mergim Bajraliu, 17, said the heard the gunshots from his home and ran to check on his 9-year-old sister A woman hugs her daughter after the shooting.

He said teachers were shaking and crying as they came out of the building. "Everyone was just traumatized," he said. Tearful Obama mourns 'heinous crime'President Barack Obama wiped away tears and fell silent with emotion Friday as he spoke to the nation about the "heinous crime" that took place in Connecticut earlier. "We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years, and each time I hear the news, I react not as a president but as everybody else would, as a parent," Obama said in a short address at the White House. "And that is especially President Barack Obama wipes a tear from his eye as he discusses the shooting in a Connecticut elementary school that left 27 people dead. (AP Photo)true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. ... Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there is no way to ease their pain." In a statement, Obama ordered flags flown at half-staff until sundown Tuesday at the White House and all federal buildings.The Wire, a summary of top national and world news stories from the Associated Press and other wire services, moves weekdays.
