I'm very much a beginner when it comes to these things.  I've rooted my Galaxy Nexus (just for wireless tethering, still using stock) and before that I rooted my OG Droid which I did install a couple custom ROMs on, but I'm not super comfortable with everything.  Can you point me in the direction of an easy to use / understand guide for unlocking and rooting TF201?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Boss.  Honorable mention goes to Frank Alexander who has played excellent as a 4th round situational DE with 4 sacks and 3 passes defended.Offense - ???: There are only 2 rookie offensive players on the roster.  Joe Adams who is supposed to be a PR.  He has only been active for 5 games has returned 9 kickoffs with 1 fumble and a long of 31 yards and returned 7 punts with 2 fumbles and a long of 21 yards. The other rookie is Silatolu at LG and he has looked less than stellar to put it lightly.  permalinksavecontextfull comments8234Full-finger gloves that I can type (and ideally use a touchscreen) with?

Will AP and Peyton make it four?  by  rderekpin  nfl[+]faultlessjoint 1 point2 points3 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]faultlessjoint 1 point2 points3 points 19 days agoWell, it's very common that when someone tears their ACL they also tear the MCL which isn't nearly as serious of a problem that once the ACL is torn that is the concern.  You're right that no one has lead the league in rushing in a season that started 9 months after injury.  But how many times has a top tier RB with a solid O-line torn his ACL exactly 9 months before the next season.Not only is Davis the only NFL player in history at any position to comeback from 3 ACL tears but he gave up his $8mil a year salary and came back for the $700k vet minimum just to get an opportunity to play again.  He was going to be primarily a back-up / special teams player, no one thought he would ever contribute again.  But it's late November, he's starting and he is making plays all over the field.  If he had been cut it's doubtful any team in the league would have signed him.  Many fans were pissed Carolina was even offerring the Vet minimum.   permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL Three times before, there have been Co-Comeback Players of the Year. Will AP and Peyton make it four?  by  rderekpin  nfl[+]faultlessjoint 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]faultlessjoint 0 points1 point2 points 19 days agoThis is true.  But I would argue he is an elite 4-3 WLB and deserves to be in the discussion based on the extent of his comeback.  No offense to Peterson and his amazingness, but people comeback from ACL tears all the time.  No one in the history of the NFL has ever town the same ACL three times and every played another down, much less play at a very high level.  I'm not saying he deserves it more than Manning but he should at least get mentioned.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL Three times before, there have been Co-Comeback Players of the Year.

He's come back from 3 consecutive ACL tears in less than 3 years and playing excellent.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI oft hear /r/Halo-ers reminisce about Halo 2 or Halo 3. Were these games inherently superior, or do we just have good memories and feelings associated with these games (e.g., playing them with high school friends, playing them while growing up) that makes us like them more?  by  maestosoin  halo[+]faultlessjoint 0 points1 point2 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]faultlessjoint 0 points1 point2 points 20 days agoIMO, I've enjoyed Halo 2, 3, ODST, Reach, and 4 all about the same.  Each game does some things well and some things not so well.CE is the only one that stands above the rest.  It was obviously a simpler game but even as someone who played a lot of Goldeneye/Perfect Dark, Halo CE is the game that will forever define what an FPS should be.  And I would say the biggest single thing that made CE so great was the simplicity of the weapons/combat system combined with outstanding physics.  To date, I can't think of any game I've played where the physics were as smooth and rock solid as CE (if unrealistic).permalinksavecontextfull commentsFirestone Walker 16: The Voltron of Beers  by  GuitarOmnivorein  beer[+]faultlessjoint 1 point2 points3 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]faultlessjoint 1 point2 points3 points 22 days agoEver since Firestone Walker started showing up on shelves around here about a year or two ago I've been thoroughly impressed with everything I've tried.I found two of these bad boys at my local beer store last week, I drank one immediately and this one I'm saving for a special occasion (it's phenomenal): http://i.imgur.com/kIkIK.jpgpermalinksavecontextfull commentsCharlie's thoughts on the "Body of Christ."  by  lolyssain  atheism[+]faultlessjoint 4 points5 points6 points 22 days ago (0 children)[]faultlessjoint 4 points5 points6 points 22 days agoWell, so did Dennis, and for all we know Frank and Dee too.

The amount would be tiny and not enough to cause any harm to a person, but let's say you did this 24/7 for the rest of your life (start microwave, open door, rinse and repeat) then you might start seeing some effects.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho is your least favorite player on your team?  by  mack0350in  nfl[+]faultlessjoint 2 points3 points4 points 26 days ago (0 children)[]faultlessjoint 2 points3 points4 points 26 days agoMeh, Clausen has 0 impact on the team at this point.  His responsibility is to hold a clipboard and as far as I can tell he does it exceedingly well.My vote would go to Haruki Nakamura.  I feel like he's a huge liability out there and given what we've seen this year I think Martin should be starting, not him.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho is your least favorite player on your team?  by  mack0350in  nfl[+]faultlessjoint 1 point2 points3 points 26 days ago (0 children)[]faultlessjoint 1 point2 points3 points 26 days agoPersonally, I don't dislike him that much.  He really seemed like a douche at Notre Dame (and I've never liked Notre Dame in the first place) and I was disappointed we drafted him.That said, he hasn't done anything except work hard and do what's asked of him since he got to Carolina.  I think he has a good attitude about being but in a very shitty situation.  His rookie year he was set-up to fail from the start.  Lame duck coach, owner cutting payroll and not signing any FA's in case of potential lock-out, and was never really given a fair shot to succeed.  And then Carolina gets the #1 and Newton bursts on the scene.I think Clausen is still an unknown at this point, and possibly a douche, but he has kept his mouth shut and has done his job thus far.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is there no cat team brotherhood?  by  everydayimlulzinin  nfl[+]faultlessjoint 19 points20 points21 points 27 days ago (0 children)[]faultlessjoint 19 points20 points21 points 27 days agoFrom a couple seasons ago on carolinahuddle (carolina fan site):Crackerjack, Honey Dew, Boom - chicka - Pow!
