American philosopher Klein also played hippie tourist there. Now in old age, he returns with a suitcase of  books. He also has a quest  for happy old age. His guide is the work of the ancient philosopher Epicurus, generally misunderstood as a hedonist. Klein shows we can make the best of what we have.COMEDY Two PintsRoddy DoyleJonathan Cape, $17.95Two Irish mates meet in a bar, men of a certain age facing an uncertain world. Over their pints they discuss current affairs, the family, football and the world. The talk can get very dark, but also very funny. Doyle has a pitch-perfect ear for idiom, making a few words speak volumes. It runs the gamut from Irish realism to the surreal.  Imagine Clarke and Dawe, without the visuals, as two foul-mouthed old Irishmen. For the blokes.CRIME The Black BoxMichael ConnellyAllen & Unwin, $32.99The 16th Harry Bosch book takes our hero down the mean streets of old LA and  back in time. Bosch is assigned a cold case,  a woman killed during the Rodney King riots. She was a freelance photojournalist chasing a story that got her killed? Bosch begins to follow the  leads. One ingredient in the mix appears to be an Australian case; true crime transforming into fiction. As ever with Connelly, sterling stuff.BOOK THAT CHANGED ME: Paullina SimonsIn Cold Blood by Truman CapoteNon-fiction that reads like fiction. A perfect book - not a word wasted,  not a phrase wrong. The gradual reveal of story details, the  development of character, the anatomy of a well-publicised crime that  still manages to be shocking and suspenseful. It is seamless,  significant and beautiful. Capote knew it was a masterpiece when he  finished it. I wish I could spend six years writing one novel. What an  impressive time commitment; what an enviable achievement.Russian-born Paullina Simons lives in the US and is the  best-selling author of nine novels and a cookbook. Her latest novel is Children of Liberty (HarperCollins, $29.99).Tweet      Print StorySaveLatest News Funding boosted for 'carbon and capture' project Killer forced his wayPerfect pupil's next big test - finding a jobMan dies as inflatable raft upturnsClass heroes save lives Editor's Picks Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireFun at the Clunes show.Newlyncouple shocked by truck accident Popular Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeMemories flow of Daylesford's Boathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesFloats needed for DaylesfordNew Years Eve GalaDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireMultimediaGallery: The Boathouse Cafe burns      Gallery: Keele BreenHannah Knight catches up with local artist Keele Breen.
