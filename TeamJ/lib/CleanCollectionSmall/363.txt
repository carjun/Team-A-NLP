Please name the militia you belong to, and direct me to a website where I can see the regulations which define how you were licenced to carry a gun, how often you train, and how you ensure that the gun does not make its way into the hands of the untrained, the unlicenced, the unregulated or the mentally unwell.Reply 11 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate narrativium's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate narrativium's comment.Sign inin reply to Mrblaze0505(Show the comment) All Comments (993)Update automaticallyDisable automatic updatesRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Usercovmeister                22 seconds agoEven trained police and military personnel panic in situations like that.

That's fucking stupid mate. This isn't the fucking matrix. You aren't some top shit cowboy. If a guy bursts into the room and opens fire it could very well be too late for you to do anything. People like you utterly fail to comprehend how intensely chaotic these situations are. The idea that some rambo type will just whip out a gun and kill the bad guys no problem is ridiculous. I don't know whether gun ownership is good or bad but your argument is trash.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate AsmoAD's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate AsmoAD's comment.Sign inin reply to thiscouldntblowmore(Show the comment) RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserTheBobitoman                59 minutes agounfortunately though, the news channels take advantage of it because they will get a spike in their ratings, which unfortunately is more important to them than actually fixing the problem, or at least trying to :(Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate TheBobitoman's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate TheBobitoman's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserYOFACEZ                1 hour agoNothing is inherently wrong with Reddit,people suck everywhere,but how about we shut the fuck up and stay on point with the video hmm?Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate YOFACEZ's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate YOFACEZ's comment.Sign inin reply to Lukorz(Show the comment) RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserGolwar                1 hour agoNope, he only used a form that you aren't familiar with.

I had to endure CNN coverage of the CT shooting for nearly an hour, with no way to change the channel and nowhere else I could sit. In that span of time, CNN broke every single of the guidelines laid out in this video, and they were still doing it when I was finally allowed to leave.
