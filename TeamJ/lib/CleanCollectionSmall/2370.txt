This is so fucking rare. They always just commit suicide and the reasoning stays a mystery. I really want to know how in the world you can get to the point of doing a school shooting. No, I don't want to know it, but what good it is to be in denial? Those things happen way too often and it's not just someone "snapping". There are reasons and maybe ways to prevent it. Maybe. Just makes you feel helpless and at least they can now ask questions now an maybe get (terribly dark and disturbing) answers. I don't even care about punishing the guy. Doesn't undo anything, it's not like they're ever afraid of the sentence. Just want to know why.permalinksaveparent[+]rocketvat 5 points6 points7 points 31 minutes ago (1 child)[]rocketvat 5 points6 points7 points 31 minutes agoThey arrested loughner and the guy who shot up the movie theater.
