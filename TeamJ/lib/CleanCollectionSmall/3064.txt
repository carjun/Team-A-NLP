Lifestyle she can't predict who'll take the sporting accoladeBy Nicola McCafferty | Yahoo LifestyleFri, Dec 14, 2012 17:52 GMTJessica Ennis is preparing to go head-to-head with some of the biggest sporting talent for the crown of BBC Sports Personality of the Year this weekend.The gold medal winning heptathlete is going up against the likes of Sir Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins, Sarah Storey and Mo Farah for the coveted title this Sunday.Jessica Ennis said even she can't predict who'll win BBC Sports Personality of the YearBut while she became the poster girl of the Olympics 2012, Jess admits even she can't predict who will take the title this weekend."I honestly couldn't choose who I'd like to win," she told us. "Everyone [has] had amazing years and achieved so much. [Related: Jess Ennis reveals her body hang ups in new interview]"[We've all had] different journeys or paths for whatever [we've] achieved, so its really to hard to pick one person ahead of anyone else."Instead, the world's finest all-round female athlete will just be trying to take the whole evening in.She grinned: "Ill be there just enjoying my evening and itll be a lovely surprise to see who wins!"Jessica Ennis revealed she's happy to be a healthy role model for young women RexThe 26-year-old has got good reason to sit back and take it all in too. This year we've seen Jess cement herself as one of the greatest female athletes in history, shrugging off immense public pressure to take the gold in her event.She'd be forgiven for relaxing her gruelling training schedule after achieving her dream, but - ever the focused athlete - Jess says there's always a new goal on the horizon to be working towards.[Related: Jessica Ennis earns her fashion title in dazzling Alexander McQueen dress]"As an athlete, theres always a championship - theres always a big goal that youre focused on," she told Yahoo! Lifestyle."When you take time off you do see differences in your body, which everyone else probably wouldnt notice, but you do in yourself. "You feel a bit softer in places. And that, as an athlete, makes you want to get back into and push yourself again."She added: "Your body is your tool at the end of the day and it needs to be in a certain shape and condition for it to perform at its best."So what keeps her motivated when she's already won a gold medal?"I find it really hard to motivate myself," she admitted."But I always think about the benefits I'm going to get. Once you're in a routine its so much easier because you just keep going and going. The gold medal winning heptathlete is up against the likes of Bradley Wiggins and Mo Farah for BBC Sports Personality"But when you stop and have a break your body gets used to that, then when you start back its even harder. I suppose I just motivate myself by thinking if I just push a bit harder then I'll see big changes."Like the rest of us, Jess finds it hard to get up and go in the cold too: "I know its hard [to train in winter]. I find it hard when its raining and I just dont want to get out and do hill runs."Jess explained that having a goal, whether it's a gold at the Olympics or just to run a 5K, is something we all need."For a normal person just training, its always good to have a goal  whatever that might be. Whether its a half marathon or something youre working towards."The 26-year-old might have had the eyes of the nation - and the world - on her this year, but she said she wouldn't have changed a moment of it."It was such a build up to the Olympics and there was so much pressure on me," she told us. [Related: Jessica Ennis shows off her toned figure at Cosmopolitan Women of the Year Awards]"But I wouldnt have changed anything. The whole build up was brilliant. Jessica Ennis achieved a goal of a lifetime at the Olympics 2012"But when you actually achieve your goal or your dream, its such a strange feeling. I always feel like I'm pushing and I can nearly touch it, but I'me not quite there. "So it was a really strange feeling to have actually have done it. It just felt really different. It was hard to put it into words."Naturally, Jess felt a sense of relief when the Olympics were over.She explained: "Not [having that] feeling like I have to train right now or I'm going to let myself down and the whole country down, [is great]. "Since the Olympics, I've been able to do different things and meet different people. Just things that I never thought Id have the opportunity to do."The British athlete's excellence aside, Jess has become a role model for young women around the world.Displaying her uber-toned physique in her sports kit on the track and field at the Games, Jess' ripped abs took up almost as many column inches as her achievements.And for Jess, putting out a different, healthier image to younger generations is of huge importance."Sport has been pushed into the forefronts of everyone's minds this year," she said. "And its nice that I've had the opportunity to do some great photoshoots and be on the cover of fashion magazines which never really happens that much. "Its a great opportunity to put a different image out there for girls to aspire to want to be like, which is a really healthy figure."There's no chance of Jess, whose training regimen will continue right through Christmas, will be worrying about losing weight as a result of all the press she's getting either.She told us that she's completely focused on eating right and keeping on top of her training."I suppose I dont feel that much pressure because this is how I look because of how I train," she explained."I'm not on a really strict diet; I just train hard and eat healthy and do all the right things."Jess Ennis is #allin wearing the new adidas womens spring summer collection available at adidas.com from January 2013. @YLifestyleUK on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook  All Comments                        110 commentsPopular NowNewestOldestMost Repliedv1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355646268850-151cd5b9-a481-42b7-8329-542063b93a27Rectal Feedback12 hours agoThe less she dresses herself up, the fitter she looks.v1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355638905059-fea6f886-7f32-40a0-a59a-e569028a5519mike14 hours agomy pin up girl shes beautiful ,keep up the great work jessv1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355680483964-a245342c-cef9-46b6-b1b8-b62327edc055Haug2 hours 59 minutes agoGot to be the strongest field yet - any one of them could have won in previous years.v1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355605244917-a2d37303-4c29-4372-9ae3-9c59e8351c63Nigel23 hours agoShe has the best body by far, but I think Bradley should win, sorry Jessv1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355565959649-e06494fe-2ab2-48ef-a64b-5f16d8ae0074Darl Idiot1 day 10 hours agoshelly ann fraser pryce , all the way ,  she has it all .  looks , colour , personality , voice , hair , lips , eyes , leg , butt .   everything !!  a real smart wise sexy beautiful lady !!  the best on the planetv1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355572215259-58e2cb5b-d5c1-4a47-9813-9f8568e22c3bHenry1 day 9 hours ago"You feel a bit softer in places.

I doubt once you get to the Olympics the pressure can be much more. I didn't give you a thumbs down though and am not too bothered who wins it. If i had to choose though would go for Ben Ainslie as watching him race was enjoyable.

I hope not...Sorry, I won't be watching...I was one of the few who avoided the Olympics when they happened. They are no longer as I believed they were as I was growing up.v1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355567630862-5cc596ed-314b-421d-bb70-c21b5decae47Jeffrey1 day 10 hours agoI'm still bemused that somebody actually called her FAT - perhaps they were talking about another Jessica Ennis?In fact she IS on a strict diet, just one of healthy eating whereas most people think of a diet being a slimming diet.Not a huge sports fan but the girl did well, Wiggo's achievement was impressive but he had a huge amount of team and financial support whereas Ms Ennis was slogging her heart out on some soggy English sportsground - hope she adds this award to her mantlepiece.v1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355673061680-f1c4f9d2-e8b9-4ae3-910c-4744ecd481abROBERT5 hours agogreat girl , great talent , but what's with those dreadful yellow leggins . ughhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!v1/comments/context/2c0793b0-9a86-3a85-90cc-b07b055b9907/comment/1355681833158-0317a0a1-d03e-4153-9c1c-26e735bdaf3eAnthony2 hours 36 minutes agoIf I had been involved in the Olympics I would have kept as far away from any politician and certainly would not have wanted to have my medal given to me by them either. If I'd no choice I would've had to say something later. It was especially galling during the Paralympics and also having Atos involved with the sponsorship of the event too.
