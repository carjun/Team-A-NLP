Does that matter?It surely makes a difference in the amount of adrenaline when you don't feel threatened enough to start point shooting as soon as you can.Worst case scenarios aren't realistic. The odds of them happening don't justify what I'd want to carry for them.If I was of slight build or had an infirmity, I'd certainly not feel obliged to carry a full size, high capacity auto-loader for the reasons you stated. My philosophy is that we should each carry as much as we can handle. I can't go about my normal life carrying a .308 bullpup...but I can carry a Glock 20, so I will. I'd carry one of the 29rd mags if it wouldn't look like I'm shoplifting.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNever could understand why someone would choose a 1911 over a new polymer hi cap..

I'd carry a Keltec RFB if I could acquire one, get it to run right, conceal it, & not get a major friction rash from doing so.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm not getting that bonus, am I?  by  Coryheroin  Eve[+]PacoBedejo 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]PacoBedejo 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago"Oh, is that how it works. Ok, let's dance."^ This so muchI finally understood this when my small mining corp got war-dec'd & I got blowed up. I spent the next 2 weeks mercilessly hunting those guys with my then 3.5m SP. I managed to collect 7 of their frozen corpses...3 from the CEO.This was back under 2004 rules; My favorite kill was when the CEO undocked from a vertical-tube Amarr station in a 0.4 system...and I was sitting 155km away in my Caracal. I insta-locked & lobbed my (then-AOE) torpedoes at him. Just before he aligned...POP insta-podkill.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm not getting that bonus, am I?  by  Coryheroin  Eve[+]PacoBedejo 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]PacoBedejo 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoThe only ship-loss I ever lost my shit about was back in 2004. I lost my Moa while mining because I shot a missile at an incoming 'rat...and the missile hit an empty shuttle someone had parked in the belt...which just happened to be precisely between me & the 'rat. CONCORD stomped my ass.Yeah...I'm pretty glad they got rid of missile collision...permalinksavecontextfull commentsNever could understand why someone would choose a 1911 over a new polymer hi cap..

Otherwise, go big & shoot until they stop. Personally, I'll keep my Glock 20 & its 15+1 rounds of 180gr JHP @ 1300fps.A question for you to ponder: Do our soldiers generally carry rifles that shoot high power rifle cartridges or do they carry carbines that shoot low power carbine cartridges & carry more ammo?permalinksavecontextfull commentsNever could understand why someone would choose a 1911 over a new polymer hi cap..
