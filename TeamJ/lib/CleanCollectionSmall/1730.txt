Call them delusional, temporarily insane, enraged, whatever you want, but whatever they are isn't healthy or normal; and it should be addressed before 26 people die.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDeadly elementary shooting in Conneticut - 26 dead, 18 of which are children  by  DrGreenKarmain  videos[+]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoYes you do, but the ultimate goal is to reduce the number of murders, not get rid of guns, remember that.If a sudden ban on firearms were to take effect, you would have a period of time where there would be a drastic increase in violence, and possibly civil conflict (It sounds like hyperbole, but there are many, many conservative gun owners that wouldn't give them up quietly, enough to be concerning). This could roll over relatively quickly, or it could be prolonged. I'm leaning toward it being a drawn out affair, at least until the older generation dies off and a new generation that grows up without firearms takes hold. Either way, you've directly contradicted your chief goal of reducing murders, being the cause of millions of unnecessary deaths because you wanted to take the direct, poorly thought out approach. You also failed to address the true causes of violence: socio-economic issues and mental health problems. Way to go, ass-hole.Since strict gun regulation is off the table (at least for the time being), you're left with the actual issues at hand. Why don't we start with making healthcare accessible and affordable for everyone, especially the poor, disabled, and mentally ill. Once that starts to fall in to place, we can work on early detection of mental illness and prevention of worsening conditions. Wouldn't ya know? We just so happened to be working on that right now. It's going slower than anyone would like, but it's getting there.The second thing to do (and this can and should occur simultaneously with the first) is redefine what it means to be mentally ill. The stigma against it needs to go away for people to be able to talk about it, and people need to  realize what a problem it can be. Thirdly, violence is almost praised here in the US, and sex has a greater stigma than violence. That will have to change as well, and it is, albeit slowly. That will have to be an effort put forth by both the populus and popular media.If the people of the United States want to see a reduction in the number of lives lost due to violence, it has a lot of work to do, and multiple angles that it simultaneously needs to attack from. There is, however, no place in this situation for knee-jerk reactions, which could very likely make the situation much worse.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDeadly elementary shooting in Conneticut - 26 dead, 18 of which are children  by  DrGreenKarmain  videos[+]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoDepends. "Mentally ill," isn't one single condition or degree of illness. Lots of fucked up people kill for the recognition. Look at Timothy McVeigh, Charles Manson, and many other high-profile murderers/rapists/all-around-fucked-up-people.I'd say that in most cases, yes they would be aware to some degree and would care about the infamy.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDeadly elementary shooting in Conneticut - 26 dead, 18 of which are children  by  DrGreenKarmain  videos[+]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoWhile I am all for the unhindered exchange of firearms among well-intentioned and responsible people, this is an oversimplified, extreme, and foolish suggestion. Not everyone who is responsible enough to own one necessarily desires to, and would make society no more or less safe. Furthermore, just like with stricter forms of gun regulation, you have to define who is and is not responsible, which is a difficult task. Now you can give any definition you want, but no single definition can weed out every possible risk without unnecessarily infringing on second amendment rights. There is no way to tell if someone deemed responsible enough to own a gun at 21 will eventually develop schizophrenia, alzheimer's or manic depression. There is no way to tell, no matter how stringent the application process, whether or not someone is capable of murder. Murderers, themselves, often didn't know beforehand that they were capable of doing what they did in a fit of rage. Defining "responsibility" beyond very basic things like, "are they currently mentally stable," or "are they prior felons," is a fool's game.Maybe, in stead, we should set up a system in which troubled people can be recognized early on and receive help. Society should stop the problem at it's source rather than arm everyone to the teeth in hopes that someone will take down a shooter before the shooter kills too many people. Granted, it's not the most straightforward solution, but it's a whole lot better than band-aid solutions like banning all privately owned firearms or arming everyone.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGoing to a nice restaurant tomorrow, am hopelessly clueless when it comes to wine.

Also, you'd be amazed at how many common misconceptions doctors believe in. They may be very well educated, but they're not infallible; and even the most well-intentioned MD can be misled. They have tens of thousands of things they're required to know, so I'd be willing to let something relatively minor like that slide :Ppermalinksavecontextfull commentsGoing to a nice restaurant tomorrow, am hopelessly clueless when it comes to wine.

Help me pick something?  by  slidewithmein  wine[+]ladut 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]ladut 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours agoI want to clear something up: whether or not you have a sensitivity to sulfites (which are different than sulfa drugs or other sulfur containing compounds) I don't know, but if you were sensitive, you would have a worse reaction to white wines and sweet wines than you would reds. You would also not be able to eat dried fruit, many condiments, or most pre-made baked goods among other things, because they can contain much higher levels of sulfites than wine. Red wines contain lower levels of sulfites than whites because certain compounds found in grape skins act as antioxidants and preservatives, which whites do not contain. People who get "red wine headaches," are often sensitive to tannins (that only exist in reds) or histamines (which are in higher concentrations in reds). Sulfite allergies are exceedingly rare, while most people will react to sufficient levels of histamines. You also can't rule out the fact that many people, hearing about sulfites in wine, experience a placebo-like reaction.It's an extremely common misunderstanding that's propagated by alternative health circles and older ladies that think that if they read it on the internet it must be true, but it's mostly all bunk. Forgive the not-so-polite guy below me: you see, people involved with the wine industry have to explain this to people, often daily; and it can get frustrating, especially for those who would rather blatantly ignore you, the informed wine expert, in favor of what some ill-informed health blogger ranted about once.To answer your question, though, salmon can go with quite a few things depending on how it's seasoned. All of the foods you mentioned are going to have some buttery/oily qualities to them, so something kind of acidic like Sauvignon Blanc (I would avoid New Zealand, though, the grassy flavor might conflict), a Pinot Noir (California or Oregon), or even some Chardonnays. The acidity will help to cut through the oiliness, which will prevent your palate from getting heavy and gunked up (so to speak). The buttery flavors in the Chardonnay will actually accentuate the buttery flavor in the chanterelles and what not without adding to the oily textured mouthfeel. The Pinot Noir can add to the meatiness of the salmon and the savory, earthy character of the chanterelles.Go with the Chardonnay if you want rich and savory, go with the Sauv Blanc if you think the meal will be too heavy for your liking and you want to lighten it up (or if they are using citrus to season the salmon, that would be delicious). Go with the Pinot if you really like mushrooms and umami. And don't be afraid to ask the waiter or sommelier. Tell them what you're looking for, they know the wine list better than any of us would.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReview #3: Blue Label  by  aureliusantoninusin  Scotch[+]ladut 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]ladut 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoTIL that the liquor store monopolizing Bloomington, IN caters to cheap boozers at the expense of higher end stuff.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I got my start in wine, and that's where my heart is at (I've been in the industry for about two years now), but I've dabbled in beer and bourbon, and have developed a recent interest in scotch. There are so many parallels between different drinks/spirits, and I want to try it all.Having said that, I'm still working my way through college, so a $60 bottle of decent booze is a really big commitment to make. That's why I suggested splitting a bottle.Did you mean to say that there is a bottle of JWB at Big Red Liquors, or were you just excited about it existing and had to mention it? Cause if it's in town here, I would be more than willing to do the same thing as I suggested for the JW Blue.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you're a man and you shake hands like this, I hate you.  by  skitt123in  pics[+]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI've found that people that give firm handshakes do so to portray confidence and power. Not that that is a bad thing, but in certain circumstances it's excessive and showy. People don't usually like a person who flaunts their position in society, especially so in casual or strictly social settings.I've actually known many brilliant and wise people who don't have a particularly firm handshake. Many professors, clergymen, and intellectuals that I've met don't want to put off people, they don't want to intimidate students/parishoners who may be timid or meek. Timid people by no means are "dicks and cunts" for being what they are, and anyone who goes out of their way to make them feel comfortable, especially if it's an important part of their profession to do so are good in my book.For business people and politicians, where it's important to display confidence, sure; but there is no reason to think that this display of dominance should be applied to every social situation. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReview #3: Blue Label  by  aureliusantoninusin  Scotch[+]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ladut 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoHmmm...
