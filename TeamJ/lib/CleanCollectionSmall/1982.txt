Also, when watching porn a lot of men like the idea of the woman(/women) in the videos/pictures being these very lusty and sex craving women who can't wait to take a mouthful of (let's edit this out) - and having massive silicone implants is a visual way of conveying being of this mentality. Some would suggest that breast feeding plays in as well. That we are wired to react to large breasts either due to some primal in born instinct or a mental remnant from when we were infants.While big breasts certainly can be nice, some fail to realize that small breasts can be equally nice. The thing is, we generally just like the female body. A lot. Sure, some will have preferences, but for most - and I remind you that this is just my personal experience, based on my own and my friends' reactions - it's a package thing. Personally, I'm more of an eye-guy. Nothing beats gorgeous eyes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf penis size doesn't matter then why are dildos always so big?  by  briroberin  AskReddit[+]Avista 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]Avista 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoThey could have done without the "mini"... :-(permalinksavecontextfull commentsScumbag Fox News hypocrisy at its worst  by  omegasnake07in  AdviceAnimals[+]Avista 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]Avista 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours agoOh for fucks sake, please stop arguing like this.

It's vital to note, that these people rarely fall under the category of everyday criminals. Yes, "Criminals" will obtain illegal weaponry due to their ties with the criminal environment, but I very much doubt that these mass shooters would, had guns not been available elsewhere. This is as much speculation as your comment it, mind you. But, maybe one should compare with nations that can be considered Americas peers, instead of just guesstimating? I'm not going to, but someone sure should, if they are to keep presenting the argument that people will get a hold of guns no matter what. Had heavy firearms (semi automatic and up) been available only in the criminal underbelly of America and bolt-action firearms been the only legally obtainable firearm, the situation might be entirely different. Guns are built to kill, semi- and full-automatic are built to kill a lot. Who knows, maybe the gunman would have settled with killing his family members? permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
