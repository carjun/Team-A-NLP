Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]nothis 5 points6 points7 points 44 minutes ago (0 children)[]nothis 5 points6 points7 points 44 minutes agoIt seems they arrested one. This is so fucking rare. They always just commit suicide and the reasoning stays a mystery. I really want to know how in the world you can get to the point of doing a school shooting. No, I don't want to know it, but what good it is to be in denial? Those things happen way too often and it's not just someone "snapping". There are reasons and maybe ways to prevent it. Maybe. Just makes you feel helpless and at least they can now ask questions now an maybe get (terribly dark and disturbing) answers. I don't even care about punishing the guy. Doesn't undo anything, it's not like they're ever afraid of the sentence. Just want to know why.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

"The Xbox sales situation has become severe," Microsoft's director of business development, Par Singh, reportedly said during a company meeting reported by Nikkei Keizai Shimbun. "Regrettably, an early retirement program has been instituted. Please return to your desks and check your email for a letter from the Personnel Department. If you receive one, follow the instructions immediately." This was the way of the west, not the way of Japan.That's kind of a cowardly and asshole way in general. I'm from Europe and we say the very same thing about US companies opening branches here. People avoid going there, often leave with a middle finger pointed towards their former boss and a swear to never work in a US run company again. "Please return to your desks and check your email for a letter from the Personnel Department." Wow.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy Xbox failed in Japan  by  TargetSin  Games[+]nothis 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]nothis 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoThe Japanese are incredibly polite racists. Sad but true. In a way, I don't mind because that's how they assholed their way into becoming the only non-Westernized yet equally rich and modern society on earth, which is just plain interesting.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy Xbox failed in Japan  by  TargetSin  Games[+]nothis 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]nothis 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago"Xbox is a cocky company."Heh, finally they admit it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBIOSHOCK INFINITE: Ken Levine Discusses Columbia, Elizabeth, and Religion - Part 1 - YouTube  by  catfishguyin  Games[+]nothis 2 points3 points4 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]nothis 2 points3 points4 points 3 hours agoYes, Adam Sessler.

New Deals everyday!  by  rockstarfruitpunchin  Games[+]nothis 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]nothis 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoWhy are they so scared of -75%+ deals (I know there's one or two, but very few)? I'll be honest: Those games or rather those licenses aren't worth 10 bucks for me. Not even 5. I own all of the games I really care about on their site, with the original box and whatnot. They basically give me a way to download them online instead of installing from disc and pre-package them with a few patches (many of which I could track down myself or find alternatives). For $5, I can get a brand new indie game, a 2 year old AAA game on Steam, etc, etc. I know it's not much for an individual game but the whole appeal of digital distribution, to me, is to build up an easily accessible library, I'd either buy nearly their entire catalog (too expensive) or nothing at all.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHomeworld meets Rainbow 6 in new indie game from ex-Bungie Dev.  by  marmite22in  Games[+]nothis 47 points48 points49 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]nothis 47 points48 points49 points 1 day agoNote how this "renaissance" does well without any support whatsoever by AAA studios.
