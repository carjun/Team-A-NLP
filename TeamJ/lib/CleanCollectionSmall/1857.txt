How, exactly, is Mass Effect responsible for today's shooting?  by  superfiedmanin  gaming[+]Sn1pe 2 points3 points4 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]Sn1pe 2 points3 points4 points 16 hours agoI hope really I'll be saying this in the distant future:Grandson: "Grandpa, why do you still play games on the TV with that obsolete Playstation 3? You should get with the times and play some Matrix. You basically connect the game to your brain, and wam, your in a different world."Me: "Grandson, let me show you a few movies that this gaming system was based off of. Then you'll see why I play with this old system."After watching all 3 moviesGrandson: "Oh your funny Grandpa. That'll never happen. They've made sure it wouldn't get to that point."Me: "Oh really? Let me show you another movie (Surrogates)."I wonder if we will in fact get to that point in gaming/tech wise or if I'll keep my PS3 at that age. If nursing homes are still a thing in the future, I could kind of see myself playing the would be then ancient system. Maybe some of my "neighbors" and I would share stories of the days of old where people trashed talked others over microphones or always had this war between which console would be better.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Sandy Hook Elementary murders will be covered on the news for weeks to come.

Maybe it was just that the emulator hadn't supported the latest iOS of that time, which was 5.1.1.Anyway, pretty awesome that you got to meet and sell something to him.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre any of the area theaters showing The Hobbit in HFR Imax 3d?  by  HeegeMcGeein  StLouis[+]Sn1pe 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Sn1pe 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoWell, I've seen advertisements at that theater of the Hobbit.
