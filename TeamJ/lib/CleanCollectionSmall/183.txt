On Monday, the 6th grader pulled a .22 caliber pistol out of his book bag during recess and aimed it at another student, threatening to kill her.The 11-year-old was immediately disarmed by teachers and whisked away to the principal's office. Though the police were called, there was no lockdown and school administrators say the entire ordeal was over in 30-to-45 seconds. However, some parents feel that the school didn't do enough to guarantee safety for their children."There was no lockdown. No one was called. Nothing was done. And then we had to hear it from our kids," said understandably concerned parent John Klaus. Yesterday, some parents elected to keep their children home as a safety precaution.As an investigation continues, police will look into the accuracy of the boy's statement about being given the weapon by his parents. He's been turned over to a juvenile hall and could face criminal charges, as well as expulsion.[via Gawker]Tags: kearns-utah, west-kearns-elementary-school, gunPin ItRelated Articles:MTA Approves Fare Increase34 minutes agoRihanna Purchases New L.A.
