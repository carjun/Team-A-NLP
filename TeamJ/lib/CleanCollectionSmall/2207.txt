My second Harley fxrg jacket. The first saved my everything when a deer jumped into me. I also have Harley riding pants, And 2 pairs of fxrg gloves. All of the gear is waterproof textile and armored. I'm just not into leather and chaps. Every Christmas and birthday I get harley T-shirts and harley gift cards, it's real easy to end up decked out in Harley gear.  I have also discovered their jeans are cut a little differently so that they don't ride up over the boots while riding, and this is what I use gift cards on because I always need new jeans. I'm prone to climbing under a truck or on a roof to help a buddy in whatever I'm wearing at the time. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAtheist billboard vandalized within three days of being put up.  by  MadeFromMetalin  atheism[+]itsokimaplumber 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]itsokimaplumber 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoWhy do Christians? permalinksavecontextfull commentsAwesome drawing my cousin did with a blue ball point pen.  by  Gr8gigInTheSkyin  pics[+]itsokimaplumber 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]itsokimaplumber 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours agoIn the thread there's a link to a "Drawing Anatomy for the artist" book.
