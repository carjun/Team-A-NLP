Emotional reactions can hinder rational problem solving. Being too rational dampens our humanity. It's a balancing act, and people can walk the wire in many different ways. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Some other guy was saying that frac aka Completions is less stressful than wireline. It's probably less bonus too. So you have to decide. Do you want to be responsible for a rigsite operation for up to 48 hrs at a time or do you just want a steady well paying job with consistent shifts. That's the best comparison. For the record I don't think Wireline in the US offers good pay, but they do have a 2 weeks on 1 week off rotation that some engineers really love.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny Field Engineers in Oil & Gas?  by  tek9in  engineering[+]merper 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]merper 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago*There was no push to one division or another when I joined. They had us just pick at the interview. D&M is growing too - essentially cannibalizing a lot of wireline as the measurement tools get more sophisticated - so I find it tough to imagine it being much more difficult to get into. Keep in mind that in D&M your bonus is paid by days on rig site. Wireline gets 1-2% of the job ticket. In many locations there may often be a $1-2 million job. I was in the Middle East making 6-9K each month as a new engineer with only a 15% tax rate. permalinksavecontextfull comments10012Looking for some insight on working in the Solar industry.

What segment you go into depends on your personality. Field engineering in most parts of the world is a rough lifestyle, but for different segments it's rough in different ways. Drilling(often Drilling and Measurment or D&M these days) can spend more than a month living in a box on a rig just monitoring their operation, but the stress level is lower and smoother with less severe peaks. Wireline is in and out within a few days or a week for the most part, and is much higher intensity. I can't speak to the other segments, but Mud seems a bit less intense, and Fracking and Completions tend to be much larger operations which may or may not diffuse the heat.  I may be biased but Wireline tends to be more  independent in that you assume control of the operation from the moment it lands on your desk to the moment you pull out your tools and turn in the log. There's a lot more analysis and knowledge you need and a lot more leadership training you get to handle the job. Wireline training takes about 4 months to complete, and you are basically working nonstop at school the whole time. D & M finishes in 2 months and have a much more relaxed time in school. The other segments finish even faster. I believe Fracking and D & M are growing faster than wireline at this point, so it may be worth going into that for future prospects. As for companies, the ranking in perception is generally Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes. I haven't worked at all the companies so I can't offer a fair comparison, but if you want to work in field certainly try to go for Schlumberger.Edit: To add to what Sonny said, you will be lifting in Wireline, so keep that in mind. I got injured from lifting, and I've seen people lose their backs over it on rare occasion. He's also right that it is mostly a dumb job. Your brains are only required at school and when things go wrong, otherwise they wither from disuse and the long hours. I've been up 36hrs commonly for a job, and at times up to 55 hrs. The lifestyle is why I left field. The money will quickly get into six figures after you finish training, but it's simply not worth it. Computer engineers easily break six figures without the hard labor.permalinksavecontextfull comments14012Looking for some insight on working in the Solar Industry.

I have been wanting to work in solar for some time. I have an offer now and while the pay cut hurts( i work in petroleum now...) the real concern for me is opportunity for growth in the industry. It seems like there is a glut of laid off professionals with sometimes 5 to 10 years of quals from bust companies. If you think you may join them next year what is your exit strategy? Do you plan to stay in the industry or do you intend to leave?  I am also a mech e which adds to the hesitation.

Also, with inflation, $9000 is probably going to be around an average wage in 30-40 years. Of course this also means that 1.5 million isn't so hard to get if you save starting early. Using this calc if you save just 10k in your IRA and 401K and grow it at just over 5% for 40 years you will have 1.5 million. Then again, it will only be worth about $450k in current dollars. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIAm Guy Kawasaki, father, speaker, author of APE: Author, Publisher, Entrepreneur, and former chief evangelist of Apple  by  Guy_Kawasakiin  IAmA[+]merper 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]merper 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoGuy, I'm a 27 year old engineer trying to pick between two jobs offers right now. One is in the renewable energy industry I love in a company that is just about to IPO, but is very low paying, entry level and unchallenging design work. The other is in a mature industry that I don't have much interest in, but pays 50-60% higher and is more challenging theoretical design. Which one would you pick? Oh, just to add a 3rd option, my current position is in a lucrative industry that I don't like and is primarily related to testing which I don't enjoy, but pays just a bit less than the 2nd position.permalinksavecontextfull commentssrsh explains where people go when they "drop out of the labor force."  by  arch4nonin  bestof[+]merper 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]merper 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoIn CS, no less.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhenever I bring this up on Reddit, people always ask a lot of questions.
