blog.reddit -- what's new on reddit: POTUS IAMA Statsskip to main  |      skip to sidebarFriday, August 31, 2012POTUS IAMA StatsPosted bythe reddit adminsat12:35|Labels:AMA,iama,interviews,not bad,obamaWithout any fanfare ahead of time, The President of the United States spent 30 minutes answering questions from anonymous users with no mediation on a website run by 20 people, and in a forum that was organically created by volunteers. Tens of thousands of people actively participated by voting and/or commenting and millions watched, and The President even broke some news in the Q & A (by suggesting a new amendment for the first time). Did it go perfectly smooth? Nope. Is this the absolute perfect format for politicians to answer questions? Nope. But it worked, and it was a big step, not just for reddit, but for online communities everywhere. No matter how you feel about the IAMA, reddit, the President, or politics in general, we hope that what took place this past Wednesday will inspire other online communities and start-ups, and encourage other politicians to seek out more ways to talk directly with their constituents. We thank the President and his team for making this happen.Key figures from the IAMA:2,987,307 pageviews on the day of5,280,441  pageviews so far in total (as of 9 AM PT 8/31 -- not accounting for stats lag).In the first five minutes, there were 37 comments. By the ten minute mark, redditors had made 278 comments. Within half an hour that number jumped to 5,266 and was over 10,000 by the end of the first hour.The only link in recorded history to have surpassed the front page.At any given time, the front page of reddit (http://www.reddit.com) has around 15-20% of active visitors. An extremely popular submission may have 2-5% of visitors at any given time. In the recorded history of reddit, weve never had one single submission get more visitors than the front page at any given time, until the Obama IAMA. The Obama IAMA received over 30% of all visitors to reddit at its peak./u/PresidentObamaThe Presidents account was given 5 years, 9 months of reddit gold! (Suppose someone will have to figure out how to declare virtual gifts if they havent already).PresidentObama's user pagereceived 428,004 pageviews on the day of the IAMA.As many speculated, the username /u/PresidentObama was not actually publicly available. That user deleted their account a while ago, so when this event arose, we made the username available for the President. If you are not a current or former head of state, dont ask us for a deleted username.The whole siteThere were 865,092 unique visits during the first hour after the IAMA began -- up from 518,312 before it started. At peak, Google Analytics showed 198,000 active concurrent visitors. At the peak of the IAMA reddit was receiving over 100,000 pageviews per minute.Map of Barack Obama AMA traffic by City and Hour - August 29th 2012Technical bitsIn preparation for the IAMA, we initially added 30 dedicated servers (20%~ increase) just for the comment thread. This turned out not to be enough, so we added another 30 dedicated servers to the mix. At peak, we were transferring 48 MB per second of reddit to the internet. This much traffic overwhelmed our load balancers which caused a lot of the slowness you probably experienced on reddit.This IAMA gave us a lot of information on what we need to do next not only to handle the next megathread on reddit, but also to make reddit faster in general. Were going to redesign our load balancer system to be more flexible under this kind of load, and weve got a bunch of things we need to do to make our code more efficient for giant comment threads. Both of these improvements should make day-to-day reddit use faster as well.discuss this post on redditNewer PostOlder PostHomethe reddit blogKeep up with the latest development updates, community announcements, and general reddit tomfoolery.Blog Archive2012(30)          December(1)          November(1)          October(1)          September(3)August(3)POTUS IAMA StatsNew Fundraising Options Designed Just for redditor...University of reddit - Explore any subject that in...
