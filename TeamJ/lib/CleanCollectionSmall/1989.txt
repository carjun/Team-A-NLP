We aren't defined by our worst when most of us are fighting, or at least hoping, for decency and kindness.Edit: I'm not talking about those who suffer from mental illness, I'm talking about those who malevolently inflict pain on others. To me, that is a sick person. I'm not talking about depressed people, or bipolar people, etc.permalinksaveparent[+]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (8 children)[]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoThere is not really any such thing as a broken mind. Humans are each born individuals with individual brains. The way someone's brain functions (free of disease or physical damage) is just the way they are as an organism. It's the same with any living, thinking creature. It will never end because genetic diversity dictates that people with this type of mind will be born no matter what you try to do to prevent it. It's hardwired into them. The only thing we can do is separate them from society, from those of us who were born with our minds similar enough that we were able to make values, laws, and culture. These individual organisms that stray from that pattern are forced out either through prison or death. If you're scientifically minded, you'll accept that this was a course of nature, and that it's going to happen anyways. If you belong to one of many major religions, you probably believe that a higher deity has set this course and that it is again out of your hands. I know this isn't much to say for those dead, but what I want to convey is that this type of thing will continue to happen because that's how the world turns. permalinksaveparent[+]0ab83a7b 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]0ab83a7b 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoIn other words, Honey Nature don't give a fuck.permalinksaveparent[+]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoIndeed. It's the same as how some people are born stronger, some people are born more sociable, some people are born with high metabolisms, some people are born athletes, scholars, cowards, etc. These are all just variations of human beings that have branched out within the entirety of humanity. Some of these people, unfortunately, are born hostile. permalinksaveparent[+]RenlyIsAHomo 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (5 children)[]RenlyIsAHomo 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoAs a depressive person (with no violent tendencies so far) your comment makes me feel like offing myself is the right thing to do.permalinksaveparent[+]cdskip 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]cdskip 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoIt isn't. Depressive doesn't mean violent. Violent doesn't mean depressive. And maybe most importantly, depressive now doesn't have to mean depressive forever.Get counseling. Get drugs if they're warranted. Don't kill yourself because of misguided fear that you'll do something monstrous.permalinksaveparent[+]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoIf your depression is caused by a chemical imbalance, like many who are clinically depressed, then that is a ailment. That is a malfunction in your brain.Otherwise, you're still a human being. Like I said, we shun people who are different without the understanding that it is simply how they are made. If their hard-wiring causes damage or harm to society, then they isolate them. With someone who is depressed with no violent tendencies, all we can do is accept you. That's who you are because of a course of nature. It's nothing anyone did wrong, it's nothing that we can control. If you think you'll be a danger later down the road, go ahead and speak out about it. Specialists within society are trained just to work with those who are born outside of our standardized norms. Just remember that humanity is many individual organisms that make up a single biomass. We are still humanity, no matter where the individuals may branch out to. permalinksaveparent[+]pissoutofmyass 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (1 child)[]pissoutofmyass 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoWe do have medication meant to treat depression, some of which works very well.permalinksaveparent[+]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (0 children)[]RuTsui 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoRight, because clinical depression is a chemical imbalance. That's actually an ailment. This doesn't fall in line with biological individuality. It can happen to anyone, even those born within our social norms. Depression can be treated. Being naturally more violent can't be, that's the difference between biodiversity and an actual, mental problem. permalinksaveparent[+]pissoutofmyass 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago*(0 children)[]pissoutofmyass 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago*That is not at all what I meant.

In other words, mental illness may afflict a great proportion of "sick" people, but mentally ill people are not generally "sick" in the way I defined the term. Most mental illness is internalized suffering.permalinksaveparent[+]spencer102 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]spencer102 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoI meant it in the reverse.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
