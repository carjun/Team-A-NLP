But the good news about the agency couldnt last very long. Tuesday saw the release of the long awaited report reviewing the agencys police force activities on New Years Eve this year, the night 22 year old Oscar Grant was killed on the Fruitvale BART platform by a BART policeman. The report offers a pretty universal condemnation of the BART police force practices, calling the response to the incidents that night seriously deficient.The report finds failures at every step in the process, from the manual (parts of which have not been updated in over 30 years) to the activities of BART police on the night in question (what procedures were in place were basically completely ignored).Some highlights:In spite of the rapidly escalating nature of this situation that was evident on the radio, there were no BART PD supervisors on-scene. The escalation of the incident should have prompted a response by supervises to assume command and control of this situation. BART PD provided no documentation that spoke to the expectations of supervision to establish on-scene command and control of such incident. Plainly put, the expectation of supervision must be that they respond to tactical events, assume command of those events and assert field level control. In this case, an experienced supervisor would have proven invaluable in controlling the scene, managing resources, directing the force actions by officers, etc. Instead, the situation had no apparent leadership.andThe tactical concepts of work as a team, stay together and contact-cover are well known to law enforcement. There was minimal evidence of these concepts being applied during the New Years Day incident. BART PD officers worked independently of each other, thus reducing their potential effectiveness and increasing their risk of being assaulted.Read the report hereRead a summary of the key findings herePosted By: V Smoothe(Email) |Aug 19 at 10:30 amListed Under: News | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0)Comments & Replies (1)Comments & Replies () : Post CommentPost CommentPost Comment  | Main |Finally!
