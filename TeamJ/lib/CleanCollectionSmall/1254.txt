"The. Door. Knob. Is. Always. Locked. Just imagine how many seconds it would take (in an emergency) to take the keys out of your pocket, turn the door knob and then lock it.""It's better to have it locked and not need to lock it," added Via, the father of three young boys. "You just never know."Locking the classroom door, and keeping his students safe, was among many things running through Via's mind Sunday -- nine days before Christmas -- as he paid a solemn visit to the driveway leading to Sandy Hook Elementary School.Twenty first grade students in two classrooms were among the dead, as well as the school principal and five other staff members, in one of the worst mass shootings in US history.Via's youngest son, who is six years old, might have been in one of those classes but for the fact that his home is situated just a few yards outside the Sandy Hook Elementary School zone.Wearing a grey Newtown hoodie in a cold drizzle, Via pondered the line of 26 Christmas trees that went up overnight at the school entrance, one tree for each of the dead, each festooned with teddy bears."The stories that you've seen in Columbine (1999) and Jonesboro (1998) and the theater (in Colorado earlier this year) where people were just trying to enjoy their Batman movie -- it's here now," he told AFP, referencing previous gun-related rampages.So why do such mass shootings happen so often in the United States?"I don't know," he said. "I wish I had the answer why ... We have a free country and people are free to do wonderfully good things -- and people are free to do something like this."Via owns no guns, though his wife has been pushing him to buy one."I thought about it," he said. "I thought about it after 9/11. I thought about it after this. I still don't know. Me owning one would probably only make a difference if somebody tried to break into my home."Down the hill from the school, Daniel Gregg, who spent 23 years with Connecticut's department of education, paused with flowers in hand by a pair of Christmas trees surrounded by memorial candles and more teddy bears.He disagreed with many Americans who feel school shootings can be countered with tougher security. "That's not the answer," he said. "There's plenty of security. What do we do, put fences and gates around our schools?""The solution, to me, has to do with our own problem with guns," he added."We have a constitution that is very specific on this ... but there's also such a thing called common sense and safety -- and we've gotten way out of hand on this, just way out of hand."Gregg continued: "We are concerned about safety in every other category of everything in this society. In this one, we're not."These days, Gregg oversees international programs for the Connecticut Association of Schools, a job that puts him in regular contact with fellow educators from Asia and other parts of the world."I can tell you, some of the comments I get from China, from South Korea, from many countries, is: 'Why do you have guns?'," he said. "It almost makes us feel like we're uncivilized, and that's a shame."Copyright   2012   AFP.
