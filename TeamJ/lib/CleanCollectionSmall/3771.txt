He is the 28th head coach in franchise history.During his tenure with the Broncos, Shanahan guided the franchise to two Super Bowl victories, three conference championship game appearances, seven postseason berths and nine winning seasons. Along with Vince Lombardi, Don Shula, Chuck Noll, Jimmy Johnson and Belichick, he is one of six coaches with back-to-back Super Bowl championships.In his nine seasons coaching at the collegiate level, Shanahans teams participated in eight bowl games and won two national championships (Oklahoma -- 1975 and Eastern Illinois -- 1978).Shanahan led Denver to 138 regular-season victories in 14 seasons, a win total that marks the 10th-most by a head coach with one franchise in NFL history. Among the nine coaches who have more wins with one club than Shanahan, all eight who are eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame have been honored with membership.Shanahan was hired as Denvers head coach on Jan. 31, 1995, and later added the responsibilities of Executive Vice President of Football Operations in 1998. Under his guidance, the Broncos became one of the most accomplished franchises in the NFL.In 2006, Shanahan coached through his 200th career regular-season game, and his 125 wins at that milestone are tied for the fourth-most by a coach in the Super Bowl era (since 1966). The year also marked Denvers fifth consecutive winning season (9-7), a total that tied a franchise record.In 2004, Shanahan joined the exclusive club of head coaches to post 100 wins in his first 10 seasons with one club, finishing the campaign and decade tied for fourth on this list of 12 coaches, seven of whom are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.In his third and fourth seasons at the helm of the Denver Broncos in 1997 and 1998, Shanahan led the Broncos to their first Super Bowl victories and in 1998 became the only coach in NFL history to fashion seven postseason wins in a two-year period.In 1998, the defending world champions stormed to their second consecutive title with an offense that scored 501 points and finished third in the NFL in total yards. During the Broncos Super Bowl run, their defense allowed just 25 points and two touchdowns while sparking a remarkable +12 turnover ratio (13 takeaways, 1 giveaway) in the playoffs.In the historical 1998 season, Shanahan became the first coach in history to win two Super Bowl titles in his first four years coaching a team and is the only coach to have directed two different teams to a 500-point season (the 1998 Broncos scored 501 points, and Shanahan helped San Francisco in 1994 score 505 points as offensive coordinator). The 500-point mark has only been reached 12 times overall in pro football history.The 49ers offense reached unprecedented levels under his leadership. San Franciscos three-year offensive averages under Shanahans direction were the most productive in the history of pro football. His three-year averages included being number one in the NFL in total points (469.7 per year), total touchdowns (60.3), rushing touchdowns (23.7), passing touchdowns (31.7), third-down efficiency (48.5%), total offense (6,230 yds.) and average yards per play (6.2).His three-year period as offensive coordinator included the 49ers setting numerous team records during that time, including the first time ever that San Francisco led the NFL in total offense in consecutive seasons (1993 and 1994). It also set records for most touchdowns (66), passing yards (4,302), total offense (6,435 yds.), first downs (372), completion percentage (70.3) and average yards per play (6.3).A driving force behind the Broncos offense for all three of their Super Bowl appearances in the 1980s (following the 1986, 1987 and 1989 seasons), Shanahan first came to Denver in 1984 as the clubs wide receivers coach and served as offensive coordinator from 1985-87.He then returned to Denver as quarterbacks coach on Oct. 16, 1989, after serving as head coach of the Los Angeles Raiders in 1988 and through the first four games of the 1989 campaign. Shanahan inherited a Raiders team that was 5-10 in 1987 and improved it to 7-9 his first season. He was dismissed after starting 1-3 the following year.Shanahan began his coaching career as an offensive assistant at Oklahoma from 1975-76. The Sooners won the national championship in his first year on its staff.A native of Oak Park, Ill. (born 8/24/52), Michael Edward Shanahan attended East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Ill., where was voted athlete of the year as well as most valuable player in both football and track.He received a scholarship to Eastern Illinois University, where he played quarterback before losing a kidney in the spring game of his junior year. He received his bachelors and masters degrees at EIU.Assistant CoachesNFL SHOPWRS R.Griffin 80th Game Jry REDSKINS THROWBACK109.99NFL SL Static Storm Hood WASHINGTON REDSKINS59.97NFL-80oz Grub Jug w/Remove Bot WASHINGTON REDSKINS46.99VISIT NFL SHOPTeam ProfilesSelect a Team...Arizona CardinalsAtlanta FalconsBaltimore RavensBuffalo BillsCarolina PanthersChicago BearsCincinnati BengalsCleveland BrownsDallas CowboysDenver BroncosDetroit LionsGreen Bay PackersHouston TexansIndianapolis ColtsJacksonville JaguarsKansas City ChiefsMiami DolphinsMinnesota VikingsNew England PatriotsNew Orleans SaintsNew York GiantsNew York JetsOakland RaidersPhiladelphia EaglesPittsburgh SteelersSan Diego ChargersSan Francisco 49ersSeattle SeahawksSt. Louis RamsTampa Bay BuccaneersTennessee TitansWashington RedskinsPlayer Name --%>Forbath, 34-yd FGPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 06:53 a.m.(11:47) K.Forbath 34 yard field goal is GOOD, Center-N.Sundberg, Holder-S.Rocca.00:24D Redskins, 64-yd, punt returnPublished: Dec. 10, 2012 at 06:50 a.m.(13:42) S.Koch punts 56 yards to WAS 12, Center-M.Cox.
