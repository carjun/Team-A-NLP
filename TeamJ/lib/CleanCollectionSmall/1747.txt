The problem is that record labels only sign and fund music that will immediately sell, which means it has to fit with a trend rather than buck it. Trust me, people as brilliant as Lennon or Morrison or Marley still exist, they just don't get signed because money doesn't give a fuck.permalinksavecontextfull commentsConfirmed: Messi to Arsenal this winter.  by  ComeOnRefin  Gunners[+]mottledbungabunga 12 points13 points14 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]mottledbungabunga 12 points13 points14 points 2 hours agoITT: Proof that we people generally comment after only reading the title of the post.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMaurice Herzog, part of the first rope team to summit an 8000m mountain, has died  by  pozorvlakin  alpinism[+]mottledbungabunga 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours ago (0 children)[]mottledbungabunga 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours agoDon't forget it was the peak that remains to this day the most deadly - Annapurna I.RIPpermalinksavecontextfull commentsI see your garage climbing wall and raise you my friend and comp climber's garage climbing wall...  by  pooncartercashin  climbing[+]mottledbungabunga 1 point2 points3 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]mottledbungabunga 1 point2 points3 points 9 hours agoRerouting much be a bitch!
