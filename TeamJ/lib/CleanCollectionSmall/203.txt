God lives in hearts, not in schools. Does Governor Huckabee think God got pissed off about being banned from schools and decided to teach Americans a lesson by allowing a person to assassinate a bunch of children -- children who take the term "loss of innocent lives" to a whole new level? What kind of God does Governor Huckabee worship? The God I love doesn't purposely use violence in spiteful retaliation of his/her perceived shunning. The God I love is spending the day with the rest of America mourning the loss of lives, not having a "that will teach you!" moment.God had nothing to do with the Sandy Hook massacre. The murders were a direct result of the lack of gun control laws in this country. Yes, people driven by violent outbursts are not going to go away once gun control legislation is enacted. However, the carnage will be reduced. Guns facilitate psychotic episodes to become extreme and more fatal. If you look at any of the mass shootings that have previously occurred, without a doubt, there would have been less loss of lives and overall damage if the attacker were wielding a knife instead of an assault weapon. The statistics are clear that our liberal gun laws drive a national murder rate that is exponentially greater than any other country in the world. Cars and even children's toys are more regulated than guns. That is so wrong. If we put these people through a process half as comprehensive as we put people through to get a driver's license, we would see less gun-related murders. Now is not the time to start a discussion around God in schools. And now is not the time to start a discussion about gun control. Now is the time to immediately pass gun control legislation. We owe it to the 20 little kids and six heroic adults who lost their lives in Newtown. We owe it to the close to a hundred Americans who are killed every single day by people with guns. Once we stop the bleeding, we can go on to discuss the bigger issue of how to better manage mental illness.If the God Squad really wants to reduce gun-related violence versus pimp a self-serving agenda, they should advocate for gun control laws. Unified, we as a country have an opportunity to make something positive happen in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedies. While nobody wants to have children or anyone die for a reason -- let's give their deaths more meaning. Let's let the Sandy Hook school shootings be the catalyst for good. Let's take positive action to ensure we minimize the likelihood that this will happen again. Let's do it to honor all those who have lost their lives because someone with a gun murdered them. And in doing so, we will be doing God's work in a much more positive and meaningful way.Follow Kel Kelly on Twitter:www.twitter.com/kelkellyFOLLOW POLITICSLike198k Get AlertsSandy Hook Elementary School ShootingMike HuckabeeMore in Politics...Obama Announces Gun Violence Task Force, Presses...Robert Bork Dead: Former Solicitor General And...State Benghazi Report Is Harshly Critical Of...Joe Biden To Lead Push For New...

View AllFavoritesRecency|PopularityPatiencePie19 Fans35 minutes ago ( 1:17 PM)I'm tired of this stupid lie that we can't pray in schools anymore. You can go into ANY school in America right now and pray -- and it is LEGAL.  What is not legal is for anyone to force kids to recite a school-sponsored prayer.  Prayer, like religion, is a private choice and the government cannot endorse one religion over another. That is the beauty of our Constitution.PatiencePie: I'm tired of this stupid lie that we can't prayhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/PatiencePie/sandy-hook-shooting_b_2308316_215026771.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itHUFFPOST BLOGGERKel Kelly28 Fans22 minutes ago ( 1:31 PM)amen sista' patiencepie! ;)hp_blogger_Kel Kelly: amen sista' patiencepie! ;)http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/hp_blogger_Kel Kelly/sandy-hook-shooting_b_2308316_215031904.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

When prayer was removed from school it was also removed from those who only experienced it in the class room at the beginning of the day. Maybe you should do a study and compare deaths in the US due to guns or any acts of violence prior to prayer being removed from all school events and compare that to todays events. Look at the age of persons commiting such acts and see if prayer was in the school when they were.Gun control will not stop the senseless killing of human beings. One would only have to look at OJ Simpson or the Ok City bombings and the World Trade Center. All tragic but none involved guns.We can only morn with those who have experienced a loss of life, which is what the Bible teaches. Our Pastor stated in Church this past Sunday that We have an amazing God in times like this. He feels pain with the loss of life and at the same time somewhere else a baby is being born and life is being celebrated. Satan will always be amongst us trying to turn you against God, we only help him do it by removing God from everything, think about it ??JerryJerry_Pate: Kel Kelly, Really??

We have become a largely immoral people and as a result the evil in men's hearts goes unfettered.  Your gun control stance is ignorant and misguided although I'm sure your heart is in the right place, it's just your knowledge of the facts is woeful.Lance_Batchelder: I agree with Mike Huckabee and it's not that Godhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Lance_Batchelder/sandy-hook-shooting_b_2308316_214977708.htmlHistory|Permalink|Share itThis comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.
