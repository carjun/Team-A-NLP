Dr. H. Wayne Carver told reporters on Saturday that all of the deaths are considered homicides and he believes that everybody was hit more than once. Carver described the damage inflicted by the deadly high-powered rounds as a devastating set of injuries.  The rounds used in Lanza's Bushmaster rifle are known as a .223 Remington. The .223Rem, as they are sometimes called, is a civilian analogue to the military 5.56 x 45mm NATO round. The civilian version is classified as a sporting round. However, the bullet design is far from other common types of bullets used for target practice.  These rounds, depending on their specifications, are capable of inflicting severe and devastating injuries to tissue. If a weapon firing these is loaded with hollow-tipped bullets, the round will expand or fragment.  Perhaps one of the nastiest aspects of this round is that unless it strikes a vital organ, death can come excruciatingly slowly. Testing of the round has shown that when it strikes tissue, it tends to turn sideways and go into a tumble while simultaneously splitting into two main pieces and several smaller fragments.  When coupled with the extreme velocity (more than 3,000 feet per second in some configurations) of the round, it does not take a physicist to realize that this type of velocity can transfer a huge amount of energy to a human body. These characteristics cause an enormous amount of trauma to the body and also create multiple wound channels inside of the body. Victims of this type of wound usually die from severe blood loss.  There are reports from soldiers during the Vietnam War that said the 5.56mm (.223) did not kill as quickly as the larger 7.62mm (.308) caliber. Instead they reported following massive blood trails several feet from where enemies were shot to find the enemy soldier dead from blood loss.  Basically, a victim shot with this type of round will die a slow and extremely painful death unless they are killed instantly from the initial gunshot. Rounds in these configurations can be purchased off the shelf at any gun store.  Obviously, any type of firearm is capable of killing or injuring a person, but we now see that certain types of ammunition can be infinitely more devastating than others. These are the types like the .223 with the capacity to inflict some of the most horrific injuries that also have the added ability to cause extreme suffering as well.  When this is coupled with a weapon that has high-capacity (more than five to ten rounds), we see the potential for extreme carnage and suffering can result should such a weapon end up in the hands of a deranged gunman bent on creating the maximum amount of casualties possible.  It should be noted that there are similar types of ammunition to the .223 on the market, but few are able to be fired from weapons that have such a high capacity as those that fire the .223 caliber. An individual can easily purchase a 100-round magazine for weapons that use the .223 rather inexpensively.  An assailant armed with a few of these would be more than capable of causing massive amounts of casualties, especially if they fire on victims in close quarters.  Authorities have not said what capacity the weapon Lanza used had. However, accused Aurora movie theater suspect James HolmesJames Holmes allegedly used one of these high-capacity magazines during that attack.  Opinion:  The time truly has come to rethink some of these gun regulations. There has to be a way to reduce these dangers to the public without nullifying the Second Amendment.

Do we need this type of detailed description of exactly how horrible the death was? There is a creepy quality to this piece that has disturbed me greatly, and I wish I hadn't read it.    ReplyReply Bytjlarson        |        about 7 hours        ago        the purpose of this article is not to describe how horrible these deaths were, this is abundantly obvious... on the contrary, the purpose of this article is to inform the public about the dangers and capabilities of these high-powered, high-capacity weapons... if you are only "disturbed" by the "quality" of this piece then you have completely missed the point here.
