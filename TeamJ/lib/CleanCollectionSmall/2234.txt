Literally, I can sit in a warm bath and if you touch my leg it will still feel ice cold. I get a lot of remarks from strangers.. drives me nuts having to constantly explain that I am not dying! :-ppermalinksavecontextfull comments"Poor Kids" - a documentary about children living in poverty in Britain (2011)  by  letticein  Documentaries[+]L_xo 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]L_xo 4 points5 points6 points 3 days agoI loved this.
