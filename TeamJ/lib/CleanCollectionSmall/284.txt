Generations of families in Newtown, Connecticutof which Sandy Hook is a partlearned to read, write, add and subtract at Sandy Hook Elementary. Its one of those schools where you would see it in a movie, says Shaun Piccirillo, 26, who attended the schoolas did nine other members of his family. Its tiny, its very homey. Its not like your overgrown school that you see nowadays everywhere.But on Friday, the fabric of the town began to unravel at that very school as residents got word of the massacre that took the lives of 20 children and six adults.(Another adultbelieved to be the gunmans motherwas found dead elsewhere; the gunman, identified as Adam Lanza, took his own life.)As the horror sinks in and the funerals begin, the village will forever be changed.(MORE: Twenty Brighter Stars: Shocked Conn. Town Mourns Its Slain Children)Around 10 a.m. that Friday, Piccirillo was preparing for his usual day-off routine: taking his nine-month old daughter for a walk near the playground and hiking trails outside of Sandy Hook Elementary. He opened his window and heard what sounded like low-flying helicopters. Outside of his home on Sunnyview Terrace, Piccirillo saw squad cars, guns and ammo. At the end of his cul-de-sac, his neighbors were collecting onto Riverside Road near the volunteer firehouse. Dickenson Drive  the only road leading into and out of the school  was blocked. He recalls his incredulity: You gotta wipe the cobwebs out of your eyes and take a second glance to make sure that this is really going on.It was into the firehouse that the surviving children and school staff were slowly ushered and within the building, Monsignor Robert Weiss, a pastor at the nearby St. Rose of Lima Church, stood with law enforcement officials as they helped parents and students navigate the chaos. Some of them went running this morning, Weiss told TIME, describing children fleeing the school. They were scared and there was a house farther up the street where some of them went. Officials organized the students by grade and made lists of those still missing.(PHOTOS:Grief in Newtown: Photos from the Scene)Weiss recalls how the roll was called. They assembled all the children in the fire house and then they had the teachers there and the teachers wrote down the names of all the children and the ones who were unaccounted for went into another room  the parents went to another room  and wrote those names on the list.By the next day, the identities of many of the victims would begin to come out, divulged by family and friends even as an official list was being compiled by the sheriffs office. There would be heartbreaking tales of the death of the school principal Dawn Hochsprung, 47, and of first-grade teacher Victoria Soto, 27, whom friends said was shot as she shepherded her class into a closet, shielding them just as they came into the gunmans sights. The staff was close knit and loyal to the children in their care. A lot of teachers stick around until they have to pretty much retire because they really love their jobs, says Piccirillo. Its not like one of those jobs like youre worried about going to work every day.(MORE:Am I Safe? Talking to Your Kids About the Sandy Hook School Shooting)There would be no school bell sounding an end to the day that Friday. Instead, there were sirens echoing through the normally quiet streets of Sandy Hook. There would be no school buses taking kids home for the weekend. Instead there were police officers escorting grief-crippled mothers still waiting for their husbands to arrive. As one woman hobbled to her car, she turned to the police officer to her left  her eyes wide and glassed over. She shook her head and said, I cant believe theyd do this to children.Theres really no words, says Weiss. Its just been a lot of huging and crying and holding onto each other. I think thats basically what people can do. People are sharing wonderful memories about their children. A lot of them brought a picture of their child with them [to the firehouse]. I dont think the reality or the magnitude of this has absolutely settled in at all. You know, any time a young person dies, its the worst thing in the world. To have a whole group of young children like this  so innocent I have never had to deal with this before. Ive dealt with many individual deaths but never a situation like this.You just pray that the Lord is going to give you the grace, he adds as he begins to grapple with a problem. What will he say at the funerals? In my head, Im thinking about these services that well have to do next week and what can you possibly say to anybody thats going to help them or make sense about this? He continues, You teach foregiveness but its going to be very diffiuclt for people to forgive this personto even understand why they would do something like thisAs the priest begins to walk away, he says, Keep us in your prayers, will you?MORE:A Town of Broken Hearts: How Newtown Residents Cope with Grief0 comments&nbspGet            LivefyreFAQSign in                  + Follow                  Post comment                                    Link        Sort: Newest | OldestMore on TIME Connecticut School Shooting: Multiple Deaths ReportedThe Nanjing Massacre: Scenes from a Hideous Slaughter 75 Years AgoTop 10 Everything of 2012Who Should Be TIME's Person of the Year?Latest from James Zogby: From This Day On: Christmas in NewtownRana Florida: Shame on Us, America: Take a Stand and #BanGuns NowKaren S.
