Since the start of 2010, average Hong Kong home prices have doubled.But the price tag mentioned here is neither for a home nor an office.It is for a parking space: A slab of undecorated concrete, stained by black motor oil, about 8-feet-by-16-feet in size.

Xie was there, she said, because she was forced to be  held in a hotel room for eight days after she and her 56-year-old husband, Ma Haiming, traveled to Beijing in March to protest the compensation they were given for the demolition of the family's farmhouse to make way for the expansion of Shanghai's PudongInternationalAirport in 2005. When the couple arrived in Beijing, Xie said they were picked up by plain clothes police and forced to travel hundreds of miles back to Shanghai, then held separately at the hotel."I really felt quite sick inside," said Xie, who now lives in a tiny apartment near the airport where her son works as a janitor. Xie said she tried to escape from her third floor hotel room on March 10 via its balcony but was stopped by at least seven guards who, she said, "put me on the bed and used the bedspread" to hold her down. She said she stole the room key when a guard was not looking.Xie and her husband were not alone. Three other people have told CNN they were held against their will at the Holiday Inn Express Nanhuizui  located in Lingang New City on the outskirts of Shanghai  to keep them from airing grievances to the central government during the 10-day annual meeting of China's legislature in March. The hotel management and owners deny their claims.FULL POSTPosted by: CNN.com business producer, Kevin Voigt Filed under: ChinaChinas new leaders: Good for biz, bad for reform05:40 AM GMT, November 15th, 20122(CNN)  China unveiled the elite group of seven who will set the agenda for the next decade.
