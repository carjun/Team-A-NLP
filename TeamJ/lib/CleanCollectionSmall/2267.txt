I make a batch of dough, and freeze it in saran wrap portioned out.  When I'm ready to bake, I take em out, cut the dough into slices, roll them in crushed roasted cocoa almonds, and bake a few minutes longer. So damn good!permalinksavecontextfull commentsI [23f] have recently started seeking counselling for my anger issues, trust issues and low self esteem. Can I really change?  by  princesspeach_xin  self[+]krisdafish 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]krisdafish 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours agoIf you work at change, you can change. Life is nothing but change, it's great you want to address the issues that are holding you back.  Go after it, work it, understand therapy is often hard work and uncomfortable.  Don't quit :)  Good for you for addressing this head on, you are on a great path.  Also, I'm 30, I can't tell you how much I've changed since I was 23... You aren't too old ;)permalinksavecontextfull commentsI know this has been asked before and I'm sorry but nothing has worked for me.

I think it's a mistake a lot of people make at first.  I've upped my veggies by eating lots of riced cauliflower, and it did the trick.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsI.. t-t-think I'm in ketosis.

It's a pretty tasty rice substitute, and another way of getting your veggies in.  My pure processed food partner was skeptical, now he asks when we are having it.  Also soups, are a great way to get your veggies in. They are really easy to make from scratch (If I can do it, anyone can), and you can add and cook the veggies to your liking.  Don't forget the bacon :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsEnough bragging on what awesome food you made, what strange keto concoctions have you came up with out of desperation?

Last night was left over steak, with some onions, butter, and mushrooms... topped with shredded cheddar and sour cream.  YUM :) As for binges, these snickerdoodles are friggin amazing.

Couples therapy is helpful, but it sounds like she has some serious issues she needs to address alone. She also needs to be assessed by a professional, so she can get the care she needs, and you and your son can be safe. I would try really hard to get her to some kind of mental health professional immediately. Her behavior is not ok and needs to be addressed to ensure not only her safety, but yours and your sons.  If you don't think she will hear it from you, see if you can enlist someone she can hear it from (her mom?).  Sorry you are going through this.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCaution! Cold medicine has carbs!  by  Frankless24in  keto[+]krisdafish 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]krisdafish 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoI get sick every year, and realized I better have some solutions on hand that contain no sugar.  Here is my list so far...  Robitussin makes a sugar free one. There is also something called Diabetic Tussin. Last, you could try mucinex in tablet form :)  Don't forget my favorite, A hot lemon toddy. 1 cup Crystal Light lemonade, prepared with water as directed. 1 ounce bourbon, brandy or rum  Anyone else have some more to add to the list?permalinksavecontextfull comments/r/BodyGallery (a non-sexual and non-discriminatory subreddit in which to browse bodies of all shapes and sizes) would love your photos!  by  bodygalleryin  keto[+]krisdafish 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]krisdafish 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoI checked this out today, it's really interesting to see people of similar height with different weights on em.

I don't feel worse really, I do feel a bit more distant and foggy. It's strange because I feel like I have more energy, but don't really take much pleasure in using it right now.  I'm hoping in another week or two I will be fully keto adapted and my brain fog will clear up.   I suppose ya should give it a shot, but track your moods via a mood log so if you begin to see a slip you can reassess.The positive side thus far, is that losing weight, controlling my diet, helps me feel productive and far more comfortable in my skin, and that eases some of the anxiety and depression I think.
