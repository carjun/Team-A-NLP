The gunman forced his way into the school and unleashed a rain of bullets from a semiautomatic rifle, striking each of his 6- and 7-year-old victims more than once, in an attack that lasted just a few minutes. RelatedPolice: Victims include 12 girls, 8 boysConn. officials: Principal died lunging at gunmanEditorial cartoon: Connecticut shootingGraphic: What happenedPhotos from the shooting The six adults also killed Friday morning in the Sandy Hook Elementary School were also each shot multiple times in a massacre of innocents that has deeply shocked a nation sadly familiar with mass shootings.President Obama will visit Newtown on Sunday to meet the families who lost loved ones and to thank first responders, the White House said in a statement. The president will speak at an interfaith vigil scheduled for 7 p.m.Authorities on Saturday did not explain exactly how the heavily armed shooter, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, got into the school, and have not yet offered a possible motivation for the slaughter.I cant say that we know [the] motive, said State Police Lieutenant J. Paul Vance. We havent reached that determination, that culmination yet of the investigation.State Police on Saturday released the names of the 26 victims slain in the attack, including the schools principal, Dawn Hochsprung. Each of the children, 12 girls and eight boys, was born in either 2005 or 2006, according to the police.Dr. H. Wayne Carver II, state medical examiner, said at a briefing Saturday that he personally examined the bodies of seven first-graders, each dressed in cute kids stuff, and each of whom had been shot between three and 11 times.Ive been at this for a third of a century, said Carver. And my sensibilities may not be [that of] the average man. But this probably is the worst I have seen, or the worst that I know of any of my colleagues having seen.Lanzas mother, Nancy, also was found shot dead Friday at her nearby home. News outlets originally reported that Nancy Lanza was a teacher at the Sandy Hook school, but police said Saturday that she had not worked there.Though the shooter had at least two handguns with him during his attack, the primary weapon appears to have been a Bushmaster .223 semiautomatic rifle, according to multiple news reports.Carver said the guns bullets are designed to inflict a very devastating set of injuries, suggesting that the victims died quickly.Lanza apparently killed himself after the attack. Carver said that while he did not want to belabor the obvious, he could not officially rule that Adam Lanzas wounds were self-inflicted until he examines the body on Sunday.Adam Lanza remains something of a mystery, known well by few, if any, in the town where he is now infamous.Mario De Vivo, who graduated from Newtown High School a year before Lanza, could not immediately recall the shooter when he first heard the name, he said. But then a friend reminded him: the briefcase kid. While his peers slung backpacks over their shoulder, Lanza carried a dark briefcase through his high school halls, a row of pens neatly lined up in the pocket of his button-down shirt. His oddly formal outfit varied so little, students had wondered if he wore the same shirt every day. People knew him as smart, an honor roll regular, a computer whiz who loved video games. One classmate described him as a genius. But they also knew he was so reclusive and painfully awkward that even well-meaning students struggled to interact with him. He was a loner, for sure, said De Vivo. Lanza was born in Kingston, N.H. Outside the Kingston home of Lanzas uncle, James Champion, on Saturday, two men identified themselves as family friends and said the family did not want to speak with reporters.Later Saturday evening in Kingston, Michael Downing, the Rockingham County sheriff, gave a statement on behalf of the Lanza and Champion families, who share the grief of a community and a nation as we struggle to comprehend the tremendous loss that we all share. ... On behalf of Nancys mother and siblings, we reach out to the community of Newtown and express our heartfelt sorrow for the incomprehensible and profound loss of innocence that has affected so many.On Saturday, the community Adam Lanza so thoroughly devastated responded with its own messages of condolence, posted in storefronts, at churches, and at homes. They included: Our hearts are broken, scrawled on a chalkboard; Hug a teacher today, crudely printed on a sheet hung from a window; and God bless the families, sprayed-painted on a piece of plywood.A sign outside St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church said it would be open 24 hours. Families with young children visited the church Saturday morning, some stopping at candles set up outside. Mourners added a soccer ball, a doll, and flowers.Continued...Martine Powers and Peter Schworm of the Globe staff and Globe correspondents Matt Rocheleau, Jaclyn Reiss, Gal Tziperman Lotan, and Derek J.
