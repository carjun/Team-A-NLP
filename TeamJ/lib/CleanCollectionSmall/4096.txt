I was brought to tears & I know many others who said the same. There really are no words to even come close to how horrific this was, but you message was elegant & appropriate & obviously from the heart...Rest in heavenly peace, all the children & adults & the peace of God to all the grieving families...Reply 5 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate skyemcleod1's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate skyemcleod1's comment.Sign inAll Comments (243)RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserRandy Ragsdale                5 minutes ago@Newdebate Please explain to us where it says in the second amendment that people have a right to open fire on elementary school children with assault weapons?

The Republicans John Boehner, Kevin Mccarthy, Eric Cantor and that other loser who lost to President Obama and Joe Bide, Lying Ryan. Now if you want to pass gun control in this country, you have to lean DOWN ON THE REPUBLICANS. YOU HAVE TO BREATHE DOWN THEIR NECKS, AND KICK THEM IN THE NUTS AND TELL THEM TO MAN UP AND STOP ACTING LIKE LIL BITCHES @NEWDEBEATE AND TELL THEM TO DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE TO MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD!Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Randy Ragsdale's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Randy Ragsdale's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserMrFurling                16 minutes agoWhat that gunman did was evil and sick but I can't believe how many people on here, think obama is so great.

When I was in school, many moons back, the worst I had to worry about was bullies and their fists (bad enough)! Now it's guns and knives!! Can anybody out there tell me what's going on, and why somebody would want to kill school kids? What's the point? I can't figure it out!! What does one gain from murder and suicide?? Being known as an a-hole? For what?? Got this old frog hanging...Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate bullfrog1954's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate bullfrog1954's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserVincenzo Ernesto Cozzarelli                34 minutes agoThe United States has receveid a great gift from God: a President as Obama.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Vincenzo Ernesto Cozzarelli's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Vincenzo Ernesto Cozzarelli's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserJosh Eaton                35 minutes agoThis fucking scumbag is full of shit with his crocodile tears. youtube dot com slash user slash realitycheckineffect slash featuredReply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Josh Eaton's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Josh Eaton's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Usersteven allenbaugh                40 minutes agoVOTOR FRAUD.......really.......you really think that is what happened? you are a dumb fucking idiot.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate steven allenbaugh's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate steven allenbaugh's comment.Sign inin reply to MarsSauerHacker(Show the comment) RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserAznPr1des                43 minutes agowhat kind of sick fuck would dislike this video?Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate AznPr1des's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate AznPr1des's comment.Sign inShow more Loading comment...Loading...14:19President Obama Welcomes Prime Minister Singh of Indiaby whitehouse96,544 views1:32President Obama on Student Loan Interest Rates: "I know about this firsthand"by whitehouse8,055 views29:38President Obama Speaks at Hankuk Universityby whitehouse88,509 views8:25President Obama Proposes Federal Employee Pay Freezeby whitehouse26,794 views28:24President Obama holds a Press Conference with Prime Minister Noda of Japanby whitehouse11,140 views9:44Celebrating Ramadan at the White Houseby whitehouse163,147 views5:37President Obama Speaks Before G8 Working Session on the Global Economyby whitehouse10,752 views28:46President Obama's Conversation with 9th Gradersby whitehouse37,587 views6:32President Obama Speaks on Enforcing Trade Rights with Chinaby whitehouse8,545 views13:14President Obama and President Medvedev Meet Before G8 Summitby whitehouse7,712 views6:18President Obama Honors 2011 MLS Cup Champion LA Galaxyby whitehouse114,933 views14:23President Obama & the First Lady: Conference on Bullying Preventionby whitehouse35,304 views43:34First Lady Michelle Obama Addresses Young African Women Leadersby whitehouse27,804 views13:17President Obama Addresses the Nationby whitehouse38,170 views33:33President Obama discusses College Affordability in Michiganby whitehouse37,631 views25:46President Obama Speaks on the Resurgence of the American Auto Industryby whitehouse71,746 views27:31Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Phoenix Awards Dinnerby whitehouse32,635 views12:32President Obama Honors the Nation's TOP COPSby whitehouse10,620 views5:18President Obama's Bilateral Meeting with President Hu of Chinaby whitehouse6,754 views25:21President Obama Speaks on American Infrastructureby whitehouse10,144 viewsLanguage:  EnglishCountry:  WorldwideSafety:OffHelpLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...
