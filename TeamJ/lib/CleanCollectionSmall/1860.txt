We HAVE to.I was in NYC this past weekend.  In case any of you don't know, there are no guns allowed in NYC...period.  20 minutes after I walked through Columbus Circle with my fianc, a man stepped up to the back of another man, shot him once in the head, then got into a car and drove off.You can take the guns out of the hands of people, but they WILL find a way to get them.  And if they don't get them, they will make them.  And if they don't make them, they will use knives, axes, chainsaws, even a car, to do what they want to do.The secondary problem is weapons.  The primary problem is PEOPLE and what is going on in their heads. EDIT:  Thank you to whoever gave me gold, that's very kind of you.  Please be compassionate and watchful over one another, everyone.  We have to do that now. permalinksave[+]tmoraca 23 points24 points25 points 1 day ago (5 children)[]tmoraca 23 points24 points25 points 1 day agoMore than half of inmates in the US now have mental health issues. Tons of prison money should really go to hospitals and psych wards. And we must examine what it is about our society that allows for these kinds of evil thoughts and actions to flourish.permalinksaveparent[+]gottabtru 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (4 children)[]gottabtru 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoSeems to me that jails create mental illness.permalinksaveparent[+]tmoraca 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]tmoraca 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours agoThat surely is part of the problem. Chicken and the egg, yopermalinksaveparent[+]godless_communism 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago (1 child)[]godless_communism 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours agoYes, prisons are practically designed to create mental illness and recidivism.  Thank goodness there's more private companies available to contract out prison services to.  I'm sure that'll solve things.permalinksaveparent[+]ZeroAntagonist 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]ZeroAntagonist 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoIt's no accident. Jails are no longer meant to rehab, educate, and give inmates mental help. The mental health issue in America is at a breaking point. permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 14 points15 points16 points 1 day ago (21 children)[]brokenex 14 points15 points16 points 1 day agoTo be fair, just because guns aren't allowed in NYC and someone got shot there is not a good argument against gun control. NYC isn't isolated city. It is easy to buy guns just outside NYC and then bring them in. If someone is going to try to massacre a school filled with children, I would rather they try to do it with a knife instead of a gun. It would go completely differently.permalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 10 points11 points12 points 1 day ago (20 children)[]penguin8508 10 points11 points12 points 1 day agoThat was my point...that even if we put firmer gun control laws in individual states and cities, that doesn't stop people from doing it.  Let's say every gun in America was destroyed, somehow.  Let's say that happened.Does that magically erase people's impulse to kill?  Were people killing each other in huge numbers prior to the advent of the gun?Guns make it easier to kill people in large numbers.  No argument there.But do we also outlaw batteries and fertilizer, so that people can't kill children with bombs?  Do you think that wouldn't happen?permalinksaveparent[+]atarusama 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]atarusama 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours agoHas anyone not seen the parallels? There was a similar incident in China where firearms are banned... a man with a knife went into a school and tried the same thing.... they had 20 injured children, while we have at least 18 dead children. Does this not give you at least SOME insight?permalinksaveparent[+]Time_for_Stories 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Time_for_Stories 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours agoPersonally I'd rather have them injured than killed.permalinksaveparent[+]BulletBilll 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]BulletBilll 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoPeople kill mainly for two reasons, compassion or compulsion, both of which irrational. Something goes through your head and suddenly you act upon it, it's easy to go through with it if you have a gun, just pull the trigger. With guns being harder to find you might already cut back on those kinds of murders, where a kid get's angry at his parents or another kid, or a wife/husband getting into an argument and one ends up dead.Guns have no practical use other than you kill or injure. Knives, batteries and fertilizer however have primary uses which aren't to mame or murder.permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (16 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThat was my point...that even if we put firmer gun control laws in individual states and cities, that doesn't stop people from doing it.That is why we should do it on the federal level But do we also outlaw batteries and fertilizer, so that people can't kill children with bombs? Do you think that wouldn't happen?The federal government monitors fertilizer more than it does guns because of terrorists.permalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (11 children)[]penguin8508 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoI'm not even having an argument with you about gun control right now.  I'm acknowledging that guns allow people to kill in high numbers at a high rate.What I am asking you is, 1) do you acknowledge that people will find a way to do this regardless, 2) were people killing others in high numbers prior to the advent of the gun, and 3) doesn't what's CAUSING people to do these things warrant more attention than what they're using to do it?permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (10 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agodo you acknowledge that people will find a way to do this regardlessYes, but its a hell of a lot harder to committ a massacre with a knife instead of a gunwere people killing others in high numbers prior to the advent of the gunyes but disenfranchised 20 year olds weren't going on mass murder sprees in elementary schools quite as oftendoesn't what's CAUSING people to do these things warrant more attention than what they're using to do it?We have to be pragmatic in how we solve the problem. Ideally, we need MASSIVELY increased spending in mental health, but I don't think that is going to happen any time soon. In the short, we need to take the weapons of mass killing out of the hands of those who would commit such atrocities.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (7 children)[]montyjack 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoI'm sorry- did you just say we should give up our rights because we can't be bothered to do the correct thing and address the SOURCE of the problem?permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (6 children)[]brokenex -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoI don't think people have the rights to own weapon that present a massive threat to society. I think that argument is based on an extreme reading of the 2nd amendment.I have been a deer hunter my whole life. I own numerous hunting rifles and shotguns, but that doesn't prevent me from seeing the truth of this situation.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (5 children)[]montyjack -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoIf you're truly a hunter then you know any one of the guns you own would pose an extreme threat to humans too.permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*(4 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*I don't own any semi-automatic weapons -- well except for a .22. The mass lethality of a weapon goes massively up when a weapon becomes semi-automatic and automatic.If they were to ban semi-automatic rifles and pistols. It wouldn't effect me in the least. I don't need a semi-auto to hunt deer. In fact, I am mildly disgusted when I'm sitting in the woods and hear someone unload 5-7 rapid shots with a semi. permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]penguin8508 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]penguin8508 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoI think we're on the same page here, but don't you think removing weapons is going to take an enormous amount of funding too?  We're talking about increased border security to prevent illegal imports, increased police force, etc.  That stuff doesn't come cheap either.  Mental illness affects a society on every level---education, economy, safety, structure of family, etc.  permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoI come from a family of therapists and I am a psychology grad, so I understand the need for increased mental health spending, but I don't think that it is going to be a panacea in this situation. Most people who would commit a tragedy like this don't seek out help.We're talking about increased border security to prevent illegal imports, increased police force, etc.Not really. Most guns used in North/South America come from the USA. Right now guns flow out, not in. People easily buy guns on the American side of the border and smuggle them into Mexico. permalinksaveparent[+]OWmWfPk -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours ago (3 children)[]OWmWfPk -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours agohttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1376982.stmYou don't need a gun.

People wouldn't believe the status of mental health care in this country. If more people were aware then it wouldn't be a matter of gun safety. It'd be a matter of getting mentally ill people help so they don't do these things!permalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]penguin8508 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoThere are a lot of things that go into it...It's also increasing awareness and erasing, or at least lessening, the stigma attached to mental illness.  Why don't people seek help?  Because of the stigma.There was also a really, really awesome bestof thread a few days ago about men and masculinity, and the problems that come with being a man, because they are not allowed by society to be emotion, express emotion, or ask for help.  permalinksaveparent[+]acousticbruises 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]acousticbruises 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoExactly. These people are seriously ill and it's increasingly difficult to access healthcare that's making this worse. As you said, young men in particular suffer from this system the worst and wouldn't ya know? It's young men who keep being the perpetrators of these crimes.permalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]penguin8508 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoExactly.permalinksaveparent[+]Mylozen 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (7 children)[]Mylozen 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoA guy walks into an elementary school with a knife he isn't going to kill 18 children before some one takes him downpermalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (6 children)[]penguin8508 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoInteresting; it happened in China.  22, actually.permalinksaveparent[+]ReggieVelDenny 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]ReggieVelDenny 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoHe didn't kill 'em all, bro.permalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (3 children)[]penguin8508 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoNumber one, I'm not a bro.

Getting it over a national border is somewhat more difficult. Gun control is easy - a large number of countries have a neglibible amount of civilian owned arms. There is violence with knives and more beatings, but the scale of the incidents are much smaller than if they owned guns.permalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (1 child)[]penguin8508 -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoBut think for a moment the size of the UK, for instance, and the size of the United States.  More difficult to control, can you agree with that?  permalinksaveparent[+]Time_for_Stories 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Time_for_Stories 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoIt is more difficult to control initially, but after 20-30 years of guns being illegal I would guess that there would be fewer large scale incidents.permalinksaveparent[+]holybatmanballs 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]holybatmanballs 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoVery well put.permalinksaveparent[+]TofuTofu 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]TofuTofu 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoIn case any of you don't know, there are no guns allowed in NYC...period.That's actually not true at all. There are shooting ranges in the city, for example.

My point is, NYC has really strict gun control.  For petes sake, that active military guy (ignorant fool that he was) got put in jail last year for trying to check his weapon at the empire state building.  But all those laws didn't help the guy who got a bullet in his head this weekend.In other words...where there's a will, there's a way.permalinksaveparent[+]theghostofme 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]theghostofme 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoBingo!
