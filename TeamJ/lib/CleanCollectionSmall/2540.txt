The only way you can see them at night is by the way they block the stars.Light pollution from a city, your house, a single streetlamp.You don't give your eyes enough time to adapt, or you have very insensitive eyes. Do you eat your vegetables? Serious question, read "night blindness" on wiki.The moon is up whenever you try to look for stars.You're not out late enough, and if you do, it's during summer.There's no reason you shouldn't be able to see stars because of your location on earth. Try again.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTook some shots of the moon with my phone.

What people want to know is what scope you use.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMagic in ya FACE !  by  everyfuckinamewtakenin  videos[+]Groke 8 points9 points10 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]Groke 8 points9 points10 points 14 days agoI hate "magicians" like this with a passion. They claim what they do are real illusions when they actually do all the work on a computer with fake audience, etc.That cup and coin trick is impossible. It just can't be done in any way. The audience are actors.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy sister's first winter.

And every Swede knows that they are superior to the Norwegians. It's just good old teasing between the countries. We actually love eachother.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBaguette from nowhere [x-post from /r/gifs]  by  kondrat1983in  woahdude[+]Groke 14 points15 points16 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]Groke 14 points15 points16 points 15 days agoIt is.

Humanist beliefs without specific religious belief is supported by three out of ten.  by  warrantyvoidin  Norway[+]Groke 6 points7 points8 points 16 days ago*(0 children)[]Groke 6 points7 points8 points 16 days ago*It's because almost everyone here are baptised and confirmated in church, as well as married and burried.This probably cause people to say that they are christian even though they don't believe in god and Jesus.The word "atheist" has very little meaning here since there are no vocal Christians for contrast. That might cause people to either not know what atheist fully means, or go with the most familiar option.I've never believed in god, but until I started reading Reddit, "atheist" meant nothing to me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCould you provide a Norwegian perspective on this [Wolves] -  by  viewsonicmuvoin  Norway[+]Groke 3 points4 points5 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]Groke 3 points4 points5 points 16 days ago39.600 sheep / 25 wolves = 1584.Every wolf must have killed 4-5 sheep every day for a year.You make it sound like wolves are behind all those kills.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAnyone have any idea where the stereotypical "Nordic" accent came from?  by  Tealwispin  linguistics[+]Groke 1 point2 points3 points 16 days ago*(0 children)[]Groke 1 point2 points3 points 16 days ago*That is the first time I've heard that kind of accent in parodies or imitating.This is more like Norwegians with little English training talks. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49CkgeQVh70&feature=fvwrelpermalinksavecontextfull commentsThiefbusters - a hungarian web series  by  c4nn1balin  JusticePorn[+]Groke 2 points3 points4 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]Groke 2 points3 points4 points 17 days agoIt's Hungarian, and it's subtitled in English.permalinksavecontextfull comments20414243"English is a Scandinavian language" - What do you think about this?

There are no illusion, because what you see is exactly what happens in the video. There are no behind the scenes or tricks to do it. It's all done on a computer.If you count this as an illusion, then every movie with some CGI in it must be a long magic show to you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTaiwanese magician pulls out a baguette from nowhere.  by  OOOH_WATERin  videos[+]Groke 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]Groke 1 point2 points3 points 17 days agoNo, I'm saying that this guy tries to pass his tricks as illusions, when it's not.There's a difference between illusions and magic.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTaiwanese magician pulls out a baguette from nowhere.  by  OOOH_WATERin  videos[+]Groke 11 points12 points13 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]Groke 11 points12 points13 points 17 days agoYea, I didn't recognize the guy, but I recognized the clever filming style immediately.
