Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]j3ssh4rt 69 points70 points71 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]j3ssh4rt 69 points70 points71 points 21 hours agoThis entire situation is just horrific.  Mass killings are terrible and atrocious.  Add to that the fact that the large majority of the victims were so many young, vulnerable children.  My heart just aches.I understand that the media needs to report something.  (After all, I'm sure many of you were checking all of the major news outlets to get some sort of update or bird's eye view of the situation as it was unfolding.)  So I get that they needed to release information as they gathered it.  And in times of chaos, it's easy for someone to hear something and just run with it.  Unfortunately, that kind of swift release leads to misinformation.  But rather than point fingers (news, media, social networking, gun laws, lack of gun laws, bad parenting, what have you...) we should all take this time to open our hearts to the ones we love, and also to pay attention to those around us.  Remind our friends and family how much they mean to us, take the time to let them know how important they are in our lives.  That tiny step alone could prevent another situation like this from happening in the future.  Of course, there are individuals and groups who have a negative agenda (whether brought about by mental instability, political propaganda, religious zeal, etc.) but perhaps by using love and compassion as a preventive tool we can come together during this time.  My entire heart goes out to the families and loved ones who are now suffering from this unspeakable tragedy.  And I truly wish them all a healing process that allows them to grieve and remember the lives of those lost without fear or hatred or bitterness.  There are no magic words to take away their pain, but hopefully they can all gather strength throughout the aftermath of this terrible event.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should we name her?  by  vonmoein  cats[+]j3ssh4rt 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]j3ssh4rt 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoWe just rescued two identical looking cats over the weekend.  (Named the girl Babou and the boy Gizmoe.)  However, my other choices for the girl were Sansa and Khaleesi. (Both Game of Thrones references.)

What have you done to cheer yourself up when you're feeling down?  by  TAabc123in  AskReddit[+]j3ssh4rt 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]j3ssh4rt 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoFirst, keep reminding yourself that whatever you are going through right now is temporary. In five weeks, or five months, or five years everything will change. You will have bad days, but you will also have good days. Second, remember that it's ok to feel sad. We all get that "blue" feeling sometimes. Some of us hide it better than others. But we all feel it. Third, find someplace really busy. (I like the mall, but it can be anyplace where there are lots of people.) Find a bench or table and have a seat.  Take notice of the people that walk by. Really pay attention to them. Every single one of them has a story. Try to imagine what brings them there. What they go home to. And I can assure you that a few of them are going through a similarly rough (or possibly even worse) time than you are at this moment. And they will also get through it.Time moves forward.  Every minute of every day passes. And we are allowed to have rough times. We are allowed to be sad and frustrated and angry at times. But that also means that we will also experience happiness and joy and love. Just wait and see.  Even if it seems like you're waiting for longer than you want to, it will get better. One final piece of advice. Try to find someone to talk to. Never stop looking. Find a doctor, teacher, colleague, anyone. Keep talking until someone listens.  Please. Never give up trying. Before you know it, this will all be a memory and your life will have changed. It always does, and that is the best part of all. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, who is your all time favorite lyricist?  by  cheezyguy12in  Music[+]j3ssh4rt 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]j3ssh4rt 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoTIL that Neutral Milk Hotel is an actual band, led by Jeff Magnum, and not just something made-up by PandR writers for April Ludgate to swoon over. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy girlfriend and I had an argument this morning.
