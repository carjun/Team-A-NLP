Can't imagine anything like this happening there.  Something is odd here- the shooter was a 24 year old NJ man?  What the hell was he doing in northern Fairfield county with 4 guns and a bulletproof vest?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Anything to place the blame on something mechanical and incidental, rather than something systemic.

This is the real issue we should be discussing rather than more or less guns.  We're creating a society that makes everyone miserable, and people are going nuts because of it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

The cops shot, I think, seven people trying to take down the gunman.  Ironically, the gunman only shot his target.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]montyjack 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]montyjack 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoContrary to popular belief, most cops train with their guns about once a year.  If you look at the ESB shooting that happened a few months back, the gunman hit his target and left.  The cops shot seven (iirc) people trying to take him down.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]montyjack 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]montyjack 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour agoGiven that there has been no substantial change in gun laws recently, doesn't this strike you as odd?  This isn't per se a pro or anti gun rant, but really, doesn't it strike you as odd that there's been a wave of high-publicity shootings recently without apparent cause?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]montyjack 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]montyjack 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoIt's plenty appropriate, just like any time.  It's acceptable for both pro and anti gun advocates to discuss gun laws.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJon Stewart Tears Into Fox News For Arbitrarily Deciding When And Where People Can Talk About Gun Control  by  UndrDawgin  politics[+]montyjack 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]montyjack 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoEvery time a thread like this comes up, no matter where, no matter how conservative or liberal, the results are the same- a minority of Americans, and mostly Europeans come out in support of gun control and EVERYONE else opposes it.  Yet this issue is presented in the media as if the nation is somehow truly divided.  To me, this is similar to the abortion debate- it's an issue that's been decided, but a vocal minority keeps trying to push their point of view.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJon Stewart Tears Into Fox News For Arbitrarily Deciding When And Where People Can Talk About Gun Control  by  UndrDawgin  politics[+]montyjack 6 points7 points8 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]montyjack 6 points7 points8 points 3 days agoThis is a side of gun control that no one discusses, but should.  My views on gun control would be considered extreme by most- I think private citizens should be able to get licenses for automatic weapons.  However, I do believe that in order to get a gun license, you should have to train in using that weapon or class of weapon, and you should be required to train in it a certain number of hours yearly.Additionally, I believe we should expose our children to firearms earlier, so their idea of what a gun is doesn't come from the latest Call of Duty game.  Create a gun culture which, while permissive, practices strict discipline with regards to firearms.permalinksavecontextfull commentsColorado students accused of sickening class with pot-laced brownies - Something honestly seems Weird About This...  by  TheWiredWorldin  conspiracy[+]montyjack 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]montyjack 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoPlease, do not tease.permalinksavecontextfull commentsExcuse me sir but your steroids are touching me  by  yourfavouritemooin  funny[+]montyjack 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]montyjack 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoSo it IS that guy!permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow does this idea sound: what if we varied tax on high incomes according to how well the economy performed for everyone: the higher the average wage, the less that wealthy people got taxed.

You could argue it's not good for them to buy Ferraris because some of that money goes overseas, but building a house, or a building- well, that IS an investment.  They have to hire people to do that, and those people get paid, which boosts the economy.The problem is when ONLY rich folks have money to spend, and the economy shifts to suit just them at the expense of everyone else.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow does this idea sound: what if we varied tax on high incomes according to how well the economy performed for everyone: the higher the average wage, the less that wealthy people got taxed.

As I recall, they couldn't find one who was willing to take the job until they rescinded that rule.Ironically, as recently as the 1950s, corporate CEOs didn't make substantially more than their employees.  They made decent upper-middle-class livings, but that was about it.In short, wealthy people have gotten spoiled, and will pitch temper tantrums and refuse to work (which they can do because they're wealthy) if they don't get what they want.  By allowing CEO compensation to creep as high as it has, we really screwed ourselves.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
