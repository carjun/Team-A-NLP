NYC isn't isolated city. It is easy to buy guns just outside NYC and then bring them in. If someone is going to try to massacre a school filled with children, I would rather they try to do it with a knife instead of a gun. It would go completely differently.permalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 11 points12 points13 points 1 day ago (20 children)[]penguin8508 11 points12 points13 points 1 day agoThat was my point...that even if we put firmer gun control laws in individual states and cities, that doesn't stop people from doing it.  Let's say every gun in America was destroyed, somehow.  Let's say that happened.Does that magically erase people's impulse to kill?  Were people killing each other in huge numbers prior to the advent of the gun?Guns make it easier to kill people in large numbers.  No argument there.But do we also outlaw batteries and fertilizer, so that people can't kill children with bombs?  Do you think that wouldn't happen?permalinksaveparent[+]atarusama 10 points11 points12 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]atarusama 10 points11 points12 points 23 hours agoHas anyone not seen the parallels? There was a similar incident in China where firearms are banned... a man with a knife went into a school and tried the same thing.... they had 20 injured children, while we have at least 18 dead children. Does this not give you at least SOME insight?permalinksaveparent[+]Time_for_Stories 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Time_for_Stories 7 points8 points9 points 22 hours agoPersonally I'd rather have them injured than killed.permalinksaveparent[+]BulletBilll 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]BulletBilll 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoPeople kill mainly for two reasons, compassion or compulsion, both of which irrational. Something goes through your head and suddenly you act upon it, it's easy to go through with it if you have a gun, just pull the trigger. With guns being harder to find you might already cut back on those kinds of murders, where a kid get's angry at his parents or another kid, or a wife/husband getting into an argument and one ends up dead.Guns have no practical use other than you kill or injure. Knives, batteries and fertilizer however have primary uses which aren't to mame or murder.permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (16 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThat was my point...that even if we put firmer gun control laws in individual states and cities, that doesn't stop people from doing it.That is why we should do it on the federal level But do we also outlaw batteries and fertilizer, so that people can't kill children with bombs? Do you think that wouldn't happen?The federal government monitors fertilizer more than it does guns because of terrorists.permalinksaveparent[+]penguin8508 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (11 children)[]penguin8508 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoI'm not even having an argument with you about gun control right now.  I'm acknowledging that guns allow people to kill in high numbers at a high rate.What I am asking you is, 1) do you acknowledge that people will find a way to do this regardless, 2) were people killing others in high numbers prior to the advent of the gun, and 3) doesn't what's CAUSING people to do these things warrant more attention than what they're using to do it?permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (10 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agodo you acknowledge that people will find a way to do this regardlessYes, but its a hell of a lot harder to committ a massacre with a knife instead of a gunwere people killing others in high numbers prior to the advent of the gunyes but disenfranchised 20 year olds weren't going on mass murder sprees in elementary schools quite as oftendoesn't what's CAUSING people to do these things warrant more attention than what they're using to do it?We have to be pragmatic in how we solve the problem. Ideally, we need MASSIVELY increased spending in mental health, but I don't think that is going to happen any time soon. In the short, we need to take the weapons of mass killing out of the hands of those who would commit such atrocities.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (7 children)[]montyjack 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoI'm sorry- did you just say we should give up our rights because we can't be bothered to do the correct thing and address the SOURCE of the problem?permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (6 children)[]brokenex -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoI don't think people have the rights to own weapon that present a massive threat to society. I think that argument is based on an extreme reading of the 2nd amendment.I have been a deer hunter my whole life. I own numerous hunting rifles and shotguns, but that doesn't prevent me from seeing the truth of this situation.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (5 children)[]montyjack -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoIf you're truly a hunter then you know any one of the guns you own would pose an extreme threat to humans too.permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*(4 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago*I don't own any semi-automatic weapons -- well except for a .22. The mass lethality of a weapon goes massively up when a weapon becomes semi-automatic and automatic.If they were to ban semi-automatic rifles and pistols. It wouldn't effect me in the least. I don't need a semi-auto to hunt deer. In fact, I am mildly disgusted when I'm sitting in the woods and hear someone unload 5-7 rapid shots with a semi. permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (3 children)[]montyjack -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoPlenty of shotguns and hunting rifles are semi-auto. Also, can't think of too many handguns that need to be cocked between shots.permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]penguin8508 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]penguin8508 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoI think we're on the same page here, but don't you think removing weapons is going to take an enormous amount of funding too?  We're talking about increased border security to prevent illegal imports, increased police force, etc.  That stuff doesn't come cheap either.  Mental illness affects a society on every level---education, economy, safety, structure of family, etc.  permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoI come from a family of therapists and I am a psychology grad, so I understand the need for increased mental health spending, but I don't think that it is going to be a panacea in this situation. Most people who would commit a tragedy like this don't seek out help.We're talking about increased border security to prevent illegal imports, increased police force, etc.Not really. Most guns used in North/South America come from the USA. Right now guns flow out, not in. People easily buy guns on the American side of the border and smuggle them into Mexico. permalinksaveparent[+]OWmWfPk -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours ago (3 children)[]OWmWfPk -2 points-1 points0 points 23 hours agohttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1376982.stmYou don't need a gun. It doesn't go completely differently. Getting guns out of America wont fix this.permalinksaveparent[+]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]brokenex 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoI would rather that 8 were killed instead of 26+. How do you put a cost on those 18 lives?permalinksaveparent[+]OWmWfPk 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]OWmWfPk 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoI'd prefer none.. switching the focus to identifying and getting people who are sick enough to do this kind of thing into treatment might be a better allocation of resourcespermalinksaveparent[+]Time_for_Stories 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Time_for_Stories 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoDoing both wouldn't hurt.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
