However, gun control advocates are pressing Obama to turn his tears into actions and push for stronger firearm regulations.  Hours after the killing of 27 people in Newtown, Obama said that its important to make sure no more tragedies like this take place in the future.  "Our hearts are broken today," Obama said in a brief statement at the White House briefing room, frequently pausing to wipe tears from his eyes. "The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them: birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams."  The president vowed to take a meaningful action against gun violence without considering its political consequences.  But New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg criticized Obama, saying that merely calling for taking "meaningful action" is not enough.  We need immediate action. Bloomberg said. We have heard all the rhetoric before.  This year, there have been at least seven similarly tragic incidents, all including gun violence and taking precious lives of innocent Americans. Politics be damned, Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) said yesterday in a statement about the shooting in his home state. There is not a single person in America who doesnt fear it will happen again. Its time we recognize the danger and address it.  Several Republicans, who have backed the National Rifle Association all this time, avoided talking about firearm regulations. We need to find out what happened and what drove this individual to this place, Rep. Cathy McMorris RodgersCathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) said in an interview on C-SPAN. She said that the officials need to look at what drives a crazy person to do these kinds of things and make sure that we are enforcing the laws that are currently on the books.  The NRA has declined to comment on the Newtown school shooting, saying that until all the facts are thoroughly known, nothing can be said as to what drove the killings.  1 of 1               Image: Reuters      wendyzachary is based in Texas, Texas, United States of America,      and is a Reporter for Allvoices.Report CredibilityShare:Tweet    Credibility ReachGlobal ReachThis report's viewers come from the following                    countries:United States of America (97.2%)United Kingdom (1.7%)Canada (0.4%)Australia (0.4%)2 other countries (0.2%)READ MORE:gun control, Obama, firearm regulation, mass shootings, connecticut school, National Rifle Association, cathy mcmorris, John Larson, Sandy Hook ElementaryMore News From:Newtown : CT : USAAdvertisementPost a CommentComments: 0Enter your comment belowAdd Your CommentSave ChangesCancelAdvertisementRelated Allvoices ContributionsSenior democrats call for greater gun control in wake of Newtown ...By: arkarIn the wake of the tragic Newtown, Connecticut shootings that claimed the lives of 26 people, senior democrats have called for greater gun control, urging that stronger measures be put in place to restrict access firearms.Friday saw one of the most tragic and deadly shootings in United States history as lone gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, ... 2 hours agoMan arrested after opening fire in mall parking lot, another for ...By: tjlarsonIn the wake of the terrible tragedy which took place in Connecticut on Friday, two more significant events involving guns have emerged.On Saturday, police arrested a southern California man after he allegedly opened fire with a barrage of more than 50 shots in the parking lot of a crowded mall in Newport Beach, Calif.Police said the ... 2 hours agoThe American gun-control controversy: Can we preserve the Second ...By: tjlarsonThe Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre has reignited an issue that has been hotly debated in the US for many years.
