Dr Jeannie Pasacreta, a nurse practitioner and psychologist in this picture postcard New England town, told me that neighbours were cancelling Christmas parties and taking down decorations, unable to celebrate amidst such searing grief. Grief counsellors arrived at the firehouse where families have been waiting before going to identify their dead children. Firefighters laid flowers at the white sign which says "Sandy Hook school, visitors welcome". That spot is rapidly becoming a makeshift memorial. A couple laid a bouquet, then embraced one another, weeping as they walked away.People are at a loss, said Dr Pasacreta, who believes the lesson of this killing is to give more help to those showing signs of mental illness. As reporters from around the world gathered outside the firehouse, there was a chilling reminder of what had happened. A black medical examiner's truck passed us, pulling a huge white refrigerated vehicle that is likely to have served as a mortuary for those killed in the shooting. This reporter wept at the thought of the children's bodies inside. Grief amid Christmas scenes The gunman killed his mother at the home they shared before driving to the school in her car and opening fire.  Reports say the guns used in the attacks were registered to her.President Obama has urged "meaningful action" against gun crime in the US in the wake of the attack. "As a country we have been through this too many times," he said in an emotional White House address."We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."The children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary were aged between five and 10, although the exact ages of the victims have not been revealed.All the victims have now been identified, Lt Vance said, and their names would be released later. Principal Dawn Hochsprung is believed to be among them.'Absolutely quiet'Friday's killings took place in two rooms within a single section of the school, police have said. The shooting lasted just a few minutes.Flowers have been laid outside the schoolAs they heard the shots, teachers in other parts of the building tried to protect children by locking doors and ushering them into closets."I told them we had to be absolutely quiet, because I was just so afraid if he did come in, then he would hear us and just start shooting the door," said teacher Kaitlin Roig. "I said to them, 'I need you to know that I love you all very much and that it's going to be okay', because I thought that was the last thing they were ever going to hear."Library clerk Maryann Jacob described telling 18 children to crawl into a storage room, before barricading the door with a filing cabinet. "We set them up with paper and crayons," she said.Dr Jeannie Pasacreta, a nurse practitioner and psychologist who has been advising parents on how to talk to their children, says neighbours have been cancelling Christmas parties and taking down decorations. Officials say Ms Hochsprung  was killed while lunging at the gunman, AP news agency reported. Board of Education chairwoman Debbie Liedlien said administrators were emerging from a meeting when the gunman forced his way into the school, and they ran toward them.Brother questionedEarly reports named 24-year-old Ryan Lanza, of Hoboken, New Jersey, as the gunman, but unnamed officials later said his brother Adam was the suspect.Ryan Lanza was questioned by police, US media reported, but has not been named as a suspect.The attack at Newtown is the second deadliest shooting attack at a US school or university.In 2007, a student at Virginia Tech university killed 32 people and injured many more.More on This StoryConnecticut school shootingHow it happenedA timeline of how a gunman rampaged through the Connecticut town of Newtown, killing 27 people, including 20 children.Profile of suspectMardell: Gun control?As it happenedObama: 'Heal the broken-hearted' WatchGovernor: 'Unspeakable tragedy' WatchNewtown victims face years of healing WatchPupil: 'Everyone went to ground' WatchDunblane's lessonsWitnesses recount shooting horrorIn pictures: School shootingFrom other news sitesSky News  US School Shooting: Gunman Kills 27 8 hrs agoAbout these resultsShare this pageDeliciousDiggFacebookredditStumbleUponTwitterEmailPrintMore US & Canada storiesRSSBenghazi furore ends Rice hopesUN Ambassador Susan Rice withdraws her name for consideration from the race to succeed Hillary Clinton as US secretary of state, the White House says.'Stalking apps' face ban in USNo UK charges for Gary McKinnonTop storiesGallstone operation for MandelaEgyptians voting into the nightRocket attack on Pakistan airportKate nurse left 'unfillable void'Court orders Argentine ship freedFeatures & AnalysisHairy crabsThe delicacy of the autumn in eastern China 10 things Female fish fancy males attracted to other males, and other nuggets Losing faithJapan questions traditional party politics Tweets of the weekIkea monkey, Susan Rice and North Korea - in under 140 characters Most PopularShared1: Vodka 'saved elephants from cold'2: China school hit by knife attack3: Obama plea after school shooting4: Nelson Mandela undergoes surgery5: How the internet is changing EnglishRead1: School gunman 'forced his way in'2: Adam Lanza: friendless gunman3: School shooting: How it happened4: Automatic net porn block rejected5: Will Obama address gun control?6: Indians begin to talk about S&M7: Cathedral prays for Kate nurse8: Rocket attack on Pakistan airport9: Egypt set to vote on constitution10: Nasa admits 'Everest' photo errorVideo/Audio1: 'I thought we were all going to die' Watch2: Planes struggle to land in Spain Watch3: Teacher 'piled students into bathroom' Watch4: One-minute World News Watch5: Handcuffed man steals police car Watch6: US mourns shooting victims Watch7: Pupil: 'Everyone went on the ground' Watch8: Obama: 'Heal the broken hearted' Watch9: Lanza ex-neighbour 'sick to stomach' Watch10: 'Evil visited our community' WatchElsewhere on the BBCBooks to get carried away withDiscover some of the best travel writing stocking fillers this festive seasonProgrammesClick WatchWill computers ever be capable of being creative  interpreting a drama or composing music?ServicesMobileConnected TVNews feedsAlertsE-mail newsAbout BBC NewsEditors' blogBBC College of JournalismNews sourcesMedia Action    BBC links    Mobile siteTerms of UseAbout the BBC     Advertise With UsPrivacyBBC Help     Ad ChoicesCookiesAccessibility Help     Parental GuidanceContact Us       BBC  2012 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
