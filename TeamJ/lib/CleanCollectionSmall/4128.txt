Job ad from a galaxy far, far away | The Advocate - HepburnWeatherYour 4-day local weather forecastFeedbackWhat do you think of our new website?            Sunday December 16, 2012        EntertainmentLarger / SmallerNight Mode    Job ad from a galaxy far, far away      By            Asher Moses          Dec. 3, 2012, 2:01 p.m.Wanted: A Melbourne-based real-life version of Juno Eclipse from the video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, for a drive/secretary role in an exciting new publishing business.The bizarre job ad appeared on Seek late last week from Black Sun Publishing, and was removed from the site after spreading virally across the web in hundreds of tweets according to Topsy.com. But it remains in Google's cache.I have a pretty upbeat personality and I think a certain degree of human flair, the prospective employer writes, before describing his intention to create a media business that will be a mix of ABC Good Game, The Economist, Star Wars, Alien, The Nerdist Podcast.The candidate must be a 21- to 28-year-old female (gamer chick a plus), love travelling, sensible, intelligent, good with computers, well versed in cars and automobile mechanics and able to handle secretary duties.This role, as geeky as it sounds, is largely based on Juno Eclipse from The Force Unleashed," the ad reads before providing an image of the video game character.Not too fussed how awesome you look; well that's a lie ...  if you look and speak like Juno I probably hire you regardless of say well anything, even disclosures of violent psychotic fits of rage on your resume.The job poster appears to fancy himself as a real-life version of Force Unleashed protagonist Starkiller, who Juno drives around in the game and later becomes a love interest.Pretty much I would like our relationship to be purely professional and plutonic, well unless this being altered by some Oedipus like fate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvKrELFopUI, the ad reads.Applicants who like Rage Against the Machine, U2, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Tegan & Sarah, Coldplay, Foo Fighters, LCD Soundsystem, to the front of the queue.The car, my old beamer, will be dubbed Rogue Shadow (the name of the car in the game), but plans are afoot to upgrade this to a new BMW 5 Series pending on favourable market conditions and the hands of fate.The standard wage will be $20 an hour, but this is negotiable based on experience, such as secretarial experience in corporate environments, or spent some years at ADFA, or have a pHD in metaphysics, or speak another language fluently.Anyways, looking forward to you! Remember, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all started out as quirky absurd ideas.The poster of the job did not provide much identifying information aside from saying he was a commerce student setting up a new publishing business.Seek spokesman Peter Osborne said: The ad was taken down because it was in breach of our terms and conditions relating to appropriate content.Tweet      Print StorySaveLatest News Funding boosted for 'carbon and capture' project Killer forced his wayPerfect pupil's next big test - finding a jobMan dies as inflatable raft upturnsClass heroes save lives Editor's Picks Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireFun at the Clunes show.Newlyncouple shocked by truck accident Popular Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeMemories flow of Daylesford's Boathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesFloats needed for DaylesfordNew Years Eve GalaDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireMultimediaGallery: The Boathouse Cafe burns      Gallery: Keele BreenHannah Knight catches up with local artist Keele Breen.
