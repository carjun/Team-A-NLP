Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Limeyoryank 12 points13 points14 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank 12 points13 points14 points 1 day agoI also find the whole pro and anti gun community using this as a soap box to justify their points completely sickening. Why don't both sides STFU and take a moment to think about the families of these kids, instead of getting self righteous? permalinksavecontextfull comments4chan on video games.  by  sincerepooperin  funny[+]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agogeniuspermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the most ridiculous thing someone has ever tried to convince you is true? (Keeping religion and politics out of it)  by  Washain  AskReddit[+]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoI'm an American who moved to the UK for a few years back in 2001. I had a job at a nightclub, and one night after beers, someone asks me how many US states there are. I state that there are 50, to which a few people start laughing and say there are 51. I counter with Costa Rica technically isn't a state, to which people stare at me with a confused stare. At this point a giant doorman with gorilla arms, lurches into the conversation and says "Idiots, there are 52, everyone knows that. Have you not heard of Hawaii?" then walks away smug. Everyone then turns to me with smug faces. I just stared in bewilderment and wandered off.permalinksavecontextfull comments"Thank you cast and crew for a record breaking season!"  by  inmate2in  thewalkingdead[+]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoThank you for doing that. Apologies for coming across rudely, but you may of saved someones job. Producers can get crazy. all it would take is one to see this, and they would want to put in some crazy inpractical scheme of signing in and out your callsheet, or no longer having paper only digital. OR making the 2nd AD and Office PA watermark EVERY callsheet. That's the 6th circle of hell right there. Right next to laminated sides for "tank" shots.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTitan Quest added to Humble THQ Bundle  by  rphillipps16in  Games[+]Limeyoryank 2 points3 points4 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank 2 points3 points4 points 8 days agoThis is a great game. For alot of us it filled the void after Diablo 2. I've gone back to it multiple times, as the multi class builds offer ALOT of variety. The mythological world is a great set up, and its generally good fun. Yes its a bit linear, but considering its age, its well worth it.definitely get the unofficial fan patch as mentioned earlier. permalinksavecontextfull comments"Thank you cast and crew for a record breaking season!"  by  inmate2in  thewalkingdead[+]Limeyoryank 5 points6 points7 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank 5 points6 points7 points 8 days agoHope to god no one saw you taking a photo of that. You've broken your NDA clause, and you didn't blur the office number in the top corner either. so the office PA and coordinators are going to be PISSED when they start getting random calls. This is incredibly unprofessional, and I sincerely hope I never encounter you on a filmset.permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuentin Tarantino explains why he wants to quit making movies.

Did you remove a mod, then continue playing? The save thinks the mod is still there, when its not, and the whole thing freaks out. Do you get these artifacts in older saves? Keep going back in them until you find one that doesn't. Maybe figure out from there what you did. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey Reddit, it's around 2am in the UK right now and I need to stay awake until 11am.

You can craft a well detailed hammer, and some great kite shields. The helm can be a robed hood or plate if you prefer. Pretty much I only use this for any type of battle caster/cleric playthrough. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25642one of the armour options also allows you to remove the front guard (looks better without imo). check it out! permalinksavecontextfull commentsI find the lyrics to "Baby It's Cold Outside" incredibly creepy.

Then go to files at the top, and search under the various categories. Generally search for whatever has the highest recommendations or has been downloaded the most. check comments to see if any issues are there, and make sure the mod you're using is updated. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre there any plans to make movies from the rest of author Philip Pullman's "his dark materials" trilogy?  by  roofermannin  movies[+]Limeyoryank -1 points0 points1 point 21 days ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank -1 points0 points1 point 21 days agoIt was my understanding that the first was very expensive to make, combined with a lackluster box office turn out. Also the whole backlash from the Christian right didn't help matters with its marketability either. Shame really, the books were a great read. permalinksavecontextfull comments(Don't Upvote) Any Good Single Player Games You All Recommend?  by  RunnerMeepin  gaming[+]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 21 days ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 21 days agoon the PC, you could go delving into skyrim Nexus, and play a modded version of skyrim. its been a year now, and the modding community has done ALOT. Alternatively, you could go for something a bit older (for instance I just picked up Knights of the Old Republic 2) that was on sale on steam for 2 bucks? Get the addon, and experience one of the best RPG's ever made. Could go even more old school and pick up baldurs gate 2. Alternatively, Fallout 3 modded, new vegas. permalinksavecontextfull commentsYou know what?

Any special or rare posters I should look out for?  by  IamRiderin  movies[+]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoDefinitely get some help from a professional movie buff. If you're not sure where to start, perhaps your nearest university's film department, or if you have an independent video store, you could put up a notice. From there I would branch to the collectors, and they may have some advice on where to turn there. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhile Dressed as Batman on Halloween, I asked Harley Quinn on a date.

I moved to Vancouver and am now marrying a canadian girl. Most of my relatives and friends will have to travel anyway for the wedding, and since it'll be a small amount  of people due to the very reasons you listed, we figured why not get married on a beach? Also my fiance doesn't want a big fancy wedding, and the prices of putting a wedding on in Vancouver are completely ridiculous cost wise.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some great but affordable destination wedding options in Mexico or the Caribbean?  by  Limeyoryankin  AskReddit[+]Limeyoryank[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]Limeyoryank[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoBig fan of the worlds deadliest city, but I find people freak out about being invited to weddings there. permalinksavecontextfull comments25001What are some great but affordable destination wedding options in Mexico or the Caribbean?
