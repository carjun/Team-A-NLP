Shit makes me so furious, I don't really attribute video games to being part of the problem (even when criminals have even flat out said they use it as "practice") but one thing that's for god damn sure is that shit like this makes it harder and harder to argue against claims like that. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGot Alpha invite, question about NDA.  by  Cyathemin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoAny NDA is almost self-explanatory. It means non-disclosure, meaning don't disclose information. The very very obvious ways to disclose information are media, either video, images or of course, live video. I mean, really, it's not rocket science. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrader Joe's coming to downtown  by  ashketchemin  Boise[+]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI dunno what the obsession is with building every new store in downtown Boise. permalinksavecontextfull comments4123For those who like the fall colors.

This isn't the one-stop give you every answer you want corner. I have no idea why people think that's what dev blogs are supposed to be. SE has always had a very hush hush approach to any game details and since have really started to broaden their approach. This blog is intended only as a supplemental flow of tiny tidbits of random information. permalinksavecontextfull commentsALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO SQUARE ENIX HOLDINGS CO., LTD.  by  justamemoryin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoI don't expect it at all to be a playable race, I'd rather have Qiqirn.

Kepler introduced up to 4 monitors with it's 600 series. I know my GTX 660 TI has 4 ports, 2x DVI, 1x HDMI and 1x Display Port, and you can run all 4 with just the one card. This is a new thing just for Kepler though, and I dunno if the 650 supports it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCompilation of big Sheever ravages.

I remember how much of a god damn achievement that felt like to me. Even years into the game, I still felt proud to have am ax level WHM. they were sure as hell a lot more rare than in XIV. Sort of a bummer. All I see in XIV is WHM's. I consider healing an art and seeing so many WHM's in the end days of XIV kills that feeling for sure. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn - Quests and Combat (Alpha)  by  Ceravicin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoYeah. That's a pretty good perspective on it. I agree on almost everything in terms of Abyssea and burns. Then again, I did BLM burn my way via level sync in Qufim Island from like, lvl 20 all the way to 75. I don't consider it that cheap though. It was a damn blast and I still had to party for dozens of hours, meeting great people. I just want people to have things to do with other people, at the very basic casual level. Behest's were the closest original XIV concept that did that, but they seemed to lose their charm very fast.  I know FATE intends to change that and I hope it does. I also agree that some content was really out of reach for some. I myself never got SEA access or LIMBUS. Hell, I don't even know if they're the same thing. I got as far as a bit after the Minotaur fight in the aqueducts. It was fun, but always a pain to try to get people for. It's hilarious to think of how much time I spent playing XI, how I had like, 6 or 7 job's at 75, 90 etc. And that there was so much content I never saw. I never saw sea, never finished that damn sky quest where you fight the dark versions of job's or w/e. Never got to the advanced dynamis spots. But for me it was alright, because there was just always something to do. I want there to always be some fun content to do in XIV. I know that ARR is a reboot, not an expansion or anything. I'm patient enough to know that the real added content is "coming soon" and I just want them to nail it so bad. I am glad that level sync is planed for release. At least, I remember posts in the forums indicating it was per dev's. That will be a great way to go back and enjoy so content again without having to re create your character. I just know that people need to socialize in ARR. You stick with a game when you have friends that make it more fun. Even if the game isn't fun, you'll more often stay with it if you have friends to keep you company. From a business perspective, it's within SE's best interest to make reason to have friends and develop system that encourage this -- that's sort of the only reason I object to the solo-leveling system, but as you said as long as they offer fun content along the way, it should be good. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn - Quests and Combat (Alpha)  by  Ceravicin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoI really hope so. It's the part that XIV constantly lacked for me. It's also compounded by the fact that leveling has been severely gimped. Though, this is part due to the difference of 50 being the new cap. Getting to 50 in XI could arguable be done with relative ease in a week or two. 54 ~ 75 was when it really started to grind. Even so, we all clearly know that leveling 1~50 in XIV was nothing close to XI. I only really know of 3 camp's in XIV. I remember once killing lots of puk's in a mine outside of Ul'dah. There were the raptor's out somewhere in Limsa, and the dog's past the merc camp to the north zone. You never really even spent much time leveling in a party as it was. I went from 1 to 40 on my cnj/whm before ever seeing a relative shout for a party. I know a lot of people love the freedom to solo xo successfully, but I dunno, I just really hope it's a bit different in ARR. permalinksavecontextfull commentsFINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn - Quests and Combat (Alpha)  by  Ceravicin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoI think that if I could get one solid feature into ARR by talking to Yoshi himself it would be a much greater emphasis on being forced to assemble a party of players to do things, be it leveling, dungeons, quests, etc. I want people to use the party flag system, I want you to be forced to seek a party, I want sure-fire leveling spots where people get together to party up. I just miss that aspect so bad from XI. Great way to learn  your role in a party. Great way to meet new people and socialize. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSecond wave of invites for December has rolled out.  by  thunderbolthelpedin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago4chan is unfortunately a fantastic place for content / asking testers some off hand Q & A. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSecond wave of invites for December has rolled out.  by  thunderbolthelpedin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoWhat really irks me is how many alpha testers report people just AFK'ing. Literally unacceptable. If it's a stress test they should just invite over the amount of able players and have an entry queue. I feel most people shouldn't even want to play for hours on hours. get in, check it out, level a bit, get out and move on. I have plenty of things to keep me pre occupied, I just feel the way they're "stress testing" isn't very efficient. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHalo battlefield?  by  Lawlguesswho1337in  halo[+]darkm0d -3 points-2 points-1 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d -3 points-2 points-1 points 9 days agoThat'd be fantastic if it came out on PC. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWoodworking Lv18  by  Alpha_Rebornin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoAh, good call.

My carpentry was like, 20 ish. Mats dropped from mob's in ridiculous amounts. I'm hoping that it changes a bit because I don't honestly want 50 different types of fur's and leathers after an hour of partying. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWoodworking Lv18  by  Alpha_Rebornin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 2 points3 points4 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 2 points3 points4 points 10 days agoIn XIV, at level 1 crafting you had no skills, but you had 3 types of craft you wanted to do. Rapid, standard and bold... I think it was bold. Basically rapid gave huge progress, virtually no quality and cost lots of durability if you failed the attempt. Bold was the same, but for quality. standard was the in the middle raised both progress and quality, less chance to lose a lot of durability. In ARR, It's been noted you'll earn those skills, to less confuse an entry level crafter this time around. You'll start with just standard I believe, then learn skills that let you focus on either progress or durability. After that, you'll learn the actual skills like, "gain immunity from failing an attempt for your next 3 attempts" or perhaps "Double the success of your next attempt", stuff like that. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWoodworking Lv18  by  Alpha_Rebornin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 2 points3 points4 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 2 points3 points4 points 10 days agoYeah you'll always need crystals, I just forgot to type that for the gear part and yeah, can get every craft to 50. It's also MUCH more important now (subject to change) but basically every craft will give you it's own individual skills. You'll learn "x" skill from blacksmith and "y" skill from carpentry. Down the road, you'll want to borrow skills from other craft's and combine them to achieve the most effective combination of skills for the job at hand.Correct, a level 50 goldsmith cannot repair a silk robe. (There are exceptions, lol) Certain repairs might require a hybrid of skills. Say, a caster staff that has golden trim. You might need to be CRP 50, GLD 20. This was one of the parts of crafting Yoshi said he felt was a bit too hardcore, so it might change. But as it stands, sometimes you needed multiple craft's as a variety of levels to both MAKE and repair certain recipes. I never got too much into DoL, but I think it's nearly identical. pre-ARR DoL's got skills like sneak and invis once they hit certain levels in botany, harvesting, woodcutting, etc. They also have a 1 - 50 leveling system, same sort of principal. As far as how I've seen it in ARR, you get to a logging point, inspect the node and it will tell you the items you can attempt to harvest from it. It also gives you relative success rates for each item. Say you'll have a 30% chance to harvest birch lumber, and 70% chance for maple lumber. Nodes also appear shared. Lets say you can harvest 3 times before it runs out, that's 1 time each for 3 people at the same node, or 3 for one person. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWoodworking Lv18  by  Alpha_Rebornin  ffxiv[+]darkm0d 6 points7 points8 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]darkm0d 6 points7 points8 points 10 days agoI find it more engaging than most. But it's still just crafting. It's more exciting than putting shit into some device, click go, and wait a couple of minutes while it churns out dozens of items. I'm not sure how crafting could get much more interesting. permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
