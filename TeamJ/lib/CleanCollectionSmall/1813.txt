For the champions, it actually lists them all and then if you choose a champion they already own it'll give an error.  If you wanted to make a list of the champions your friends have it'd be pretty hard, haha. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSnowdown Showdown is Here  by  HansVonBurgerin  leagueoflegends[+]Diali 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Diali 4 points5 points6 points 2 days agoActually, I think the bug happened a bit after it came out.  I believe you're speaking of when his autoattack didn't have an animation, yes?It was unfortunate too, because at the time he was very strong in the jungle. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDay 1 | IGN ProLeague Season5 | Group Stage | Live Update/Discussion Thread!  by  SaLiPandain  leagueoflegends[+]Diali 4 points5 points6 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]Diali 4 points5 points6 points 15 days agoHe said he'd shave his head if he got so many facebook or twitter followers, can't remember which.Obviously, Reddit gave him a hand in that as well ;)permalinksavecontextfull commentsCheap lunch in Louisville?  by  boco0412in  boulder[+]Diali 0 points1 point2 points 18 days ago (0 children)[]Diali 0 points1 point2 points 18 days agoDo Gasoline Lollipops still play there every tuesday?

Three target bans, 5 jungle ganks in the first 7 minutes, team ends up down almost 20 kills.

In his case, it was Scarred for Life.  After that, he wanted a name that was short (which he finds he likes a lot better than long names) and he shortened it into Scarra. permalinksavecontextfull commentsELOhell vs. Armageddon is the biggest joke I have ever seen.  by  PhattyBaconin  leagueoflegends[+]Diali 1 point2 points3 points 23 days ago (0 children)[]Diali 1 point2 points3 points 23 days agoI do hope they learn from this display though, since it weighs heavily on the organizers of the tournaments.  I hope the scene in Singapore get a chance to grow from this and become stronger, it'd be nice to see more healthy competition. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Elementz from Team Curse otherwise known as the Bench King.

They eventually changed the trail to what it is today (off-white with little ghosts coming out) and the Nidalee skin was ignored.  I think they saw that since they were going back and updating her skins that they'd add it for the people that already bought it.To me, it's awesome that they did this.permalinksavecontextfull commentsComprehensive post on the 11/20 PBE Update: Champ/Item changes, new particles on red/blue/baron, "Hud Animations", and more.  by  moobeatin  leagueoflegends[+]Diali 1 point2 points3 points 24 days ago (0 children)[]Diali 1 point2 points3 points 24 days agoWow, they added the particles to Bewitching Nidalee that people wanted way back when Haunting Nocturne got his trail turned white.I am now even more happy that I bought the skin at that time.
