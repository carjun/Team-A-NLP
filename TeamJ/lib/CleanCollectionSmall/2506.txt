It would arguably reduce the number of victims.  It could also potentially increase the number of victims if the "good guy" hits bystanders instead of the shooter.  The goal should be to find ways to prevent the shootings from occurring in the first place, not recreate the wild wild west the hallways of an already bloody school and pretend that it's justice.  Putting a gun in the hand of a faculty member does NOT guarantee a better or different outcome.  It provides the possibility of both better and worse outcomes and doesn't alter the original situation in any way, and that is all that it does.  permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 41 seconds ago (0 children)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 41 seconds agoI cannot see this situation being made worse by a faculty member with a hand gun. permalinksaveparent[+]fedupwith -1 points0 points1 point 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]fedupwith -1 points0 points1 point 25 minutes agoClearly, an administrator.permalinksaveparent[+]Fluffiebunnie 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]Fluffiebunnie 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes agoThe janitor could've gotten the gun anyway if he was prepared to murder someone.Things need to be pretty bad before people start acquiring illegal guns to protect themselves.permalinksaveparent[+]timothytandem 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes ago (1 child)[]timothytandem 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes agoYes because he couldn't do the same with a knife, if someone is so determined to kill somebody taking away one weapon won't keep them from finding another. permalinksaveparent[+]Cylinsier 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]Cylinsier 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes agoI'm not saying you should take away his gun.  I'm just saying that when he shot somebody, the answer isn't to give every other faculty and staff member a gun.  You don't put a fire out by pouring gasoline on it.  permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
