If he starts crying a good clip and we can't calm him all we have to do is hold him right in front of tree and the crying stops and the staring begins.I don't know what we are going to do when we take the tree down. I think I want to leave it up all year. permalinksavecontextfull commentsN.J. Sen.

Barbara Buono is first Democrat to challenge Christie for governor  by  JorgeCSin  newjersey[+]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoHonest question - there might be a strong anti-Booker sentiment in Newark but how much of Newark turns out for the state elections? Upper crust Essex county likes Booker (you are fellow South Orange resident so you know how liberal that whole area is) but would it matter if Newark doesn't love him?I agree with you though - he'll need to start acting like the Chris Christie we knew pre-Sandy, picking fights on the boardwalk with people, etc etc for people to dislike him again. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoBelieving in Santa is not the same thing as not knowing colors or understanding skin color. That is a terrible analogy. (That is an opinion, not a fact).What clinical journals are you using when you state that a child is not "quick to comprehend" or "having having good understanding or a high mental capacity" if they believe in Santa at age 9? You said "by definition" which leads me to believe you have a source. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoEXACTLY! You understand YOUR kids. You don't understand mine or the original poster's children. Rather than just say, "hey this is how we do it in my house" you said the original poster's child couldn't possibly be intelligent if they still believed in Santa. What you or I think is ludicrous for our kids doesn't apply to the OP's children. It's no different than having a favorite TV show or book. If they want to believe in Santa, let them. If they don't, that's fine too. There's room for all opinions here - one way isn't better than the other. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoNot saying that is the case with this poster, but it can certainly indicate social issues in the right circumstances.it can certainly indicate social issues in the right circumstances.in the right circumstancesI didn't it was a cause and effect relationship. Sometimes, it is a red flag. When children are so ridged that they are unable to be imaginative, it can be cause for concern. Often, those kids have a hard time playing with other kids. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoYou started with the personal attacks by saying the original poster's child couldn't be intelligent if they believed in Santa at 9. You started this by saying a child believing in Santa lacks intelligence and you held up your kid as some sort of example of how it should be. You're so busy trying to reflect your own beliefs back on your kid, you're not letting them figure things out for themselves. And yes, your manifesto about why kids shouldn't believe in Santa is your opinion. But you know this, you're just being obtuse.I do feel bad for your kid. You apply adult language and reasoning to your six year old. As in, you seem to think he is older than six. I mean, look what you wrote:I tell you what, don't feel sorry for my kids, while yours are still believing in fairy tales mine will be patting their heads and saying "that's nice dear now let the adults talk".I suspect you know that your kid doesn't actually speak like that. But, it is pretty telling you defaulted to such an odd affect for a six year old to take when communicating. It doesn't sound like you understand children very well. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoThis is actually debatable, lets look at some of the facts here.First you have to lie about santa, you have to persistently lie about this santa guy year after year, this is simply not a healthy relationship with your child.Secondly you have to keep making those lies bigger, you cannot get away with a couple of little lies, no, as the child grows they begin asking questions, then you begin inventing bigger lies, eventually you begin fabricating evidence (half eaten cookies, glass of milk etc), this is simply unethical.These aren't facts - they're your opinion. Honestly reading your replies, I am starting to feel really bad for your kid. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoWhen you read him Goodnight Moon, did you annotate the book and let him know that cows don't actually jump over the moon? Or that it was an impossibility for the quiet old lady whispering hush to be a mouse in a nightgown?Come on man - you tried to equateyour kid not believing on Santa to him being superior in intellect. And you also called the poster's daughter stupid for believing at nine.It's all good though - we all have our soapboxes. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoI'll take is a step further and say a child that is unable to be imaginative at that age is red flag. Not saying that is the case with this poster, but it can certainly indicate social issues in the right circumstances. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoKids are so different in the way they synthesize information - believing or not believing in Santa doesn't indicate a lack of intelligence in a child. It's astounding to me that anyone would think it does. permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents Who Love That Their Tweens Still Believe in Santa Are Idiots  by  streetlitein  Parenting[+]mynameisacoolname 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoI work at a school. Most of the 4th and 5th graders still believe in Santa. No need to be so heavy handed in your response. Your kid figuring out at 6 there was no Santa (I'd be hard pressed to find kids that age in my school who don't believe) doesn't imply anything about you or your kid - not positive or negative. It certainly doesn't mean he is smarter than his other classmates.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHelp!

To your point, it would be a lot more realistic if she was fired because of her ties - that would also cause some pretty overt drama for them. And yes, I know this show isn't exactly steeped in reality but it would be a nice nod to the fact that they understand how outside of the norm this lifestyle really is. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI have to admit something.

It takes me out of every scene she is in because I stare dumbfounded at her head.That said, Jax being in the club married to a doctor just doesn't make sense anymore. He could quit, get a job as a mechanic somewhere and have a much nicer life than they do now. She's a fucking surgeon! It is ponderous. It's not like he wants to be in the club anymore - he keeps saying he wants out. So get out, dumb-dumb. Your wife is a surgeon.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Season 1-7 is currently on Netflix  by  scotishstrikerin  IASIP[+]mynameisacoolname 3 points4 points5 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 3 points4 points5 points 6 days agoToday will be the greatest Saturday in the history of Saturdays. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBosses of Reddit, what's the weirdest reason why you had to fire an employee?  by  monstasantain  AskReddit[+]mynameisacoolname 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]mynameisacoolname 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoNot quite a firing story: I got into trouble (which lead to me quitting) because I had AIM on my work machine (this was over ten years ago). Someone in IT had done it for me, and I wouldn't tell my bosses who it was so...I got written up. I quit about a month later. They weren't mad it was on there - they were mad I wouldn't tell them who put it on there!
