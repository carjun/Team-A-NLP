I will keep a prayer for those poor children and their parents. This story is bring all kinds of rage and sadness from within me. I want to know why the kids... WHY!!!I'm supposed to be Santa clause for my kids and some other kids at a Christmas party tonight. This is going to make it harder than it is.I still cannot stop thinking about those parents, putting myself in their shoes, my world would no longer have any meaning, and I would not stop until the bastard has a painful and slow death, the police would never find the bastard.permalinksaveparent[+]JRock184 1 point2 points3 points 9 minutes ago (1 child)[]JRock184 1 point2 points3 points 9 minutes agoI left work to pick up my little girl from school.

Stay with your daughter, tell her how much she means to you. I don't have kids, I do one day. All I want to do is go back and time and stop it somehow. All I want to do is make it right. Fix it. Give them their lives back, give them Christmas, give them happiness.You're a good parent. Have a good day with her, as good of a day as it can be in spite of what has happened.permalinksaveparent[+]Jack_Sipper 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes ago (1 child)[]Jack_Sipper 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes ago*heartpermalinksaveparent[+]JRock184 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]JRock184 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoThank You :) Upvote.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
