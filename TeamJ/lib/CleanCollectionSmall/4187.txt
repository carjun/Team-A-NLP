They have being pushing its appliance extensively during the last couple of years and will continue to do so. They see it as an opportunity to replace the Oracle stack/DBs several large enterprises sit on top of today. There is also HANA certification (https://training.sap.com/us/en/certification). However, most third-party consulting firms are still a bit reluctant about the certification as it feels a bit thrown together. That is, certification doesn't always equal actual knowledge. Also, SAP is pushing its cloud, mobile and Big Data story. Any experience with any of those areas should help you land a job as well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Republican National Convention Drinking Game!  by  PL4CIDb0rgin  politics[+]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoIf you feel like getting really wasted, every time they mention "freedom".permalinksavecontextfull comments10000Time Article: "Why Apples Win over Samsung Is Ultimately Good News for Consumers" (techland.time.com)submitted 3 months ago by dumb_elephant to technology2 commentssharecancelloading...The solution to bad teachers isn't testing, punishing teachers or whining about unions.

Whenever we go to a restaurant (everything from TGI's Friday's to more fancy) he will make sure to stop by a liquor store beforehand and pick up one of those mini-bottles of rum. At the restaurant, when everyone else is ordering beer or wine, he will order a coke. As soon as the waiter/waitress leaves the table he will pop open his mini-bottle of joy and pour it in his glass effectively mixing himself a rum & coke. He is especially gleeful when we go to a place that offers free refills of soda..Didn't happen to me, but one of my friends lived with three other guys in college. The used to go to Costco to buy groceries for the whole house. Apparently one time during one of these grocery trips one of the roommates, that is stupidly cheap, said he didn't want to share the cost of a gallon of milk (which is like $4 or $1 a person) because "he wouldn't use it". The next morning my friend finds the cheap roommate in the kitchen just about to pour himself a nice bowl of cereal and milk. My friend is like: "fuck that, you didn't want to pay, so no milk for you". What did the roommate do? He proceeded by taking his bowl of cereal to the tap and fills it up with water(!) instead. Apparently he ate the whole thing. permalinksavecontextfull commentsApple's grip on the smartphone market is continuing to decline while Samsung continues to gain market share, according to the latest analysis.  by  PrettyBoyFloydin  technology[+]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 4 months agoI guess it depends on what type of app you want. A lot of business and news apps are now built as hybrids and deployed via a browser. Financial times being the most famous IMO: FT WebApp However, if you want to create an app with heavy graphics and device integration (such as the camera) the native route makes more sense, at least for now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsApple's grip on the smartphone market is continuing to decline while Samsung continues to gain market share, according to the latest analysis.  by  PrettyBoyFloydin  technology[+]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 4 months agoApologies - clearly I misunderstood your argument. I agree with your point that people want similar products because it is easier, but also compatible. Might be especially important in the cloud era. But I do believe Apple's share of the market will decline as other vendors get better. It is just the evolution of the technology market, whether people like it or not.permalinksavecontextfull commentsApple's grip on the smartphone market is continuing to decline while Samsung continues to gain market share, according to the latest analysis.  by  PrettyBoyFloydin  technology[+]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 4 months agoI disagree. I think development platforms like Appcelerator and Phonegap can help push HTML5 forward, especially since you can add native functionality to the code. I think a single code base through hybrid applications will eventually outgrow today's native deployments. HTML5 isn't a standard yet and is still in its infancy, I agree. But technology, like always, will evolve and so will web based technologies with it.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsApple's grip on the smartphone market is continuing to decline while Samsung continues to gain market share, according to the latest analysis.  by  PrettyBoyFloydin  technology[+]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWell.. a) with newer technology, such as HTML5, there will be more cross-platform deployments without app stores, be it Apple or Android. b) iPad isn't a smartphone, it's a tablet computer. I do not see how that would help them dominate the smartphone market?permalinksavecontextfull commentsPhoto I took of the Chicago skyline from a beach in Indiana.  by  tomdadamsin  pics[+]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoTIL that anything is for sale in the US, even history.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCoffee like Sweden's  by  Tealwispin  sweden[+]dumb_elephant 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]dumb_elephant 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI also find that Swedish coffee is of a much finer grind, and that makes a huge difference regardless of water to coffee ratio (although Americans do like their coffee tasting like tea). If you plan on using a good old coffee maker, make sure it is labeled: "brygg". Ratio is 1:1, one scoop of coffee for each cup of water (and by cup I mean the measure on the side of the coffee maker) and then an extra spoon at the end for good luck.Also, I see Gevalia all the time in the US. Used to be if you bought it online you got a free coffee maker - or something like that.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLook who my friend ran into today!  by  pabloescobarloxin  funny[+]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[]dumb_elephant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoOr do friends exist, but we don't?permalinksavecontextfull comments20012Gaikai  PlayStation-as-a-service ..possibly.
