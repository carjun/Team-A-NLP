Perhaps it sounds strange, but I had never heard of Pacifica.  Also, you've piqued my curiosity and aroused the poli-sci major in me: at the risk of going off on a tangent (I promise I have no intention of arguing or debating- just curious), you say they aren't liberals, but on "the real left".  Do you mean progressivism?  Because I have heard before that there is a difference between the two ideologies, but never really looked into it.  What would you say differentiates them?permalinksaveparent[+]sirernestshackleton 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[]sirernestshackleton 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onReporter here.

I usually scan over the news sites, like google, MSMbc, cnn, alJazeera, and NPR, read what I want to and then head here.

Even Edward R. Murrow had biases (look at his public feud with McCarthy).I gave up on most American news journalism some time ago.  NPR is probably the best of the bunch.  I get most of my news online, and generally go to the BBC and al Jazeera websites, as well as...well, r/news, r/worldnews, and r/worldpolitics.  Again, if you're looking for perfect, you aren't going to find it, but you could do far worse than the aforementioned.permalinksave[+]TexDen 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[]TexDen 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThe BBC, Al Jazera.permalinksave[+]John_Wilson_543 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[]John_Wilson_543 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onBBC - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/CBC - http://www.cbc.ca/news/NPR - http://www.npr.orgpermalinksave[+][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onif you read both  huffingtonpost and fox news and average them, then you will be within 1 standard deviation of the truth.permalinksave[+]botterpants 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[]botterpants 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onNewspapers. The bottom line is that journalism ethics rules with newspapers are much much stronger than with television news journalism. The key is to know that every newspaper writer may have a bit of a slant, intentional or not, but the best thing to do is read both the conservative and liberal points of view and then decide for yourself. Critical thinking is your only real help. The more you educate yourself the more you will be able to determine your own point of view no matter what you read or watch.permalinksave[+]huck08 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[]huck08 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onBBC and Democracy Now are a good start.permalinksave[+][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onNewstrust.netpermalinksave[+][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)[][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onGood luck.permalinksave[+]go24 -2 points-1 points0 points 2 years ago (1 child)[]go24 -2 points-1 points0 points 2 years agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThat's like asking "What one food can I eat exclusively that will fulfill all my nutritional and sensory needs?".Everyone and every organization has their own agenda, whether they know and/or admit it themselves or not. You have an obligation to yourself and those you care about to hear as many sides of every story as possible. Doing so will equip you to make the most informed, and therefore best decisions on how to most effectively life your life. Honesty never existed in journalism, but today we have access to all sorts of news sources. Sifting through the different "angles" can give you enough information to extrapolate a useful understanding of the story. News sources can be broadly categorized into two types: The Crusaders, and the Businesses. Crusaders are motivated by their own conception of enlightened self interest, and are trying to bring about societal change of some sort. Financial gain is not their primary goal, and often they operate at a loss, financed by like-minded donors. Businesses exist to make money. If the only news people would pay for was about how many zits Lady GaGa had on her left ass cheek that day, that's all the MSM would report on. They preach to the converted, because it pays. Very few people will pay to be told they are wrong. Journalism has never and will never exist as it is conceptualized, pure truth flowing forth to uplift the masses, untainted by bias or self-interest, because it is made by biased, self-interested entities. Your best shot is to think for yourself, or else just ignore everything and find an engrossing hobby.TL;DR: You're S.O.L.
