The American author had a nervous breakdown and was suicidal after divorcing her first husband. Still in her early 30s and terrified of committing to another relationship, she decided at the time to pursue that great middle-class antidote to torment: overseas travel.After eating herself silly in Italy, searching for enlightenment in India and finding romance in Bali, she wrote her hugely successful 2006 memoir Eat, Pray, Love.Written with raw honesty and tender humour - and later adapted to film starring Julia Roberts as Gilbert -  Eat, Pray, Love touched a chord with women disillusioned by the expectations of marriage and motherhood. It earned Gilbert a near cult following of 10 million (predominantly female) readers and made her wealthy and famous.Gilbert, who had never wanted children of her own, ended up marrying the older ''Brazilian guy'' she fell in love with in Bali, but this came about through unexpected circumstances. Jose Nunes (called Felipe in Eat, Pray, Love) was just as keen as Gilbert to avoid marriage after divorcing his Australian wife of 20 years. However, while trying to enter the US with Gilbert on a multiple visa, Jose, an Australian citizen, was detained by homeland security officers. They advised him to marry Gilbert if he wanted to join her in America.Gilbert writes about this in Committed, her 2010 sequel to Eat, Pray, Love that begins with a historical exploration of marriage and ends with their wedding in the US in 2007 after Nunes got a valid visa in Sydney.Today Gilbert, 43, is enjoying the fruits of her adventures, living with Nunes, 60, in Frenchtown, a small community on the Delaware River in New Jersey where they run a Balinese imports store.Her second marriage, she says, ''is quite lovely''. The day after their wedding she woke up feeling as if they had just been before a firing squad but, after finding there were no bullet holes, thought, ''This is fine''.She went into her first marriage without thinking, she says, and paid a great price. ''So I almost over-thought the second, to the point I may have obsessed over it,'' she says, laughing. ''But I find, oh, it's really quite a nice thing to do as a full-grown adult when you have established your identity  Your agenda is nothing more than that you would like nice companionship with somebody  you know how not to be a terrible pain in the ass.''Neither of the pair has given up travel and their first destination in 2013 is Australia, where Nunes has two grown-up children and one grandchild in Sydney and Canberra. It will be their fourth visit here in the past eight years.But the Australian connection runs deeper. The idea for Gilbert's latest book, a novel called   The Signature of All Things, to be published next year, came from a 1784 illustrated edition of Captain James Cook's voyages called Cook's Journeys, which belonged to Gilbert's great-grandfather.Cook has more significance for Australia than the US, she says, but she considers the book a stunning talismanic object. ''After  a while, you get an instinct, like a water diviner,'' she says of her writing. ''When that book was put in my hands, it sent a shiver up my arm.''Gilbert's novel is about a 19th-century family whose livelihood comes from  botanical commerce.  It follows two generations of the Whittakers as they make their way in the world during the intersection of science, botany, trade and the beginnings of the debate about evolution. The main character's father was a botanical assistant on Cook's final voyage to Hawaii, where Cook was bludgeoned to death.Gilbert grew up in a world of books. Raised on a farm in Connecticut by ''back-to-the-land'' parents, she and her older sister, Catherine, now an acclaimed young-adult novelist, amused themselves by reading, inventing stories and staging plays.  At  13, Gilbert read Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. ''It was an epic moment in my life,'' she says.Gilbert spent many years as a magazine journalist before her first book, Pilgrims, a short story collection, came out in 1997. Her second, Stern Men, published in 2000, was a novel. For the next 12 years she wrote non-fiction, continuing her examination of manhood in The Last American Man, her 2002 warts-and-all biography of an unconventional character called Eustace Conway.Gilbert says it's no accident she has returned to writing fiction. After Committed, she felt she did not want to write memoir again.  ''For the moment I am very happy writing about lives that aren't mine.''
