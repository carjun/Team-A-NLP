The media has a way of just spreading contempt and discourse for no other reason than ratings. They will only focus on negative issues and most "news" programs are really only commentary shows with extreme biases. Add this with a lack of factual television, (example: channels like the history and discovery channel succumbing to the reality tv craze and axing documentaries completely) and you have a television-raised generation of people basing conclusions on biased and incomplete information. And then the next big controversy comes along, and the media gets their ratings and ad revenue all over again. permalinksavecontextfull commentsA friend of mine went swimming at the beach. At night. On Cape Cod. During shark season.  by  cherlichin  WTF[+]whichwitch9 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]whichwitch9 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago*Okay then, I'll volunteer. It could be a number of shark species, ranging from dangerous to not. Increasing seal populations have definitely brought the great whites back. There's also porbeagle sharks, thresher sharks, and the occasional mako. And, of course, basking sharks. I can exactly make out color of the fin because it is night time, but it seems to be more of a brownish than the charcoal grey you'd find on the three makerel sharks- great white, mako, and porbeagle. The dorsal fin seems really curved, and if you compare it to photos of basking sharks, it looks similar. If you look at the kayaker being followed by the basking shark and compare fins, they look the same. So, I'm going to say basking shark. However, the picture is still pretty damn cool.Edit: linkpermalinksavecontextfull commentsA friend of mine went swimming at the beach. At night. On Cape Cod.

He told us all we needed to study was the practice exam, and all of the test questions would be similar. We get the exam; nothing like the practice test. I only squeezed out a 79 cause I had taken calc before (took ap calc in high school, only passed because of extra credit work, so I didn't even try to take the ap exam for credit; just retook the class). People in my recitation had legit zeros on the exam. I'd feel sorry for the TA who taught the recitation, except we only understood what she was saying when she was insulting our professor. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTeachers of Reddit, what is something you do that your students can never find out about?  by  gibby282in  AskReddit[+]whichwitch9 4 points5 points6 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]whichwitch9 4 points5 points6 points 5 days agoAaaand done.

Refers to the northern half of the country during the civil war. Y'know, the kind of people that were against slavery and all that. I've never found it to be an insult. The a large chunk of the southern half of the country still calls our civil war "the War of Northern Aggression" and flys confederate flags. It's mostly an insult to them because it associates them with the northern half of the country. I've always just found the term "yankee" interesting with how the meaning has changed through history and outside the country. No larger meaning or advice in it, just an odd little note on my part.Edit: yes, I know there was more to the civil war than just "being against slavery" But too lazy to go into itpermalinksavecontextfull commentsPSY scandal reveals 2004 song in which PSY sings, "Kill those fucking Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives', he said.

For example, I heard this in the radio a a few months back http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCwUdc6GLe0 which definitely could get called out for more than a few of its lyrics, but no one cared. Yet psy sings this 8 years ago and its a huge deal. I will say, the lyrics are terrible (in the psy song and the one i linked too- but the link is musically a terrible song to me as well). No, I would not sing those lyrics and yeah, I'm pretty disgusted by them, but hey, freedom of speech. I'm not gonna metaphorically hang the guy for it. I can, however, think that he is tasteless.
