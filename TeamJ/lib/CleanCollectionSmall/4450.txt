Dec. 14 2012.They came by the hundreds to stand in solidarity and face an unimaginable horror.Friends, neighbors and strangers braved a bitterly cold Friday night to collectively mourn the 27 lives cut tragically short by a deranged 20-year-old on a mission to kill.There was standing room only inside St. Rose Church in Newtown, Conn., at the start of the 7 p.m. vigil, and the lawn outside was crammed with yet more mourners holding candles, offering quiet prayers and talking in eerily hushed voices.It was left to Monsignor Robert Weiss to offer the crowd solace, or at least some way to comprehend what drove a young man to gun down his mother and then fatally shoot six of her colleagues at Sandy Hook Elementary School  along with 20 defenseless small children  before finally turning the gun on himself.PHOTOS: SCENES OF TERROR FROM CONN. MASS SHOOTINGJames Keivom/New York Daily NewsPrayer vigil at St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church after a mass murderer, identified by authorities as Adam Lanza, packed a pair of weapons opening fire inside the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT.But there was no way to ease the pain or explain the days tragic turn of events.I don't think there are any words you can say, Weiss said at the conclusion of the 80-minute service.We put 26 candles on the altar tonight, one for each of the folks at Sandy Hook school, but as I said, there were really 28 people who died today and ours is not to judge or to question. We are really holding in our hearts especially the children and the staff of the school.Weiss had spent the day at Newtown firehouse with the families of several of the 20 children killed, kids who ranged in age from 5 to 10. Some of the youngsters are believed to have belonged to the church.He said the parents managed to smile in between their tears and one father touchingly recalled watching his beloved son score his first ever goal earlier this year.OBAMA: 'OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY'ANDREW GOMBERT/AFP/Getty ImagesMourners gather inside the St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church at a vigil service for victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left at least 27 people dead, many of them young children, in Newtown, Connecticut, USA, 14 December 2012.TRAUMA TO LINGER FOR KIDSThe families planned to sleep in the firehouse Friday night as the removal of their childrens bodies from the classrooms where they died reportedly began. They wanted to be together to receive updates about when they might claim those they lost.The anger is going to come. The hurt is going to come, Weiss said he told the loved ones. But right now were trying to deal with their sadness.At the evening vigil, clergy members exited the brick church to offer communion to the overflow crowd of mourners huddled outside on the lawn and parking lot.Many stood still muttering Hail Marys repeatedly, others simply bowed their heads and sobbed.Were here to pray for peace, and also the souls of these children and certainly peace and comfort for their families, said Kiersten Kirkman, 46, whose teenage daughter attends St. Rose School just 2.5 miles from Sandy Hook Elementary.We're a small community, so all of them are our family.Weiss also reflected on the timing of the nation's second-deadliest school shooting, which comes less than two weeks before Christmas Day.There are 20 brighter stars in the heavens than any Christmas lights in Newtown, he said. These 20 children were just beautiful, beautiful children.Post a Comment CommentsSee All Comments[Discussion Guidelines                                                        ]To post your comments, please, Sign in                                                         .
