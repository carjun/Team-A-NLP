Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]a_monster_ 671 points672 points673 points 3 hours ago*(0 children)[]a_monster_ 671 points672 points673 points 3 hours ago*Final update: final class of the day. We are watching the news. We are horrified. We are all sobbing. 'm currently in one of the class rooms of the neighboring school and we're in lock down. So far we have heard nothing from the administration. We know that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook School (the elementry k-4 school). There were 2 shooters alledged. One kid (confirmed with multiple sources) is wounded and carried out of the school. The shooters are still out there, not caught. One teacher was shot.My town is trending on every major news site and it's scary as fuck. Update: 3 patients admitted to danbury hospital  by ambulance and the number of people shot is up to 4 (no ages yet). Update 2: one shooter reported dead (unconfirmed but multiple people are saying that)Update 3: One child dead. One shooter still on the loose. Yale hospital has opened a triage for victims. Update 4: Unconfirmed repoet that the principle is dead. The shooter is heading down river-side (the road). Update 5: Swatt team is sweeping the school Update 6: they've taken one woman aside and she's crying into a firefighter's arms. This could mean update number 3 about a kid dead is true. Update 7: We were released back to class. There was an announcement that said the area was safe, so we are conducting classes. I need to get back to class, so I will update later. We're watching the news, it's last period but we were forced to turn it off. One of the reporter's said,"and just think that these kids were seeing santa claus last weekend." We turned the audio off and we're all crying still.This is hell. Some kids are bawling in the bathroom, there are only 10 or so (out of 25) that remained in class). Nobody has a dry eye right now. Some kids are angry and swearing, others are staring at their feet. We don't know how to deal with this. This town has virtually no crime, we were unprepared. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat little thing could a potential partner be into that would make you forget about ever dating them?  by  torchesftwin  AskReddit[+]a_monster_ -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (0 children)[]a_monster_ -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoWorld of Warcraft.
