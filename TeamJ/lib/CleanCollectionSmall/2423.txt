I agree with most posters here that the episode would've been even stronger if the overall episode had matched up to the quality of the comedy bits.And the "writing for the movie poster" does show. Completely. And it looks like "Oh hey, hey, guys. Guys. GUYS! Let's pose like we're all praying to the Weeping Angels. Even though it looks dumb and Instagrammed and the episode doesn't have anything to do with that and people will get whiplash from the episode anyway."Ahem. I'm sorry. I had...problems with ATM.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould someone mind filling me in on why so many Whovians hated Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe?  by  ginger_88in  gallifrey[+]ginger_88[S] 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ginger_88[S] 4 points5 points6 points 3 days agoThat made watery eyes, yes. But when The Doctor went home to the Ponds, I was all done. Yes, you dumb TimeLord, people love you, and they set places for you at the holidays on the off chance you drop by. Ignoring all the "rah but Amy is just a girl who waits" - though true - it really gets me that The Doctor misses how beloved he is to those who get to travel with him, even if he does nearly get you killed/stranded/dissolved by acid on Christmas Eve. So, when he finally embraces a welcome instead of choosing to be all lonely and self-loathing...I cried.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould someone mind filling me in on why so many Whovians hated Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe?  by  ginger_88in  gallifrey[+]ginger_88[S] 9 points10 points11 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ginger_88[S] 9 points10 points11 points 3 days agoNot an attack at all! And it's all true. Moffat's female characters aren't always (...I hesitate to say ever, but...) well-developed. At least, in plot, that is.More than anything I love how The Doctor comes across in this episode. Adorkable. You got it. It was nice, especially after all this "Grarr Oncoming Storm" stuff. I mean, he's both, but we really only got the big baddie Doctor in S6. It was nice to see the eternal child part of him come out.As for this upcoming one, I think it's completely up in the air. The S7 Doctor (and episodes) were so...scattered and rushed. I hope this isn't the same, but I will probably love it regardless.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould someone mind filling me in on why so many Whovians hated Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe?  by  ginger_88in  gallifrey[+]ginger_88[S] 18 points19 points20 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ginger_88[S] 18 points19 points20 points 3 days agoThis is really good! Thank you. I liked it, but even I cringed hard at humany woomany. Since I watched it so long after the end of Series Six, I think I was spared some of the "oh come off it, please just give me something good and fun" that I (and many others) wanted.In retrospect, the key characters here were really the Doctor and the Widow...and the rest was a lot of filler. Looks like we're going a little dark this year...it will be interesting to see what happens with The Snowmen! I maintain that the teaser poster of Smith looking rather Wonka/Bowie-esque promises a mash up of Victorian England, Rankin-Bass, Willy Wonka, The Labyrinth, and Christmas. It could be messy. Or awesome.Given the last "half" (five episodes is not a half! dammit!) season, my money is on both.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould someone mind filling me in on why so many Whovians hated Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe?  by  ginger_88in  gallifrey[+]ginger_88[S] 17 points18 points19 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ginger_88[S] 17 points18 points19 points 3 days agoI can see that. A Christmas Carol was a damn near perfect episode. I just saw it on Omnimax at our local science center and was giddy all over again. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould someone mind filling me in on why so many Whovians hated Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe?  by  ginger_88in  gallifrey[+]ginger_88[S] 12 points13 points14 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ginger_88[S] 12 points13 points14 points 3 days agoOk. Full disclosure. I cried too. It caught me by surprise. Matt Smith's Doctor has just been SO. DAMN. LIKABLE. in both of his Christmas specials so far. Him + Kazran in the first, "fixing" the sitting room in the second...egads. That's why I'm curious about why folks disliked it so much. I can't help but wonder if I missed something.permalinksavecontextfull comments14636465Would someone mind filling me in on why so many Whovians hated Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe?

I have a Westie (a breed reputed to be terrible with small children) but so far he's been great with the other kids we've had him around. He definitely doesn't like them, but he won't snap or try to trip them up. He just...stares at them with disdain. Ha.Anyway, when we start kids, I know I'll probably have some of the same concerns. He's quite attached and quite the lap dog, but my hope is that they're more understanding than we might think.All the best!permalinksavecontextfull commentsBringing home a new baby  by  redditerrrrin  dogs[+]ginger_88 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]ginger_88 3 points4 points5 points 4 days agoBefore you bring baby home, send your SO/someone else who your dogs know home with a blanket that the baby was swaddled in for some time.Then let both dogs get a good acquaintance with it (e.g. don't expect to use the blanket again, maybe). We've done this with each of my sister's kiddos and both times, the baby got a good sniffing from the dog, but then was pretty much just another fixture in the house. No problems.I'm sure it is different for every dog, but this is a pretty standard "get acquainted with new baby" practice as far as I know.Good luck! Don't let clingy dog go unless you have to, certainly not preemptively. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan you help save this dog?  by  zalodadin  StLouis[+]ginger_88 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]ginger_88 1 point2 points3 points 8 days agoYou may want to edit your original post so that people know photos are in the comments or include the links in the original post. I gave you my upvote to try to shoot it to the top, but it looks like your best results will be editing the post.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan you help save this dog?  by  zalodadin  StLouis[+]ginger_88 2 points3 points4 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]ginger_88 2 points3 points4 points 8 days agoHave you contacted the Humane Society?If the dog has been in a bad situation, he may need medical attention. Simply re-homing him without a vet check gets him out of the situation, but it doesn't really get the dog very good care. If there was an abuse situation, the dog may have injury or infection - and the dog may not show any signs or symptoms, as they tend to hide any sign of weakness (IIRC). If the dog has been neglected, he may have some malnutrition issues that would need to be addressed as well. Finally, you mentioned he's scared. While dogs can definitely be rehabilitated outside of a concentrated environment like a shelter, odds are good that a random stranger may not have the skills or patience to help the dog overcome his issues - and a scared dog is not a happy dog. :(TL;DR - If you have not contacted the Humane Society first, please do so. Rehoming is good, but care and rehabilitation is better if it's available.Oh, and if you don't want to do that, at least post pictures of the dog and a way for someone to contact you.
