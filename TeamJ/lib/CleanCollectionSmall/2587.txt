I've worked in Grocery, Produce, Dairy/Frozen, In-stock, Maintenance, and Carts. They ALL have their downsides, but deli is the combination of all the downsides into one. Customers, stocking, freight, cleaning up nasty shit, understaffed, micromanaged, and pressure from health inspectors to do EVERY THING perfect. Sure it's pay grade 5 or w/e, but I enjoyed my work life much better cleaning shit off the walls in maintenance than working in the deli.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIAMA Employee at KFC and Wal-Mart.

In all seriousness, I hate being the critic/hater/pessimist in subs like this, I really do hope the game evolves into at least half of what Diablo 2 was for the time it existed. It's just this game has been visibly mismanaged from the start, and it's getting beyond sad and depressing to down right hilarious. permalinksavecontextfull commentsDiablo 3 Google's 5th Most Searched Term of 2012  by  DanMorgan405in  Diablo[+]Iniquity77 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]Iniquity77 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*http://www.spike.com/events/video-game-awards-2012-nominees/voting/best-rpghttp://www.spike.com/events/video-game-awards-2012-nominees/voting/best-pc-gameI'm glad they won two irrelevant awards for cinematic and audio.

Just because "Diablo 2" had an expansion and Diablo 3 doesn't have one yet, doesn't give Diablo 3 the excuse of regressing from previous entries in the Diablo series.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsDiablo 3 Google's 5th Most Searched Term of 2012  by  DanMorgan405in  Diablo[+]Iniquity77 -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Iniquity77 -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 day agoIt's a Diablo game that won no awards or titles other than fastest-selling because it was riding on someone else's legendary title.
