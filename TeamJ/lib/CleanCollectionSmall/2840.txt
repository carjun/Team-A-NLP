The campaign finance system is broken, and Super PACs aren't the main problem - it's 501(c)(4)s and 501(c)(6) that can get undisclosed amounts of money from individuals, corporations, unions, foreign entities, etc. and spend as much as they want on ads, hiring people to hound candidates on issues, etc. with anyone knowing how much they spent. People benefitting from the system by taking extra cash from Super PACs is a very small issue when it comes to campaign finance.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

If they didn't choose to "go with football", their football program that they've put a ton of money into, and recently has been successful, would dissolve.

No police officer should still have a job after being pulled over 44 times "in the past several years". I'd love to see what happened those other times. If he's driving with a .104 BAC, and has been pulled over 44 times, my guess is he's been behind the wheel hammered more than a few times and has been let off because of his badge. I know I'm making some assumptions here, but seriously how the hell can you be pulled over 44 times and still be a law enforcer?permalinksavecontextfull commentsMajority Say Federal Government Should Back Off States Where Marijuana Is Legal.  by  reeds1999in  politics[+]CunthSlayer 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]CunthSlayer 3 points4 points5 points 4 days agoHere's a link to the actual Gallup poll.Interesting how 43% of people that believe it shouldn't be legal, also believe the federal government shouldn't take steps to enforce its federal laws.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy fucking dream  by  bigdsimein  trees[+]CunthSlayer 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]CunthSlayer 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoUpvote for Breezeblocks and dream pursuing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBigfoot Is Part Human, and Here Are the DNA Tests to Prove It, Claims Researcher  by  grahvityin  nottheonion[+]CunthSlayer 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]CunthSlayer 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoSomeone get Neil Sampat involved in this study!permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
