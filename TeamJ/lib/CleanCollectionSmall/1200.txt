A popular and colourful figure in France, the 63-year-old Depardieu is the latest wealthy Frenchman to seek shelter outside his native country after tax increases by Socialist President Francois Hollande.              Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault described Depardieu's behaviour as "pathetic" and unpatriotic at a time when the French are being asked to pay higher taxes to reduce a bloated national debt.              "Pathetic, you said pathetic? How pathetic is that?" Depardieu said in a letter to weekly newspaper le Journal du Dimanche.              "I am leaving because you believe that success, creation, talent, anything different must be sanctioned," he said.              An angry member of parliament has proposed that France adopt a U.S.-inspired law that would force Depardieu or anyone trying to escape full tax dues to forego their nationality.              The "Cyrano de Bergerac" star recently bought a house in Nechin, a Belgian village a short walk from the border with France, where 27 percent of residents are French nationals, and put up his sumptuous Parisian home up for sale.              Depardieu, who has also inquired about procedures for acquiring Belgian residency, said he was handing in his passport and social security card.              He said he had paid 145 million euros ($190.08 million) in taxes since beginning work as a printer at the age of 14.              "People more illustrious than me have gone into (tax) exile. Of all those that have left none have been insulted as I have."              The actor's move comes three months after Bernard Arnault, chief executive of luxury giant LVMH and France's richest man, caused an uproar by seeking to establish residency in Belgium - a move he said was not for tax reasons.              Belgian residents do not pay wealth tax, which in France is now levied on those with assets over 1.3 million euros ($1.7 million). Nor do they pay capital gains tax on share sales.              "We no longer have the same homeland," Depardieu said. "I no longer have any reason to stay here. I will continue to love the French and this public that I have shared so much emotion with."              Hollande is pressing ahead too with plans to impose a 75-percent supertax on income over 1 million euros.              "Who are you to judge me, I ask you Mr Ayrault, prime minister of Mr Hollande? Despite my excesses, my appetite and my love of life, I remain a free man."

Why, as in the UK also, have continuing Governments been allowed to borrow money to pay for policies they can not afford, then leave the debt for the taxpayer and future generations to repay while they (the politicians) swan off into the sunset, awarded with knighthoods (UK) and continue to live a very prosperous and privileged life.v1/comments/context/7fa1d100-a477-3b0b-b13e-c8b785cd8a9a/comment/1355655287961-86ebb124-2f37-4fd4-b222-70f9714ad94d/reply/00024I000000000000000000000000-ca70256f-af35-4e79-ae93-a603438e326aPertinax1 hour 51 minutes agoI have a day job thank you.

It is not just about citizens being patriotic to a country, a country has to be equally patriotic back. If a country betrays some its citizens by trying to steal their hard earned wealth and threatening them with imprisonment if they don't accede to the demands, well it is the country that has committed the first betrayal. I don't mind paying 15% tax, 50% is way too much and any government that tries it on will suffer the consequences and end up getting nothing at all.v1/comments/context/7fa1d100-a477-3b0b-b13e-c8b785cd8a9a/comment/1355670563910-e22cb004-def1-440b-bd5a-41dad36a9deaTruth5 hours agoThis Country is turning to #$%$ and that is a fact. Lowering of general standards, poor education, rising drugs and alcohol abuse, the none work attitude and the worship of so called 'celebs', over pricing of servicing, poor maintenance of roads, over governance from Europe and Human Rights taking over our laws, weak government decision making, immigration, over bearing taxation and the weather.

Even The Beatles and Rolling Stones shoved off. We had something called, The Brain Drain. The smart people, investors and job creators all left. It proved categorically that taxing the wealthy too highly does not generate extra income. In fact it has the opposite effect. Just putting the top rate up in the UK from 45% to 50% resulted in tax revenue dropping. According to HMRC website, the top 10% or earners contribute 80% of the total received in income tax. Best thing to do is keep them and keep paying them big bucks. More highly paid footballers please. Without their PAYE the government would have to come to us to make up the loss. The more top earners we have, the better off we all are, and the' country as a whole.
