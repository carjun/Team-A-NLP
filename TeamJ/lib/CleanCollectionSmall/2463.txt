The fact of the matter is that homicides of all types, including guns, has been consistently falling since sometime in the nineties. And in that time, gun laws haven't really changed that much, and the few changes that have been made generally loosened restrictions. I'm not trying to say that more guns = less crime. I'm trying to say that gun laws and crime aren't really related at all. You can verify this yourself by looking at countries' homicide rates and their numbers of guns per capita. You quickly start to realize that there's pretty much no correlation, provided that you don't cherry pick your examples.permalinksaveparent[+]TheCavis 2 points3 points4 points 49 minutes ago (0 children)[]TheCavis 2 points3 points4 points 49 minutes agoToo soon!Also, later is too soon!Then, it's too late.Then, it's too soon again.permalinksaveparent[+]I_are_facepalm 59 points60 points61 points 2 hours ago (344 children)[]I_are_facepalm 59 points60 points61 points 2 hours agoGuns don't kill people, people kill people......quite easily, with guns.

However, blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd. I am glad to talk about how it was allowed to happen, and what steps can be taken to prevent it. First off, we MUST recognize that "gun free zones" are simply the target of choice for these people. What can be done about this?Either we do away with gun free zones, or we start stationing police at every soft target such as elementary schools, movie theaters, and any where people can congregate. Next is the WHY are they doing this? Gun laws haven't changed dramatically in the past 10 years, but these shootings are on the rise? There are a myriad of reasons, and it always revolve around mental illness. I am glad to discuss means of deterrence and prevention, but gun control will be as effective as the drug war. So please, let us have a discussion.permalinksaveparent[+]its_your_their 2 points3 points4 points 15 minutes ago (2 children)[]its_your_their 2 points3 points4 points 15 minutes agoI'm all for a debate about safety. However, blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd.That's interesting because nuclear bombs, chemical weapons, and mines are all inanimate objects which 1. we are all glad are not things you can purchase at Walmart and 2. we work hard to stop the use and proliferation of.So, just saying that a thing is an inanimate object and thus shouldn't be regulated, is itself absurd.permalinksaveparent[+]treedick2011 1 point2 points3 points 5 minutes ago (1 child)[]treedick2011 1 point2 points3 points 5 minutes agoThis is false equivalency. These items would cost (for nuclear bombs) Billions of dollars. Chemical weapons would be absurdly expensive as well. They simply wouldn't be available to the general public.permalinksaveparent[+]its_your_their 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]its_your_their 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agoTheir cost is completely irrelevant. Are they inanimate objects? Yes. Are they highly regulated? Yes. If those two things are true, then "blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd." is false. Unless you believe that those things shouldn't be regulated at all, in which case you are actually clinically insane. That's as simple as I can get.Also, chemical weapons aren't prohibitively expensive. You can make mustard gas in your garage. And landmines? Developing nations use landmines, so those aren't cost-prohibitive either. But, like I said, cost is irrelevant to the idea that inanimate objects shouldn't be regulated.permalinksaveparent[+]ForRealsies 2 points3 points4 points 29 minutes ago (1 child)[]ForRealsies 2 points3 points4 points 29 minutes agoNext is the WHY are they doing this?There is no why or reason for acts like this.

I think a society that is nurturing and understanding of those with mental illnesses would more often than not avoid mass murders like this. Do you think these men felt understood by society? Or do you think they were lashing out at a system that has no place for them? permalinksaveparent[+]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoAre these shootings really on the rise?

I will put at least some of the blame of this at the feet of the media though. The sensationalizing of the mall shooting in Oregon. The plastering of the shooters face all over the news only incites more people who have serious mental issues to go out and do the same. Im against outright banning, the fact that police weren't around to stop this tells you everything you need to know about relying on their protection. There should be more over site into the mental faculties of people purchasing firearms though.permalinksaveparent[+]egonil 5 points6 points7 points 55 minutes ago (1 child)[]egonil 5 points6 points7 points 55 minutes agoPeople rely too heavily on the police.

I knew the ethics surrounding the use of my firearm. I knew how to shoot it, I knew how to inspect it. I knew how to handle it in public.This shooter clearly did none of those things because his parents never exposed him to firearms and he never learned the ethics that go along them. He could also just be a severely sick individual who the system failed. Blaming guns is a hotshot answer and all it does is add to the media attention that this shooter was looking to achieve.permalinksaveparent[+]adams551 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]adams551 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoIt's nearly always twenty somethings. They've not had time to grow up, to experience life and have children of their own or to have committed the inevitable crime that will make ease of gun access hard to begin with. In all honesty as someone who leans more toward gun rights I would be in full support of a ban on high capacity anything being sold to anyone under 30.

No, you can't place the blame for a tragedy strictly on an inanimate object.Does the ease with which children and mentally unstable adults can get their hands on deadly weapons contribute? Of course it does.Does having a gun in your hand change your mentality and disposition? Well, for some people it does. Holding a gun can make a person feel powerful, and for those already inclined to commit heinous acts, it can empower them.Come on people.

Violence with firearms that manifests itself in this form is a social medical problem, not a problem of property rights.   Gun crime where robbery and assault is involved, is also not a property rights issue, it is a socioeconomic one.Mental health is a serious problem, that often goes unchecked.  It is when it goes unchecked, combined with a unique circumstance, that tragedies like this occur.  While people are quick to blame guns, the same sort of thing happened in China quite recently with a young man armed with a knife was able to kill 9 people before he was stopped.99% of all firearms are never used to intimidate, hurt, or kill people.  For those reasons, and more, I think anyone who is staunchly anti-gun is barking up the wrong tree.permalinksaveparent[+]SicilianEggplant 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (1 child)[]SicilianEggplant 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoThe sad part is that it's easier and cheaper for someone to get a gun in this country than medical or psychiatric help.

You get people who don't always agree, groups are marginalized, anger seethes, and some are willing to resort to extremism for whatever purpose they rationalize. Right now, the most urgent conversation is the immediate either or demonization of us versus them, splitting sides. This happens no matter what and death, anger, destruction is used to push whoever's agenda best. My country is devolving into a state where there's no right or wrong anymore, just how many people you can get to agree.If anything I think these incidents are indicators of an overall trend of the general unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Happy people don't do these things. But you can't guarantee everyone's happiness forever at every moment, only try to provide for an environment for anyone to pursue happiness. We live in USA, an experiment from 200 years ago that through the generations have been built through trials and errors, blood and sweat. These are the costs and collateral damage of freedom. There are some that strive to keep the bar high but there are also people willing to kick the bar lower each day.If you are angered by any of this the very most important you can do now is do everything you can to keep raising the bar and help everyone else be there too. The rest is is just noise to scare you, to control you, to distract you.permalinksaveparent[+]brandonw00 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]brandonw00 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI don't see what having "freedom" has to do with a shooting. There are many countries that have the same freedoms that Americans have, yet they don't have this kind of violence in their country. I do agree with your statement about these incidents are indicators that people are not happy. It is too bad though, because life is a beautiful thing, and everyone alive has the opportunity to experience it! Every day is a new adventure, every day you get to see the sun rise, the world come alive, the wildlife move about, you get to interact with other individuals. It is too bad people don't value life more.

Either way it's an ongoing struggle for Americans of this current generation to define what freedom means, because quite frankly, after my service in the Marine Corps, after more than a decade of war, I don't believe anyone truly understand what freedom really means.As for the beauty of life, having socialized and hanging with the broken, misfits, the traumatized, and the suicidal the past few years... the one thing I learned is that just because you're not wrong doesn't necessarily make you right either. permalinksaveparentload more comments(1 reply)[+]snarketeer 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]snarketeer 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour agoIt's a little easier to get rid of guns, or at least do more to DRASTICALLY limit access, than change an entire society.permalinksaveparent[+]weric91 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes ago (1 child)[]weric91 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes agoYou obviously haven't been to a gun show in a rural area.

Do you really think the shooter(s) would say to him/herself, "I'd really like to commit mass murder. Oh darn! Guns are illegal!

Guns have little to no impact upon a society's violence rates. Japan and Switzerland have the lowest rate of gun violence. Japan bans guns to the pint that the police are unarmed. Switzerland requires citizens to own firearms. Obviously, gun violence is a symptom of education and economic stability, not restrictive legislation. If the presence of guns is indicative of violence, then everyone in America would have died of a fatal gunshot as a direct result of the over abundance of guns. That hasn't happened, so...permalinksaveparent[+]dusters 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]dusters 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoAnd you are too busy planning your argument for why they should be banned.permalinksaveparent[+]flyguy52 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)[]flyguy52 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes agoAnd what are you doing at this very moment?

You can call them rare if it makes you feel better, but relative to every other civilized society on Earth (and also the uncivilized ones), they're not, even when you adjust for population size.Guns are a complicated issue all around, as is mental health care in the US and how it plays into these issues, but those are the numbers.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 8 points9 points10 points 1 hour ago (19 children)[]StrahansToothGap 8 points9 points10 points 1 hour agosource?permalinksaveparent[+]cyclicamp 3 points4 points5 points 49 minutes ago (3 children)[]cyclicamp 3 points4 points5 points 49 minutes agoAfter searching "Anthony de Rosa school shootings Reuters," the first result here leads one to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which has a comprehensive listing of U.S. school shootings.

I'm reading a bunch of things during this right now, and if someone is presenting information, I just simply asked if they can point to a source since they've apparently already done the investigation.  I don't think that is so terrible.  I am self-sufficient, but I am also smart enough to not do work that's already done.  Technically, everything on reddit you can investigate yourself.  It's convenient when people bring it to you though.  permalinksaveparent[+]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes ago (1 child)[]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes agoI apologize for being short.  Usually when I see someone typing "source" and nothing else they're doing it to express disbelief, and seeing it in response to a post with a citation seemed lazy since most of the work was done at that point.In other words, I was not expecting it to mean something rational like "Could you please expand upon that citation with a link?" since in all my time here it hadn't before.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 9 minutes ago (0 children)[]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 9 minutes agoCool.
