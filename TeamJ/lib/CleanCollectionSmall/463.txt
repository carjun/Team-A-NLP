Drink the cool aid...you are an ass. It is people like you, sir, that will be the demise of this country. So unmoved by tragedy and heartless that there is a point of contention. Maybe if we removed sociopaths this would be a better place.Reply 7 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Karri Underwood's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Karri Underwood's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserLollypopStuffs                14 hours agoI agree with the comment below me, we all need to remember that today a lot of young kids died. They deserve to be respected and not used as an argument. They were people and their families are going through hell right now.Just respect that today.Reply 5 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate LollypopStuffs's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate LollypopStuffs's comment.Sign inVideo ResponsesThis video is a response to Earthquake Watch December 15 2012 Connecticut ShootingAll Comments (317)Update automaticallyDisable automatic updatesRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Userxtheunicornx                1 minute agoTHAN DO SOMETHING!Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate xtheunicornx's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate xtheunicornx's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserDan Stewart                15 minutes agoAmazing acting skills.

If we can get 25000 signatures, we can get the President to address this problem and what he is doing to change our gun restrictions.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate TheMrEdphonse's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate TheMrEdphonse's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Userfullert11829                1 hour agoIt seems that anyone that has a problem with the President having to fight some emotions while delivering the news to the country that 1 of our own has went in and slaughtered a bunch of small children...wtf? Quite frankly can't you find something better to do then leave comments that are disrespectful I'm sure there's gotta be something else that you can do with your time. Perhaps get off the internet and go find yourself a self help book... And perhaps read it twice.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate fullert11829's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate fullert11829's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserDat GoodFeel                2 hours agoI quite honestly don't blame him. It might not be a great thing to display emotion and make him weak, but I think any parent would be sad to deliver such bad news, especially when it could happen to your kids.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Dat GoodFeel's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Dat GoodFeel's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserThomas Reed                3 hours agoI am tired of watching the leader of the free world cry.

You don't see that many shootings happen there. The laws need to be tailored to the USA if gun death numbers cannot be kept to a bare minimum.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate MissMediaPower's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate MissMediaPower's comment.Sign inShow more Loading comment...Loading...2:35Jenni Rivera dies at 43 in plane crash -  Mexican-American Singer Tragic Endby Newsforthenation14,651,553 views4:49Adam Sandler "Sandy, Screw Ya!"
