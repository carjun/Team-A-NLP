Also, eat something filling for dinner. Soups and crappy replacement meals are not actual replacements for meals. Have some good things: meats, veggies, healthy fats like cheese. Your body will be happier, and you'll be too full to snack.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI realized my foreign coworker would not spend halloween with her kids because she didn't know how. Instead of going back home, I spent the evening showing her family how to trick or treat from door to door. Reddit, what unexpected series of events happened on your Halloween?  by  Some_french_canadianin  AskReddit[+]nonnyduck 4 points5 points6 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]nonnyduck 4 points5 points6 points 1 month agoI went to give candy to my neighbor's developmentally delayed daughter. He couldn't get her to go trick or treating this year. She was just kneeling on the ground repeating random sounds to herself, wearing a blue princess costume.So I just held out a bowl of candy for her, and she grabbed the one full sized Hershey's bar in there.Her dad laughed, and then asked her, "What do we say?""Trick or treat."Better than a thank you at that moment, I can tell you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOFFICIAL WEEK 9 TRASH TALK THREAD  by  NFL_Modin  nfl[+]nonnyduck 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]nonnyduck 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoTHIS BYE WEEK WON'T SCORE A SINGLE POINT ON US.

And the reason is that it's not considered attractive for chicks to have leg hair. So... yeah. It's kind of sexist.
