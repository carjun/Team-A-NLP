The only useful measurement of 'size' in this case is population, and the United States has a much, much smaller population than the European Union. 310 million vs 500 million people, respectively.Please adjust your perceptions.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCheaper version of these boots?

Horses do not do rough terrain like this at their top speed.In fact, humans routinely win long distance races with horses over rough terrain.Not just that, it is rough AND downhill. Horse riders are usually taught to keep their horse slower on declines. It's principally for the same reason: to prevent injury.Horses evolved for very flat environments. I guarantee that the riders were not making those hunting dogs keep up with a horse at full gallop in rough, downhill terrain.permalinksavecontextfull comments132 high resolution photos of the actual blaster prop from Blade Runner  by  CircumcisedSpinein  Cyberpunk[+]SenatorVreenak 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]SenatorVreenak 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoAdam Savage's personal replica of the gun.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThey say if you spend 2hrs in the gym each day that you will live an extra 10 years...  by  fwoooooshin  MLPLounge[+]SenatorVreenak 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]SenatorVreenak 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago[wetblanket mode] In case there is anyone taking "this math doesn't make sense" joke too seriously, please don't.I volunteer alongside many retired folks of different ages, at a hospital that serves mainly older patients. I get to see both sides of this. The difference continual activity makes in both the physical health and mental health of older folks is tremendous.You shouldn't look at this as having an extra decade, but as insuring your ability enjoy the life you have as long as possible. You will get much more than a decade out of being active. It is both sad and terrifying to see human beings fade.It is also inspiring to see 90 year old dudes doing (almost) whatever they want.And you only need about 20-30 minutes 3 to 4 times a week, not 2 hours in a gym every day. You can get those 20-30 minutes from home, easily, without expensive equipment.[/wetblanket mode]permalinksavecontextfull commentsSeen in NJ, what a friendly neighbor  by  RuffDesperadoin  pics[+]SenatorVreenak 5 points6 points7 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]SenatorVreenak 5 points6 points7 points 1 month agoYou just wont stay in business for very long.

I would be upset if I never saw my pet again because someone assumed it was abandoned and put in superficial effort to reach out.Like when people on reddit adopt 'homeless' cats they swear are feral.Feral cats are not friendly.
