It could be another situation where Smoker is named the hero who defeats Virgo and Ceasark while Luffy's bounty increases. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBaby 5 and Buffalo??

Bounty does not necessarily reflect strength, for example Robin has a high bounty than Sanji yet we can agree that Sanji is stronger.Likewise Luffy usually fights the strongest enemy because he's the main character and that's how Shonen works.  However Zoro is usually handicapped whenever fighting the second strongest and usually comes out better than Luffy.Finally a lot of people have been saying that if Zoro didn't respect Luffy he wouldn't follow him, which I completely agree with.  However it's not only Luffy's strength that has earned his respect.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSanji is going to be so pissed.  by  Mr_NeCr0in  OnePiece[+]moronic_comment 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agoBut he doesn't have one now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSanji is going to be so pissed.  by  Mr_NeCr0in  OnePiece[+]moronic_comment 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoAce doesn't have a bounty because of certain circumstances regarding his position, however Dragon being the most wanted man in the world most certainly has a bounty.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey reddit, what is your favorite fact about the universe that just blows your mind?  by  aaaaalicein  AskReddit[+]moronic_comment 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 0 points1 point2 points 14 days agoWhat do you mean outside the universe?permalinksavecontextfull commentsDear lord Enel, It's true!

Whitebeard wrecked Sakazuki, however he had a lot of trouble doing so such as having a molten hand thrust through his chest.  Same with Kuzan who nearly killed him before.  All three of the admirals faced off with Whitebeard and all of them made it out alive and capable of fighting.Likewise it would make no sense to hunt down Whitebeard because perhaps the Government could have taken him down, but the losses would be so high that it wouldn't be worth it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAm I the only one who can't wait to see how Coby has improved?  by  Djdude128in  OnePiece[+]moronic_comment -3 points-2 points-1 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment -3 points-2 points-1 points 17 days agoMuch weaker, the admirals were in the same league as Whitebeard.

From what we've seen from Shanks, Whitebeard and possibly Big Mam none of them actually want One Piece.  Whitebeard wanted to sail the seas with his family, Shanks likes to relax and pal around and has probably already been to Raftel and Big Mom has been shown to turn down treasure instead of candy.  You also have to get through the Yonko to get to Raftel so these three and maybe Kaidou stand in the way of people getting to Raftel while never seeking it themselves.permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuestion on Luffy's Tattoo  by  ChokeArtist50in  OnePiece[+]moronic_comment 1 point2 points3 points 24 days ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 1 point2 points3 points 24 days agoWell sure he can eat it, it would just be a little chewy.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTheory on madam sharley's prediction.

Likewise we don't even know how inanimate objects eat devil fruit so it's kind of a null point to discuss what would happen.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTeachers of Reddit, what really goes on in the teachers lounge?  by  herpderpydooin  AskReddit[+]moronic_comment 2 points3 points4 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 2 points3 points4 points 29 days agoBecause it hit you right in the funny bone right? permalinksavecontextfull commentsTrafalgar Law's Plan (major manga spoilers)  by  slashbringinghasherin  OnePiece[+]moronic_comment 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoBut Nami would be shocked if she knew they were going after such a powerful man as blackbeard.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, can you name one thing that is and will remain impossible?  by  keitarnoin  AskReddit[+]moronic_comment 11 points12 points13 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 11 points12 points13 points 1 month agoWhat the hell does almost infinite mean?permalinksavecontextfull commentsFan Theories that bother you?  by  Imadoc91in  OnePiece[+]moronic_comment 4 points5 points6 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 4 points5 points6 points 1 month agoThat was a fake page.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow Democrats in Texas must feel today  by  See_Bassin  AdviceAnimals[+]moronic_comment 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]moronic_comment 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoArrow's impossibility theorem.
