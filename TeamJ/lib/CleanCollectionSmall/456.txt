The massacre of 26 children and adults at a Connecticut elementary school elicited horror and soul-searching around the world even as it raised more basic questions about why the gunman, a 20-year-old described as brilliant but remote, would have been driven to such a crime and how he chose his victims. CBS News has learned that all of the dead have been identified by authorities with the help of pictures provided by grieving parents and family members. Connecticut State Police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance told "CBS This Morning: Saturday" that the bodies have been removed from the school, which remains a crime scene.

Police shed no light on the motive for the nation's second-deadliest school shooting. At a Saturday morning press briefing Lt. Vance said that investigators at the school crime scene and at the secondary crime scene - the home of the shooter's mother - did produce "very good evidence.""We're hopeful it will paint a complete picture as to how and why this unfortunate incident occurred," he said. Lt. Vance also confirmed that the gunman was not allowed into the elementary school and had forcibly entered the building. He also said there have been other arrests associated with this investigation. In tight-knit Newtown on Friday night, hundreds of people packed St. Rose of Lima church and stood outside in a vigil for the 28 dead  20 children and six adults at the school, the gunman's mother at home, and the gunman himself, who committed suicide. People held hands, lit candles and sang "Silent Night."  "These 20 children were just beautiful, beautiful children," Monsignor Robert Weiss said. "These 20 children lit up this community better than all these Christmas lights we have. ... There are a lot brighter stars up there tonight because of these kids."  One parent whose children had escaped the event felt a different emotion: "I feel in some respect guilty because I have my baby here, and I just hope anybody who needs help . . . I feel terrible."   Lanza is believed to have suffered from a personality disorder and lived with his mother, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation.  Will school shooting spur gun control action?How to talk to kids about the shootingMass shootings in 2012: Details on 13 incidents Lanza shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, drove to the school in her car with at least three guns, including a high-powered rifle that he apparently left in the back of the vehicle, and shot up two classrooms around 9:30 a.m. Friday, law enforcement officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  A custodian ran through the halls, warning of a gunman, and someone switched on the intercom, perhaps saving many lives by letting them hear the chaos in the school office, a teacher said. Teachers locked their doors and ordered children to huddle in a corner or hide in closets as shots echoed through the building. 47 PhotosConnecticut elementary school shooting The well-liked principal, Dawn Hochsprung, was believed to be among the dead. A woman who worked at the school was wounded. An update on victims' identities was possible Saturday morning, state police Lt. Paul Vance said Friday evening.  A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said investigators believe Lanza attended the school several years ago but appeared to have no recent connection to it.  At least one parent said Lanza's mother was a substitute teacher there. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.  Lanza's older brother, 24-year-old Ryan Lanza, of Hoboken, N.J., was questioned, but a law enforcement official said he was not believed to have had a role in the rampage. Investigators were searching his computers and phone records, but he told law enforcement he had not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.  The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the unfolding investigation.  At one point, a law enforcement official mistakenly identified the gunman as Ryan Lanza. Brett Wilshe, a friend of Ryan Lanza's, said Lanza told him the gunman may have had his identification. Ryan Lanza apparently posted Facebook page updates Friday afternoon that read, "It wasn't me" and "I was at work."  For about two hours late Friday and early Saturday, clergy members and emergency vehicles moved steadily to and from the school. The state medical examiner's office said bodies of the victims would be taken there eventually for autopsies. A law enforcement source told CBS News that Adam Lanza had three weapons with him during the attack: Two handguns (a Sig Sauer and a Glock), and a Bushmaster .223 assault rifle; spent shells were found in the school. Those three weapons were registered to his mother.  There was also a fourth weapon (a long gun) found in the car he drove to the school.  In addition, the source told CBS News there were "a few" other weapons found at the mother's house. The registry of the weapon in the car and at the house are still be checked. The tracing of all the weapons - such as where and when they were purchased - is still being conducted.   The Associated Press reports a Henry repeating rifle, an Enfield rifle and a shotgun were recovered. It was not clear exactly where those weapons were found.  Adam Lanza and his mother lived in a well-to-do part of prosperous Newtown, about 60 miles northeast of New York City, where neighbors are doctors or hold white-collar positions at companies such as General Electric, Pepsi and IBM.  Lanza's parents filed for divorce in 2008, according to court records. His father, Peter Lanza, lives in Stamford, Conn., and works as a tax director for General Electric.  The gunman's aunt Marsha Lanza, of Crystal Lake, Ill., said her nephew was raised by kind, nurturing parents who would not have hesitated to seek mental help for him if he needed it.  "Nancy wasn't one to deny reality," Marsha Lanza said, adding her husband had seen Adam as recently as June and recalled nothing out of the ordinary.       no previous page     next    1/2    2012 CBS Interactive Inc.

The problem is that after the grieving, it doesn't take much time before people forget and move on, and nothing gets done about the problem!

Motive is easy to figure out. Adam's mother was the authority figure in the household and he hated her and everything she stood for, probably blaming her for every bad thing that ever happened to him in his short life. That's the way delusional minds, such as those of people suffering from paranoid schizophrenia work. The act of killing his mother was just too quick to satisfy his rage, so he went to the school to continue to kill her by killing everything that reminded him of her until he just used up all of his anger. While we will probably never know for sure, it's a safe bet that his mother and other close family members were aware of his mental health issues for a long time. Whether they ever attempted to have Adam address those issues by getting professional help, or like so many other families, they just ignored the problem and even tried to hide it out of shame or embarrassment is yet another part of this sad story that likely will never be known. Anyone who thinks that this tragedy could have been prevented by some kind of gun law or any other law is suffering from delusions of their own. We need to be trying to educate and inform our citizens on how to spot the signs of mental illness and how to deal with it.     reply        cbsnews11 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  People who think gun control laws would help in situations like this are not suffering from delusions. Gun controls might help keep some things like this from happening. It would just be naive to think that all crimes like this would be stopped by gun controls. Again, however, that doesn't mean gun control laws wouldn't help prevent these kinds of crimes.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  IPonUall2 says: Do the insane need a motive?     reply        erasmus111 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  No, they do not.

For a country that is considered to be the best in the world (by their standards), it's actually very primitive and barbaric. The fanatics refuse to see it. What is wrong with these people? There is something wrong. SERIOUSLY wrong. Why do they feel the need for guns? Where is the fear coming from? The only thing to fear is themselves.People keep saying that there are enough laws. That's just bullcrap. You don't have many laws, and what little there are, they aren't enforced. Very few states actually have the law to LOCK UP THE GUNS! And you know what the real kicker is, most don't even know what their gun laws are! I'm not American and I know more about your guns laws than you do!There are so many guns out there now, and so many mentally unstable people, that laws are no longer going to help, anyways. America is out of control. The idiots always say that if there were no guns, then knives would be used. Well, as it was pointed out on Piers Morgan last night, those children in China, the ones that were stabbed with a knife, THEY ALL LIVED. When threatened with a knife, you at least have the opportunity to run away or try to fight them off. With a gun, you're dead before you even know there is a problem.America had over 9,000 deaths from guns last year. So many of them are children. When are you people going to wake up? The time for more laws and gun "control" has passed. It's time to ban them. It's time to start collecting them. Get the military out there going door to door and confiscating them. The "sick", and that is exactly what these fanatics (NRA/Republicans) are, should no longer have a say.     reply        One American replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  We carry guns to protect ourselves from Leftist zealots like yourself.Don't you dare try.            teflondonn replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  ONE AMERICAN, there seems to be a common theme to your posts.

The facts say otherwise. His father lives right down the road and has not seen his son for six months! The aunt refers to this as "as recently as June" - you have to be used to a lot of disfunctionality to think 6 months is recent contact for a "kind and nurturing" dad. The brother also lives and works nearby, but says he has not had contact with his brother since 2010. As Lanza lived with the mother it's pretty clear that this young son has not been home for years. A kind and nurturing family would not have this happen.Can the media, out of respect to those of us parents that strive hard to create loving homes and out of journalistic integrity, please stop describing this family as kind and nurturing! It is simply misreporting!     reply        andie52 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  You are spot on the facts say this family and the shooter had a lot of issues leading up to the killings.Shame on all of them for not addressing the mental haelth problems before. innocent children and adults were killed!               linkicon reporticon emailicon  Libertarian084 says: Oh, you just gotta love the media.
