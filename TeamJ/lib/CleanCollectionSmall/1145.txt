How many dead is good enough to make my point?  The guy who drove his truck purposefully through a crowd killing over thirty?  Is that good?  How about McVeigh, his truck bomb (very creative of him eh, a gun would have been so much easier?) killed over 160.. Is that too many?

How about a serious Mental Health Care debate instead?  Gun control is the low hanging fruit and it so far has proven completely ineffectual.  The means will always be the means, it's the cause should be were all the effort is placed.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Samueul 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Samueul 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThat's a fallacy.  Norweigh has much stricter gun laws than the US and that didn't hinder Anders Breivik much.  DC sniper killed 11 people at 11 different scenes with an "assault weapon" but only fired a single shot each time.  Timothy McVeigh killed over 160 people with a truck bomb....  Get rid of guns (impossible anyway) and you will produce more creative mass murderers because that's what these people are... The means by which they kill does not matter.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Guy drove his truck into a crowd purposefully and killed over thirty, another guy in japan or china went on a knifing spree in a kindergarten and killed like 11.  Doesn't diminish this tragedy by any means, but guns are not the only means and there is data to back it up.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I'd be more interested to know if the shooters obtained the weapons legally, had any history of violence or mental issues, criminal records etc.  I really could care less about the means by which they killed these people with and more concerned with the why.
