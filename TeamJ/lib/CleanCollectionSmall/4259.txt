Only a small fraction will have any kind of long term problems. Most of them did not witness anything. They heard sounds in the distance and people told them to run. It won't be until they are older they fully realize what happened. permalinksaveparent[+]ologies 16 points17 points18 points 43 minutes ago (1 child)[]ologies 16 points17 points18 points 43 minutes agoI'm inclined to agree with you - children are resilient and have pliant enough minds at this point that with the right support structure and guidance, even those who witnessed the worst of it first-hand have a good chance of growing up to be healthy, productive adults. I hope they get all the help they need and are surrounded by lots of love and patience while they cope.permalinksaveparent[+]nixonrichard -2 points-1 points0 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]nixonrichard -2 points-1 points0 points 23 minutes agoIt sounds like those who witnessed the worst of it didn't make it out.God save any poor little Dexter who lived through that nightmare of all your friends and peers around you being slaughtered.Poor kids.  I wish I could extend a big hug to every one of them.  Somehow, though, I don't think any amount of hugging will do the trick.permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 5 points6 points7 points 34 minutes ago (6 children)[]chrissymad 5 points6 points7 points 34 minutes agoAt fourth grade they will most definitely be profoundly effected by that for life. They are also going to experience the loss of teachers and children their own age. The younger children especially, are going to be forced to mature a lot quicker than they should. At age 5, most children still don't fully understand the concept of death and it is a very strange situation for them to be in when someone their own age passes away. permalinksaveparent[+]hemmicw9 1 point2 points3 points 24 minutes ago (0 children)[]hemmicw9 1 point2 points3 points 24 minutes agoThis whole situation is making me sick and depressed. So horrible. permalinksaveparent[+]fkausername 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes ago (1 child)[]fkausername 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes agoYou are most certainly correct about having to mature much quicker from dealing with this. Reality hits you at a young age. You lose that innocence you once had. I lost my parents at 8 years old and life was never the same. As much as I wanted it to be normal, there was always that thing in the back of your head haunting you.permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]chrissymad 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago<3 When I was 9 years old, in the fourth grade, a first grader who I would play with in aftercare was killed in a drunk driving accident while we were on Christmas break. I wasn't there to experience her death, obviously but the aftermath was awful. I can't imagine what these kids will go through, especially being there and seeing their friends die. I can only hope that they have a strong and loving support system for life. permalinksaveparent[+]iatowk -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes ago (1 child)[]iatowk -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes agowill most definitely be profoundly effected by that for lifedo you have any evidence supporting that?permalinksaveparent[+]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)[]chrissymad 2 points3 points4 points 6 minutes agoWill post more later but: hereAfter five years of age, children gradually understand "that death is final, inevitable, universal, and personal" (Grollman, 1967, p. 101).Most ten-year-olds understand that death is an irreversible and inescapable part of life.This was a k-4 school, they're mostly at an age where they are learning or already know what death entails. Let alone the fact that I'm sure some kids will have seen their fellow school mates be murdered. Also why is no one jumping on the other train for the previous posters who stated the children will not be effected at all? permalinksaveparent[+]smacksaw -4 points-3 points-2 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]smacksaw -4 points-3 points-2 points 23 minutes agoCitation neededSeriously. PubMed. Now. permalinksaveparent[+]scatmango -1 points0 points1 point 39 minutes ago (0 children)[]scatmango -1 points0 points1 point 39 minutes agoI agree.  What sort of trauma will the adults around them insist that the children experience? It's really up to the parents to what extent they allow their children to be traumatized because no child can really understand what just went down.permalinksaveparent[+]FreeDirt 0 points1 point2 points 34 minutes ago (0 children)[]FreeDirt 0 points1 point2 points 34 minutes agoI sincerely hope this is the true outcome.permalinksaveparent[+]UbiquitousOddity 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]UbiquitousOddity 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes agoUntil they notice that some their classmates aren't showing up anymore...
