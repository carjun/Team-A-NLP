But so far, the suggestions range from ill-informed to probably irrelevant. Gun rights, even in IllinoisDecember 13, 2012There are certain constants to life in Illinois. Abraham Lincoln has always been revered. The Cubs always find a way to lose. Lake Michigan never goes dry. Letting citizens carrying concealed firearms is out of the question.Concealed-carry in Illinois, at lastDecember 11, 2012Illinois is the only state in the country that does not make some provision for ordinary citizens to carry concealed firearms. But not for long. Today, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said the state ban is unconstitutional because it violates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. Raising the Medicare age is no solutionDecember 10, 2012It's a simple, reasonable idea that would recognize growing lifespans and trim federal outlays on a fast-growing part of the budget, Medicare. The idea? Raise the age of eligibility from 65 to 67. The trouble is, it will help one problem only a littlewhile making another one significantly worse.The unlikelihood of President HillaryDecember 9, 2012The votes have been cast, the count has been completed and we all know the winner of the presidential election. So now it's just a matter of letting the Electoral College meet to make the outcome official. Then we can get along with planning the inauguration of Hillary Clinton.The Supreme Court and gay marriageDecember 7, 2012The Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases challenging laws against same-sex marriage, and that's good news for supporters of the concept. Each of these cases gives the justices room to expand the rights of gay couples without taking the huge step of asserting their constitutional right to wed. And I'm guessing that's what they will do.Defending the world, bankrupting ourselvesDecember 6, 2012The argument for leaving 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan after 2014 is more or less reasonable on its face. The Kabul government is fragile; our gains might be reversed; the Afghan military is not ready to stand on its own. Here's the unreasonable, unavoidable part: If we don't leave then, we probably never will.Michelle 2016? No. No. No.December 5, 2012The Democratic Party has plenty of credible possibilities for the 2016 presidential nomination, including several women: not just Hillary Clinton, but Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Sen. Ellen Warren of Massachusetts, even Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. But who does Newsweek magazine focus on? Michelle Obama.Scrap the dollar bill? Dream onDecember 3, 2012Congress is considering, not for the first time, getting rid of the dollar bill and replacing it once and for all with a dollar coin. It makes all kinds of sense, and it has for years. Canada did it and survived.But I wouldn't bet a single greenback it will happen in the next four years.Higher taxes, lower spending?December 2, 2012It comes as no surprise to hear anti-tax activist Grover Norquist talk about tax cuts, but it does come as a surprise to hear him raise the subject of pink unicorns.How the consumer became kingNovember 29, 2012Some 200 retailers nationally opened their doors on Thanksgiving Day, and a lot of others did so at midnight. Shoes, jewelry, sporting goods, flat-screen TVs, fancy chocolate  if you wanted it, you could buy it before the football games were finished.Can Republicans shift on immigration?November 28, 2012It's obvious to everyone that Republicans need to take a less restrictive and punitive approach to immigration. That became clear on Election Day, when Mitt Romney found himself badly beaten among a Hispanic segment that is only going to keep growing. A losing immigration strategyNovember 18, 2012Everyone in Washington is showing new interest in immigration reform. President Barack Obama needs to do something to cement the loyalty of Hispanics, who did so much to re-elect him. Republicans seem to grasp that they had better soften their hard line unless they want to forfeit any hope with Latinos and Asian-Americans.The lesson of Cutler's concussionNovember 16, 2012Jay Cutler won't play for the Bears Monday night at San Francisco, and fans should be glad. After suffering a concussion on Sunday,heclearly shouldn't exposed himself to riskagain so soon.But the Cutler episode only shows that the current way of handling such incidents is dangerously obsolete.  GOP should reassess the Electoral CollegeNovember 15, 2012In 2000, conservatives were obligated to explain why they supported preservation of the Electoral College even though it produced a victory for their candidate, George W. Bush. In coming elections, their devotion may face a sterner test: Will they favor it if Democrats win the White House even when Republicans carry the popular vote?Unhinged by ObamaNovember 11, 2012On Wednesday morning, sober conservatives pondered an election defeat, swallowed their disappointment and turned their attention to things that truly affect their lives, such as work and family. But there are other conservatives, who were profoundly affected by their collision with reality.Voters say: Keep the changeNovember 8, 2012Republicans are mystified that in a nation they know as fundamentally conservative, a president they regard as deeply radical has been re-elected. But Americans didn't vote for Barack Obama because they are liberal. They voted for him because they are conservative.How a bitter campaign will endNovember 4, 2012Last month, a New York Times story noted "an extraordinary event" in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. President Mikhail Saakashvili, whose human rights record is not exactly the gold standard, "conceded defeat in parliamentary elections," saying gamely that "democracy works in this way." The candidates trade nonsenseNovember 1, 2012A national political campaign can be a good vehicle for educating the citizenry about vital issues  whether fiscal balance requires tax increases, say, or the pros and cons of health care reform. By Election Day, Americans who have been paying attention will know more about such matters than they did when the race began.Letitia Baldridge's real missionOctober 31, 2012If you read the headline on her obituary in The New York Times, referring to her as an "etiquette maven," or The Washington Post's description of her as the "doyenne of decorum," you might have an image of Letitia Baldridge as a stern, exacting schoolmarm who would rap you on the knuckles for using the wrong fork. From my one experience with her, she was nothing like that. The tax reform mirageOctober 29, 2012Tax reform is the new rage. It's not just the favorite idea on the campaign trail and think-tank circuit these days. It's the glorious inevitability that will end the nation's fiscal crisis.The day after we attack IranOctober 29, 2012Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are agreed on one thing: If Iran refuses to give up its apparent pursuit of nuclear weapons, at some point we will have no choice but to intervene with military force. The discussion, to the extent there has been one, is just about where that point lies. But an attack on Iran would not be the end of matter. It would just be the start.Foreign policy surprises aheadOctober 25, 2012Americans who watched Monday's debate learned that Mitt Romney wanted to sound like Barack Obama on major world issues and that Obama wanted to highlight the contrasts. They learned that Romney can be vague and Obama can be condescending. They learned that Bob Schieffer can't keep a discussion from veering off course.The monster from the black energy drink canOctober 24, 2012The Food and Drug Administration is investigating Monster Energy over reports that it was connected to five deaths over the past three years, includinga 14-year-old girl who died of heart arrhythmia. Investors responded by dumping the company's stock, and it's safe to assume some parents are steering their kids away from energy drinks, whose high caffeine content is taken to be a mortal threat.Myths of Iraq and AfghanistanOctober 21, 2012When Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the other day the U.S. war in Afghanistan is "succeeding" and "has turned an important corner," I could have sworn I had heard that before. Where could it have been?Obama lacks vision? Good thingOctober 18, 2012Barack Obama was more assertive and combative in the second presidential debate Tuesday, but the inspiring orator of 2008 still had trouble painting a vivid picture of what his second term will look like. He wants to strengthen manufacturing and promote energy independence, but it's hard to find a grand theme or a sweeping vision.Romney's feint on Pell GrantsOctober 17, 2012Mitt Romney is unusually prone to 180-degree reversals of policy for naked political reasons, but it's hard to think of a chutzpah moment in his campaign more striking than his assertion last night, when a college student asked him about the bleak job climate. Romney responded by saying, "I want to make sure we keep our Pell Grant program growing."The HPV vaccine and teen sexOctober 15, 2012If you could vaccinate your kids against cancer, wouldn't you do it? The answer may sound obvious. But we can vaccinate our kids against some vicious types of cancer -- and many parents are deliberately choosing not to.Taxing bullets criminal  October 14, 2012For urban politicians, gun control is like the bar in "Cheers"  a place of refuge they can seek out whenever things aren't going well. Things aren't going well on the crime front in Chicago, with homicides up 25 percent this year. So what else can our elected leaders do but promise action against guns?Biden 2016?October 12, 2012Barack Obama probably enjoyed Joe Biden's aggressive performance in last night's debate, which was designed to fire up loyal Democrats demoralized by the president's weak showing in his outing last week. But among Democrats, I suspect there was one viewer with mixed feelings: Hillary Clinton. If she's contemplating a run for president in 2016, she may have to contend with a formidable opponent in Biden. The NRA's stubborn endorsement of RomneyOctober 5, 2012When he ran in 2008, Barack Obama sang from the National Rifle Association hymnal: "I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in peoples lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away. I wont take your handgun away."  Why Mitt's Mormonism doesn't matterOctober 4, 2012Mormonism is a minority sect once persecuted by mainstream American Christians for its unconventional doctrines and practice of polygamy. It is still viewed by many as an odd cult. But a Mormon is the Republican nominee for president, and he can take consolation that if he loses, it will not be because of his religion.'Fusion centers' and terrorismOctober 3, 2012After the 9/11 attacks in 2001,New York'sMetropolitan Transit Authoritytried to combat terrorism withposters instructing, "If you see something, say something." In 2008, it proudly announced that 1,944 people did exactly that. What it didn't mention is that the reports of suspicious activity and items led to only 18 arrests over the previous two years -- noneconnected toterrorist plots.Will pot laws go up in smoke?September 30, 2012Judging from recent history, any young person who aspires to be president should be aware that certain attributes seem to be critical. You have to be male. You have to have an Ivy League degree. You have to have been a governor or senator. And, don't forget, you have to have smoked marijuana.The GOP's environmental disasterSeptember 27, 2012By the time he died last month, Russell Train was largely forgotten. Most Americans didn't know that, as The New York Times' obituary said, he helped shape "the world's first comprehensive program for scrubbing the skies and waters of pollution, ensuring the survival of ecologically significant plants and animals, and safeguarding citizens from exposure to toxic chemicals."Striking a blow for choiceSeptember 23, 2012On Monday, Sept. 10, the first day the Chicago Teachers Union was out on strike, 350,000 public school students  and their parents  were left high and dry. But for 52,000 other youngsters enrolled in public schools, it was just another day of learning. They attend charter schools, of which the city has 118.Romney's dependency delusionsSeptember 20, 2012Mitt Romney's unguarded thoughts about the half of America that pays no income taxes  "who are dependent on government, who believe they are victims"  show a notable lack of empathy as well as political savvy. Maybe that's a surprise. But the big surprise is how little he seems to comprehend about the federal budget or the tax system or American politics.A weak foreign policy narrativeSeptember 16, 2012On Aug. 31, 1983, a South Korean airliner flying from New York to Seoul drifted off course and entered Soviet airspace. After tracking the civilian plane for more than two hours, Soviet fighter pilots were told to shoot it down. They did, killing 269 people, including 60 Americans. It was one of the most shocking atrocities of the Cold War.Is the Fed fooling the markets?September 14, 2012Free-market advocates, a group that emphatically includes me, think that markets aregenerally efficient, digesting all relevant information toreach reasonable conclusions. From the way the equity markets responded to the Federal Reserve's new round of quantitative easing -- they rose sharply -- you'd assume it's a healthy thing for the economy. Obama's auto fairy taleSeptember 13, 2012I'm a little hazy on the particulars, but as I understand things from the Democratic National Convention, a team of Navy SEALs landed in Detroit to save General Motors, and then autoworkers ran over Osama bin Laden repeatedly with a Chevy Volt.Romney's health care confusionSeptember 10, 2012Mitt Romney often comes across as a newcomer trying to learn an alien language. In his case, the language is conservatism. He's been running for the Republican nominationpresident off and on since 2007, but he still stumbles in addressing the natives. Obama didn't save the auto industrySeptember 5, 2012We heard it last night from former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, and we'll probably hear it ahundred times more before the Democratic convention is over: "Barack Obama saved the American auto industry." It's a great line, especially in battleground states like Ohio and Michigan. Too bad it's not true.The truth about Obama and welfareAugust 26, 2012The old line is that there's a simple way to know a politician is lying: His lips are moving. Odds are good that any lurid charge leveled against a candidate is largely fraudulent. So it was no surprise that when Mitt Romney accused Barack Obama of gutting welfare work requirements, fact checkers said his trousers were conspicuously aflame.Tobacco and free speechAugust 24, 2012The test of a society's commitment to freedom comes when it involves the rights of the unpopular. Not many people are less popular than the tobacco companies, which are regarded as shameless merchants of death. But a federal appeals courtsays their low status doesn't deprive them of First Amendment protection.The candidates vs. the Bill of RightsAugust 23, 2012Back in the early days of the Republic, the framers went to great trouble to draft and ratify the Bill of Rights. And every four years, our leaders pay homage to the framers by neglecting or disparaging that creation.Russian subs, dubious dangersAugust 22, 2012The national news media has largely ignored a story that has gotten a lot of attention among conservatives -- that a Russianattacksubmarine surreptitiously spent a month in the Gulf of Mexico. This is taken by some to prove that Vladimir Putin is a dangerous enemy and confirm Mitt Romney's view of Russia as our "number one geopolitical foe." But let's be serious. Putin's fear of Pussy RiotAugust 17, 2012Vladimir Putinis a famously tough guy -- a former KGB agent who knows karate, plays hockeyand gets photographed shirtless on horseback. But the Russian strongman is not really so strong. Evidently he's scare to death of three women who play in a punk rock band with the unforgettable name of Pussy Riot.Paul Ryan's incontestable virtuesAugust 13, 2012Having been on vacation until today, I'm late to the Paul Ryan party. But as someone who thought the selection of Sarah Palin thoroughly discredited John McCain's judgment, I have to say Mitt Romney has passed the most important test to date of his fitness to be president: choosing a running mate who would make a plausible president.The assault weapons mythAugust 1, 2012Gov. Quinn wants to outlaw the sale and possession of "assault weapons," insisting that "there is no place in Illinois for weapons designed to fire rapidly at human targets at close range." He doesn't mention that even if his ban were to pass, there would be plenty of other legal firearms that can be used to fire rapidly at human targets at close range -- or long range, for that matter. The silence on gun controlJuly 27, 2012President Obama said yesterday that "AK-47s belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities." You could take this as damning evidence that he has a secret plan to confiscate our firearms. Or you could take it as a head fake to mollify gun control advocates on his way to doing nothing.Chick-fil-A and free speechJuly 25, 2012In Chicago, the competition for the title of "most embarassing alderman" is intense and never-ending. But for the moment, no one comes close to Joe Moreno, who says he won't allow Chick-fil-A to build a restaurant in his 1st ward because he abhors its president's views on same-sex marriage.The weird GOP attacks on ObamaJuly 18, 2012If I were conspiracy-minded, I'd suspect Barack Obama has deployed several moles to sabotage his opponent. Take John Sununu, who yesterday attacked the president for having used drugs, spent time abroad and lived in Chicago. Or Phoenix Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who now claims to have proof Obama's birth certificate is a fraud. Mitt Romney's aides are vowing to expose Obama's past, insisting he wasn't "vetted" the last time around. If I were David Axelrod, I'd be smiling. Syria would be no cakewalkJuly 16, 2012With Bashar Assad waging a brutal war on his own people, there's a definite temptation for Americans to look for ways the United States could use its military power to turn the tide against the dictator. And past interventions in Libya and Kosovo have created the impression that we could play a decisive role in defeating Assad's forces at very low risk to our own.  Racial detours on the campaign trailJuly 15, 2012It may have been a bit surprising when the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People held its national convention and Mitt Romney showed up. Romney, as comedian Reggie Brown put it, is "what people who hate white people think of when they think of white people." He's likely to do about as well among black voters as he is among Wiccans.Give Jesse Jr. a breakJuly 13, 2012Along with everyone else, I think the voters of Jesse Jackson Jr.'s district are entitled to know a lot more about what's wrong with him and what his prospects are. But I don't think it's fair to blame him for the lack of information, and I don't think it's fair to blame his father.Iran and nuclear proliferation, cont.July 11, 2012In my Sunday column, I explained why we shouldn't expect a nuclear arms race in the Middle East if Iran manages to acquire the bomb. History indicates proliferation is rare, because most states facing nuclear enemies see no need to match their arsenals. But there's another reason to doubt an outbreak of proliferation: It's not as easy as it looks. The continuing Afghanistan failureJuly 9, 2012The last twodays have been a verybad spell in Afghanistan, with bombings that killed seven U.S. troops along with Afghan soldiers, policeand civilians. But then, are there ever gooddays in Afghanistan?John Roberts and ObamacareJuly 3, 2012When Chief Justice John Roberts is being excoriated by conservatives for upholding the Obamacare individual mandate -- just as when he is pilloried by liberals for concluding corporations have a right to engage in campaign spending -- the underlying assumption is that he has acted cravenly or politically. His motives are seen as sinister, and his reasoning attacked as a mere pretext. It's assumed that the meaning of the Constitution is inescapably clear and that no honest, intelligent person could avoid it. The surprising Obamacare verdictJuly 1, 2012From the sound of conservatives, Thursday was a day that will live in infamy. The U.S. Supreme Courtdecision upholding Obamacare unleashed a storm of outrage from critics who made it sound like a combination of Pearl Harbor, the Great Depression and the Black Plague.Chicago decriminalizes potJune 27, 2012The Chicago City Council doesn't always act with wisdom and frugality, but it did so today in voting to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana. Treating it as a crime wastes money, diverts police from truly scary activity and brands many minority youngsters with a police record that will hold them back in life. This new policy is more humane and more responsible.Arizona and the new immigration realityJune 25, 2012Supporters of Arizona's "show your papers" immigration law take comfort that the Supreme Court upheld the part allowing police to check the immigration status of people they lawfully stop. The Federation for American Immigration Reform called the decision "an important victory" for those "who want their jobs, tax dollars and security protected from mass illegal immigration." But since the police can't charge or hold illegal immigrants indefinitely, it may not have much effect.Obamacare, myth and realityJune 20, 2012Back when President Obama's health care reform was making its way through Congress, there was a lot of discussion of its various provisions. But since it became law, its actual content has been lost in the partisan warfare. Republican voters are strongly against it. But aside from the individual mandate, it's not clear they really know what it does. Burke, Rahm and potJune 18, 2012Ald. Ed Burke is not too keen on the mayor's proposal to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana, partly because because he is "very concerned with anything that gives kids the idea that this is not a bad thing to do."But Mayor Emanuel and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle have by far the better of the argument. Treating simple pot possession as a crime is a pointless endeavor and aterrible waste of resources.Obama's immigration moveJune 15, 2012President Obama's decision to halt the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought here as children is at best a rough and temporary remedy for a serious problem. I'm not entirely comfortable with the executive branch electing such broad non-enforcement of a valid law. I'd much rather see the law changed. Can Chicago teachers win a strike?June 11, 2012Members of the Chicago Teachers Union have voted by a nearly 90 percent majority to authorize a strike, which could happen this fall. That doesn't mean it will happen. But teachers may be forgiven for thinking they can get their way by walking. In the past, they always could. This time, I think, is different. The right's fraudulent fearsApril 1, 2012Whenever you hear about a psychic being arrested, the natural question is: Why didn't she see that coming? Conservatives who raise dire alarms about what will happen in Barack Obama's second term face a similar problem. They need him to lose so their predictions will not be exposed as products of raging paranoia.'Ag gag' bill stuffed in IllinoisMarch 12, 2012I don't get a lot of opportunities to applaud the Illinois General Assembly, but right now, commendations are in order. Disabling drunken driversMarch 11, 2012Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. It's a good rule for dealing with those who have proved themselves to be untrustworthy. And it's increasingly applied in a realm where a lack of dependability can be lethal: drunken driving.Obama's defense of religionFebruary 23, 2012Catholic bishops, evangelical pastors and Republican presidential candidates have been decrying the Obama administration's war on religious liberty. Amid all the uproar, it's easy to overlook something equally important: the administration's many battles for religious liberty.Inoculating against religious freedomFebruary 2, 2012A few weeks ago, Rick Santorum got some criticism for saying the U.S. Supreme Court erred in saying states may not outlaw contraception. The idea that Americans could legally be forbidden to buy condoms or birth control pills struck most people as a gross violation of personal liberty.Finish school or elseJanuary 29, 2012Many teenage kids regard school as the functional equivalent of prison  where they are forced to endure oppressive rules, bad food and unpleasant company. For them, Barack Obama has a message: There will be no parole.Obama's justicesJanuary 26, 2012Barack Obama, the law professor who railed against the Bush administration's disdain for privacy, has been to civil liberties what the Hindenburg was to air travel: an unexpected debacle. Time after time, he has chosen to uphold government power at the expense of individual protections.Is it a sin to promote gay rights abroad?December 18, 2011Back when Ronald Reagan was president, conservatives relished skewering liberals who, in approaching international affairs, "always blame America first." A generation later, with Barack Obama in the White House, they are proving they can indict the USA with the best of them.Obama's 'war on religion'December 10, 2011Texas Gov. Rick Perry has a new TV spot accusing President Barack Obama of waging "war on religion." It's a reckless, overstated spot that exploits prejudice against gays while deliberately distorting major issues. But here's the surprise: Perry has a point.Obama's burdenOctober 9, 2011Candidates for president generally blare recorded rock or country hits before their campaign rallies. At President Barack Obama's appearances, expect a different form of music: whistling in the dark.Why Obama should withdrawSeptember 18, 2011When Ronald Reagan ran for re-election in 1984, his slogan was "Morning in America." For Barack Obama, it's more like midnight in a coal mine.Bully pulpit's limitsSeptember 11, 2011In the summer of 1971, the nation was in the doldrums. Inflation was rising, and unemployment was painfully high. The stock market was sinking. Polls indicated President Richard Nixon could lose his 1972 re-election bid.Why Obama looks so badAugust 14, 2011Barack Obama came into office aspiring to bridge the chasm between liberals and conservatives, red states and blue states, and the gulf is gone. People in each camp heartily agree that as a president, he's a disappointment and a flop. Both sides even compare him to Jimmy Carter.The anti-ObamaJuly 24, 2011 When you pick up a glossy, multipage color brochure at a presidential campaign event, you expect to see a candidate's image on the front. The ones stacked on a table inside the Sports Page Grill, where Tim Pawlenty is appearing this morning, do feature that sort of photo. But it's not of Pawlenty. It's of Barack Obama.How Obama's stimulus failedJune 30, 2011Mired in excruciating negotiations over the budget and the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama might reflect that things didn't have to turn out this way. The impasse grows mainly out of one major decision he made early on: pushing through a giant stimulus.Obama and the pursuit of endless warJune 12, 2011When historians sit down decades from now to address the events of the early 21st century, they will have no trouble explaining why Americans elected Barack Obama president. They elected him out of a firm conviction that the United States was not involved in enough wars.A Libya war fit for a kingJune 1, 2011Remember back in your high school civics class when you were taught about the constitutional division of authority in matters of war? When you learned that the president has all the powers of an emperor, and Congress has all the powers of a potted plant?A conservative defense of ObamacareApril 17, 2011Opponents of President Barack Obama's health care program lost the legislative battle, but they have high hopes of stopping it yet. That could be accomplished by defeating Obama in 2012 and electing a Republican Congress. Or it could be done sooner, without an election, by the U.S. Supreme Court.Imperial leader at warApril 10, 2011After the 2008 election, Barack Obama was pondering the growth of presidential power. So, ABC News reported, he met with former Secretaries of State James Baker and Warren Christopher "about how to achieve more meaningful consultation between the president and Congress on the use of military force." Yes, he did. Then he went home and laughed till his ribs hurt.Did Obama avert a bloodbath in Libya?April 3, 2011Remember when a crusading president, acting on dubious intelligence, insufficient information and exaggerated fears, took the nation into a Middle Eastern war of choice? That was George W. Bush in 2003, invading Iraq. But it's also Barack Obama in 2011, attacking Libya.Obama, Libya and the ghosts of '68March 27, 2011In 2008, Democratic voters had their pick of many candidates for president  from Hillary Clinton to John Edwards to Joe Biden. Why did they choose Barack Obama?War: Obama's fatal attraction March 24, 2011It's a good thing we didn't elect John McCain in 2008. A McCain victory would have meant an escalation in Afghanistan, a third war in the Middle East and a president sending U.S. forces into harm's way heedless of public opinion or congressional power.Why Obama wants to cut corporate taxesFebruary 10, 2011America doesn't feel much like the champion of the world these days. Everywhere we look, we see other countries outdoing us  in economic growth, educational performance and men's soccer. But this year, we are expected to gain an impressive distinction: the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world.America's conservative moment?February 6, 2011If you want proof that America is a conservative country, Ronald Reagan provides it. Once seen as a reactionary nincompoop, he's probably the most respected president of the last 50 years. Highways and buildings bear his name. Republicans compete to see who can lavish the most praise on him.Fake budget plot: Obama, GOP agree to pretendJanuary 27, 2011Spring is months away, but bipartisanship is blooming in Washington. Amid a terrible fiscal crisis, President Barack Obama  and Republicans have come to a historic accord on the budget. They are agreed on a fake solution.Fooled by ObamaDecember 12, 2010Smart women know that if a guy is sending mixed signals  promising to call but never getting around to it, making dates and then canceling, professing warm feelings but not introducing you to his friends  it can mean only one thing: He's just not that into you.Obama's false alarmOctober 24, 2010At a campaign rally the other day, President Barack Obama decried those who say "you can't overcome the cynicism of politics; no, you can't overcome the special interests; no, you can't overcome the big money; no, you can't overcome the negative ads."Stimulus to nowhereSeptember 22, 2010No one spends money like the federal government. This year alone, it will shovel out $3.7 trillion, which works out to $7 million a minute.
