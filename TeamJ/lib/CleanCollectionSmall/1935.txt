But I wasn't sheltered either.  That's a pretty outlandish statement to make considering I'd say the vast amount of the population wasn't explained these things at such a young age and is dealing with the real world just fine.permalinksaveparent[+]RobbleDobble 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (2 children)[]RobbleDobble 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoNo, but you were exposed to death and violence and the realities of the world little by little.  Most of the children arent going to be noticibly effected by this event in the long run.These things happen in the world, the notion that it is somehow more horrific because it happened in our back yard is what i find rediculous.permalinksaveparent[+]ljackstar 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]ljackstar 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoIt only effects most people by a little when they see it on the newsShit changes when it happens to you in personpermalinksaveparent[+]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago*(0 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago*The only thing I can recall ever happening as a child was a classmate who died of an asthma attack.  At the time, I was terrified I'd wake up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe (I was 8).  I didn't have asthma, nor any other health problems and to be honest, even now, I still think about this classmate every once in awhile.  How her parents must have felt and how she never really had a chance to live her life because she died when she was in 2nd grade.  I'm 24 now if that makes any difference, and I still think about her occasionally and how sad it was such a young, seemingly healthy kid just passed away.  However, as a child I didn't quite grasp the finality of the entire thing.  As an adult it just seems wrong and unfair.Now, not saying this is true in every case, but some of these children had bullets flying past them (there is one interview with a small child describing this), seeing their teachers shot (another interview) and quite honestly, I can't imagine having to explain this to a kid.  Nor can I imagine having to try to reason with a child's logic why a grown adult would walk into a school and shoot 20 kindergarteners for no reason.  Small children don't really understand  (I imagine the older kids do, those between the 3rd and 4th grade).  But how do you explain to a 5-6 year old what occurred if they ask questions?  You have to be honest, but there's no reason a kid that young should have to know about the messed up stuff that occurs in this world.  Spare them their childhood basically.EDIT:  I guess what I'm trying to say is that, yes we were exposed in small doses.  We had time to adjust to loss and the realities of life normally.  Small children thrown into this sort of reality (the sort that makes grown adults cry--because to be honest I did when I heard this news, and I know several others who did as well) are not really comparable circumstances in the slightest.  This is an extreme, traumatic event.  This is not a naturally occurring event or a frequently occurring event.  It is a random, sick act of violence that quite honestly is going to fuck up tons of children's lives permanently.  If you can't recognize that then....wow.permalinksaveparent[+]DionysosX -1 points0 points1 point 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DionysosX -1 points0 points1 point 18 hours agoI would argue that the opposite is the case.Kids aren't able to rationalize what they experience, which means that they can't work at any trauma they experience and internalize.Having said that, most of the children at that school merely heard some shots. It's not going to ruin them.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 22 hours ago (1 child)[][deleted] 22 hours ago[deleted]permalinksaveparent[+]dweebcentric 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]dweebcentric 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours agoAnd their young siblings.permalinksaveparent[+]xiacidfireix 13 points14 points15 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]xiacidfireix 13 points14 points15 points 23 hours agoI live around 10 minutes away from Newtown.

This/these shooters are the lowest form of life. They are sub-human, sociopathic pieces of shit and deserve nothing less than to have their very existence forgotten and over-looked for the rest of human history. There is no punishment befitting what they've done to the victims, the surviving children's development, and everyone that this touches. It's rare that news makes me feel physically ill.permalinksaveparent[+]swested 34 points35 points36 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]swested 34 points35 points36 points 23 hours agoThey are sub-humanNo, they aren't. They're human beings with serious fucking mental issues coupled with pent-up rage. And until we stop writing off these events as just random, unfortunate occurrences and start addressing the fundamental social and cultural issues that drive people to perpetuate this violence, we're just going to continue being victims.permalinksaveparent[+]shugna 9 points10 points11 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]shugna 9 points10 points11 points 22 hours agoI over-reacted and over-spoke. I agree that it takes someone very ill to go through with something like this, but it does nothing to humanize these actions, in my mind.Having certain violent desires, sexual inclinations towards minors, or other fairly common "issues," does not make you less than human -- in fact it doesn't even make you that rare by human standards. I have immense respect for people who admit these tendencies and seek help and for the people that help them. When these same people go through with an atrocity such as this, I lose sympathy and respect for them. permalinksaveparent[+]DrDougExeter 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]DrDougExeter 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoNo what we really need are more laws!

You're talking as if young kids these days aren't in the know.  They are all in the know.  Shitty parenting + internet = kids no more.Whether this is good or bad remains to be seen.  But, judging from other countries that don't protect "childhood" as much as the USA once did, it's a bad thing.permalinksaveparent[+]swested 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]swested 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoThese kids are 5-9 years old.

Waiting until emotion is calm before starting discussion is EXACTLY what we should do.Logic demands a removal of emotion from a situation.  You're mad.  We're all mad.  And now is not the time to push an agenda or discuss "right" and "wrong."If you can't understand or refuse to agree with that, then you give up any future opportunities for argument that may come later.permalinksaveparent[+]Seakawn 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]Seakawn 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago*I agree with the fundamental sentiment you have, but you're not quite correct. I'll point out some erroneous conclusions you've jumped to without reasonable support.His point isn't automatically negated from having an origin in emotion, even anger. All this might do is distort or skew the logic, but not even always vastly. Sometimes, emotional rationale isn't even far from logical accuracy. Sure it tends to be, so as such, reasonably necessitates awareness/concern. But to say because A then B? Please clarify to the circumstance, because emotion isn't an ultimatum for logical negation. If you understand this, then my question would be: why didn't you specify specific to this circumstantial case?And even if he can't understand that or refused to agree, why does he give up any future opportunities for argument? Because merely his points might not be optimal? A construct of thought in logic without emotion might be more coherent, but it's not always closer to the truth nor objectivity. This isn't an absolute. This is conditional, and if you have the ability to re-read your post from distant eyes you might be able to see that your rhetoric suggests otherwise.Also, obvious anger? This fails to give credence to any possibility that this was a response that seems angry but was written from a completely unabashed tone stemming from any other attitude that isn't affected by anger. I mean yeah, dude, it looks like he's angry from the words he said. But the word "obvious" to me makes it look you obviously know something that you don't actually know. Use different words to reflect uncertainties, even if they are likely probabilities. (Especially if you're going to appear on a high horse for attempting to prove points that negate someone else's).I thought I would throw in my perception of your post. Take the criticism any way you would like.permalinksaveparent[+]vCarbonix[] 9 points10 points11 points 1 day ago (10 children)[]vCarbonix[] 9 points10 points11 points 1 day agoIf you outlaw guns the outlaws will still have guns.permalinksaveparent[+]hardlyart 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]hardlyart 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoTrue. But we should also be trying to make sure that deadly weapons are as inaccessible as reasonably possible to those who might misuse them.That said, events like this are often near impossible to prevent/predict and are more likely to correlate to those with mental/emotional issues than those simply with access to guns.permalinksaveparent[+]Imeatbag 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Imeatbag 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoFine.

Look I get it, guns are never gonna be able to truly be regulated. But we can regulate certain accepted behaviors or connections to the guns. Like bullets. You can't buy bullets without registering your gun. If there's illegal bullets out there, they sure as hell are coming from somewhere-so let's get to it.

I rather find out why they did what they did and work on weeding that out. I thin a lot of shootings happen because of mental instability such as depression and anxiety.

Killing the killer does nothing. Sure it makes others feel better or tries to give them some bit of broken peace but it also sends a message this is the correct way to fix this issue.

What happened is horrible but this is indeed a side of humanity. If you look into our history there has been far worse events and how we act and the changes we make due to an event like this will show if we have learned as a society. Almost all the time these things happen for a reason, like a volcano spilling out that has been building up pressure. Our job is to make changes to keep this from this being repeated.
