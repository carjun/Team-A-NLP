Orbital mechanics isn't too difficult a subject mathematically (in respects to needing to know very little calculus, though for 3d orbits you need vector calc), it just requires a knack for following sequential equations in order to find the desired variables. With a few weeks of study you would be able to understand the different type of orbit transfers and orbit types very easily. permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuestion about gpa on resume  by  styguyin  resumes[+]styguy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]styguy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoThis is just for a summer internship, i cant fit a coop into my schedule. permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuestion about gpa on resume  by  styguyin  resumes[+]styguy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]styguy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoYes i am an Aerospace Engineering major, so i know it is best to put my GPA on my resume. permalinksavecontextfull comments14567Question about gpa on resume (self.resumes)submitted 8 days ago* by styguy to resumes15 commentssharecancelloading...Novice Tricker in Progress  by  GenericAtheistin  Tricking[+]styguy 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]styguy 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoOnly thing i would really say would be to try to jump more vertical for your sideflip, you have a lot of unneeded travel distance. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPolice Stop Leads To Bizzare Arrest   by  mr_blankendin  Connecticut[+]styguy 3 points4 points5 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]styguy 3 points4 points5 points 9 days agoHow does one become a renowned transvestite? permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn my lifetime...  by  greenmachine969in  Futurology[+]styguy 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]styguy 0 points1 point2 points 11 days agoGo to school for aerospace engineering to aid your goal of going into the depths of space! permalinksavecontextfull commentsA video interview with Elon Musk, on his Dragon capsule, rocket plans and retiring on Mars.  by  danrantin  space[+]styguy 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]styguy 0 points1 point2 points 12 days agoI need to get a job with spacex really badly..permalinksavecontextfull commentsOf Monsters and Men - Mountain Sound  by  Ribbbittin  Music[+]styguy 1 point2 points3 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]styguy 1 point2 points3 points 15 days agoSuch a great band, saw them early this year in boston.
