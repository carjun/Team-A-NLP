The study was conducted for BCA by The Indiana School of Journalism/National Sports Journalism Center (NSJC) on the IUPUI Campus. The complete report can be viewed at www.bcasports.org.We are honored to collaborate with NSJC on the Men's Basketball HRC project stated Floyd A. Keith, BCA Executive Director. The 2012 HRC provides an opportunity to evaluate the hiring process and to create a baseline to measure progress. The number of black male D-I basketball student-athletes has steadily increased in recent years, but we have not seen the same trend in the hiring of black head coaches of men's basketball continued Keith. Pamela C. Laucella, Ph.D., Academic Director, NSJC at IUPUI and principal author of the HRC said this inaugural study will contribute to projects which promote accountability and transparency, and reinforce the need for sound and equitable hiring processes at universities and institutions of higher learning. The NSJC is committed to promoting and implementing diversity and inclusion in teaching, research and events. It trains students to critically analyze professional and ethical choices, and supports practical research that influences perception and policy within industry and society. BCA is highly charged to advocate for inclusion on all levels of sport and we are thrilled to add the DI mens basketball head coaching hires to the BCA annual HRCs. The process indicates that institutions appear more committed to conducting an inclusive interview and hiring process, yet much progress is still needed.About the Black Coaches & Administrators The Black Coaches & Administrators (BCA is a 501 (c) (3) tax exempt non-profit organization whose primary purpose is to foster the growth and development of ethnic minorities at all levels of sports both nationally and internationally.
