She is pretty cute, and her comedy seems more natural than the other comedy in this. The ending on the roof was so sweet it gave me diabetes.

So close.Opening: Good song, not terribly catchy. Showed the characters and not that special.Art: Again, its good but not great. I personally like the outlines of everything.MC: Her Seiyuu is fantastic. When she was standing up to those boys in the batting place, you could hear her voice crack and stutter, it was great. Also she looks adorable.Haru: I would have preferred if he was just a regular kid who has problems socializing with others due to physical violence, instead of being the top kid of the class. Makes him feel like Gary Stu by having both brains and brawn, but I still like his character.Story: So far so good. Will like to see how the characters develop.Comedy: Comedy was great. I laughed out loud quite a bit during this episode.Overall: 9/10 for the first episode. I'll try to take some screenshots and edit them into this post.That was a hard punchOh no he didn'tSuzuka being amazingly cuteK-k-k-k-kissu?!permalinksavecontextfull comments[Discussion] Shinsekai yori Episode 1  by  DeathorGlory9in  anime[+]monsterinmate 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]monsterinmate 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoReally enjoyed this episode. It is a bit confusing putting the names to faces, and we still need background information like how people got these powers, when the boundary rope was put up, what kind of different monsters there are. The music was fantastic, especially the ending music. spoilerpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat seemingly happy movie or game has a dark secret?  by  Mr_Industrialin  AskReddit[+]monsterinmate 72 points73 points74 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]monsterinmate 72 points73 points74 points 2 months agoEven Miyazaki's happy movies are sad.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWant to get into anime, but finding it hard  by  KeyboardChemistryin  anime[+]monsterinmate 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]monsterinmate 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoNetflix, Hulu, Funimation's youtube channel are all good choices.
