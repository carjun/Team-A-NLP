When he didn't know the answer we would fill the gaps with blatantly incorrect information.Example: to masturbate you get a piping hot pizza, put it between your man boobs and and slap your boobs together. It's a hot mess.To eat a girl out you spread open her butt and lick the cherry inside until it pops.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey Sexxit!
