(reddit.com)submitted 5 days ago by sonicblue to cringe2 commentssharecancelloading...Most cringeworthy classmate you've had?  by  panda_poacher69in  AskReddit[+]sonicblue 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]sonicblue 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoThere was a 30 or 40 year old woman I had two semesters of college biology with. The class was held in a huge auditorium for around 200 students and every dogdamn day she was at least 5 minutes late. She sat at the front-ish so about 50 stairs down from the entrance and every step she took this bracelet of bells around her ankle would ring. Even in a huge room, the sound traveled, distracting everyone.  She would then procede to sit down and spent the entire class with eyes glued to her laptop, reading forums for people who think they are vampires and discuss how to become more vampiresque. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the best Free Music/media player in the Play store?  by  panky117in  Android[+]sonicblue 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]sonicblue 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoOh I see, thanks for updating me.
