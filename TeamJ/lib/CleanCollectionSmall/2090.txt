The letter also addresses safety protocols within the school district here. With the districts permission, Oakland North is reprinting it, with links at the end to resources geared for parents, students, teachers and other community members available on the school districts website.December 14, 2012Dear Oakland Unified School District Parents and Staff,We know that most of you heard about the tragic events which took place at a Connecticut school on Friday, December 14. Like you, we are devastated to learn of the many lives lost in this horrific shooting. We send our thoughts and condolences to the victims and their families and are sobered by the thought that so many children have been torn from their parents and this world in such a violent manner.Our thoughts also turn inward as we reflect on the safety of our children here in Oakland and the violence that pervades many parts of this community. The massacre in Connecticut has aroused fears and questions about our readiness for such an event and our ability to counsel children as they cope with senseless death. Some parents have also requested advice on how to speak with children about this frightening development.Please click through to Oakland North to read the rest of the letter.Posted By: Oakland North(Email,Facebook) |Dec 15 at 9:08 amListed Under: Crime, Schools | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentFriday, December 14, 2012Childrens Fairyland to turn into Fairy Winterland to celebrate the holiday seasonComments|    E-mail|     PrintThe Nutcracker Prince, the Grinch, Snowflake the Elf, Santa Claus and even a tap dancing Christmas tree will be joining the whimsical cast of characters at Childrens Fairyland this holiday season.

On the reporting team for this series, one of us is from Brazil and one is from Southern California. We decided it would be great to learn more about some of the structures that represent Oaklands beautiful landscape.With a great deal of assistance from the representatives at the Oakland Library History Room, Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey and Oakland Heritage Alliance, we were able look at a wide array of old city maps, photographs and drawings to learn more about how Oaklands most notable buildings once appeared. You can scroll the photo at the top of the screen from left to right to toggle between the older photo of the building and the one from today.For the next six weeks we will showcase some of the buildings we liked the mostboth as they used to look, and what each is like today. Some are more familiar to Oakland residents than others. Each has helped enhance the citys reputation and some are considered the crown jewels of Oakland.This week there is blue everywhere, in the sky and blue on the walls, specifically on exterior tiles of the Floral Depot building on 18th Street and Telegraph Avenue.Click through see past and present photos, plus read the story and hear an audio history by Debora Silva and Theresa Adams at Oakland North.Connect with Oakland North on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.Posted By: Oakland North(Email,Facebook) |Dec 14 at 11:08 amListed Under: Community, Culture, News | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentThis weekend in OaklandComments|    E-mail|     PrintCommunity events and activities for the weekend of December 14-16 2012.

OPD's actions during this and other Occupy-related protests have been criticized by the independent monitor. Photo by Brittany Schell.Nine years after the Oakland Police Department was ordered to comply with a series of court orders or be put into receivership, a federal judge approved a settlement agreement Wednesday between city officials and civil rights attorneys that avoids a takeover of the department by a federal monitor. Instead, the agreement will establish a court-appointed compliance director who will have the power to enforce remaining reforms and the authority to remove the police chief.Wednesdays decision supplants a hearing scheduled to take place Thursday, which would have allowed U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson to hear arguments for and against receivership.The idea of a compliance director came from a settlement agreement released last week, which was discussed and agreed upon by city officials, OPD brass, the Oakland Police Officers Association (OPOA) and civil rights attorneys John Burris and Jim Chanin. It includes the city and departments consent that the compliance director has the authority to remove the police chief or demote deputy and assistant chiefs.Its an agreement that we, of course, were in favor of because the former agreement had proved so spectacularly unsuccessful and the OPD would not listen to us or the monitor, Chanin said in a phone interview Wednesday afternoon. It became clear after so many years that they were not going to listen  and that they needed to be ordered to comply rather than asked to comply.Read the rest of the story by Samantha Masunaga at Oakland North.Connect with Oakland North on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.Posted By: Oakland North(Email,Facebook) |Dec 13 at 8:09 amListed Under: Crime, News, Politics | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentWednesday, December 12, 2012Bay Area same-sex marriage advocates react as Supreme Court takes on Proposition 8Comments|    E-mail|     PrintSonja Tottenh and Joseph Sheppers campaign against Proposition 8 at 51st and Telegraph in 2008. Photo by Anna Bloom.The four-year legal clash over Californias Proposition 8 may be coming to an endthe US Supreme Court announced last week that it will hear the case on the states same-sex marriage ban, and make its first-ever ruling on the issue. To gay and lesbian rights advocates around the Bay Area, this will be a momentous decision.Were in a pivotal time right now, said Amber Todd, chair of the annual Pride festival in Oakland and executive assistant to the city administrator. It is amazing to be heard at this level. I am confident that the defenders of our constitution will uphold equality and rights for all.Proposition 8 was passed in 2008 with 52 percent of the vote. The controversial ballot measure amended the California constitution to ban same-sex marriage, adding a section defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Its passage set off a lengthy legal battle that made history on December 7, 2012, when the US Supreme Court announced it would hear challenges to Proposition 8 and rule on the constitutionality of the same-sex marriage ban.The day is now clearly in sight when the federal government, the state of California, and every state will recognize that same-sex couples and their children are entitled to the same respect and recognition as every other family, said Kate Kendell, head of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. The NCLR, along with the American Civil Liberties Union and other legal advocates, is supporting the legal team arguing against Proposition 8 in the case.Read the rest of the story and see an interactive timeline of the history of same-sex marriage in California by Brittany Schell at Oakland North.Connect with Oakland North on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.Posted By: Oakland North(Email,Facebook) |Dec 12 at 11:17 amListed Under: News, Politics | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentTuesday, December 11, 2012Despite failure of Measure A1, Oakland Zoo to go ahead with California Trails projectComments|    E-mail|     PrintThe Oakland Zoo's expansion plans will go ahead despite community opposition to planned construction on 56 acres of Knowland Park.This November, voters in Alameda County rejected a proposed parcel tax aimed at creating a stable source of income for the Oakland Zoo. Many of the measures opponents objected to the zoos multi-million dollar expansion plans, even though zoo officials said funding from the measure would be used for animal care, repairs of existing facilities, and the zoos veterinary hospital, not the expansion. Despite the failure of Measure A1, the zoo will go ahead with planned construction of the California Trails project, which officials say has been in the cards for more than a decade.The Oakland Zoos ZooCamp director, Sarah Cramer, said Measure A1 had nothing to do with the planned construction of an exhibition and buffer zone that will sit on 56 acres of Knowland Park. The exhibition itself will occupy 18 acres, but we need a buffer zone so that should an animal escape, we are able to capture it and bring it back, Cramer said.Preservationists have objected to the expansion because of concerns that it will encroach on native plant species as well as the habitat of the threatened Alameda whipsnake.Laura Baker of the California Native Plant and Animal Society said the California Trails project would take up the best part of Knowland Park. It would take what we call the heart of the park, Baker said. There is a cruel irony in building something to honor the species we have lost by wiping out endangered species.Read the rest of the story and see the video by Tawanda Kanhema at Oakland North.Connect with Oakland North on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.Posted By: Oakland North(Email,Facebook) |Dec 11 at 3:40 pmListed Under: Business, Community, News | Permalink | Comments & Replies (0) : Post CommentPage 1 of 39712345102030...Last HomeLocal HeadlinesArrest RecordsSeeClickFixEventsIn OaklandContact | AboutThe latest information on schools, restaurants, real estate, events and sports from Oakland's finest local bloggers.By Oakland Local, Oakland North, V.
