A dispatcher at the Newtown Volunteer Ambulance Corps said a teacher had been shot in the foot and taken to Danbury Hospital," Huff Post reports.Many believe the school shooting only involved one lone gunman. It is unknown how many shots he fired before police were able to catch up to him. Again, it is unclear whether or not the gunman was taken down by police or whether he turned one of his guns on himself. Investigators are now working to piece together the day and to try and figure out a motive.Pictures of children leaving the school have been released.
