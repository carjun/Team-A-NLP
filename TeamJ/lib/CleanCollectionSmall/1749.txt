It didn't help that my ex was a really good cook. I feel like my first hurdle is to accept the fact that I won't be better than her  at cooking and try my best to get my kids to accept that as well. Thankfully I have really good kids.Thanks for taking the time to write the reply.permalinksavecontextfull comments25246247248As a recently divorced single dad that never did any of the cooking I need some help...
