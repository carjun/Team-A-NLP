He needs to make some of his newer comments public so everyone can get off his ass already.permalinksaveparent[+]desertjedi85 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours ago (5 children)[]desertjedi85 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours agoFacebook took down his profile.permalinksaveparent[+]the_anj 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours ago (3 children)[]the_anj 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours agoHas that been confirmed?  Because the response you get now is the same response you get for any profile that is completely private.permalinksaveparent[+]desertjedi85 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (2 children)[]desertjedi85 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoI loaded his profile a few times and then after that it said it wasn't available.  So it is confirmed as "unseeable".permalinksaveparent[+]the_anj 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]the_anj 3 points4 points5 points 21 hours agoYea, I didn't mean to be a dick about it.  But yea, who knows but it's definitely unseeable lolpermalinksaveparent[+]desertjedi85 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]desertjedi85 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoI know, that's why I amended my words.permalinksaveparent[+]lilbigd1ck 1 point2 points3 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]lilbigd1ck 1 point2 points3 points 9 hours agoHe probably deleted his own account. It would also delete all the shares that have been plastered on thousands of peoples wall with the caption "THIS MONSTER IS BURNING IN HELL!"If i were him i would of deleted the photos that are being shared, made my comments public, and replaced my cover photo with an image stating "I AM NOT THE SHOOTER. PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE"permalinksaveparent[+]deceax 97 points98 points99 points 23 hours ago (14 children)[]deceax 97 points98 points99 points 23 hours agoYea. Good luck in a job interview. "Ryan Lanza?? Why does that name sound so familiar??"permalinksaveparent[+]Bramsey89 36 points37 points38 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Bramsey89 36 points37 points38 points 21 hours agoYou must be that guy that killed those kids and yourself! There's no way I'm going to hire you!permalinksaveparent[+]s0beit 36 points37 points38 points 21 hours ago (2 children)[]s0beit 36 points37 points38 points 21 hours agoWell, that's probably why he's going to have such a good case in court. Seriously, I understand the desire to obtain news on a subject like this immediately... but that's no reason to publish completely baseless unconfirmed reports. It's crazy irresponsible to report the wrong person as being the perpetrator of a crime for hours.permalinksaveparent[+]triplea20x 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]triplea20x 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoWas it the wrong person? Or was it just that there are two people named Ryan Lanzapermalinksaveparent[+]s0beit 7 points8 points9 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit 7 points8 points9 points 21 hours agoIt was the wrong person, gawker is reporting that "Ryan Lanza" (the guy in the pictures) was the brother of the deceased perpetrator but I have no idea if that's actually true right now.I sincerely hope it's a major mistake and he isn't... if it is actually the brother, his parents and brother are now dead, and he's been plastered all over the news as a criminal. Horrible.permalinksaveparent[+]Frankeh 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours ago (2 children)[]Frankeh 5 points6 points7 points 20 hours ago'I was the guy that went on a killing spree and then shot myself dead.'permalinksaveparent[+]deceax 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]deceax 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoWell it was more of the fact that the name now has a pretty negative connotation. It's like the episode of Seinfeld where Elaine is dating Joel Rifkin.permalinksaveparent[+]GiantWhaleCannon 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]GiantWhaleCannon 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago"Shot yourself--AAAA!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE??"permalinksaveparent[+]WhyAmINotStudying 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]WhyAmINotStudying 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoOh, I'm related to the famous tenor Mario Lanza. I get that a lot from people who are cultured.It's a great response, because it throws off the interviewer, while complimenting them. It lets you get off of the subject without having to expose your relationship to this event.permalinksaveparent[+]dogs_are_best 18 points19 points20 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]dogs_are_best 18 points19 points20 points 22 hours agoThis is one of the reasons why the media needs to stop giving out names of shooters.permalinksaveparent[+]babywhiz 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]babywhiz 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoStupid Fox News now trying to flip it around again? Can't they just hush? permalinksaveparent[+]FlimtotheFlam 11 points12 points13 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]FlimtotheFlam 11 points12 points13 points 23 hours agovery much. That dude is 24 when they say the shooter was 20permalinksaveparent[+]ninjames 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (1 child)[]ninjames 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoYes because he IS related to the shooter and the family victims. It was his younger brother (Adam) who was the shooter. The shooter was autistic at least one point in his life (I don't know how autism works so I assumed it's "curable"). permalinksaveparent[+]spoonfedsam 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]spoonfedsam 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agowhy the fuck did people downvote you for this comment?permalinksaveparent[+]HeroicGomez -1 points0 points1 point 19 hours ago (2 children)[]HeroicGomez -1 points0 points1 point 19 hours agoSeriously. How many death threats has this guy probably received today? He probably didn't do anything wrong.permalinksaveparent[+]ButteredNoodles 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]ButteredNoodles 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoI know he wasn't the shooter, but even if he was why would people send him death threats? If he was the shooter he would already be dead.permalinksaveparent[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoPeople do foolish things without thinking, and some of them have internet access.Fortunately, it appears he disabled PM access to non-friends on FB so turns out it's not an issue.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
