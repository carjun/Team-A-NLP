Do the two relate at all?  by  yvvain  SkincareAddiction[+]PecanSoup 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]PecanSoup 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoFor multi purpose, a good jean jacket that bottoms all the way up to the neck and at the wrists. Tough material, will burn away rather than melt to your skin (any kind of synthetic fiber or mix fiber will melt to your skin!)As for welding, BSX makes a great all cotton jacket. permalinksavecontextfull commentsStory-time! What's your day job and how did you get into being interested in skin care? Do the two relate at all?  by  yvvain  SkincareAddiction[+]PecanSoup 0 points1 point2 points 47 minutes ago (0 children)[]PecanSoup 0 points1 point2 points 47 minutes agoOther than the sunscreen in my moisturizer, no. No offense, but your boyfriend wasn't observing proper safety procedures for welding. Welding creates an extremely bright UV light, and any skin that isn't covered up or shielded in some way will get damaged and burned.There are specialized welding jackets that provide ample protection from light UV exposure, and can prevent nasty burns from sparks, molten metal, and hot slag. Won't save you, but it's better than bare skin. I'm really surprised the local didn't provide a basic jacket for their guys to wear. Christmas is just around the corner ...maybe a little jacket to keep in his toolbox will make a nice gift, and keep him safe! Doesn't have to be fancy, since it sounds like he doesn't weld all day. :) You should try welding sometime. It's really fun and cool, and as a bonus all of the guys will be instantly impressed that you're welding, simple because you posses a pair of tits and a hole between your legs ;)permalinksavecontextfull commentsStory-time!

Do the two relate at all?  by  yvvain  SkincareAddiction[+]PecanSoup 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]PecanSoup 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI'm training to be a welder. It's really dirty work, even in a clean shop environment. By the end of the day, my face is covered in metal dust, dirt, sweat, and black "smog" from all of the gases, fumes, and flames I am exposed to. I have been religiously washing my face, and figured the stronger, the better. Nay nay, says my skin! My face has been breaking out like mad. Add to my poor eating and exercising habits, and my skin is just a mess: oily, dry (after using harsh cleaners), covered in blackheads, and no stranger to pimples. So, I'm educating myself. This is a fantastic sub and I've already learned a thing or two. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm from Newtown and I have something to say to the world.  by  Notmyrealredditsn1in  politics[+]PecanSoup 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]PecanSoup 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoIf not now, then when?

I really have nothing to argue. I do still believe that we need better access to affordable care, mental and physical. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy does USA's lack of functioning mental health care take a back seat to gun regulation whenever there's a public shooting?  by  stickykeysmcgeein  AskReddit[+]PecanSoup -1 points0 points1 point 4 hours ago (0 children)[]PecanSoup -1 points0 points1 point 4 hours agoMaybe we shouldn't help those people in car accidents. Maybe they don't want treatment. After all, we should definitely err on the side of respecting people's autonomy. Something needs to be done. Events like yesterday's shooting can bring to light to real problems that we have in caring for those who are mentally ill. We can push for more assistance, better care, an more transparency in our (non existent) mental health facilities. , permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny suggestions for a middle aged sporadic working house wife with low funds as far as working and going back to school?  by  needhelpsterin  jobs[+]PecanSoup 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]PecanSoup 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoWhat is your living situation?

Boomer will be 80 and 90. Barring medical advances which will drastically extend our lifetime and ability to function, most of your boomers will be too old to politic.

I do think there is some sort of income cap, but it must be pretty high for our area. Wonderful program. Now, if we could get maternity leave guaranteed for both parents, and some better post pregnancy care (TN only covers one doctor visit after birth for mom), then things could be a lot easier for some folks. permalinksavecontextfull commentsKrugman: This is worth repeating: Were not having a debt crisis.
