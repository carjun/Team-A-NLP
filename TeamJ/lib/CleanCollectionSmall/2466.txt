But a ban on guns (Assault rifles in the US are semi-automatic, by the way) will drive crimes like this towards easier targets and not necessarily stop the crimes. There's a reason that the stabbings in China take place in elementary schools. The casualty counts are still high.permalinksaveparent[+]Sieziggy 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes ago (2 children)[]Sieziggy 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes agoAn isolated stabbing is still far less damaging than a mass shooting. A mentally unstable individual who is intent on hurting someone for whatever reason will find the best suited tool.

However, blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd. I am glad to talk about how it was allowed to happen, and what steps can be taken to prevent it. First off, we MUST recognize that "gun free zones" are simply the target of choice for these people. What can be done about this?Either we do away with gun free zones, or we start stationing police at every soft target such as elementary schools, movie theaters, and any where people can congregate. Next is the WHY are they doing this? Gun laws haven't changed dramatically in the past 10 years, but these shootings are on the rise? There are a myriad of reasons, and it always revolve around mental illness. I am glad to discuss means of deterrence and prevention, but gun control will be as effective as the drug war. So please, let us have a discussion.permalinksaveparent[+]its_your_their 2 points3 points4 points 15 minutes ago (2 children)[]its_your_their 2 points3 points4 points 15 minutes agoI'm all for a debate about safety. However, blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd.That's interesting because nuclear bombs, chemical weapons, and mines are all inanimate objects which 1. we are all glad are not things you can purchase at Walmart and 2. we work hard to stop the use and proliferation of.So, just saying that a thing is an inanimate object and thus shouldn't be regulated, is itself absurd.permalinksaveparent[+]treedick2011 1 point2 points3 points 6 minutes ago (1 child)[]treedick2011 1 point2 points3 points 6 minutes agoThis is false equivalency. These items would cost (for nuclear bombs) Billions of dollars. Chemical weapons would be absurdly expensive as well. They simply wouldn't be available to the general public.permalinksaveparent[+]its_your_their 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]its_your_their 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agoTheir cost is completely irrelevant. Are they inanimate objects? Yes. Are they highly regulated? Yes. If those two things are true, then "blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd." is false. Unless you believe that those things shouldn't be regulated at all, in which case you are actually clinically insane. That's as simple as I can get.Also, chemical weapons aren't prohibitively expensive. You can make mustard gas in your garage. And landmines? Developing nations use landmines, so those aren't cost-prohibitive either. But, like I said, cost is irrelevant to the idea that inanimate objects shouldn't be regulated.permalinksaveparent[+]ForRealsies 2 points3 points4 points 29 minutes ago (1 child)[]ForRealsies 2 points3 points4 points 29 minutes agoNext is the WHY are they doing this?There is no why or reason for acts like this.

I think a society that is nurturing and understanding of those with mental illnesses would more often than not avoid mass murders like this. Do you think these men felt understood by society? Or do you think they were lashing out at a system that has no place for them? permalinksaveparent[+]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoAre these shootings really on the rise?

I will put at least some of the blame of this at the feet of the media though. The sensationalizing of the mall shooting in Oregon. The plastering of the shooters face all over the news only incites more people who have serious mental issues to go out and do the same. Im against outright banning, the fact that police weren't around to stop this tells you everything you need to know about relying on their protection.

I knew the ethics surrounding the use of my firearm. I knew how to shoot it, I knew how to inspect it. I knew how to handle it in public.This shooter clearly did none of those things because his parents never exposed him to firearms and he never learned the ethics that go along them. He could also just be a severely sick individual who the system failed.

Violence with firearms that manifests itself in this form is a social medical problem, not a problem of property rights.   Gun crime where robbery and assault is involved, is also not a property rights issue, it is a socioeconomic one.Mental health is a serious problem, that often goes unchecked.  It is when it goes unchecked, combined with a unique circumstance, that tragedies like this occur.  While people are quick to blame guns, the same sort of thing happened in China quite recently with a young man armed with a knife was able to kill 9 people before he was stopped.99% of all firearms are never used to intimidate, hurt, or kill people.  For those reasons, and more, I think anyone who is staunchly anti-gun is barking up the wrong tree.permalinksaveparent[+]SicilianEggplant 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (1 child)[]SicilianEggplant 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoThe sad part is that it's easier and cheaper for someone to get a gun in this country than medical or psychiatric help.

You get people who don't always agree, groups are marginalized, anger seethes, and some are willing to resort to extremism for whatever purpose they rationalize. Right now, the most urgent conversation is the immediate either or demonization of us versus them, splitting sides. This happens no matter what and death, anger, destruction is used to push whoever's agenda best. My country is devolving into a state where there's no right or wrong anymore, just how many people you can get to agree.If anything I think these incidents are indicators of an overall trend of the general unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Happy people don't do these things. But you can't guarantee everyone's happiness forever at every moment, only try to provide for an environment for anyone to pursue happiness. We live in USA, an experiment from 200 years ago that through the generations have been built through trials and errors, blood and sweat. These are the costs and collateral damage of freedom. There are some that strive to keep the bar high but there are also people willing to kick the bar lower each day.If you are angered by any of this the very most important you can do now is do everything you can to keep raising the bar and help everyone else be there too. The rest is is just noise to scare you, to control you, to distract you.permalinksaveparent[+]brandonw00 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]brandonw00 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI don't see what having "freedom" has to do with a shooting. There are many countries that have the same freedoms that Americans have, yet they don't have this kind of violence in their country. I do agree with your statement about these incidents are indicators that people are not happy. It is too bad though, because life is a beautiful thing, and everyone alive has the opportunity to experience it! Every day is a new adventure, every day you get to see the sun rise, the world come alive, the wildlife move about, you get to interact with other individuals. It is too bad people don't value life more. It is the greatest thing ever, and we need to value every day we have on earth, because once it is gone, its gone. permalinksaveparent[+]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago*(0 children)[]alaskamiller 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago*Pro gun wants to elevate the conversation to be about freedom. Anti gun wants to elevate the conversation about public freedom. Either way it's an ongoing struggle for Americans of this current generation to define what freedom means, because quite frankly, after my service in the Marine Corps, after more than a decade of war, I don't believe anyone truly understand what freedom really means.As for the beauty of life, having socialized and hanging with the broken, misfits, the traumatized, and the suicidal the past few years... the one thing I learned is that just because you're not wrong doesn't necessarily make you right either. permalinksaveparentload more comments(1 reply)[+]snarketeer 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]snarketeer 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour agoIt's a little easier to get rid of guns, or at least do more to DRASTICALLY limit access, than change an entire society.permalinksaveparent[+]weric91 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes ago (1 child)[]weric91 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes agoYou obviously haven't been to a gun show in a rural area.

I think if we made stricter gun laws and enforced them more strictly, we would see a change.  But nobody knows for sure, since nobody has even tried.  So why not try?

It's one thing to shoot a deer, and quite another to shoot an invader in your home, while you're terrified.  And unless you drive with your hand on the trigger, I can't see how a gun would help you in a car-jacking.  The jacker usually gains control of the car incredibly quickly, and I don't see how you could grab your gun that fast.permalinksaveparent[+]justanotherreddituse 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]justanotherreddituse 0 points1 point2 points 12 minutes agoCanada's largest mass killing was done with gasoline.  37 people dead.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Bird_Caf%C3%A9_firepermalinksaveparentload more comments(4 replies)[+]PacoBedejo 0 points1 point2 points 54 minutes ago (0 children)[]PacoBedejo 0 points1 point2 points 54 minutes agoGuns don't kill people, people kill people......quite easily, with guns.Especially when you box up your most precious possessions in a building/campus that doesn't have anyone armed for protection.permalinksaveparent[+]Jakooboo 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]Jakooboo 1 point2 points3 points 50 minutes agoCome on now, this isn't the time for that argument.

If you restrict gun sales and purchases, people will always find a way. Only criminals will have guns. That's always been my stance.But then I read about this story and realized that if someone wants to commit an act of senseless sickening violence like this, they'll just go to a place where it's highly unlikely that they'll face any resistance until the cops show up. It's nice to think that the freedom to have guns on your person will help to prevent sprees like this...people always say "well if someone else was there who had a gun they could have just shot them!". But it's not like the maniacs who do this haven't thought of that. Usually, anyway...In short, you just can't stop people from killing each other, or going on shooting sprees. If they wanna kill a lot of people, it will happen.Depressing...permalinksaveparent[+]BarackisKing 0 points1 point2 points 31 minutes ago (0 children)[]BarackisKing 0 points1 point2 points 31 minutes agoDude schools are no gun zones... anyone who could have prevented this wouldn't have been allowed in the building :( Sad stuffpermalinksaveparent[+]MrTacoMan 1 point2 points3 points 31 minutes ago (0 children)[]MrTacoMan 1 point2 points3 points 31 minutes agoYea, the extremist second amendment folks don't have time to feel empathy says the guy that started talking about gun control as soon as this happened.

Switzerland requires citizens to own firearms. Obviously, gun violence is a symptom of education and economic stability, not restrictive legislation. If the presence of guns is indicative of violence, then everyone in America would have died of a fatal gunshot as a direct result of the over abundance of guns.
