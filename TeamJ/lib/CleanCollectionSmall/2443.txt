Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Allycia 2 points3 points4 points 39 minutes ago (0 children)[]Allycia 2 points3 points4 points 39 minutes agoI don't live in CT anymore, but my family does.  A few days ago my brother told me that someone in his high school (which may or may not have had some dirty cupcakes floating around a few weeks back) threatened to shoot up the school.  The facebook updates about "CT school shooting" temporarily stopped my heart.  This stems directly from when my stepdad flew out to Newark, NJ on 9/11/01 for a meeting and didn't have cell service so when my mom saw the news and couldn't get ahold of him she freeeeaked out.  Such a scary feeling..permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm dreaming of a wight Christmas  by  Allyciain  gameofthrones[+]Allycia[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Allycia[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoAs op, I completely agree.

It's okay because I think of myself as royalty. Not so much everyone else.Ha. I totally love the barn owl king collage. Two of my favorite things. I would need to hang this in my bathroom next to the cat painting I have that "B. Willis" painted (I really hope it was Bruce)permalinksavecontextfull comments"But I drove an hour to get here!" That's nice. We're still closed.  by  PrincessBubblegum-in  TalesFromRetail[+]Allycia 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]Allycia 1 point2 points3 points 17 days agoI worked at Lowe's and all of a sudden Corporate told us we weren't allowed to announce we were closing because that seemed very poor customer service. People didn't realize we were about to close (Nobody checks the hours sign. Ever.) even when some of the lights went out. We'd have to help them until they were done shopping, and then the registers were counted. Everyone closing left at the same time, so we'd all just be sitting around until the customers left. It was stupid. So. Very. Stupid. Why do people think they are so damn entitled?Edit. I forgot about the guy who would come in for wood and random stuff 10 minutes before closing. More often than not, he was drunk. He was very friendly, but didn't realize/care that we wanted to go home. He shouldn't have been driving, I don't know why the police were never notified. Sigh.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWalking through a graveyard yesterday, I stepped on a broken piece of a headstone with just my birthday inscribed on it (Pic included).
