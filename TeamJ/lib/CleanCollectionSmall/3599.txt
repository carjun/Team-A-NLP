About Google NewsGoogle NewsAbout Google NewsHelp Center Help for PublishersGoogle News:About Google NewsGoogle News is a computer-generated news site that aggregates headlines from news sources worldwide, groups similar stories together and displays them according to each reader's personalizedinterests.Traditionally, news readers first pick a publication and then look for headlines            that interest them. We do things a little differently, with the goal of offering our readers            more personalized options and a wider variety of perspectives from which to choose. On Google News we offer links to several articles on every story, so you can first decide what subject interests            you and then select which publishers accounts of each story youd like to read. Click on            the headline that interests you and you'll go directly to the site which published that story.Our articles are selected and ranked by computers that evaluate,among other things, how often and on what sites a story appearsonline. We also rank based on certain characteristics of news content such as freshness, location, relevance and diversity. As a result, stories are sorted without regard to politicalviewpoint or ideology and you can choose from a wide variety ofperspectives on any given story. We'll continue to improve Google Newsby adding sources, fine-tuning our technology and providing Google News to readers in even moreregions.FeaturesPersonalized news: No one can read all the news thats publishedevery day, so why not set up your page to show you the stories that best represent your interests?
