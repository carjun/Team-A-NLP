The families of the children, and all of the others will remember this every holiday season and it will always haunt them. Unimaginable.As a father with a daughter who is getting ready to start school in 2013, this hits hard. The real WTF here is that there are two shooters. It's hard enough trying to understand why one person would do such a thing, but to think that two people were able to carry this out really gets to me.permalinksave[+]I_PISS_HAIR 2 points3 points4 points 28 minutes ago (4 children)[]I_PISS_HAIR 2 points3 points4 points 28 minutes ago36 parents will be getting that heartbreaking call today36?

We here in Aurora just started to get over the Theater shooting and then this happens. permalinksaveparent[+]nvanprooyen 3 points4 points5 points 38 minutes ago (0 children)[]nvanprooyen 3 points4 points5 points 38 minutes agoI know what you mean man.

It's getting to be like a gamble now, trusting other people around your kids when you're not there to protect them.  It's a shame we have to feel this way and that we can't just trust that others will cherish life as much as us.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
