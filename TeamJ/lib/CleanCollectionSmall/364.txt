The Newtown police officer is requesting assistance, putting out a distress call for all police units to respond to the site of the shooting.Adam Newton shot his mother Nancy Lanza, drove her car to Sandy Hook Elementary school, forced his way into the building, possibly shooting his way in, then killed 26 innocent victims before turning the gun on himself.Ryan Lanza, 24, was questioned by police and revealed that his brother had a personality disorder and is autistic. Experts speculate that Adam may have been a paranoid-schizophrenic, and question whether alcohol may have played a role in the tragedy.The conversation between the Newton emergency services officer to the Conn. State police:"The front glass has been broken. We are unsure why"Attention all units. The individual I have on the phone is continuing to hear what she believes to be gunfire.Reports that teachers saw two shadows running, past the building, past the gym.In the edited footage, another voice reports: "The shooting appears to have stopped. The school is in lock down."Then comes a chilling response from armed police on the scene."I've got bodies here.  We have multiple weapons, including one rifle and a shotgun. We need doctors here ASAP."In a longer transcript of the radio call, one officer is reported to have said: We have one female in room one who has gunshot wound to the foot.Weve got an injured person in room nine with numerous gunshot wounds.A call handler then responds: "What is the number of ambulances you will require?"The reply comes: "They dont know, theyre not giving us a number."Tweet0EmailPrintReport Rachael Monaco,      Buffalo Top News ExaminerRachael Monaco is a freelance writer, blogger, wife, mother, political activist.
