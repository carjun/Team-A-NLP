But although it was mentioned it was just a lead in to his breaking bats over his knee and head.

I have about 20 games in a box with it. Unfortunately I don't have any of the game boxes anymore. I do still have the consoles box as well as the steering wheel, centipede ball controller and I think the Atari adapter. I'm not sure if I still have that sweet ass leather cover anymore... I completely forgot about that thing. I still have my Rocky controllers too. I hated that game. The game that probably got the most play at our house was Miner 2049er...Or as we would say, Death to Bounty Bob. Two games we used to have high score runs on were Frenzy and Ladybug. We used to have these sticker labels we would write our score on and stick on the cartridge. If your score got beat it was covered up with another. We never realized how lucky we were back then. We had the 2600, 5200, Coleco, Intellivision, and a few Adam computers. Nothing compared to the Coleco in terms of usage. Not until our Commodore 64 and eventually the NES came along to dethrone it. Great fucking system! permalinksavecontextfull commentsOne of my ColecoVisions.  by  krakissiin  gaming[+]iix 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago (0 children)[]iix 0 points1 point2 points 19 days agoIt's an Adam...

I was in need of a WR3, I've been bouncing back between S. Rice, Hartline, Britt and now T. Young.  I've been reluctantly starting Britt with a mix of Hartline for bye week issues or favorable matchups.  I had to start Hartline last night because of byes.  But I was able to deal Bush for Fitzgerald... it might be a wash in the end but fuck whatever, I'm feeling happy about it for now.  Not only did I get rid of that bum Bush... I picked up a nice WR3 so Hartline should not find his way back in my lineup.  My weakest position, beside TE, was WR (Harvin, J. Jones and now Fitz)... is looking much better.  Bush was just going to my bench now that byes were done for my RBs.  So happy I won't have to mess with any Dolphins in my lineup for the rest of the year.  I'm a Dolphins fan who hates the fucking Dolphins.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Tom Matte, Baltimore Colts RB -- AMA  by  TomMatte41in  IAmA[+]iix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]iix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoIs Emerson Boozer a booser?permalinksavecontextfull commentsPapa John's CEO John Schnatter Says Company Will Reduce Workers' Hours In Response To Obamacare  by  EatalltheBaconin  politics[+]iix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]iix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoMy local Dairy Queen's franchisee had up a Obamacare message on his big sign board last year. He closes for a couple of months each winter and goes to Florida. His sign said, right before they closed for the winter, "If Obamacare passes we will not reopen". I called Dairy Queen corporate and complained. They apologized and stated it was against their policy to put up a sign like that or something. The next time I went by it was gone. I wish I had taken a picture of it. The funny thing is, franchise owner Dave with the help of some insurance money from an accident that damaged the drive thru roof and siding, renovated the building last winter. He's also just opened up his own BBQ joint up across the road from his DQ. He's a major league asshole. Thankfully a small little ice cream and yogurt shop opened up in town this summer. We take our business there now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMitt Romney speaking very clearly about his views on the Mormon church and abortion while he thinks he isn't being recorded.  by  swaggamemnonin  politics[+]iix 8 points9 points10 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]iix 8 points9 points10 points 1 month agoI don't mean to sound crass... but if Jesus didn't show up for the Holocaust I don't think he's coming.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow not to snap the ball.  by  Disco_Drewin  sports[+]iix 7 points8 points9 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]iix 7 points8 points9 points 1 month agoIt looks like the whole line was run blocking.  It's hard to tell what the running back is doing.  I assume the running back is picking up the blitz or running a little dump off route maybe... he looks thoroughly confused.  The QB was going to get blasted from his blind side by 27 had it been a good snap.  It's safe to say the entire line and the backfield were not on the same page here...permalinksavecontextfull commentsFormer WWE diva Amy Weber releases nude photos to stop thieves from "leaking them"  by  IntelligentYinzerin  SquaredCircle[+]iix 4 points5 points6 points 1 month ago*(0 children)[]iix 4 points5 points6 points 1 month ago*I used to be a huge fan of Amy's back in the mid 90's.  In fact, I used to run a fan website about her called "The Great Amy Weber", ya... creative name huh?!?I remember the first picture I spotted of her.  Caution... NSFW (http://sites.inka.de/madmage/beauties/beau010.jpg)I still love that shot.  Anyway, I became a big fan, started collecting pictures (it became an obsession) and started the site.  Another fan that was a site visitor, he was from Canada, started sending everything he could find.  We'd buy hot rod magazine and scan them and take screen grabs from VHS b-movies she was in.I had read about a movie she had done called "Forbidden Games" where she appeared topless.  I couldn't believe it, because up until that point the most revealing she got was the picture I posted above.  Most everything else was bra/panties, bikini or hands covering the fun bits.  I made it a mission to find that movie.  I ended up getting my aunt, who was the manager of a local video rental store, to order it for the business.  The damn thing was a couple of hundred dollars (rental store prices were nuts back then and you couldn't find it in stores or online to buy).  She basically bought it for me but knew it would rent well based on the cover.  I remember picking it up the day it came in and breaking the plastic shrink wrap.  We took numerous screen grabs and posted them to the site as quickly as we could.  It was a big score for the site... we were proud.  My aunt was right too... that VHS was rented out ALL the time!The newly acquired images were out there for a few weeks when I received an email from Amy herself.  She was very nice, complemented the fan site, but asked if we could please take down the topless screen grabs we had posted.  I was so excited to hear from her but was really bummed the way it happened.  At first I didn't want to take them down but I wasn't pushy about it.  I asked her why and she replied back something to the effect that she didn't do topless or nude shoots and these were the result of the director rewriting the script and making changes on the fly during shooting.  She felt betrayed by the director and didn't want to be associated with the movie let alone appearing topless in it.  I felt really bad for her after reading those emails.  I ended up taking them down and apologized for posting them.She was really nice and cool about the whole thing.  She wasn't demanding and seemed truly embarrassed or ashamed that these images of her were available.  This was really early in her career and I'm sure something like this would have a negative impact.  I didn't want to be a part of that.I held on to those emails for years and years.  I probably have left that email account abandoned too long and they're probably history now.  A few years later, before her WWE career, she debuted her own membership based website.    Being a young broke teenager I wasn't able to afford to joing.  However, no matter, I actually guessed her username and password one night to get in to the pay area.  Her username was "amyweber" (which you know is her name) and her password was "garydubie" (which was the name of her photographer).  That was awesome figuring that out.  I had a few friends over that night (I think were were playing Riven on the PSone)... they thought I was some hacker mastermind.  Ha.I got out of the WWE/F before she signed with the company.  I've actually never seen her in any wrestling segments ever.  I have spotted her on TV a few times doing hosting gigs usually.  She never became the superstar that she was in my mind but I'm proud of where she's gotten so far.Reading this story made me sad for her.  I know how upset she was about the "Forbidden Games" stuff we posted.  Maybe now it's not such a big deal.  I hope so.I've always wanted to do a TLDR but never typed anything long enough... now I can!TLDR: I posted topless pics of Amy on the internet in the 90's.  She contacted me to remove them.  I did.PS: I fucking love that "widows peak".  Damn she's beautiful!EDIT: Change "late 90's" to "mid 90's" as "Forbidden Games" was released in '95.  Time flies!permalinksavecontextfull commentsBenching Julio at home this week?  by  eaglessoarin  fantasyfootball[+]iix -1 points0 points1 point 1 month ago (0 children)[]iix -1 points0 points1 point 1 month agoNo.permalinksavecontextfull commentsZuerlein/Akers Owners -- Which K are you taking this week and why?  by  suburban_robotin  fantasyfootball[+]iix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]iix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoHe missed a 52 yard kick against the Dolphins in week 1.

I've had my box offline for more than a year.  I don't really play it that much and it's modded so I pulled it offline awhile ago.  I've played downloaded games on it while it was offline and got dashboard updates on a few occasions.  There is no way a normal 360 would have the blades dash in 2012 unless they were playing only games published from 2006-2008 or something.Buuuut... when your Xbox is never connected, you'll still have a more recent dash with NO ADS!  So OP is somewhat correct on this.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDustin Keller  by  ContraPositivein  fantasyfootball[+]iix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]iix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoWell, at least I didn't drop him.
