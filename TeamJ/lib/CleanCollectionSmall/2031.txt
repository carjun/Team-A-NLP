I went to the doctor and they put what looked like a giant red pill, a little bigger than a half dollar over the bump and bandaged it with a similar kind of "bandaid" OP described.I took it off 2 days later as directed and the bottom of my foot was covered in slime.  As I started to rinse it, skin and chunks of meat from my foot just fell off and slid down the drain.  I had a huge hole in my foot, covered in pus and goopy shit all over.  Took weeks to heal.  Fuck. Chinese.

And second, To cover all of the other comments in this post:1) She's a girl.2) Her name is "Tard", short for "Tardar" Sauce. Yes, there is speculation that the owners just came up with that to save face when the pics started gaining popularity; however, that can't be proved, so chill out and remember the post you just laughed at and up voted five minutes ago that was way more offensive than naming a "special" cat Tard.3) She doesn't have "kitty down syndrome", nor is she probably excessively inbred.  She is healthy according to the vet (from the website), with her special features probably related to some genetic or neurological issue.   Having a neurological or genetic disorder does not mean you aren't healthy.4) Her mother is a domestic shorthair and her dad is probably (again from the website) a gray striped cat.  Her breed is unknown, but yes, she does look like a mix of Ragdoll or Snowshoe.5) Yes, there is a place you can get all TardCat all the time, she has a website, tumblr, etc6) Yes, she also has her own subAnd finally, for the party poopers who hate grumpy cat:7) Fuck you, if you don't like the grumpy cat pics, just don't click them.Edit:  I forgot the most important one.8). Squeeeeee that cat is so cute!!Thank you, BedHeadRedHeadpermalinksavecontextfull commentsThis wolf was trapped outside of Winnipeg.  by  nativebobin  WTF[+]BedHeadRedHead 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]BedHeadRedHead 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoI had the same internal conversation :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your sexual bucket list reddit?  by  RandomBananasin  AskReddit[+]BedHeadRedHead 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]BedHeadRedHead 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago:Dpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your sexual bucket list reddit?  by  RandomBananasin  AskReddit[+]BedHeadRedHead 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]BedHeadRedHead 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoWell, hello.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTwins.  by  TBBTin  pics[+]BedHeadRedHead 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]BedHeadRedHead 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoLook, it's Erzabet's ex.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfghan girl  by  PinkyLookingForBrainin  pics[+]BedHeadRedHead 59 points60 points61 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]BedHeadRedHead 59 points60 points61 points 6 days agoShe is stunningly pretty.
