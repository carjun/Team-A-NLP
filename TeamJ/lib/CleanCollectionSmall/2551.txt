How many of you identify as having social anxiety and also want to quit the fap?

Without a TO, it's not worth it for me to invest any time at .05 a piece. Personally, I have seen too many people get screwed over with mass rejections so please Turk at your own risk. I'm staying far away from this one.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOn break from School...Anyone know of a good way to make a couple hundred bucks quick?  by  ajpodin  beermoney[+]gobeavs1 -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (0 children)[]gobeavs1 -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoIf you're a college student on break, this site gives some really tips on a system to earn an extra $200 per month.

I've been using this for over 3 months now and it makes earning those $5 Amazon GCs another source of passive income.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat do you think of retirement funds? (for example the "Fidelity 2040 Retirement Funds" and the like)  by  watabitin  investing[+]gobeavs1 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago*(0 children)[]gobeavs1 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago*I am 26 and opened my Roth IRA during 2011. I just hit the max contribution for this year (added to last year's $5K max puts me at the $10K mark) on my Fidelity Roth IRA. Since I'm open to moderate risk, I decided to allocate 100% of my Roth IRA funds to a target date fund FDEEX which is the TDF for 2055. I plan on retiring around 2055. I work in the education field. The only reason I chose fidelity is because a good mentor of mine suggested it but if I could do it all over again I would have gone with Vanguard solely based on the lower expense ratios. FDEEX has a ratio of .78 but a few different vanguard equivalent funds have lower expense ratios. Edit: I'm up 7.8% so far because I timed my fund purchases based on dips in the market this year. My strategy has been to buy in $2000-$2500 chunks based on downward swings in the DOW and S&P. permalinksavecontextfull commentsCollege student extra income?  by  im_intjin  beermoney[+]gobeavs1 -3 points-2 points-1 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]gobeavs1 -3 points-2 points-1 points 5 days agoHere is a relevent site that you should check out that is specific to college students. permalinksavecontextfull commentsUS - Consumer Decisions - Music Study - UCLA Anderson Researcher - $0.25/~1 min - (>95%)  by  goangurlin  HITsWorthTurkingFor[+]gobeavs1 4 points5 points6 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]gobeavs1 4 points5 points6 points 7 days agoThe Airport Study is also just as good and just as fast.https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups&searchWords=ucla+study&minReward=0.00&x=0&y=0permalinksavecontextfull comments15171819Gift Hulk code for 5 Hulk Coins for up to 10,000 GH users!!!

I came across this awesome guide for those who are looking to sell their items on Ebay but aren't completely familiar with the process. By the way, the site itself also has some other ways you can earn extra money online to fund your game collecting and purchases! :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is an easy or semi-easy way of making a daily $6?  by  ihatehomein  beermoney[+]gobeavs1 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]gobeavs1 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoI completely agree.

They are losing ground. FAST.edit: Topline people, I know you read this subreddit. It's good practice for a newer company such as yourselves to put the consumer first because without us, you would not have a company. It literally takes 3 seconds to remove Topline from a browser and people can do that quicker than it takes crazy glue to dry. permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you could observe, but not influence, one event in history, what would it be?  by  Kevickin  AskReddit[+]gobeavs1 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]gobeavs1 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoYou do realize that this actually never happened, right?
