In 2009, he led the Saints to their first Super Bowl championship by defeating the Indianapolis Colts.  In 2010 Payton led the Saints to their second consecutive postseason appearance and third in five seasons with an 11-5 record, becoming the only the second coach in franchise history to post three double-digit win seasons. It was only the second time in club record books that the Saints had back-to-back 11-win campaigns. He followed that up with a 13-3 campaign in 2011.  Payton came to Dallas after four years with the New York Giants (1999-2002), the last three as offensive coordinator.  Payton wrapped two coaching stints at San Diego State University (1988-89 and 1992-93) around a stop at Indiana State (1990-91). During his second stretch with the Aztecs, Payton was running backs coach, working with Heisman Trophy runner-up Marshall Faulk before becoming quarterbacks coach.  Following the 1993 season, Payton moved to Miami of Ohio (1994-95) where he was quarterbacks coach and later co-offensive coordinator. He spent 1996 as quarterbacks coach at Illinois before entering the NFL with Philadelphia.  Payton earned a bachelor's degree in communications at Eastern Illinois, where as a quarterback he had 10,665 passing yards, then the third-highest total in NCAA Division I-AA history. He had professional stints with Chicago of the Arena Football League, Ottawa of the Canadian Football League and the Chicago Bears in 1987.  Payton was born Dec. 29, 1963 in San Mateo, Calif., and raised in Naperville, Ill.
