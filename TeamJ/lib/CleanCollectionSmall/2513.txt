But making guns perfectly legal doesn't seem to do any good.  Guns started being regulated for a reason.  If they weren't effective tools in the commission of crimes, they wouldn't have started being regulated in the first place.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

It's one thing to shoot a deer, and quite another to shoot an invader in your home, while you're terrified.  And unless you drive with your hand on the trigger, I can't see how a gun would help you in a car-jacking.  The jacker usually gains control of the car incredibly quickly, and I don't see how you could grab your gun that fast.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]KKN50 -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]KKN50 -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes agoObviously one can injure people with weapons other than guns.  But it's way easier to shoot a bunch of people than it is to stab them.  That's why the perpetrator is initially suspected to be someone close to the victim in stabbing cases.  You need to get close to them, and it's harder to stab people than to shoot them, so it requires a lot of anger, and you usually only get that angry at people you know.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Sure they're rare, but not as rare as they should be.  Not rare enough that we shouldn't be doing something about the problem instead of sitting on our asses and saying "oh but the 2nd amendment!"permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy do many partners of cheating people tend to blame the "other person" more than their own partners?  by  Bristenain  AskReddit[+]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 43 minutes ago (0 children)[]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 43 minutes agoIt's easier to believe that the person who ruined your relationship is a stranger than the person you loved.  You love the person, how could they have done this to you?  S/he is good, because you love him/her!  A stranger can be horrible though.  It's just easier to wrap your head around.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]KKN50 -8 points-7 points-6 points 46 minutes ago (0 children)[]KKN50 -8 points-7 points-6 points 46 minutes agoI think the second amendment has everything to do with our gun violence problem.  The right to own guns is what has allowed us to develop our ridiculous gun culture.  If we never had that right in the Constitution, we could have strict gun laws today.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I think if we made stricter gun laws and enforced them more strictly, we would see a change.  But nobody knows for sure, since nobody has even tried.  So why not try?

The teacher would have to have his/her wits to be able to shoot accurately, and that requires a lot of training.  Just having a gun doesn't mean you can take down a person while you're terrified.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

It's easy to shoot a bunch of people, but not as easy to stab that many people.  If we got serious about gun control, like Japan, we wouldn't have this problem, because not even the criminals would be able to get guns.  http://www.davekopel.com/2a/lawrev/japanese_gun_control.htmpermalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

If parents want their kids to be religious, they can indoctrinate the kids themselves.  Nobody is to blame for the supposed lack of religion but the parents.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, what are your pet peeves in a relationship?  by  radamazingin  AskReddit[+]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoMy dealbreaker is not standing up to your parents.  I dated a guy in high school who wouldn't stand up to his parents, and I knew we could never have a future together.  We dated until the end of our first semester of college.  He dumped me, but I had been thinking for a while that I might have to break up with him.  Examples of behavior he should have stood up to:he couldn't go to my 18th birthday party, because it was a sleepover on Cape Cod, and they thought he'd get me pregnant.  My parents even called them and told them we'd be sleeping with a bunch of people I had grown up with.  These people are like my siblings, and I'd never have sex in front of them.  They refused to believe it.He wasn't allowed to have friends over to his house when a parent wasn't home, because of me.  Before we got serious, he was allowed to.  All of his friends knew it was because of me, and they all thought his parents were batshit insane.  They didn't blame me.He wasn't allowed to drive after 10 PM, because of me.  He could before we started dating, but suddenly it was "too dangerous".permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf your SO/ex miscarried and you hadn't even known about the pregnancy would you want to know?  by  oatamin  AskReddit[+]KKN50 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]KKN50 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoIf it would make you feel better, you should tell him.  If you'd rather not tell him, you don't have to.  You wouldn't be doing anything wrong by not telling him.  Do what's best for you.And please tell a friend or a family member.  You need support right now.  Miscarriage, even if you didn't know you were pregnant, is a horrible thing to go through.  <hugs>permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you could have any pet, no matter how exotic / expensive / fictional it is, what would you choose?  by  CooterSquirrelin  AskReddit[+]KKN50 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]KKN50 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoA dragon, of the winged, fire-breathing variety.  I'd use him for transportation and protection.  I don't think my cat would like him much, but he could sleep outside.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsDo you find yourself losing your national identity and moving towards a global identity?  by  johnsurosin  AskReddit[+]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]KKN50 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoNope.  I don't think most people experience that feeling, unless they've traveled a lot and/or lived all over the world.permalinksavecontextfull commentsUPDATE: My GF (29F) was proposed to by her disabled friend (28M).  by  tmttin  relationships[+]KKN50 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours ago*(0 children)[]KKN50 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours ago*She is not a 9.5, she's a 0.  She doesn't respect you at all.  If she respected you and your relationship, she wouldn't have accepted this guy's proposal even as a joke.  She's horribly immature.  She will not be a good wife.  Even if she's really done with this guy, she will do this sort of thing again, because she doesn't respect your relationship.  She doesn't respect the boundaries.  She will break your heart.  You're an idiot for not breaking up with her.Also, getting married won't fix a relationship.  If the relationship has problems, which yours clearly does, they won't just go away when you get married.  Getting married in your case will only make things worse, because when you finally come to your senses and leave her, you'll have to go through legal channels instead of just dumping her sorry ass.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGetting married in less than two weeks.
