Good luck in a job interview. "Ryan Lanza??

Seriously, I understand the desire to obtain news on a subject like this immediately... but that's no reason to publish completely baseless unconfirmed reports. It's crazy irresponsible to report the wrong person as being the perpetrator of a crime for hours.permalinksaveparent[+]triplea20x 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (1 child)[]triplea20x 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoWas it the wrong person? Or was it just that there are two people named Ryan Lanzapermalinksaveparent[+]s0beit 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]s0beit 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours agoIt was the wrong person, gawker is reporting that "Ryan Lanza" (the guy in the pictures) was the brother of the deceased perpetrator but I have no idea if that's actually true right now.I sincerely hope it's a major mistake and he isn't... if it is actually the brother, his parents and brother are now dead, and he's been plastered all over the news as a criminal. Horrible.permalinksaveparent[+]Frankeh 7 points8 points9 points 20 hours ago (2 children)[]Frankeh 7 points8 points9 points 20 hours ago'I was the guy that went on a killing spree and then shot myself dead.'permalinksaveparent[+]deceax 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]deceax 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoWell it was more of the fact that the name now has a pretty negative connotation. It's like the episode of Seinfeld where Elaine is dating Joel Rifkin.permalinksaveparent[+]GiantWhaleCannon 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]GiantWhaleCannon 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago"Shot yourself--AAAA!

I get that a lot from people who are cultured.It's a great response, because it throws off the interviewer, while complimenting them. It lets you get off of the subject without having to expose your relationship to this event.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
