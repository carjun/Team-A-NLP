Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]timboelliot 9 points10 points11 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]timboelliot 9 points10 points11 points 23 hours agoHow often will random shootings happen? Is this just going to be a thing from now on? I feel like a piece of shit. I saw the story developing early from the beginning it just said that two people were dead, and you know what? I almost thought nothing of it at first! Shootings are happening so often that when it comes up on the news I'm completely numb to it. This is different though, it can't get much worse than this. permalinksavecontextfull comments2012Krist Novoselic, former bass player of Nirvana just confirmed the Paul McCartney - Nirvana Rumor on twitter (twitter.com)submitted 2 days ago by timboelliot to Music2 commentssharecancelloading...Paul McCartney to replace Kurt Cobain at Nirvana reunion gig  by  themxmin  Music[+]timboelliot 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]timboelliot 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoKrist Novoselic just confirmed it one twitter!! https://twitter.com/KristNovoselicHe says its a combo of Scentless Apprentice and Helter Skelter. permalinksavecontextfull commentsaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
