No. There's no indication that there would be a nexus between the cash, your home, and evidence of a crime. No search warrant for your home, and I'm not up on the requirements for a wire tap but I believe police have to demonstrate why a wire tap is necessary (I.e., that other methods of surveillance failed). permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood luck with that I suppose..

There's a lot of unintentional UPL that goes on, people not holding themselves out to the public (though they probably wouldn't get arrested anyways) -- but this seems like it is being reserved for egregious cases where the defendant is actively soliciting members of the public for business and also causing them harm (which makes me wonder, what if there is a competent UPL "lawyer" who doesn't harm his clients? Does that make his or her actions fall outside the ambit of the new law?)I do think it interesting that they're measuring the harm in terms of monetary, not liberty losses. If you wind up pleading to the max because you were represented by a not-actual-lawyer criminal defense "attorney" who didn't know shit from shinola, that's not a felony? permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe police officer that barged into a student's dorm from the youtube video "i hate cops" is now fired.  by  Inffectedin  news[+]GPadraic 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]GPadraic 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago*Also untrue.

Where were you fifteen years ago?!I'm joking. Clearly. You don't think I've heard that before? You don't think that anyone on the business end of an addiction hasn't had people spout off like that at them before? Of course they have, and it's come from wives, kids, judges, and doctors. Saying that is akin to berating a man with broken legs for not running. I lost everything to my addiction, years ago. I came right up to the brink, looking down at some pavement, seventeen stories below, and so far past ready to jump I still can't tell you why I didn't. If platitudes like realizing the power to change comes from within, or people who mattered a great deal to me pleading with me to stop, or jobs getting lost, or crimes being committed would have gotten through to me, trust me, they would have. I used to think like you, actually. I actually think I was involved in an online discussion, not unlike this one, many moons ago, bashing AA, God, religion, etc. You can think the message abominable, that's fine. I don't begrudge you your opinion. You can think me weak, or foolish, or evil -- I've been called worse by people closer to me than you are, trust me. But again, I think the important point is recovery, and however that happens. This is how it has worked for me, and I now have a life that I never ever believed I would ever figure out how to get. I'm sober and at peace -- something I never could say before, despite many attempts at trying to realize that the power to change comes from within.You can say you don't like how I got there if you want. But I still got there. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL LSD has been shown to treat alcoholism five times more effectively than Alcoholics Anonymous.  by  Sir_Frankie_Crispin  todayilearned[+]GPadraic 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago*(0 children)[]GPadraic 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago*You're cute. So what course of action would you propose for my addiction to giving up, as you see it? Bear in mind I've tried damn near everything else that there is to try, short of eating a bullet (though I do know many who have chosen that course of action, with 100% success, I might add!)If people saying you should just stop would have worked, or shame, or threats, or loss would have worked, let me tell you there would be no such thing as addiction. No one wants to lose their jobs, their families, their freedom, their sanity, their blood. Instead, all shit like that does it just work to fuel the addictive cycle. At least, that's been my experience.Maybe it is replacing one thing with another, I don't know. Would you prefer I replace it with LSD? When I first started off in recovery, I brought up the point you're bringing up now. Someone said something to me that stuck. They said that their addiction was going to put them on their knees with their last dollar in their hand and they would have no choice but to use. Maybe it's slavery either way -- so if I'm a slave to a path of spiritual and personal development, one that sees me sober, engaged in life, and finally at peace with myself? Sign me right up.Maybe there have been many other people that possessed the moral character or willpower or whatever trait, as you would see it, is necessary. That hasn't been me. Bottom line is that the program has helped me to transform my life -- and isn't that the point? LSD, therapy, iron will determination, God, church, does it really matter what it is so long as it works? You don't strike me as someone that has ever really grappled with addiction. Maybe you aren't afflicted, in which case good on you. Maybe you are, and just don't know it yet, in which case I wish you the best. Either way, seems that you could do with a heaping helping of empathy -- as I see it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBest apartments/townhouses in the Tates Creek area?  by  testerGLaDOSin  lexington[+]GPadraic 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]GPadraic 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoThe thing about Merrick is that the office staff is just the worst. Literally, they are awful, awful awful. Once you're in a lease they could care less about you. Here's a tip about maintenance requests -- talk directly to the maintenance people. If you go through the office staff your request gets immediately forgotten about. The maintenance folks themselves are really good and responsive, but the management is some of the worst I've ever encountered. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL LSD has been shown to treat alcoholism five times more effectively than Alcoholics Anonymous.  by  Sir_Frankie_Crispin  todayilearned[+]GPadraic 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]GPadraic 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI think it depends largely on what is meant by efficacy. I've been in recovery for over six years now, and I guess what I've learned is that my using was mostly symptomatic of a much bigger problem. Sure, there are probably many ways that I could have gotten clean, but I don't really think any of them would have given me the same benefits as 12-stepping has. There were times when I was clean and sober before, sure, but I was always an asshole, and deeply unhappy, too. I was also miserable when I was using, too, I just didn't care as much. Being numb was preferable to being in pain, and so that was what I picked. When I first got into recovery, I thought the whole game was just about staying sober. Don't get me wrong, sobriety is the sine qua non, the without which not. But sobriety has just been one piece of the puzzle. Recovery has forced me to take a long, sometimes painful, always rewarding look at my life. It's put me in an environment where I can speak openly and honestly with people who, in some ways, know me better than my own family does, without fear of judgment or shame. It's also gotten me to explore what spirituality could mean to me. I was a stalwart atheist for many years, an anti-theist actually, and never would have even considered the question had it not been for step work.My life over the last six years has been full of challenges, loss, failure, and pain. Also full of good times and successes, too. I can't say whether or not the 12 steps are more or less efficacious than some other method, and honestly, if someone out there is addicted to something, my only hope is that they get help somehow. What I can say is that even despite all my life's challenges, I've never been happier and more engaged with my life.Just my .02.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL LSD has been shown to treat alcoholism five times more effectively than Alcoholics Anonymous.  by  Sir_Frankie_Crispin  todayilearned[+]GPadraic 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]GPadraic 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoIf it works for people, that's great...
