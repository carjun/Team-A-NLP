Some of our computer programmers have done a really impressive job already.  At the moment we're not looking at the hardest levels, when we get to them, humans have a massive problem," Professor Renze said.According to Professor Renze, the reason Angry Birds is so addictive - and so appealing as an AI challenge - is more than just the simple fun of catapulting a variety of attack birds at egg-stealing green pigs.He said it tested a range of sub-disciplines of AI, including computer vision, machine learning, knowledge representation and planning."It is about particular problems that exist in the game. The special relationship between the blocks, which ones need to hit another one."They [behave consistently], so if you hit a block in the exact spot the same thing will happen again, but you can't test all of these in advance."Professor Renze said the Angry Birds challenge was more than just a contemporary version of the man vs machine chess battle, it was quite different.In chess, each move might have 10 or more options, but the challenge was to plan many moves ahead. In Angry Birds there are only a small number of birds, but each shot "could have a million possibilities".And, strange as it may sound, he said the battle to the death between pigs and birds was closer to the real world than chess and therefore offered new possibilities for developing intelligent machines."Chess is really an artificial problem. Who has to solve a situation similar to chess in daily life? But Angry Birds birds is more relevant to real life, if you knock things they will move and fall."In a surprising admission, Professor Renze, whose fields of expertise are knowledge representation and reasoning, says the green pigs are safe whenever he takes command of the catapult."I'm actually very bad at the game, usually the computer beats me."Tweet      Print StorySaveLatest News Funding boosted for 'carbon and capture' project Killer forced his wayPerfect pupil's next big test - finding a jobMan dies as inflatable raft upturnsClass heroes save lives Editor's Picks Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireFun at the Clunes show.Newlyncouple shocked by truck accident Popular Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeMemories flow of Daylesford's Boathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesFloats needed for DaylesfordNew Years Eve GalaDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireMultimediaGallery: The Boathouse Cafe burns      Gallery: Keele BreenHannah Knight catches up with local artist Keele Breen.
