But using the past to predict the future tells us otherwise. Batteries are one of the only technologies that has not seen a radical technological advancement in the last 20 years or so. I mean, they are getting better to a point, but slowly. And sadly that doesn't seem to change. It's a shame really, because a major advancement in batteries would be a huge step for humanity. It would benefit us in an untold number of ways. My (most likely wrong) prediction is that we will have wireless power/energy before we see battery technology advance to a comparable state. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood Guy Seth Macfarlane  by  tkmmarshallin  atheism[+]bobbert182 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]bobbert182 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agowatpermalinksavecontextfull commentsIs this really so wrong?  by  mattammarin  AdviceAnimals[+]bobbert182 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]bobbert182 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoYup.
