Some others may be subject to later update. 4.25pm ETPolice in Newtown have released the full list of names of those who died in the shootings on Friday. We are going through the list now and will publish it shortly. 4.06pm ETConnecticut state police spokesman Lieutenant Paul Vance is speaking. He says the investigation is still open and pleads for privacy for the families of the dead."We're still actively pursuing leads, and we expect to continue to do so for the next 24 to 48 hours," he says.Vance says he won't yet answer questions about where the weapons were recovered or what they were.He says they're investigating whether the weapons were legally owned by the gunman's mother.He denies a rumor that the gunman had been involved in an altercation at the school before the shooting."There are no reports filed of any altercation at the school involving the individual..." Vance says. "We have not officially identified him at this time, and we cannot discuss any facts and circumstances of the deceased."This was the last briefing for today, he says. The next will be tomorrow morning. 3.57pm ETCarver said all of the deaths were caused by gunshot woundswere caused by an assault rifle. The manner of deaths were classified as homicide. Most of the shots were not taken from close range, he says.He adds:I've been at this for a third of a century. And my sensibilities may not be the average man's, but this probably is the worst that I have seen, or that I know of any of my colleagues have seen. And that makes me proud and grateful to our staff, who to a man have behaved both professionally and strongly. I hope that they and the people of Newtown don't have it crash on their heads later.3.50pm ETCarver says he believes all the dead children were in first grade. That wouldmean they would have been five or six years old. 3.46pm ETCarverextended his sympathies to the families.He says he was at the crime scene until 12:30 am, working at a temporary facility at the school.Postmortem examinations started this morning and were completed by 1.30pm. "We completed the children by about 1.30. I believe that everyone but the assailant and his mother will be done by tonight. And I'll finish those in the morning."He says the names of those who died will be distributed later. 3.40pm ETUpdatedat 3.47pm ETThe chiefmedical examiner of Connecticut, Dr Wayne Carver, is now speaking at a news conference in Newtown. He says that all the victims died of gunshot wounds, and all have been identified. The cause of death has been listed as homicide. 3.37pm ETThe Guardian's Ed Pilkington is in Newtown.

And mass killings actually reached their peak in 1929, according to his data. He estimates that there were 32 in the 1980s, 42 in the 1990s and 26 in the first decade of the century.Chances of being killed in a mass shooting, he says, are probably no greater than being struck by lightning.Still, he understands the public perception  and extensive media coverage  when mass shootings occur in places like malls and schools. "There is this feeling that could have been me. It makes it so much more frightening."Read the full piece here. 2.33pm ETEarly Friday morning police arrested an Oklahoma high school student on charges that he plotted to bomb and shoot classmates, the AP reports:Police arrested 18-year-old Sammie Eaglebear Chavez at about 4:30 a.m. Friday after learning of the alleged plot Thursday.An arrest affidavit says Chavez tried to convince other students to help him lure students into the auditorium, chain the doors shut and start shooting. The Tulsa World reports that authorities say Chavez threatened to kill students who didn't help.It is unknown whether Chavez had any guns. 2.28pm ETUpdatedat 2.30pm ETPeople place flowers at a memorial at a sign for Sandy Hook Elementary School in Sandy Hook, Connecticut December 15, 2012.2.24pm ETSalon's Alex Seitz-Wald reports that the gun lobby has achieved success at shutting down government research into gun control:Over the past two decades, the NRA has not only been able to stop gun control laws, but even debate on the subject. The Centers for Disease Control funds research into the causes of death in the United States, including firearms  or at least it used to. In 1996, after various studies funded by the agency found that guns can be dangerous,the gun lobby mobilizedto punish the agency. First, Republicans tried to eliminate entirely the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, the bureau responsible for the research. When that failed, Rep. Jay Dickey, a Republican from Arkansas, successfully pushed through an amendment that stripped $2.6 million from the CDCs budget (the amount it had spent on gun research in the previous year) and outlawed research on gun control with a provision that reads: None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.Read the full piece here.  2.18pm ETMark Boughton is the mayor of nearby Danbury, Connecticut: Those helicopters you hear are the Presidential advance team. No details on what day the President is coming. #newtown MayorMark (@MayorMark) December 15, 20122.09pm ETEdward Small, a reporter for the Boston Courant who went to Sandy Hook elementary school, describes his fury and heartbreak:It's just after midnight at the end of a long day of shaking, crying, worrying, and telling several concerned friends that I'm fine. It's only true in the narrowest sense, of course. Yesterday, 20 children were shot and killed in my old elementary school. I'm sad, confused, infuriated, and I want to do something about it. The problem is, I can't think of anything that would actually matter.The full piece is here. 2.06pm ETThe Guardian's Matt Williams has more on Victoria Soto, the 27-year-old teacher who died while, it is thought, trying to shield her students:According to a cousin, Jim Wiltsie, a police officer, the family was told that Soto was attempting to get her class into a closet when the gunman entered the room. "In our eyes, she's a hero," Wiltsie told ABC News."She was trying to shield, getting her children into a closet and protect them from harm. And by doing that put herself between the gunman and the children and that is when she was tragically shot and killed."Wiltsie said the family had taken some comfort in knowing that Soto died while doing a job that she loved."Her life dream was to be a teacher and her instincts kicked in when she saw there was harm coming towards her students," he told ABC News, adding: "She lost her life doing what she loved. She loved her kids. Her goal in life was to be a teacher to mould young minds."1.59pm ETWould new national legislation banning certain kinds of guns prevent future mass shootings? Multiple commenters have pointed to the Australian example, which suggests the answer is 'yes'.After a gunman used a semiautomatic rifle to kill 35 people in Tasmania in 1996, Australia passed a law banning semiautomatic and automatic rifles and shotguns. The law included a mandatory buy-back program.Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, points to the law's efficacy: In 1996, Australia banned semi-automatics. In the 18 years before, there were 13 mass shootings.Since then, none. Jeffrey D. Sachs (@JeffDSachs) December 15, 2012A 2006 paper in the scholarly journal Injury Prevention concluded that the law appears to have worked. The paper concluded:Australias 1996 gun law reforms were followed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings, and accelerated declines in firearm deaths, particularly suicides. Total homicide rates followed the same pattern. Removing large numbers of rapid-firing firearms from civilians may be an effective way of reducing mass shootings, firearm homicides and firearm suicides.The Washington Post described a separate study that concluded the law worked:A study(pdf) by Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University finding that the firearm homicide rate fell by 59 percent, and the firearm suicide rate fell by 65 percent, in the decade after the law was introduced, without a parallel increase in non-firearm homicides and suicides. That provides strong circumstantial evidence for the laws effectiveness.1.33pm ETThe Guardian's Adam Gabbatt is in Newtown, and witnesses press photographers being ejected from a memorial service. Now at special service at St John's church in Sandy Hook. Bunch of over-zealous photographers were just asked to leave twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/st Adam Gabbatt (@AdamGabbatt) December 15, 20121.08pm ETConnecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, a former member of the Marine Reserve and a former state attorney general, was just asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer whether the country needs new federal gun control legislation.Blumenthal said that "out of respect for the families" the conversation is not one to have today."That's a conversation for me to have with my colleagues," Blumenthal said. 1.00pm ETUpdatedat 1.01pm ETThere have been at least two fatal shootings in public places in the US since yesterday's attack at Sandy Hook elementary.This morning police shot a man dead in an Alabama hospital after he shot at them, the AP reports:Williams says police were called because a man with a gun was walking through St. Vincent's Hospital on Saturday morning. When he was confronted by officers, he started shooting and wounded one of the officers. That's when the second officer shot and killed the man.Detectives are still working to determine why the armed man was in the hospital.Last night a man shot a vendor at a Las Vegas hotel-casino and then killed himself, the AP reports:Las Vegas police lieutenant Ray Steiber said the shootings happened at about 8.30pm near the Excalibur's front entrance.Steiber said the man shot the woman, who was a vendor at the hotel's concierge desk, and then turned the gun on himself. The man was found dead at the scene.UPDATE: At least 10 were wounded in shootings in Chicago Friday afternoon and night, the Chicago Tribune reports.

Photograph: Richard Adams11.02am ETThe Guardian's Adam Gabbatt, reporting in Newtown, and Paul Harris, in New York, draw a portrait of the community:Even for Americans long used to mass shootings, Newtown seems a shocking place for one of the worst school massacres in American history to take place  and especially one whose child victims were so horrifyingly young.It is in the commuter belt of the state, packed with large, tidy family homes for people who drive to their jobs in bigger cities, like Stamford or Hartford or even distant New York. It sprawls through former farmland in a series of distinct neighbourhoods that includes Sandy Hook, whose elementary school is now burned into the conscience of America.In 2005 CNN Money was considering naming Newtown as one of the best places to live in America. It even boasts a few famous residents including Suzanne Collins, author of the best-selling Hunger Games series. But it is mostly a quiet place of prosperity, unused to very much in the way of attention. Last year the big news was that Newtown and its 27,000 citizens were featured in the New York Times real estate section which glowing reportedly on the towns surviving rural charms. Enjoy the horses; skip the urban circus, the newspaper advised.[...]In Treadwell Park, just about a half mile through a thick wood from the stricken school, Frank Magliocco, 53, who has lived in Sandy Hook for the last seven years, walked through the empty park with his daughter Linda, 21. As a parent, knowing something like that happened in this kind of a town, its just shock, Magliocco said. He had taken the morning off to drive his daughter home from college for the holidays. She confessed that she broke down when she heard the news that would make her town suddenly infamous around the world.In a small community like this the tragedy has inevitably reached out and touched almost everyone in a personal way. Linda Magliocco said that her best friend had gone to Sandy Hook elementary and remained close to some of the staff. Shes kind of a mess thinking one of her teachers might have passed away, she said.10.56am ETA trade association for the gun industry that boasts 7,000 members has its headquarters in Newtown. The National Shooting Sports Foundation is on Mile Hill Road, less than two miles from Sandy Hook elementary.The group's web site has a statement on the shooting:Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this horrible tragedy in our community.Out of respect for the families, the community and the ongoing police investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment or participate in media requests at this time.The statement echoes the National Rifle Association, which yesterday said: Until the facts are thoroughly known, the NRA will not be making any comment."The Newtown-based gun group's site includes a campaign to oppose gun control legislation. The campaign, run during election season, was called #gunvote:With the election results in, its important to remember that the same voters who gave President Obama four more years in office by a narrower margin than he won in 2008 also produced a divided Congress. Democrats remain in control of the Senate by a few votes. Republicans hold a solid majority in the House. [...]You can be assured that NSSF will continue to vigorously advocate for all Americans who enjoy hunting and the shooting sports, as well as to promote and protect our Second Amendment rights. #gunvote taught us a lot that we will be able to apply to the important issues that are surely ahead.10.46am ETPolice stand guard at the entrance to Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Connecticut. Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images10.42am ETConnecticut state police have issued a press release describing their response to emergency calls, the crime scene and the investigation in progress.Most of the information in the release has been previously aired. The release says the bodies of "the deceased have been transported to the Office of The Chief States Medical Examiner, where a post mortem examination will be conducted to determine the manner and cause of death."When that examination is concluded, Vance said, police will release the names and birth dates of the victims and identify the gunman. 10.32am ETUpdatedat 10.34am ETVance: gunman forced his way into the schoolState police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance is holding a briefing.The victims have been positively identified, he says, although the medical examiner is still performing some work.A list of the victims will be released when the work is complete, he says."The minute the medical examiner is done he is coming here, and we will provide as much detailed information as we can.""When we release that list, at the request of all of the family members, they have asked for you to please respect their privacy.""I'm pleading with you ... to please abide by their request."He says a crisis intervention team has been established in Newtown from the Yale New Haven medical center. They can be reached by phone at (203) 270-4283.Detectives continue to work at the scene at the school, he says. The investigation is expected to take at least another day. Investigators are examining "every crack and crevice of that facility, and that does not exclude the outside of the building."Vance says they are investigating the history "of each and every weapon" found at the scene.He is asked if the shooter is Adam Lanza. He says the shooter will be identified at the same time as the victims.Vance is asked about the gunman's motive."The answer I can give you is that our investigators... did produce some very good evidence that our investigators will be able to use in [determining] how and, more importantly, why this occurred," he says.Vance says "[the gunman] was not voluntarily let into the school at all. He forced his way into the school." He said law enforcement broke many windows in entering the school.The secondary crime scene was established "pursuant to the investigation" at the school, he says.He says the second crime scene was a "private residence with a sole female deceased."Vance ends the briefing. He says another update will be given soon. 10.22am ETUpdatedat 10.26am ETWill horror at the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary produce a national debate over gun control? My colleague Harry J. Enten observes that support for stricter gun control laws is at an all-time low:The percentage of Americans who want stronger gun laws is currently below 50% in the vast majority of surveys. The proportion of Americans yearning for tighter gun controls has beendropping by a point or two every yearsince 1990. Nearly three-quarters of US citizens,73%, believe that the second amendmentguarantees citizens the right to own guns.The only event in the past 20 years that reshaped the gun control debate at all was theColumbineschool shootings.Support for Stricter Gun Laws:Support for stricter gun laws is in decline. The percentage of Americans who wanted stricter gun control measures spiked by about five to 10 percentage points after Columbine.  Photograph: Mark BlumenthalAs this chart from Mark Blumenthal illustrates, the percentage of Americans who wanted stricter gun control measures spiked by about five to 10 percentage points after Columbine. A similar jump after Newtown would result in a revived majority of Americans wanting stronger measures.Keep in mind, though, that there have beenmany mass shootingssince 1999, and none of them resulted in Americans changing their opinions on gun control. This includes a number of school shootings, and the mass killings carried out at Virginia Tech in 2007. Columbine's ability to change opinion may merely have been unique.Read the full piece here.  9.46am ETUpdatedat 9.49am ETWe are still awaiting the news conference by Connecticut state police in Newtown.

When she sent memos to parents she would address them to the "Sandy Hook family".This July 2010 photo provided by the Newtown Bee shows Dawn Hochsprung, principal at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connnecticut.  Photograph: Newton Bee/Eliza Hallabeck/AP9.22am ETInvestigations are ongoing at the home that the person widely named as the gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, shared with his mother, Nancy. He is believed to have killed her at that location,inYogananda Street, Newtown. He then went to Sandy Hook elementary school, where he shot 20 children and six adults dead, before apparently taking his own life.The Associated Press, quoting a law enforcement official, said that a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols, and a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle were found in the school. These details have also been independently reported by other media. 8.57am ETIn his weekly address, released this morning, President Barack Obama re-stated his desire for to take "meaningful action" in the wake of the shootings. But he did not expand on those remarks. He added words of sympathy:Most of those who died were just young children with their whole lives ahead of them. And every parent in America has a heart heavy with hurt.Among the fallen were also teachers  men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams.So our hearts are broken today. We grieve for the families of those we lost. And we keep in our prayers the parents of those who survived. Because as blessed as they are to have their children home, they know that their childs innocence has been torn away far too early.8.30am ETUpdatedat 8.34am ETIt is the day after the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, when a gunman walked into an elementary school and killed 20 children. Six adults at the school, the gunman and his motheralso died. Police are due to hold a news conference in the town soon, and we will be following developments. Here is a summary of where things stand this morning. Vigils were held late into the night in Newtown as bereaved families identified the dead. Hundreds gathered at St Rose of Lima church and at other locations in the town. The principal of Sandy Hook elementary school, Dawn Hochsprung, 47, was one of the the victims. She was decribed by colleagues as a warm and energetic leader of the school. The school psychologist, Mary Sherlach, was another of the confirmed victims. The bodies of the 20 dead schoolchildren remained in Sandy Hook elementary school until late into the night. The grim task of identifying the bodies continued overnight. Police are due to hold a news conference shortly. Lieutenant Paul Vance of the Connecticut state police said official details of the gunman, named locally as Adam Lanza, 20, would be released. "We're going to paint this picture, we're going to answer these questions," he said in a television interview on Saturday morning. President Barack Obama signalled that a national debate about gun control was necessary. In an emotional address from the White House on Friday, he said "meaningful action" would need to be taken in response to the shootings.Newtown vigil after Sandy Hook school shootings.
