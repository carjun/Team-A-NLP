I hope she finds it helpful. :) permalinksavecontextfull commentsJennifer Weiner deals with her daughter calling girls "fat"  by  Veemsin  TwoXChromosomes[+]smalasussie 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]smalasussie 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoThis is a bit of an aside but I would highly recommend you pass on Caroline Hiron's blog to her: http://www.beautymouth.com. The woman is a bit of a skincare guru and has lots of great advice on how to deal with acne (look on the right side for the links under her 'cheat sheet' section in particular). Her biggest recommendation is switching to more nourishing, oil-based skincare routines, which the majority of acne-prone people would run away from because of the generally held (and incorrect) idea that oily products will produce oily skin and aggravate acneic skin. Skin with acne is essentially sensitive skin that has to be treated with a lot of care, and the typical anti-acne products are usually very drying and will only aggravate the problem. I'd definitely recommend she try some of the recommendations, at least for a period - certainly can't hurt! Caroline gives lots of products suggestions, I can repeat some - it's best to double cleanse, first using a good balm cleanser like Emma Hardie Amazing Face or Neal's Yard Wild Rose Balm, used with a hot cloth (look up "hot cloth cleansing method"); then a more deep-cleaning cleanser like REN Clear Calm Clay Cleanser; a toning spray like Caudalie Beauty Elixir; a treatment serum, she has many different types listed - gentle ones which can exfoliate the skin without stripping it (Alpha-H Liquid Gold and REN AHA Concentrate I've heard have been helpful to many); and good, natural, lightweight moisturizers for day and nourishing serums and facial oils for night (she has many on her blog). None of these items are particularly affordable, but it's definitely worth investing in skincare, and if it can get her off of Accutane, all the better! Plus, try taking high doses of fish oil or flax seed oil - up to 6000-9000mg a day, she says it does wonders for the skin. Facial massage is great as well, to bring more blood flow to the skin and help clear toxins from the face. And cutting down on sugar + raising up the fruit/veg intake can make a huge impact. I've slowly been using her suggestions (double cleansing using a hot cloth, trying facial massage, altering my eating habits) and I definitely think they're worthwhile. Best of luck to your friend! permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy Before & After!

Thanks! This was actually after a bit of a hair styling experiment. I usually wash and blow dry my hair in the morning but this time I washed my hair the night before, put in a few pumps of thickening spray and let it air dry, and in the morning just put a bit of volumizing dry shampoo on the roots and tousled it. And I'm actually pretty happy with how it came out! A bit messy, but I like it that way anyway. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy Before & After!
