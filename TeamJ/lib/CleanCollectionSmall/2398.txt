There still are federal laws protecting the ability to join unions.  The thing here is the union's position is heavily weakened if they do not speak for all employees.  (Plus losing out on those employees' union dues).  Also, the non-union employees will still benefit from what the union still is able to get for employees.permalinksavecontextfull commentsParents of Reddit: What's on your child's/children's holiday lists this year?  by  emilysnapplein  AskReddit[+]capndetroit 4 points5 points6 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]capndetroit 4 points5 points6 points 6 days agoIf I went by that's stupid or that is overpriced my kids toy list would be pretty limited...permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you could have a theme song that automatically played whenever you entered the room, what would it be?  by  Jovian8in  AskReddit[+]capndetroit 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]capndetroit 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoThis is the only correct answer.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter seeing my cake day post writhe and die yesterday...  by  DeltaThinkin  AdviceAnimals[+]capndetroit 5 points6 points7 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]capndetroit 5 points6 points7 points 6 days agoBut a post about your failed cake day post...GOLD!permalinksavecontextfull commentsU.S. Rep.
