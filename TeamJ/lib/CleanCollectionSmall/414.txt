The thought of this massacre is beyond most of our comprehension. Adam Lanza is believed to have shot and killed his mother in her home before invading the school she worked at.  In a shooting spree with over 100 shots fired, 27 victims lost their lives.Of the 20 children 18 were pronounced dead on site, and 2 additional passed later at Danbury hospital.  6 faculty and staff members of Sandy Hook Elementary School were also killed before Lanza turned the gun on himself.Sandy Hook Elementary educates 450 students in kindergarten through 4th grade.  This is a terrible loss to the Newton community, and humanity as a whole. Todays carnage surpasses the devastation of Columbine in 1999 with 19 lives lost and 24 wounded, and approaches the terror of the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007 with 32 lives lost.  Granted both those tragedies may have been slightly easier to endure. Although social media was ablaze with outrage, grief, prayers and sympathies some people felt physical action was necessary.  This sent an abundance of donations to organizations lobbing for gun control. During the days surrounding a mass shooting there is a burst of donations to anti-gun establishments.  The outpouring of support today to anti-gun organizations far surpassed any previous mass shootings, due to the age of the victims, and the malevolent nature of the act.If you are looking to get involved to support the area and families involved contact the American Red Cross, Newtown Parent Connection, or the Newtown Youth and Family Services.    The biggest question weighing on minds all over the country is why.  The situation is too difficult to process for any of us, little kids being gunned down is just too abhorrent to wrap your mind around.But the reality is, no explanation will bring those 20 precious children back to this God-forsaken world, nor peace in their loved ones hearts.Receive e-mail alerts when new articles are available.
