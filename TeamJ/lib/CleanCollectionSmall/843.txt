They have actually done a lot to propel the hardcore/deathcore/whatever the fuck you want to call it genre into more of the population. Yeah you won't hear them on the radio, but talk to anyone who listens to heavy music I bet they have heard of Emmure, or even The Acacia strain. Just my opinion.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf the President of the US were to get assassinated in today's age, how would America react compared to when Kennedy was assassinated?  by  chendoguyin  AskReddit[+]MrBlukey 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]MrBlukey 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoIn this day and age, just because we could, we would go on a fucking rampage.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, what gif always makes you laugh when you see it?  by  ken27238in  AskReddit[+]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoFIRE IN THE HOLE!permalinksavecontextfull commentsAs a gamer with a not-so-great laptop, I get this feeling often.  by  559955in  gaming[+]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoMeh, I travel so my Laptop can run Far Cry 3 no problem.

I grew up through verbal abuse and physical violence because of alchohol. Now that I am bigger and stonger than both my Father and Mother they just focus on each other. I can't even move out of the house until my sister leaves for college because I don't trust the couple of Jekle and Hydes that live in my house. She is the sole reason I don't murder myself. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, what's one movie you never get bored of?  by  Injechsin  AskReddit[+]MrBlukey 3 points4 points5 points 11 days ago (0 children)[]MrBlukey 3 points4 points5 points 11 days agoWhen Krunk is doing his sneaking, "Duh...duh da duh...duh... duh... gasp Duuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuhhhh.... duh..da duh du da duh.."permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am a professional hacker (pentester).

Reddit, what gruesome discoveries have you made?  by  CrzyBonein  AskReddit[+]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoI run freight trains. I never got that sit down. I got the sit down that the person/people you are working might get killed cause... Before I worked the railroad I never gave crossings a second thought. Never thought about the trains thatI thought were so cool. Never thought how much respect is needed for these machines that everyone almost sees daily. They make your life run. They make your life easier. They make your life enjoyable. All in the backround. All in the peripheral that you see but don't understand and take for granted.Railroads will always be around. They will always be obscure. They will always be the backbone of a country, or even continent. They are the best way to transport commodities, and even people. Cheap and efficient. Whats better than that?permalinksavecontextfull commentsI once made a gruesome discovery when I opened a floating duffle bag I found near the port of Miami. Reddit, what gruesome discoveries have you made?  by  CrzyBonein  AskReddit[+]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)[]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 13 days agoI am a locomotive engineer now, but last year as a conductor I was working a local way-freight and hit a car at a non-gated crossing with only cross bucks and a stop sign. Hit the car, killed 1 person while the other walked away. I found out later during police and company interviews that the person who was killed was the mother of the daughter that walked away. I was dealing with it fine until I learned that bit of information. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI want to learn how to be an adult  by  gothiin  IWantToLearn[+]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]MrBlukey 0 points1 point2 points 14 days agostart being somebody people can depend onMade me straighten my back more.permalinksavecontextfull commentsValet parking  by  SpazSkullin  ragecomics[+]MrBlukey 1 point2 points3 points 24 days ago (0 children)[]MrBlukey 1 point2 points3 points 24 days agoWhat is that?
