I don't plan on murdering anyone. I've been out in public shopping or helping family countless times this week. Just because I have a gun on me it doesn't equate to me wanting to murder someone. The gun has no mind of its own.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 38 minutes ago (0 children)[]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 38 minutes agoWe already have it...it's called the NICS system. People could do private sales which are impossible to track, but they still have to abide by the same laws those who buy from a dealer have to (look at a form 4473). Again, the lawless don't give two shits but they're also the same people who don't care about murdering others.If you want to make a legitimate improvement to the NICS system...and it'd be the only one I can really recommend, it would be to fix our healthcare bureaucracy. Those with mental illnesses go undiagnosed and often unreported to the FBI.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 42 minutes ago (0 children)[]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 42 minutes agoThere is regulation. There are also states with greatly increased regulation beyond what the federal laws state. Look at Cook County, Illinois. Ridiculous crime rates and yet guns are pretty much banned unless you want to go through all the hoops required by the county. Meanwhile Jamal and Rick can go find a gun easily because they don't follow the law. Still, you're proposing to burden the 99.9995% over the actions of the 0.0005% when it has been shown that minority percentage won't follow the law regardless what it states. You just don't understand the term lawless.The federal government put the AWB into place to restrict those types of guns you're talking about. It had no positive effect on reducing crime in the country. From 1994 to 2004 jack shit. Meanwhile post 2004 our crime rate has been on a steady decrease. Guns are not the problem.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I'm trying to tell people we need to be proactive and observe our fellow countrymen and women to identify the potential before it's an irreversible event. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Volucris 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Volucris 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoYou'll find many police officers will recommend CCW for those who legally can. My sheriff who signed off on my papers recommends it himself. I doubt the U.S. Government would take an official stance that you should own a gun and carry one prior to taking an official stance that you shouldn't be fat or live in low-income areas. However we all have the right to own firearms and bear them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Volucris 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Volucris 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoThere are more guns in the United States than there are people. It's been that way for a long time. The elementary school is a gun-free zone; it's not even supposed to have guns. The point is that increasing our laws in violation of the second amendment does nothing to affect crime. Reasons being that you cannot affect the lawless by legislating the law-abiding. One would think that all these guns are just going around murdering people but that's not the case at all. Our homicide rate with a firearm in the U.S. is 2.7 per 100,000 as of the most recent FBI statistics. It's very, very small and much less compared to many countries that outright ban guns. But I also want to know why these shootings happen. Why are people going crazy, hitting the breaking point, and committing these atrocities. What was wrong with the Oregon shooter? His GF and him split, he had been evicted, his flight got canceled/missed, etc. He was so hellbent on leaving this world and taking people with him that he stole a gun to do it. So he illegally murdered and wounded people, and stole a gun which is also illegal. That guy is a pretty typical case of who does shootings in the U.S.. IE crazy people. The only way to stop them is a combination of making people alert and willing to get involved when they see someone in such obvious distress (what about his friends, family, etc?). Just being evicted should put up warning signs that the guy isn't going to be stable. The other solution that works now and has been gaining popularity is to arm the lawful populace. Self-defense shootings rarely make it past local news but they happen often. I myself carry a gun concealed because I simply do not want to be at the absent mercy of one of these crazed lunatics. I suggest to everyone feeling competent enough to do so to actually partake. Even Illinois is readying to pass a CCW statute because they've tried all the bans and it doesn't do anything. Criminals and crazies keep committing murder and meanwhile their victims remain unarmed and defenseless. Like I've said before, when seconds matter, the police are only minutes away.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

You can't stop crazy people from doing this shit and no amount of legislation will affect those who ignore the law against MURDER. What we need is better involvement from society to RECOGNIZE these people before they've gotten to the breaking point, not hinder law-abiding citizens based upon the actions of lunatics.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
