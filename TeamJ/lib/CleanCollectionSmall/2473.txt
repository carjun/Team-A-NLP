Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]chargerland 2 points3 points4 points 35 minutes ago (0 children)[]chargerland 2 points3 points4 points 35 minutes agoI can see why it annoyed people, but it did start a conversation so it was somewhat effective. I think no matter what, people will argue that it is too soon to talk about gun control or that the venue isn't the right one.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

That doesn't seem completely necessary. I'd also like to know why the US has so many more school killings than the rest of the world. Not sure I know the answer, but it is interesting.edit: and why this gun is legal.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Sounds like him and Kluwe just don't like each other. I really don't think putting a post it on your jersey to send a message is distracting. Like others have said, at least he isn't getting dui's, doing steroids and pissing off his team.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGAME THREAD: Los Angeles Lakers (9-13) @ New York Knicks (16-5) - (Dec. 13, 2012)  by  ElGoddamnDoradoin  nba[+]chargerland 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]chargerland 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoI never said we don't, but I'm not going to panic until I get a chance to see our whole team play together.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGAME THREAD: Los Angeles Lakers (9-13) @ New York Knicks (16-5) - (Dec. 13, 2012)  by  ElGoddamnDoradoin  nba[+]chargerland -1 points0 points1 point 16 hours ago (0 children)[]chargerland -1 points0 points1 point 16 hours agoThe Lakers are playing on the road against the top team in the East, who can't miss from 3, and are without 2 of their best players, everyone panic!permalinksavecontextfull commentsGAME THREAD: Los Angeles Lakers (9-13) @ New York Knicks (16-5) - (Dec. 13, 2012)  by  ElGoddamnDoradoin  nba[+]chargerland 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]chargerland 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoIf he mentions how he doesn't hate the knicks one more time...permalinksavecontextfull commentsGAME THREAD: Los Angeles Lakers (9-13) @ New York Knicks (16-5) - (Dec. 13, 2012)  by  ElGoddamnDoradoin  nba[+]chargerland 3 points4 points5 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]chargerland 3 points4 points5 points 17 hours agoIs that....Sacre?permalinksavecontextfull commentsGAME THREAD: Los Angeles Lakers (9-13) @ New York Knicks (16-5) - (Dec. 13, 2012)  by  ElGoddamnDoradoin  nba[+]chargerland 3 points4 points5 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]chargerland 3 points4 points5 points 17 hours agoThey seriously need to put in Morris to play some defense, Duhon is just terrible.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGAME THREAD: Los Angeles Lakers (9-13) @ New York Knicks (16-5) - (Dec. 13, 2012)  by  ElGoddamnDoradoin  nba[+]chargerland 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]chargerland 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoI agree, but shooter doesn't equal scorer.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGAME THREAD: Los Angeles Lakers (9-13) @ New York Knicks (16-5) - (Dec. 13, 2012)  by  ElGoddamnDoradoin  nba[+]chargerland 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]chargerland 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoI think Melo is a better shooter, not sure about scorer.

It would make no sense for there to be a secret plan and if there is, I'm done with this show. If Brody was secretly working with Nazir then there was no reason for Carrie's kidnapping (at least, that I can think of, you could say it was to fool her into trusting Brody or something, but that is a stretch) and there was no reason for him to pretend like he was having a meltdown when he was alone and talking to Nazir. I think the next episode will be all about carrie/saul/brody vs. estes/quinn. I assue saul will go to carrie and tell her about their plan to kill brody, then who know what the fuck they will do.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Unofficial] Episode 2.11 Discussion - Motherf#@!#* with a Turban.  by  mediocre_geniusin  homeland[+]chargerland 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]chargerland 4 points5 points6 points 4 days agoThey saw each other on skype does that count? And Brody was alone when he was on skype so he wouldn't have needed to act like he cared about Carrie. They could have just killed Walden without all that other shit. It did strike me as weird that at the end of tonight's episode he said it was an easy choice between Walden and Carrie, not exactly a compliment. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGame Thread: Pittsburgh Steeler (7-5) vs. San Diego Chargers (4-8)  by  Apples212in  nfl[+]chargerland 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]chargerland 4 points5 points6 points 4 days agoNice coverage on DX, refs.
