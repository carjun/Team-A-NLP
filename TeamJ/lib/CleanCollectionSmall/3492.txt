Adam Lanza took three weapons from his house and shot first-graders as many as 11 times, authorities said.Comments39previous12|  single pageIt's still unknown what motivated Lanza, who has been described as brilliant but remote. Lt. Vance said authorities "did produce some very good evidence in this investigation that our investigators can use to explain how, and more importantly, why this occurred.""We're doing everything we need to do to literally peel back the onion, layer by layer," Vance said, but declined to give more details.Law enforcement sources said Lanza was disturbed by the 2009 divorce of his parents, Peter and Nancy. Ryan Lanza told investigators his younger brother had behavioral issues.AlsoPhotos:Massacre at elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Who they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsAuthorities say Adam Lanza left his house Friday with a Bushmaster .223 rifle and two handguns  a Glock 9-millimeter and a Sig Sauer semiautomatic."We know the manufacturers, and are pretty sure when they were purchased," a law enforcement source said. "But the trace is not complete yet."Just days before the shooting, Lanza attempted to purchase a rifle from a sporting goods store in Canton, Conn., about 50 miles from Newtown. He was turned away because he didn't want to wait for the required 14-day background check, according to two federal law enforcement officials.Investigators were still swarming over the school Saturday looking for evidence. A temporary facility was set up in the parking lot Friday night to identify the victims.Medical examiners took photographs of the children's faces for identification, sparing parents from having to view their bodies.As Saturday wore on, new memorials appeared with every hour.Kristen Burleson bought all the bouquets of roses in the Stop and Shop grocery store in her hometown of Wilton, 30 miles from Newtown. She walked the streets here handing roses one by one to every woman she encountered."They need to know that we care," she said. "And I know the heart of the whole nation goes out to this town."The crush of news media and humming satellite trucks stalled traffic. Nerves began to fray.A noon service at St. John's Episcopal Church drew dozens of mourners and media from around the world. The clicking of camera shutters irritated some mourners, who at one point ushered photographers out, telling them "this is a worship service." When they returned, a few women held up brochures in front of the cameras when they tried to take photos."What this young man stole was  he gave a great victory to anger and hatred and evil," the Rev. Mark Moore told the crowd, speaking of the gunman. "If that happens, evil has won a great victory. We can never let that happen.... Love will conquer all."Mary Fellows, a Newtown resident whose children went to Sandy Hook Elementary years ago, spoke out against gun violence and video games that "glorify the idea of combat."She sat crying in a pew, alone."It has to stop now," she said, wiping away tears. "Change has to start now. We have to make it worth it.... If your kid is quiet, and they seem very disconnected, that's not OK. It's not going to pass; it's not a phase. It's something very serious."On a cement wall under a bridge that spans a small river, someone had written the following lines in black paint:"We have everything / and we have nothing / small and unstable / we self destruct / we are sleeping sheep / and there are wolves among us."It's unclear if the graffito was painted before the shooting Friday or went up overnight.But on a cold day in Newtown, its truth was undeniable.tina.susman@latimes.comalana.semuels@latimes.combrian.bennett@latimes.comSusman, Semuels and Bennett reported from Connecticut.

The Second Amendment reads: "A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free   state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." The precise meaning is disputed but such militias plainly no longer exist and the duty America has to protect its citizenry conflicts with the ownership of assault weapons. Yet despite last weeks histrionics, it is unlikely the law will be amended and the regular slaughter of innocents appears to be a price America is willing to pay. The NRA remains one of the richest lobby groups and owns the Republican gun party as well as the Supreme Court's good-ol-boys ready to strike down gun-control laws. Guns dont kill people, people kill people. is a self-serving absurdity to a European but the rejoinder, People with guns kill people. is clearly considered un-American.robert dioenes at 7:34 PM December 16, 2012                GET THE FACTS BEHIND THE NEWS! Since 1979 There have been 1979 shooting in schools according to "The Bully Society" by Jessie Klein. The number of shootings appears to be increasing. Since 2009 there have been 15 shooting outside of schools where six or more people were killed.  A 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech killed 32 people.                                                 This is the tip of the iceberg. APPROXIMATELY 100,000 people are SHOT EACH YEAR and 30,00 ARE KILLED BY GUN SHOT WOUNDS. ACCORDING TO THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT VIOLENCE. to prevent violence.         After each tragedy there are flowery speeches about helping the stricken families etc. BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO PREVENT SIMILAR SHOOTINGS.NOW IS THE TIME FOR PRES OBAMA TO SHOW LEADERSHIP AND TAKE MEASURES. TO CONTROL GUN VIOLENCE, FIRST BY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SECONDLY BY GETTING THE CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO TIME FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO STOP OPPOSING REASONABLE GUN REGULATION THAT CAN SAVE LIVES.The people of this country deserve more from the Pres and Congress than ccrying on everyone's shouldeer.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
