As the residents of newtown, the victim, the families, start the process of rebuilding and -- just three days after the unthinkable occurred in this picturesque new england touwn, newtown has been taken over by neighbors, family, and stranger who is care. All with a simple message. The vick tlims not be forgotten. Why was it important to be out tonight. We have to teach our children to be children. Reporter: At an interfaith vigil last night, families stood for hours to ln and comfort. In the face of unconscionable evil, you have looked out for each other. You have cared for one another. And you have loved one another. Reporter: As the nights wear on, more signs of hope. The words, a poignant reminder of what must be overcome. We're all in it together. That boy could have been my son. We have to embrace that and pray for him as well. Reporter: As strangers become family, random acts of kindness are everywhere. This is such a small town. Face from faces, we know each other. We see each other at the deli, everywhere. It's one family. It's affected us all. Reporter: Like a family, the people of newtown, where born here or brought here by tragedy will face the difficult days ahead by relying on each other. 0Comment on this videoABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSshows:GMAGMA LIVE!GMA Recipes GMA Concert SeriesWorld NewsWorld News with David MuirNightline20/20Most Fascinating People Primetime NightlineDiane Sawyer SpecialsPrimetimeThis WeekWhat Would You Do?World News NowABC News NowPlaylist:GMA: 12/18/12GMA: 12/17/12GMA: 12/16/12GMA: 12/15/12GMA: 12/14/12GMA: 12/12/12GMA Birthday WishesGMA Backstage PassAround the WatercoolerHome > Video > GMA > GMA: 12/17/12Could Adam Lanza's Mother Have Foreseen Shooting?Could Adam Lanza's Mother Have Foreseen Shooting?Dr. Janet Taylor and Dan Abrams discuss homicide cases involving young perpetrators.Remembering Principal Dawn HochsprungRemembering Principal Dawn HochsprungPrincipal's selfless heroism saved countless lives during Sandy Hook school shooting.Helping Kids Return to School After TragedyHelping Kids Return to School After TragedyGeoffrey Canada and Willow Bay discuss helping children feel safe again in the classroom.Newtown Community Rallies TogetherNewtown Community Rallies TogetherNewtown, Connecticut residents vow the victims will not be forgotten.Calls for Gun Control Surge Following Newtown ShootingsCalls for Gun Control Surge Following Newtown ShootingsLawmakers, citizens debate whether more strict gun control legislation could prevent mass shootings.Young People's Chorus of New York City Sing "Amazing Grace"Young People's Chorus of New York City Sing "Amazing Grace"A special tribute to honor the victims and survivors of Sandy Hook school.Religious Leaders Join Together After Newtown ShootingsReligious Leaders Join Together After Newtown ShootingsPeople turn to their faith, religious leaders to help ease pain of shootings.Previous | 2 of 2External links are provided for reference purposes.
