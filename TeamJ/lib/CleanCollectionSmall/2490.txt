Man this makes me sick.Yes, society is fucked up. No, you can't place the blame for a tragedy strictly on an inanimate object.Does the ease with which children and mentally unstable adults can get their hands on deadly weapons contribute? Of course it does.Does having a gun in your hand change your mentality and disposition? Well, for some people it does. Holding a gun can make a person feel powerful, and for those already inclined to commit heinous acts, it can empower them.Come on people. Let's try to work at the problem from both sides instead of just calling each other idiots for wanting to find a solution to the problem.permalinksaveparent[+]m4tthu 16 points17 points18 points 40 minutes ago (0 children)[]m4tthu 16 points17 points18 points 40 minutes agoSmartest comment in this threadpermalinksaveparent[+]terpbaby222 4 points5 points6 points 28 minutes ago (0 children)[]terpbaby222 4 points5 points6 points 28 minutes agoYou, I like you.permalinksaveparent[+]yetanotherpoop 2 points3 points4 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]yetanotherpoop 2 points3 points4 points 21 minutes agoThis needs to be at the top of every site. I am neither pro nor against guns for the sake of it being not a black or white issue. You can argue both sides and they both make valid points.We need to find a way to make people safe without arming young children. Like you said, we have smart people on both sides of the argument; why not put our brains together and protect those kids. I applaud you! permalinksaveparent[+]Butthole_Scientist 9 points10 points11 points 54 minutes ago (1 child)[]Butthole_Scientist 9 points10 points11 points 54 minutes agoI think the main issue is health care, and stigmatization of people with mental illnesses, which creates a culture of people that cannot afford to get mental health care, and won't because they are too afraid of the consequences of being labeled "mentally ill".permalinksaveparent[+]hafetysazard 5 points6 points7 points 22 minutes ago*(0 children)[]hafetysazard 5 points6 points7 points 22 minutes ago*I do not know why you are downvoted at the time of this reply, but you are right.  Violence with firearms that manifests itself in this form is a social medical problem, not a problem of property rights.   Gun crime where robbery and assault is involved, is also not a property rights issue, it is a socioeconomic one.Mental health is a serious problem, that often goes unchecked.  It is when it goes unchecked, combined with a unique circumstance, that tragedies like this occur.  While people are quick to blame guns, the same sort of thing happened in China quite recently with a young man armed with a knife was able to kill 9 people before he was stopped.99% of all firearms are never used to intimidate, hurt, or kill people.  For those reasons, and more, I think anyone who is staunchly anti-gun is barking up the wrong tree.permalinksaveparent[+]SicilianEggplant 0 points1 point2 points 17 minutes ago (1 child)[]SicilianEggplant 0 points1 point2 points 17 minutes agoThe sad part is that it's easier and cheaper for someone to get a gun in this country than medical or psychiatric help. I'm not saying gun control is the answer. Rather I think cheaper and more readily available care and aid should be offered to people (while not knowing the facts of this case, a safe assumption is that these people were mentally imbalanced).permalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoWell, I certainly don't disagree that health should be more easily affordable, accessible.permalinksaveparent[+]mrbriancomputer 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]mrbriancomputer 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoThis, This is exactly the issue. The blame is not a single point in a large argument but rather a series of reforms we are going to need to make this a better place to live. Those kids are victims of a tragedy and let's remind ourselves what people are capable of despite our attempts to stop them. And to keep in mind all of the victims including the families affected, when we are discussing these issues. Please, Please be respectful. These are little children that were killed.permalinksaveparent[+]vvelox -3 points-2 points-1 points 24 minutes ago (5 children)[]vvelox -3 points-2 points-1 points 24 minutes agoCome on people. Let's try to work at the problem from both sides instead of just calling each other idiots for wanting to find a solution to the problem.The problem is one sides first reaction is to want to ban firearms or implement Jim Crowe style laws to make sure only the "right"(politically/financially connected) people can get firearms. This in return naturally puts those who don't on the defensive, so even if they wanted to do something about the issues, they can't as they are fighting to preserve their rights.The problem is even afterwards no one stops to talk about the issues with society, which made problematic, because the first side goes back to the same argument, preventing discussing any thing meaningful.The first reaction needs to become discussing poverty, mental healthcare, the drug laws, or other related issues, instead of engage in tool blaming.permalinksaveparent[+]Apparatii 1 point2 points3 points 15 minutes ago (1 child)[]Apparatii 1 point2 points3 points 15 minutes agoJim Crowe style lawsWhat a terrible comparison. permalinksaveparent[+]vvelox -1 points0 points1 point 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]vvelox -1 points0 points1 point 12 minutes agoActually not at all.Look at places that have may-issue or like ownership permits such as Chicago. The system is set out to very specifically dis-enfranchise chunks of the populace that politicians don't like. Very notably the lower class, or in the case of Chicago blacks.permalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 21 minutes ago (2 children)[]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 21 minutes agoI disagree that no one talks about the issues with society. We talk about the issues with society constantly in this country. Constantly.permalinksaveparent[+]vvelox -1 points0 points1 point 17 minutes ago (1 child)[]vvelox -1 points0 points1 point 17 minutes agoI never said we don't talk about it.I was commenting on the problems with talking about it.permalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agoI'm not out to "tool blame", but to completely write it off as a non factor in these incidents is irresponsible.Also, somehow your second paragraph came off as though you were saying we don't talk about the problems. If that wasn't your intent, I apologize for insinuating that it was.permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail -5 points-4 points-3 points 33 minutes ago (9 children)[]skyfail -5 points-4 points-3 points 33 minutes agoSick people do sick things and taking away the rights of the many peaceful citizens cannot change that no matter whathttp://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/12/14/man-stabs-22-children-at-chinese-elementary-school/permalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes ago (8 children)[]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes agoI have a problem with calling gun ownership a right. It should be a privilege. One that must be earned and can easily be lost.That being said, I'm not trying to stop peaceful, law abiding citizens from getting a gun.Also, the fact that guns aren't the only weapon ever used to commit murder, doesn't mean what I said about them creating a sense of empowerment isn't true.permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes ago (7 children)[]skyfail 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes agoIt is a right because it is in the bill of rights. permalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (6 children)[]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoI recognize that. That doesn't mean it's not a problem.permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes ago (5 children)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes agoI don't think it is a problem. A gun is protection, that is why it is enshrined in the 2nd amendment. There are horrible horrible shootings like this every 6 months to a year, and tons of ghetto gun violence, but I don't feel either justify removing all guns from the table. permalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes ago (4 children)[]sosuhme -1 points0 points1 point 18 minutes agoDid I say anything about removing all guns from the table? That's the issue here. You went straight on the defensive about me trying to take away your rights. Well, I'm not trying to.Also, I do think that horrible shootings and urban violence are big enough issues to show that our current laws aren't sufficient. Gun safety training and mental evaluations are the kinds of things I'm looking for.permalinksaveparent[+]Apparatii 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes ago (1 child)[]Apparatii 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes agoI've noticed that a lot of people get defensive when anyone talks about new laws/restrictions on Gun ownership.  I understand why, but it does them no good to go full-paranoia when the discussion comes up.  Most people don't want to ban guns, just tighten/tweak some regulations.permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]skyfail 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoWell unless you guys state clearly your intentions, how is anyone supposed to know? permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail -2 points-1 points0 points 14 minutes ago (1 child)[]skyfail -2 points-1 points0 points 14 minutes agoDid I say anything about removing all guns from the table? That's the issue here. You went straight on the defensive about me trying to take away your rights. Well, I'm not trying to.You said "That doesn't mean it's not a problem" about the 2nd amendment. Clarify your statements instead of doing this pussy footing, fake moderate double speak. Gun safety training I'm fairly certain the guys doing the shooting know what a gun does and how it works and how to safely use it. They choose not to. and mental evaluations Will these catch everyone? permalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoI didn't do any double speak. It's not my fault you weren't reading what I said. I said, it should be a privilege. Obviously, we are already willing to take the right to own guns away from some people, so in that sense, it's status as a unimpeachable right has already been broken.I meant that gun safety training should be mandatory in order to own a gun.No, it won't catch everyone, but how can it hurt?permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
