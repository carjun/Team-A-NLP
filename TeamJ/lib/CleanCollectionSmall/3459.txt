The motive remains murky, but that hasnt stopped the intense speculation.CLICK HERE TO SIGN THE DAILY NEWS ONLINE PETITION TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONSRichard Flashman, a pastor at Beacon Hill Evangelical Free Church in nearby Monroe, was forced to put out a statement after his son told FoxNews.com that Lanzas mother, Nancy, wanted to put him in a psychiatric facility.Ive just spoken to Josh, Flashman said of his son, according to The Journal News. As the Fox News article indicates, the information Josh spoke to them about was hearsay and not confirmed. I suggest you do not run with the story. I am perplexed why Fox would run with it in the first place.PRESIDENT OBAMA 'ACTIVELY' SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO REINSTATE AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BANSome of the families of Sandy Hook Elementary School, where the shooting took place, are members of Beacon Hill. Joshua Flashman told FoxNews.com that he heard Nancy Lanza had volunteered at the school for several years, and her son may have believed she loved the school more than she loved him.From what I've been told, Adam was aware of her petitioning the court for conservatorship and (her) plans to have him committed," Joshua Flashman claimed. "Adam was apparently very upset about this. He thought she just wanted to send him away. From what I understand, he was really, really angry. I think this could have been it, what set him off.Richard Flashman said that he wasnt the source of the information, although two state troopers had arrived at the church to take a statement, according to The Journal News.State police have said that Adam Lanza had no connection to the school, and school officials disputed an early report that his mother had worked there.No one has heard of her, Lillian Bittman, who served on the local school board until 2011, told The Wall Street Journal last Friday.

So far, no letters or diaries by the killer have emerged, The Associated Press said.A home computer was found smashed, according to reports, and an FBI forensics team is trying to determine if they can still retrieve data from the hard drive.Experts told the Daily News that it could take a while before investigators sift through all the electronic evidence.ABC NewsNancy Lanza, 52, was killed by her son, Adam Lanza, right before his shooting spree at a local elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Meanwhile, new reports have emerged about the enigma that was Adam Lanza, who has been described by former classmates as intelligent but distant. His parents divorced when he was 17.Hair stylist Bob Skuba said Nancy Lanza would take her son to get a haircut at his family-owned shop, Robert Anthony's Hair Salon, beginning when he was age 12 and over the next five years.Skuba told CNN that Adam Lanza would sit with his head down and never made eye contact.
