"Any of these neighbourhoods could be our own," Mr Obama said in his weekly radio address to the nation, "So we have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."Mr Obama did not provided details of how he would tackle one of America's most divisive and intractable political issues in the light of the shootings, but gun control advocates called for the Sandy Hook shootings to be a watershed moment on the issue.Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York and a long-time prominent advocate of gun control, led the way, saying that the warm words  however heartfelt - that have always followed such tragedies were no longer sufficient."Calling for 'meaningful action' is not enough," he said after Mr Obama had made his at-times tearful address to the nation in the immediate wake of the shootings on Friday, "We need immediate action."We have heard all the rhetoric before. What we have not seen is leadership - not from the White House and not from Congress." Proponents on the Left of stricter gun control, particularly on assault weapons, accuse Mr Obama of political cowardice on an issue, failing to take action despite the string of recent tragedies, including the January 2011 shooting of the Democrat Congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, in Arizona.Related ArticlesNewtown massacre: suspected gunman was 'smart but shy nerd'15 Dec 2012'The worst day in Newtown's history'15 Dec 2012Teachers sacrificed themselves to save pupils15 Dec 2012A pop and the slaughter had begun14 Dec 2012Police: Gunman forced his way into school15 Dec 2012White House vigil held for Connecticut victims15 Dec 2012However leading Democrats said their patience had expired yesterday, with Carolyn McCarthy, the New York Congresswoman and leading voice on gun control warning the White House that "the gloves are off" if President Obama fails to act on the issue this time around.Democrats studiously avoided the gun issue in this year's general election campaign for fear of alienating voters in key swing states like Florida, Ohio and Virginia where the "right to bear arms" is jealously guarded and government interference detested.As he called for action, Mr Obama, who has expressed his own preference for an assault weapon ban, reminded voters of the growing litany of mass shooting incidents, often committed by young men with easy access to firearms."As a nation, we have endured far too many of these tragedies in the last few years. An elementary school in Newtown. A shopping mall in Oregon. A house of worship in Wisconsin. A movie theatre in Colorado. Countless street corners in places like Chicago and Philadelphia," he said.Republicans, the traditionally pro-gun party, cancelled their own Saturday morning radio address in deference to the victims of the shooting, said John Boehner, the House Speaker, "so that President Obama can speak for the entire nation at this time of mourning." "I join the president - and all Americans - in sending prayers and condolences to the victims' loved ones," he added.Hours before Mr Obama delivered his radio address, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence had held a candlelit vigil outside the White House, with some of those attending chanting "Today is the day" to take steps to curb gun violence.Their message was echoed by Frank DeAngelis, the principal of Colorado's Columbine High School, where 15 people were killed in another gun massacre in 1999, warning that the Sandy Hook shooting provided yet another reminder, if it were needed, of how little has changed."It's a reminder of how vulnerable we are as a society," Mr DeAngelis said, "As a society we have to come together, we have to stop these senseless deaths."The National Rifle Association, by far the most powerful gun lobby group in America, followed its usual course of action after mass-shootings, by refusing to comment while the emotional temperature remained so high, and the wounds so raw."Until the facts are thoroughly known, the NRA will not have any comment," said the group, which on Friday quietly rescheduled a live "webchat" with a pro-gun country music rapper, Colt Ford.The NRA, which has some four million members, has spent a total of nearly $20m dollars lobbying for gun rights this year, paying both advertising campaigns and direct federal lobbying in Washington, according to Open Secrets, a lobbyists tracking organisation.The success of pro-gun lobby groups could be seen during the US election where Democrats avoided the issue, even though public opinion surveys shows an increased support for tighter restrictions on guns at a national level.Despite this, many Democrats, including Mr Obama, have remained wary of pursuing a debate which was widely blamed for heavy defeats in the 1994 mid-term elections after the then President Bill Clinton forced through a contentious ban on assault weapons.That ban lapsed in 2004  something that Mr Obama described as a "scandal" in his own Senate election campaign of that year  but since taking office has conspicuously failed to address the issue, to the fury of many on the left.Such was the contentiousness of the issue that in 2009, when the new administration's attorney general Eric Holder mentioned Mr Obama was supportive of a new assault weapon ban, his then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel reportedly told him to "shut the f*** up" about guns, according to Politico.When asked about the issue of reviving the assault weapon ban in the televised presidential debate in Long Island earlier this year, Mr Obama sat very gingerly on the fence, arguing for what he called a "comprehensive strategy" that focused on greater pre-emptive community support for potential killers.While saying that he shared the questioner's belief that "weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theatres don't belong on our streets" Mr Obama said that legislation or new rules could only form part of any solution."Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill," he said, "But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur."It remains to be seen whether Mr Obama, a second-term President recently elected and with mid-terms still two years away, will choose to duck the issue again this time around.However Congresswoman McCarthy, the gun control advocate, hinted at the battles ahead, revealing that even before the Connecticut shootings, she had already promised the White House that she planned a public campaign to "embarrass" them into action now that the election had passed."I was just giving the White House a heads up that the gloves are off on my side and I was going to do everything I possibly could," she told Politico, "If that meant embarrassing everybody, that's what I would do."
