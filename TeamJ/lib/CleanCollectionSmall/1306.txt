Paul Vance also told CBS News that all of the bodies have now been removed from the school, which is still considered a crime scene.Authorities did take Lanzas older brother, 24-year-old Ryan, into custody after the shooting.The older Lanza brother was first thought to be the shooter in the event, but sources say shooter Adam Lanza may have stolen Ryans identification.Ryan Lanza in not believed to have been a part of the shooting, CBS News says.But Lt. Vance told the media Saturday morning that lots of evidence recovered at the scene of the shooting and Lanzas mothers home would help paint a more complete picture of the motive for the massacre.Meanwhile, the elementary schools principal, Dawn Hochsprung, who was among those killed by Lanza, is being hailed as a hero after reports of her noble efforts to try to stop the shooter.The Associated Press reports that Hochsprung was killed as she lunged toward Lanza in an effort to stop him.It also reports that Newtown Council Chairman Jeff Capeci said From what we know, its hard to classify her as anything else.(TM and  Copyright 2011 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
