I have a 6 year old...we fussed this morning before I dropped her off for not listening...if something were to happen to her like this I would never be able to forget it.  I just want to go pick her up now and hold her.permalinksaveparent[+]AlwaysInTheMiddle 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]AlwaysInTheMiddle 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoThis.

I also hope that they don't hear or know about this, and that if they do I can somehow make them feel safe. permalinksaveparent[+]j-c-s 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes ago (1 child)[]j-c-s 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes agoI think they need to be told... I just haven't figured out how yet.And those poor PARENTS!!! They sent their babies to school today...   permalinksaveparent[+]MyNewNewUserName 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]MyNewNewUserName 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoHow old are your children? Mine are 9 and 11. We won't be watching the news tonight. We live in Colorado, and when the Jessica Ridgeway kidnapping and murder happened, we had family discussions about it. I thought it was important because they needed to be educated about how to be safe. There's no lesson for them here... there is nothing they need to know from this to keep themselves safe. No child in that building could have done anything to save his or her life. I still have some time to be the gatekeeper of their reality. permalinksaveparent[+]Zarile 0 points1 point2 points 19 minutes ago (1 child)[]Zarile 0 points1 point2 points 19 minutes agoI work with my wife. She came over to my desk and said "I think we need to leave early, go pick up our daughter"....as much as I know she is probably safe, a large part of me wants to do exactly that.permalinksaveparent[+]j-c-s 0 points1 point2 points 17 minutes ago (0 children)[]j-c-s 0 points1 point2 points 17 minutes agoBut then how do you send her to school on Monday?

When less than 100 people die from gun related mass murder per year in the US, but this year the highway deaths hit a 6 year low at over 32,000.  I suspect you are just an anti-gun nut pushing your agenda.permalinksaveparent[+]stinky-weaselteats 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (0 children)[]stinky-weaselteats 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoI work in a public elementary school and have this on my mind every day of the week. permalinksaveparent[+]built_to_elvis  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]built_to_elvis -19 points-18 points-17 points 1 hour agoAs a person who has read your comment, I can confirm that I have read your comment.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
