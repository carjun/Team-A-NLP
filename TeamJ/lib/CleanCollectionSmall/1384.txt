The 20 children and 6 adults killed were all shot more than once.According to the New York Times, the states chief medical examiner, H. Wayne Carver II, said the victims had bullet wounds all over, all over.This is probably the worst I have seen or the worst that I know of any of my colleagues having seen, Carver, who is 60 and has been Connecticuts chief medical examiner since 1989, told reporters.As law enforcement officials piece together details of the unthinkable events inside Sandy Hook elementary school, stories of immense bravery have emerged. Via the AP:After gunman Adam Lanza broke through the school door, gun blazing, school psychologist Mary Sherlach and principal Dawn Hochsprung ran toward him, Robinson said. Hochsprung died while lunging at the gunman, officials said Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher, reportedly hid some students in a bathroom or closet and died trying to shield them from bullets, a cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told ABC News. Those who knew Soto said they werent surprised Teacher Theodore Varga said that as gunfire echoed through the school, a custodian ran around, warning people. He appears to have survived; all the adults killed were women Clerk Maryann Jacob was working with a group of 18 fourth-graders in the library when the shooting broke out. She herded the children into a classroom in the library, but then realized the door wouldnt lock. They crawled across the room into a storage space, locked the door and barricaded it with a filing cabinet. There happened to be materials for coloring, she said, so we set them up with paper and crayons.Meanwhile, as the hows of the massacre become clear, the whys continue to elude investigators, the Newtown community and a nation in shock.
