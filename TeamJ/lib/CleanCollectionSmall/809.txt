They revisited the Voyager episode, but got a special effects budget and went on a trip. Still, they examined some good sci-fi topics: are people just bio machines or something more, what is next after perfect knowledge , and touched on machine lifeforms (that interaction could have created the Borg in my opinion).permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe police officer that barged into a student's dorm from the youtube video "i hate cops" is now fired.  by  Inffectedin  news[+]mens_libertina 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]mens_libertina 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoYeah, It's sad.

There are many neocons, for example, who claim to champion the constitution and rule of law, but when a situation like this occurs, they favor the cops over constitutional rights.

I don't think there was any mention of the legal impact, only that the kid provoked the incident with obscenity and insults.

This adult is trying to humiliate a kid, and the response should be to point out what a creeper That would make him.Personally, let the kid enjoy a vibrator. If it were a big dildo he were using, still fine. The awkwardness is that this person somehow thinks the tool is sexual, and not how it's used.permalinksavecontextfull commentsKids These Days  by  Quail666in  funny[+]mens_libertina 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mens_libertina 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoImagine where she uses it when you can't see. :-)permalinksavecontextfull commentsBabes in Fairyland: An essay comparing Waldorf experience to typical public school experience  by  dgodonin  education[+]mens_libertina 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mens_libertina 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoIs that a problem with her, or a criticism of the school's methods?permalinksavecontextfull commentsFelt like a boss at the gym today!  by  doggyafuerain  xxfitness[+]mens_libertina 15 points16 points17 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mens_libertina 15 points16 points17 points 2 days agodumbbells start at 5 and 10 pounds.

Only that the guy was a prick, which he was. Given the camera, it seems he was provoking an incident, and the cops failed to follow their training. On the other hand, maybe this kid is a clueless prick and doesn't know why everyone is always against him and thinks he's a victim, so he set up the video "just in case".permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe police officer that barged into a student's dorm from the youtube video "i hate cops" is now fired.  by  Inffectedin  news[+]mens_libertina 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]mens_libertina 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoI was with you until "if he was doing nothing wrong...".
