Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]drtide4 -1 points0 points1 point 2 hours ago (0 children)[]drtide4 -1 points0 points1 point 2 hours agoThis is so disturbing. I try to have a mental image of this happening to me as an adolescent in school and I can't really even fathom the scenario. If I were in the shoes of one of these kids, I don't think returning to school would ever be possible again. I'd be emotionally scarred for the remainder of my life. Home-school me or GTFO. permalinksavecontextfull comments2001Referee rejects Kris Humphries much like Kim Kardashian did.

Who other than my ex-girlfriend is the leading car directly across from me at said red light. It was one of the most intense stare-downs I've ever been associated with. Then a casual wave when we passed through the intersection. permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama Keeps Promise to Send first-time nonviolent drug offenders to rehab over jail  by  wang-bangerin  politics[+]drtide4 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]drtide4 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoHave you ever sucked dick for marijuana? permalinksavecontextfull comments5012While discussing hitting the slopes, my friend says, "We should go..."

Found a highlighter, a black light, and a great way to spend my trip  by  atrotskisin  trees[+]drtide4 5 points6 points7 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]drtide4 5 points6 points7 points 16 days agoGood advice indeed. Have a level head going into the whole trip. Any doubt or tendencies to second-guess the trip will make matters worse. Also, from my standpoint, I prefer to not have my cell phone on me, or if it's on me it better be off. I need to cut myself out from the rest of the world while going into it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy grandma left me a voicemail on my birthday in 2008. She passed away 2 months later. I still have the voicemail and I listen to it from time to time. I'd like to secure it somehow. It's something I want to have forever. Can someone explain how I can do this?  by  throw-thisin  AskReddit[+]drtide4 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]drtide4 0 points1 point2 points 16 days agoThis is somewhat relevant, but I still have numbers in my cell phone contacts list of people dear to me who have passed away. Occasionally, when I'm sifting through my contacts, I'll come across one of these people and I can't help but put a little smile on my face. Does anyone else keep numbers of the deceased? I can't find it in me to delete it for some reason. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter placing the order in 2009, my father's Tesla Motors - Model S is finally here!!
