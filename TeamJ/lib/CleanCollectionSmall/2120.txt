Furthermore the mass shooting are more of a recent thing. Those who graduated in the 1950's will tell you that in the fall it was not uncommon for students to bring shotguns and rifles to school (overtly) so that they could just go hunting right after school.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I have some older coworkers who would bring their rifles with them to school (overtly and everyone was ok with that), and then go bird hunting in the afternoon. Law abiding people will abide by the law. Malevolent people will be malevolent. If these people didn't have guns, they'd use explosives or something else.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Most deep v boats are meant to be fished by jigging from a chair, nice to see a model that can handle some chop but still has casting platforms.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]vahntitrio 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]vahntitrio 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoFertilizing grass in most places is a scam. Before my house was built the ground it was built on was a forest. Without any fertilizer that dirt supported a hell of a lot more biomass than my lawn is. You don't need it. That's why lakes are now so contaminated with weeds and algae: because all your fertilizer washed in there. Draw a line from the gulf of Mexico to Montana. If you live east of that line, 95% of all soil has plentiful nutrients. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]vahntitrio -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]vahntitrio -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day agoWhat Tom Brady has is an offensive line that allows him all day until he can make the exact throw he wants.

I will take what he said further. With electronics, you cannot make them fail after x amount of time. If you go to something with a lower MTBF, you increase the failures at all times - and thus you will see a lot more warranty claims. No company wants a reputation for having poor part.Higher failure rates are due to higher complexity and higher power. If I build a circuit board that has 1 million parts all expected to last 1 million hours, then I can expect that board I built to last 1 hour. Now let's say I build a phone that should last 5 years. The new model has a quad core processor instead of dual core. The components all last just as long, but the new phone runs 10c hotter. The expected life of the new phone would only be 2.5 to 3 years.That's just the way things are. The simplest circuit board I've seen over the past 3 years had 53 components on it. That means best case scenario, that board will last 1/53 as long as the components on the board are rated. Now imagine what happens with boards with hundreds or thousands of components. And electrolytic capacitors, you need them in most designs but damn are they unreliable.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhich bait to use?  by  trALErunin  Fishing[+]vahntitrio 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]vahntitrio 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIce fishing though you are really limited to jigging plastics, and there are some days when that flat out doesn't work. Op should grab some small jigs and a variety of plastics. But if those don't work waxies and minnows are usually the best option.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the best fishing boat ever built?  by  Columbianoin  Fishing[+]vahntitrio 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]vahntitrio 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI want one of those new Skeeter MX1825 to fish the lakes around here.

Oil patterns do change a lot week to week though. I was 2 boards left and a full mph faster (i prefer to speed up as opposed to throw a bigger swing) than I was the week before.
