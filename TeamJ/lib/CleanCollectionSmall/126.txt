In one more affront to the community, a death threat that proved unfounded marred a midday church service, forcing worshipers to evacuate.        Around dusk, President Obama arrived in Newtown and met with families of the victims and first responders. Later, at an interfaith service, he gave a powerful address which, while it stopped short of an explicit call for new gun controls, seemed to hint strongly at fresh efforts. Mr. Obama spoke of the four shooting massacres during his presidency and promised to "use whatever power this office holds," to prevent another. Condolences flowed into Newtown from around the world. When he made his customary Sunday appearance at the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI expressed his sorrow and said he was praying for the families of victims.        The coming days are not likely to become any easier for the pained families. Relatives began to claim the bodies of the dead, and on Monday the first group of funerals  of three 6-year-old children  are to be held. Two are to be in Newtown and the third in nearby Fairfield.        Though there has been no doubt about the killer, for the first time since the attack at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, the Connecticut State Police officially confirmed his identity as Adam Lanza, 20. The police said Mr. Lanza shot himself with a handgun after taking the lives of 26 other people, 20 of them first-grade students, at the school.        The police did not say where Nancy Lanza, 52, the gunmans mother, was in her house when she was shot or what weapon had been used.        But they did give the specifics of the arsenal that her son brought to the school and gave a sense of the vast quantity of ammunition that he had. Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, said most of the shots were fired from a .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic carbine, a military-style assault weapon. Mr. Lanza was also carrying two semiautomatic pistols, a 10-millimeter Glock and a 9-millimeter Sig Sauer. A shotgun was found in the car.        The guns were legally acquired and registered by Ms. Lanza, who had sometimes taken her son to shooting ranges, according to law enforcement officials and her friends. Mr. Lanza, who former classmates said had had a developmental disorder, lived with his mother.        While Lieutenant Vance said he did not yet know how many bullets had been fired, he did say investigators recovered numerous empty 30-round magazines for the Bushmaster rifle. The .223-caliber bullet is a small, high-velocity round that has been used by Western military forces for decades, in part because it inflicts devastating wounds.        Some of the bullets fired inside the school, according to a law enforcement official, penetrated the glass windows of the classrooms and went into vehicles in the parking lot.        In addition to multiple high-capacity magazines for the rifle, Lieutenant Vance said the gunman had brought a number of magazines for both pistols.        Collectively, he said, there were hundreds of unfired bullets.        Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut said Mr. Lanza had killed himself as police officers entered the school, suggesting that he was prepared to take more lives had they not arrived.        We surmise that it was during the second classroom episode that he heard responders coming and apparently, at that, decided to take his own life, Mr. Malloy said on ABCs This Week.        Officials did not make any public statements about Mr. Lanzas motivation.        A post-mortem examination of Mr. Lanza and his mother has been completed, according to a statement from Connecticut State Police. A spokesman for the state medical examiners office said late Sunday that nobody had yet come forward to claim their bodies.
