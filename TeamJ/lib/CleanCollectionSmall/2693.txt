Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes agoTrue. Banning guns in schools [though] carries a negative effect. Perhaps we should just make schools crazy-free zones instead of gun-free zones. Make crazy illegal. That'll stop them from going into the schools with their weapons.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Gadsden 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoYet the places you're most likely to be murdered are the gun-free zones of America.The nation was much more obsessed, guns were much more readily available, and ammo was cheaper years ago when kids could drive their cars to school with their guns hanging in the back windows of their pickup trucks w/o everyone having a shit fit, yet the shootings didn't really happen.Plus you're ignoring the fact that in the last few years gun sales have been through the roof, setting records, and the crime/murder rates have been dropping.I think the real problem here is the obsession with getting the bigger story [headlines].permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Or those two students from just walking in with them.Someone watches too many movies; If you think someone is going to take a gun from a teacher and mow down everyone in the lunch room. lmao. Guns don't actually have unlimited supplies of ammo.What's stupid is a building full of defenseless kids and a law that prohibits anyone from protecting them from people who will break those laws.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I have to work at several schools and it totally fucking boils my blood that I'm made to be more afraid of "the law" than monsters like this. I'm to leave my gun in the car and disarm myself so people like this can have an easy task of killing unarmed people.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAhh... TV commercials to get quieter starting Thursday - The FCC encourages viewers to report any rogue ads to 1-888-TELL-FCC (1-888-225-5322)  by  VicinSeain  usa[+]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoCommercials got really fucking quiet for me about 5 years ago when I gave up on television.

Since they spend so poorly in government it probably costs them $20 to give someone $1.If it were true about benefits being higher than income, I'd gladly do what I could to go on permanent vacation and play DayZ all damn day. Anything I can do to help the system collapse.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow I get ready to have sex...  by  Fattrainin  WTF[+]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoI bet the kids love it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHeli's are scary!

That's why our troops are basically acting as a police force now. You don't have to shoot the tanks. It's the people that command the tanks that have to live here, among a few million people just waiting for a chance to get them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJudge Napolitano: Who will keep us safe from them?

Planning it would be the most difficult hurdle.Perhaps one day their house of cards will collapse on itself, or they'll piss off enough people that will want to defend themselves from this fake liberty.When/if the day comes that that happens all the tanks and smart bombs in the world won't be enough for the government to hide behind from the millions of possible assassins around every corner. They wouldn't dare to move.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJudge Napolitano: Who will keep us safe from them?

But detectors don't scan for every known virus in real time, so things are bound to get past them now and then.Malwarebytes is a good clean up utility to have for when that happens.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's the best free anti-malware program?  by  hero0fwarin  techsupport[+]Gadsden 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoActually, there was some recent documentation that put it at the lowest protection rate too. It's pretty horrible actually.Avast was the best of the free ones. Bitdefender was the best overall.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShots fired in a mall outside Portland, OR. Shooter still on the loose.  by  zyamadain  news[+]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI'm guessing that you haven't had the opportunity to learn about and use them. Everyone I know with that viewpoint has drawn conclusions without being educated on the subject, or the people who carry.You might be surprised to find out just how anal most of us are about gun safety, and that it's our loathing of violent crime that often inspires us to choose to arm ourselves.If my carrying a gun scares you then you must really be paranoid about criminals carrying them, and should probably get one of your own ;)permalinksavecontextfull commentsAt least 26,000 children will miss school today because their teachers called in sick or took a vacation day to protest proposed right-to-work legislation, which is expected to pass today.  by  BattlestarPotemkinin  Libertarian[+]Gadsden 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoExcept teachers are allowed to be responsible for as many kids as they see fit stuffing into a single room.

Shooter still on the loose.  by  zyamadain  news[+]Gadsden 9 points10 points11 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 9 points10 points11 points 2 days agoYeah, the key phrase there is "feel like". I think we like to fool ourselves into thinking we have control over anything.I'm 40, and I've been involved in one car accident; I was rear-ended by a dude in a huge pickup truck who was busy looking at striking nurses.I was a careful driver. I even saw it coming. Traffic stopped suddenly in front of me and I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the truck coming up too fast, then the tires screeching. The only action I could have taken to avoid getting plowed into was to run over the nurses striking on the sidewalk.Thankfully, I was in a suburban with a trailer hitch installed. I probably had mild whiplash, but my vehicle sustained no damage, and his was pretty much destroyed.I guess, you could say that I was inadvertently prepared for the situation of being rear-ended.When it comes to a possibility of violence, I choose to be prepared by being armed at all times. I think of the .45 I carry as a seat-belt. Something I couldn't imagine being stupid enough not to strap myself with, but hope I never actually have to test it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI found this while digging through my screenshot folder. I'm always amazed at how accurate my friend is with sniper rifles.  by  Gilatarin  dayz[+]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Gadsden 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoAccuracy is not required. That's a problem with ArmA/DayZ; That it's too easy to snipe.I couldn't care less when playing against AI's. But for PvP, sniping is far too easy. The victim has to deal with accurate consequences for being hit, but the sender just sets distance points and clicks. Not at all a fair setup.To be fair, almost every game with sniping suffers from this. :(I prefer the ACE mod for sniping realism, and to give 'targets' a more realistic chance to not be hit at 800m+.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
