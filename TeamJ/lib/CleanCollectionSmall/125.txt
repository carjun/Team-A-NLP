The bodies of most of the children killed in the morning remained inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Friday evening, along with the bodies of six adults and the gunman himself, Connecticut State Police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance told "CBS Evening News" anchor Scott Pelley.  47 PhotosConnecticut elementary school shooting  As SWAT teams surrounded the school, state troopers moved students to safety. Some children were told to close their eyes to protect them from seeing the carnage. The police eventually found the gunman dead from a self-inflicted wound, the police said.  Among the dead was the school's principal, Dawn Hocksprung. One teacher was wounded but survived. The attack, coming less than two weeks before Christmas, was the nation's second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the Virginia Tech massacre that left 33 people dead in 2007.  "This is most definitely the worst thing that we have experienced in town - tragic," Newtown police Lt. George Sinko told reporters.  "Evil visited this community today," Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy told reporters at a news conference attended by Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen.-elect Chris Murphy, who represent the state.

Law enforcement sources had earlier told CBS News that the gunman was Ryan Lanza, Adam Lanza's older brother.

As of Friday evening, Ryan Lanza was not considered a suspect, CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reports.  Police shed no light on the motive for the attack. The gunman, Adam Lanza, was believed to suffer from a personality disorder and lived with his mother, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to discuss it. Law enforcement officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that Lanza fatally shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, then drove to the school in her car with at least three guns, including a high-powered rifle that he apparently left in the back of the vehicle, and shot up two classrooms around 9:30 a.m. The New York Times reported that Lanza wore combat gear.

Eighteen children died at the school, some as young as 5. Two more died after being transported to area hospitals, he said.  A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said investigators believe Lanza attended the school several years ago but appeared to have no recent connection to the place. Officials worry about copycat shootings  At least one parent said Lanza's mother was a substitute teacher there. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the law enforcement official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.  The school teaches about 700 students between kindergarten and fourth grade.  On Friday night, hundreds of people packed a Newtown church and stood outside in a vigil for the victims. People held hands, lit candles and sang "Silent Night" at St. Rose of Lima church.  At the vigil, the priest said the altar holds 26 candles, all of which were lit in memory of the victims. Lyrics of the last hymn of the ceremony rang out: "I will raise him up on eagle's wings."  The parish priest, Robert Weiss, said he spent much of Friday with victims of the families but he could not give them any answers about what happened.  David Connors, the father of three triplets at the school, said at a vigil that his children were taken into a closet during the lockdown.  "My son said he did hear some gunshots, as many as 10," he said. "The questions are starting to come out. `Are we safe? Is the bad guy gone?"' Adam Lanza and his mother lived in a well-to-do part of Newtown where neighbors are doctors or hold white-collar positions at companies such as General Electric, Pepsi and IBM.At least three guns were found  a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols, inside the school, and a .223-caliber rifle in the back of a car, authorities said. A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said some of the guns used in the attack may have belonged to Lanza's family. His mother had legally registered four weapons, his father two.  Authorities also recovered three other guns  a Henry repeating rifle, an Enfield rifle and a shotgun. It was not clear exactly where those weapons were found.   President Obama promised action to prevent such tragedies again but did not say what that would be.  "Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost," an emotional Mr. Obama said Friday afternoon in a statement delivered from the White House briefing room.  "Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors, as well," said Mr. Obama. "For, as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain."  White House spokesman Jay Carney said Mr. Obama was informed of the shooting at 10:30 a.m. ET by homeland security adviser John Brennan.  A dispatcher at the Newtown Volunteer Ambulance Corps said a teacher had been shot in the foot and taken to Danbury Hospital.       no previous page     next    1/2    2012 CBS Interactive Inc.

And at the end of the day the Principal can Disable the Scanner so they want work if kids trys to come back into the school after school hours.

The media is trying to manipulate the truth!     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  Mackenzie_Walston says: It's extremely hard to begin to understand how someone could possibly walk into a an elementary school and start shooting anyone in their path, especially the children. I know a lot of people think that being able to have a licence for a gun is a dangerous thing, but our right to bear arms is what protects us. Making hand guns illegal won't solve the problem. Does having drugs illegal stop people from getting their hands on it and putting it to use? No, it doesn't. Making guns illegal will pose a threat to possibly allowing some insanely evil people having the upper hand. How safe will you feel knowing that? The gun isn't what killed those innocent children. It was the person behind it. President Obama was against allowing citizens to legally own guns, and I'm afraid that he will use these recent tragedies as an example of why they should be banned. We as a nation need to look at the big picture here and put our foot down. The Second Amendment is there for a reason. Let's get people to understand that this is the exact reason we need that right. We can't back down on this issue. Maybe if one of the people of authority at Sandy Hook Elementary had a firearm, the lives of those children and adults would have been spared.     reply        JoniHandcock replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  There is no understanding. His brain is not intelligent as they say, it's mush and garbage brains. He is sick and sick that's it. People like this belong in isolation or in prison if they are not descent and good nice people to others. I don't care about your disability. You are mean then that's your heart. idiot.            JoniHandcock replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Those who are truly evil don't even believe in good or evil. They are deceived it doesn't exist. What they do doesn't matter to anybody is what they think, not to any God. It's the way of satan. He likes if you don't believe in him. He is also nuts. It's chaos. We are going to have to stand up as strong believers. Get your bullets and pray to God that your shot is accurate when somebody attacks you. They cannot be tolerated. We are the strong ones here. We are the good people. We are not afraid to fight back and make a safe place to live. And, the evil will be intimidated.               linkicon reporticon emailicon  walter63a says: What about the AR-Bushmaster rifle that he apparently left in the back of the vehicle?

Next time you shoot this derelict or his kind in the painful places of the body and make him suffer before he dies. You don't let him kill a principal and kids. You shoot him because you are an armed citizen. He threatens you? He goes to jail. He shoots at you in the office? You kill him fast. That's simple way to solve this in America. We were a frontier only 235 years ago. Deflate your big Ego's. This is nothing new on this land tis of thee. We got plenty of crazy nuts around here and they are allowed to get away with murder.

Having mandatory trigger lock laws on guns prevents immediate violent crime and small kids from injuring themselves playing with guns. It would make it some what harder for someone to steal a gun and sell it. Good gun trigger locks would force the "person" to break the trigger to get the lock off without a key. A small simple solution that may help fix SOME of the gun problems....without fighting the right to bare arms people.     reply        seabass6251 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  All new guns come with trigger locks now. Locks can be picked very easy. No need to break the trigger, as you claim, to get a lock off. Now, the real kicker is, how could you ever possibly enforce this absurdity?            JoniHandcock replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  The fact is we need more guns in schools. When a mean crazy person goes there shoot him dead and set a good example. Use the guns for defense and for love, like traditional America. Be like Clint Eastwood not like jellyfish to hide. Protect the kids. And, teachers are upstanding they need to have permits to carry also, at least 2 or 3 in the schools. Even Pilots on airlines always had their own gun to protect the passengers. The one who is responsible for lives of kids/ people gets the gun. It's Teacher and Pilot. That's the only way to stop the modern jessy james who is killer. And, about our history. It's longer than 50 years we have crazies in America who murder innocent people. In fact war crimes against many native kids.
