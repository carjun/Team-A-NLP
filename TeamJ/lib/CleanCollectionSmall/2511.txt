Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]m4tthu 0 points1 point2 points 48 minutes ago (0 children)[]m4tthu 0 points1 point2 points 48 minutes agoWell I haven't really gotten to talk to anyone yet, but I'll put it this way, checked into emergency for mental health issues in late November, will have an appointment with a therapist in January. I would have been able to see someone this coming monday, but can't due to the holidays.So there's a bit of a wait, but if you really really need help, you'd probably get it sooner. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

One of our other friends was wondering why we said that about him, and obviously had never heard of that joke.So we told him that our friend had been at a restaurant and ordered spaghetti. After he finished, while paying for his meal, he noticed that he had spaghetti on his shirt, and in a panic, just picked it off and put it in his pocket.He believed us.  permalinksavecontextfull comments2 Budgets, 1 Look: Skyfall - Part 2 - $ 368 vs. $1920  by  ATR1993in  malefashionadvice[+]m4tthu 3 points4 points5 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]m4tthu 3 points4 points5 points 1 month agodid he even fire his PPK in that scene? permalinksavecontextfull comments[Build Help]Building a budget PC for a friend, thoughts?  by  m4tthuin  buildapc[+]m4tthu[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]m4tthu[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoOk re-did the build acording to Mechyuske's advice, this is what I came up with.
