The debate received a big push Tuesday morning when the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP said it is seeking to sell the company that manufactures a gun used in the Sandy Hook rampage.The primary weapon in the massacre has been identified as a .223-cal. Bushmaster AR-15. Cerberus has acquired a number of companies that make guns and ammunition, including rifle maker Bushmaster Firearms International, which made the weapon used in Newtown.AlsoVideo:Newtown tragedy casts shadow on N.Y. schoolWho they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsWe have determined to immediately engage in a formal process to sell our investment in Freedom Group, Cerberus said in a statement released on Tuesday. We believe that this decision allows us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so.President Obama, who visited Newton on Sunday, has asked some of his cabinet to come up with gun control suggestions for Congress to consider. His spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday that the president will meet withlaw enforcement officials and mental health professionals in coming weeks.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a long-time advocate of tougher gun control, has stepped up his campaign, appearing on talk shows on Tuesday. On Monday he held a news conference with survivors and relatives of shootings around the country."If this doesn't do it," he asked, "what is going to?"In Washington, even gun-rights supporters have changed their position in the wake of the shooting.Never before have we seen our babies slaughtered. This never happened in America, that I can recall, ever seeing this kind of carnage, Sen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat who has earned top marks from the gun industry, said in a statement. This has changed where we go from here.The focus of gun-control efforts seem to be centered on assault-type weapons and high-capacity magazines.Do we really need that many bullets to kill a deer? Shane Miller of Newtown said as she stood near the funeralhomewhere many of the victims' services were being held. This area, with its vast forested areas, is a draw for hunters, but Miller said attitudes toward firearms needed to change.If it has to be Newtown that makes that change, I would be very pleased about it, said Miller, who has grandchildren the same age as many of the 6-year-old victims.Susman reported from Newtown, Conn., and Muskal from Los Angeles.ALSO:Oklahoma police say teen planned school massacreConnecticut governor calls for new assault weapons banNew Mexico bird rescue center threatened by lack of fundsCopyright  2012, Los Angeles Timesprevious12|  single pageComments39Comments (39)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQjustme34 at 3:09 PM December 18, 2012                Even the NRA is calling the Newton shooting a game changer. Yet the gun owners believe nothing needs to be changed. The gun owners are a LUNATIC and PARANOIA to begin with.Imalan at 3:00 PM December 18, 2012                areyou solame, the problem with people like Adam Lanza is that our culture now is all about winners and losers, and some losers react badly to having that label hung on themlbjack at 2:55 PM December 18, 2012                Hey, you gun-loving geniuses, the shooter WAS a law-abiding citizen...until he wasn't. The same for you and all your gun-loving buddies. Let's finally get something straight about you gun lovers. It's not about rights, not about protection: you don't want to give up your guns because GUNS TURN YOU ON. Plain and simple. Your insane assertions (that we need MORE guns), you phony platitudes (Guns don't kill people bla bla bla) are simply smoke screens for your nasty little fetish.Civilized, decent people have had ENOUGH of debating the likes of you. I am ready to declare war on you gun lovers. The slogan you like to throw around, "I'll give you my gun when you pry (or take) it from my cold, dead hands," suits me fine. The fewer of you left afterwards the better for the human race.The time for excuses -- A ban won't work? How the hell do you know??? -- is over.  Stop talking with the NRA and their lunatic constituency. We need to act now to control, if not ban guns!Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
