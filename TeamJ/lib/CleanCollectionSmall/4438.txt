"We're kind of in the middle of the woods. You wouldn't think of this."Photos: Shock, Tragedy at Connecticut SchoolView SlideshowNewtown Bee/ReutersConnecticut State Police led children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., after a shooting there Friday.By evening, the quaint New England town was convulsed with grief. Christmas decorations still hung in windows, but the sign in front of a liquor store on Church Hill Road said simply: "Say A Prayer." "This is most definitely the worst thing we've experienced in town," Newtown Police Lt. George Sinko said late Friday, as officials worked to identify some of the 27 fatal victims, 20 of them children. Newtown sits within commuting reach of job centers in Danbury and Hartford, and Stamford, Norwalk and Bridgeport to the south, a shield-shaped wedge packed with state parks, a forest and a scenic reserve adjoining the lake at the head of the Housatonic River. Now home to 27,000, the town was founded, like its neighbors, amid farmland in the 18th century. On Main Street, the Edmond Town Hall sits on the National Register of Historic Places and shows $2 second-run movies.Deadliest Mass ShootingsFrom University of Texas at Austin to Columbine, take a look back.View InteractiveWSJ's Alison Fox reports live from the firehouse in Newtown, Conn. where children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting have been evacuated. Photo: Twitter.com/AlisonFox. The town might be best known before this week as the first place the board game Scrabble was manufactured. Its most notorious crime, a domestic murder in the 1980s, known in Connecticut as "the wood chipper case" for the way the killer disposed of his victim.Friday's sudden spasm of unimaginable violence wrought confusion. Ms. Libero huddled with her children, 7 and 3 years old, while her husband relayed the day's ever-shifting messages, especially those who wondered if the stranger had simply arrived from some other place. Of that notion, she said, "I don't know if that's comforting or not."Joe Wasik, a 42-year-old electrician and longtime resident of the town, was relieved to find his young daughter shaken but safe, but said he and his wife struggled with how to talk to her about what had happened, and how to feel about trying to return to school life, and normalcy."It's basically like a little Vermont," Mr. Wasik said of the town where he has lived most of his life. "You have general stores, you see your friends and neighbors in town. You just never thought anything like this would happen here."Mr. Wasik said he could remember only a single killing in the past 10 years in town, and that was the result of a robbery.As he spoke, Mr. Wasik's daughter was with his wife, while he remained at the firehouse just down the driveway from Sandy Hook Elementary. He  had spent the afternoon waiting with a close friend whose child, a first-grader, was among those missing in the aftermath of the shooting. The friend had been escorted out a back door, Mr. Wasik said, and they assumed the worst."If he didn't want to talk, I'm not talking," Mr. Wasik said.Mourners and well-wishers flocked toward the firehouse near the school in the evening. Robert Morehouse, 58, of Southbury, had walked five miles to reach Newtown, with memorial candles in his backpack.Standing near his home nearby, John Thompson, 36, tried to imagine how this town would change, as others have in the wake of sudden violence."Middle schools and high schools usually have metal detectors but I don't see that in many elementary schools," he said. "Just because they're younger there doesn't mean this might not happen."Andrew Strickler and Danny Gold contributed to this article.Write to                 Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.comA version of this article appeared December 15, 2012, on page A19 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Stillness Shattered.Copyright 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
