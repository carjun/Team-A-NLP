In Obama's weekly radio address, he declared that "every parent in America has a heavy heart with hurt" and that "it is time to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this."For Obama, this is the fourth trip of his presidency to a community within the United States that was still grieving over a shooting in their area.Last summer, Obama went to Aurora, Colorado, to console with people who went to a movie theater for a midnight showing of "The Dark Night", only to have some of them wind up killed over a crazed and violent shooter that dressed up as the Joker.Not too long ago, a mall out in California experienced a crazed madman shooting up their mall. There were injuries in that incident, but investigators are calling it "a minor incident."Lanza's parents owned four guns. Two of them were registered to the mother, who was among those killed at the school, and two were registered to the father.Reporters initially reported that Adam Lanza's brother, Ryan Lanza, was the shooter. This was because Adam Lanza was carrying his brother's identification at the time of the shooting. Ryan Lanza was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.The Sandy Hook shooting was the worst K-12 (grade school) tragedy in the nation's history, surpassing the Columbine tragedy. The worst school related tragedy (with respect to all types of schools) was the Virginia Tech tragedy, which killed 33 people in 2007, including the gunman.The investigation into this matter is ongoing.Tweet0EmailPrintReport Samuel Steiner,      Philadelphia City Buzz ExaminerSamuel Steiner is the CEO of SHS Forum.
