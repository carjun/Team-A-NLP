It had been on a steady decline since 1977, which was after licensing was introduced (which I agree with). In fact most of the laws introduced in the 1995 bill were and still are generally in-effective in preventing crime.permalinksaveparent[+]sassycat69 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (6 children)[]sassycat69 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoNever, according to gun extremists. permalinksaveparent[+]herbandmargie -5 points-4 points-3 points 48 minutes ago (5 children)[]herbandmargie -5 points-4 points-3 points 48 minutes agoIt is time for focus on more armed citizens.

If you're trying to make the argument that it's equally as likely and easy I'm just going to laugh at you.Reduced circulation of guns would make it harder for people to get a hold of them.

We will never stop this kind of shit but there are steps we can take without all the rednecks having to give up their guns. We won't ever get them done because it's always "too soon" to talk about it. More senseless killing will be followed by more senseless killing.

We need to at least try more responsible gun control laws to see if they work, but it can't get pushed because as he mentioned, the political power is too strong to fight.I'm not an advocate for banning guns, just for doing more to restrict who can get their hands on one. But even that gets made to sound like a radical view point by so many, and that I find absurd and disheartening in terms of our country's view on guns.permalinksaveparent[+]vvelox 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes ago (4 children)[]vvelox 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes agoI'm not an advocate for banning guns, just for doing more to restrict who can get their hands on one.We already do, since 1968.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_Systempermalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes ago (0 children)[]sosuhme 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes agoThat's not enough.permalinksaveparent[+]scintillatingdunce 0 points1 point2 points 28 minutes ago (2 children)[]scintillatingdunce 0 points1 point2 points 28 minutes agoThat'll only work once we actually start dealing with the mentally unstable.

When you start talking about preemptively labeling a person as "possibly" mentally unstable and a danger to themselves and others, I see big brother and the system stepping in and ruining innocent peoples lives based on a hunch.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (4 children)[]charmonkie -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoI'm not sure either way, personally I don't think it would do much.  I'm pretty sure people who own guns easily and legally wake up and decide to kill people.  It's the kind of think they've thought about, thinking takes time, and time plus a desire to kill means you're willing to go out of your way to do so.  I'm not at all a psychiatrist, but that's my thinking....I do think ownership should be tracked, and you should have background checks to buy/own/carry permalinksaveparent[+]fedupwith 2 points3 points4 points 32 minutes ago (0 children)[]fedupwith 2 points3 points4 points 32 minutes agoEvery time you buy a gun from an FFL, you get a background check.permalinksaveparent[+]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 51 minutes ago (1 child)[]sosuhme 1 point2 points3 points 51 minutes agoThat's essentially what I'm advocating. However, this "I don't think it would do much" kind of stuff, doesn't really hold much weight. We won't know what the effect is until we've tried.I would also like to see mental health testing and gun safety testing before a gun could be purchased.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 1 point2 points3 points 48 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 1 point2 points3 points 48 minutes agoI'm also pro-mental health testing for gun ownership.  They do have the tiniest bit of that, you can't have been committed to a mental institution to have your concealed carry license (at least in my state).I'm not saying that since I have the opinion that 'I don't think it would do much' we should run with that.  I'm open to people talking about it, and trying to work out if it would.  That's just my no-resources stancepermalinksaveparent[+]vvelox 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes ago (0 children)[]vvelox 1 point2 points3 points 33 minutes agoyou should have background checks to buy/own/carry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_Systempermalinksaveparent[+]I3addog -1 points0 points1 point 58 minutes ago (7 children)[]I3addog -1 points0 points1 point 58 minutes agoWill we stop it all, Nope. Can we do a better job of getting guns out of the hands of assholes, we sure can. We have laws against drunk driving but it still takes place so I suppose we should just say fuck it then. We have laws about wearing seat belts but people still die in car crashes so fuck it then. Forty percent of guns sold are done so without a single background check but we can't talk about fixing it because the fucking NRA will destroy any politicians that do. Fuck it, keep defending the rights of guns owners to do what ever the fuck they want and just ignore the poor fuckers getting gunned down while going to class. It's a small price to pay so Jethro can go kill shit in the woods on the weekends.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 2 points3 points4 points 50 minutes ago (2 children)[]charmonkie 2 points3 points4 points 50 minutes agoSo, once again you're assuming only rednecks want guns.....Banning guns to stop shootings like this is like saying we should ban alcohol to stop drunk driving.  Except not really because no one plans days in advance to go on a drunk driving spree (I think).  Regulation would be like saying all cars should have breathalyzer-starters (even though there are work-arounds and would be for gun likely) (although I'm pro regulation)As long as you're blindly labeling gun advocates you're going to sound uneducatedpermalinksaveparent[+]I3addog -2 points-1 points0 points 49 minutes ago (1 child)[]I3addog -2 points-1 points0 points 49 minutes agoDid I say ban them ?

Nearly all sales go through NICS, as has been required since 1968. The only ones that don't are individual to individual sales, which pale in comparison to those that go through a FFL. And a increasing number of states do requires private sales to through a FFL as well.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_SystemIt's a small price to pay so Jethro can go kill shit in the woods on the weekends.Yay! Regionalism. You are using the name Jethro to portray all gun owners as rural rednecks and social conservatives. This is actually false. Firearm ownership is a extremely liberal item of which has become increasingly popular among the Democrats and urban populace as well.permalinksaveparent[+]I3addog -1 points0 points1 point 36 minutes ago (0 children)[]I3addog -1 points0 points1 point 36 minutes agoGoogle " guns sold without background checks"permalinksaveparent[+]hydrogenous -2 points-1 points0 points 32 minutes ago (1 child)[]hydrogenous -2 points-1 points0 points 32 minutes agoThat Bloomberg 40% stat is very weak.

I'm not sure anyone was saying we can't talk about gun control because it's 'too soon'.The problem is assuming that restricting guns would fix the problem of people being violent.  If I could be convinced gun control would stop any future school shooting I'd be behind it 100%permalinksaveparent[+]watitdo 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour ago*(6 children)[]watitdo 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour ago*I guess you didn't hear about the Portland Mall Shooting that happened this Tuesday. Or the Sikh shooting that happened a couple of weeks after the Aurora shooting.If the reports end up to be true, this will be the most deadly grade school shooting in US history. Yes, it is bigger than Columbine. And it is an elementary school. Kindergartners are dead. You may not think that more gun control could prevent things like this from happening in the future, and that is a valid opinion. But we have to discuss this. Enough of this too soon bullshit (p.s. if you want to find it, read more of this thread, it's there).permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie -3 points-2 points-1 points 58 minutes ago (5 children)[]charmonkie -3 points-2 points-1 points 58 minutes agoI did, but there's still a 4 month gap between the Sikh and the Portland shooting.  I'm open to people talking about if gun control is the right thing to do, but passing laws based on theory is a bad movepermalinksaveparent[+]watitdo 3 points4 points5 points 54 minutes ago (4 children)[]watitdo 3 points4 points5 points 54 minutes agoWe're not going to pass gun control laws tomorrow, don't be absurd. I'm just trying to fight the idea that it will be "too soon" to talk about these issues tomorrow out of respect. When 5 year olds are dying bleeding out from a gunshot wound in their classroom, this is the BEST time to discuss these things.And as terrible as this is, we can ignore it and still make a valid case for making sure that there are at least background checks for every gun purchase. How sad is that?permalinksaveparent[+]twinkling_star 3 points4 points5 points 42 minutes ago (1 child)[]twinkling_star 3 points4 points5 points 42 minutes agoI think the biggest obstacle is the fact that we seem to be at a point where it's extremely hard to talk about serious topics like these in a calm, respectful manner.  I'm not pointing fingers, since there's plenty to go around, but when we're seeing shouting matches, nasty generalizations, and almost an inability to remember the other side also consists of people with feelings and concerns, the lack of respect seems to also end up rubbing off on how we think of the victims.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 29 minutes agoBeautifully putpermalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes ago (1 child)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 30 minutes agoWhen people are scared their opinions change.

We had a shooting today, another one on Tuesday. Sikh shooting, Aurora, Seal Beach, Gabby Giffords, etc. If we continue to wait until people aren't scared of mass gun violence, we are never going to have a discussion on this issue. Because there WILL be another one that brings this issue up again before everything settles down.permalinksaveparent[+]tehvolcanic 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]tehvolcanic 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour agoI was thinking more about the mall shooting in Oregon earlier this week.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie -4 points-3 points-2 points 57 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie -4 points-3 points-2 points 57 minutes agoStill a significant gap between that and the last shooting.

We periodically re-test drivers to make sure they are sane(ish) and physically capable of safely operating a motor vehicle.  Vehicles themselves are registered and their ownership is tracked, in part so that stolen vehicles can be recovered.Thanks to the recent Heller and McDonald rulings, the current SCOTUS has created a new individual right to own guns.  So be it.  But rights are balanced by responsibilities, and gun enthusiasts should welcome a higher level of responsibility that protects the general public from the side-effects that can come from their pursuit.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoWhere I'm from you do have to complete a class, pretty aggressive background check, and show at least some ability to carry in public.  You also have to pass a background check to buy a gun.
