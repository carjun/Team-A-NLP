My motivation to carry always goes up following these events. I hope it is the same across the nation.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie -1 points0 points1 point 33 minutes ago (4 children)[]charmonkie -1 points0 points1 point 33 minutes agoThis will come off as a little gun-nutty, but I don't think this would have happened if the shooters thought someone at the school would be shooting back (to be clear I mean a teacher who carried, not a student, and not all teachers being forced to carry)permalinksaveparent[+]scintillatingdunce 3 points4 points5 points 31 minutes ago (3 children)[]scintillatingdunce 3 points4 points5 points 31 minutes agoNo, the fact is that this wouldn't have happened if the mentally unstable only had access to a knife.  Cause and effect and consequences do not cross the mind of somebody mentally unstable enough to commit this kind of an act.permalinksaveparent[+]asmodeanreborn 1 point2 points3 points 25 minutes ago (1 child)[]asmodeanreborn 1 point2 points3 points 25 minutes agoHave you read the news lately? Mass stabbings are rampant in China... Just a few months ago somebody stabbed 8 kids to death.  Not to mention, gun control laws didn't stop Breivik from killing 77 in Norway, and McVeigh killed 168 in Oklahoma City without firing a single bullet.permalinksaveparent[+]scintillatingdunce 3 points4 points5 points 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]scintillatingdunce 3 points4 points5 points 12 minutes agoIt's much harder to spree stab a dozen people than it is to reload a clip and keep firing.  If you're trying to make the argument that it's equally as likely and easy I'm just going to laugh at you.Reduced circulation of guns would make it harder for people to get a hold of them.  If you seriously think Norway has a murder rate anywhere near the US, again you'll be laughed out of the room.permalinksaveparent[+]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]charmonkie 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes agoLegally obtained guns aren't the only guns used in shootings.  Illegal guns will realistically always be obtainable in some sense.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
