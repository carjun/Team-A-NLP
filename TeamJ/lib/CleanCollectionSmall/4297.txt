It's an adult creeper talking to a baby one about how they have to destroy things, but all the baby creeper wants to do is play in the snow.  Does anyone have a link to this?Thanks!permalinksave[+]MrGDavies 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]MrGDavies 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoThat link confused and annoyed :( never seen the comic sorrypermalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
