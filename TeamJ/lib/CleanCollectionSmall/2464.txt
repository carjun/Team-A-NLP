State-recognized are looser with their procedures. The Sac & Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa requires DNA to confirm paternity, if your dad was a tribal member, but you still need to trace directly back to an enrolled tribal member.permalinksavecontextfull commentsApparently, my Dad's family is part Native American and he has spent some time with tribes and so have I, but I'm not a member, how do you become a member of a tribe?  by  Isatis_tinctoriain  AskReddit[+]ahalenia 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]ahalenia 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours agoWhich tribe? Most have minimum blood quantum requirements, so just because your dad was a member doesn't necessarily mean that you can be. Tribes determine their membership based on specific rolls. Once you know the tribe, you can google their constitution and by-laws and look up how enrollment is determined. Once you find out which roll, you can usually find those on ancestry.com or other genealogy websites. Then you look for your ancestors. You'll need death and birth certificates for each generation linking you to your ancestor listed on the tribal roll. Then you apply for a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Once you have your CDIB and if you are eligible to enroll, contact the tribe's enrollment office. If they don't have a website, the National Congress of the American Indian lists mailing addresses for all federally recognized tribes. They should have the paperwork to enroll. Note, besides minimum blood quantum requirements, some tribes are only matrilinear or patrilineal, and some tribes have residency requirements.permalinksavecontextfull commentsApparently, my Dad's family is part Native American and he has spent some time with tribes and so have I, but I'm not a member, how do you become a member of a tribe?  by  Isatis_tinctoriain  AskReddit[+]ahalenia 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago*(0 children)[]ahalenia 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago*No federally recognized tribe uses DNA tests for to determine membership.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are some explanations for why the Basque language has survived to this day?  by  EarlofCardiganin  AskHistorians[+]ahalenia 2 points3 points4 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]ahalenia 2 points3 points4 points 13 hours agoThat is one of my favorite books of all time.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow many Wikipedians does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

They also often had imagery indicating what contents were stored inside.Beadwork and quillwork contain a great deal of symbolism: cosmologies, maps, hunting and warfare medicine. The beadwork circle on these Cheyenne moccasins indicate seating positions in a lodge, possible a Sun Dance lodgeNorthwest Coast formline art is a very stylized visual language. Totem poles are perhaps the most famous example, with heraldic clan crests and historical imagery beginning at the base of the pole and moving upwards. BTW not all totem poles are for honoring; there are also shame poles that publicly ridicule people.Plains and Prairie elk antler quirts were incised with personalized pictographs, often recording war exploitsCalendar sticks were carved pieces of wood with information, common in among O'odham people, but also in the Great Lakes and northeastern WoodlandsSiberian Yupik tattoos convey specific information about the individual. Many of the tattoo designs relate to whale hunting.Plains hide painting carries a visual language that can be understood by many different tribes  and appears on clothing, robes, tipis, winter counts, drums, etc.Really, you could argue that all handmade items were laden with symbolic meanings and visual languages, until the advent of mass-produced "decorative" items in the Industrial Revolution.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy grandparents were born before sliced bread.  by  HotHandsin  wikipedia[+]ahalenia -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]ahalenia -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day agoAre they the greatest thing since it?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen did it become taboo for women to expose their boobs?

Many of the advances are in agriculture and medicine (think quinine and aspirin); however, Tiwanaku and Inca masonry is considered some of the finest in the word and have withstood centuries of earthquakes. Andean and Northwest Coast weaving (particularly Chilkat weaving) is some of the most technically complex in the world. Precolumbian peoples of South America invented several sophisticated metal alloys, most notably tumbaga. Mesoamericans are some of the few peoples in the world to independently discover the concept of zero. The Mayan calendar is more accurate than the Gregorian calendar.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould the Native Americans or other indigenous peoples of the Americas ever left the continents by sea?  by  But_Wait_Theres_Morein  askscience[+]ahalenia 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]ahalenia 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoYupik peoples traveled back and forth between Siberia and Alaska via water.

I'm not 100% if Mohawk Rosetta Stone is available to the general public, but it's worth investigating.Various Indian Peoples Publishing is a good source for dictionaries/glossaries.
