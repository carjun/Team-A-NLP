And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fires flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. Its not desiring the fall; its terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling Dont! and Hang on!, can understand the jump. Not really. Youd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBREAKING: School shooting in Newtown, CT.  by  KazamaSmokersin  Connecticut[+]Mybackwardswalk 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Mybackwardswalk 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoA friend tweeted it: https://twitter.com/Fletch788/status/279668466150166528/photo/1permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Thanks  by  yalilshikakain  trees[+]Mybackwardswalk 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]Mybackwardswalk 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoDo you think your reaction time is the same when you're high?Personally I would never drive under the influence. I almost hit a small girl that ran straight into the street from behind a van that was parked, while I was driving completely sober. I was only going like 30-40km/h on a city street, with snow and ice on it. Had it not been for my split second reaction to slam on the brakes, release the brakes and then turn within 2-3 seconds or so, I would probably have hit her. The car was only like half a meter away from hitting her. I just can't imagine a person that's high being able to do that. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, for gift ideas, what is the coolest thing you own under $100?  by  FiveLionsin  AskReddit[+]Mybackwardswalk 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]Mybackwardswalk 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoYeah, there's a list of some of the artists that use them here: http://ultimateears.logitech.com/en-us/earphones/galleries/ue-galleries-usepermalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, for gift ideas, what is the coolest thing you own under $100?  by  FiveLionsin  AskReddit[+]Mybackwardswalk 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]Mybackwardswalk 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoUltimate Ears custom made monitors sell for 1999$You have to go to an ear doctor and get a cast of your ear, then they make your monitors so they fit perfectly.

By 2020 their population is expected to exceed Germany's, which would make Turkey the country with most MEPs in the EU. No way Germany, France and the UK would let that happen.A good thing though is that the EU is keeping them as a potential candidate and using their power of expansion. That way the EU makes Turkey better their democracy and conditions, thus expanding democracy across Europe which is one of EU's goals.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
