Please, media, don't do it!!! This is what these sad, pathetic, sick fools want. They want to go down in a blaze of glory, and when others see the huge press they get, they'll be galvanized to the same.

Beautifully put. Yes, it gets sticky when you zoom back and forth like that. I'll consider it from the perspective you suggest (a 6th grade essay) and try and revisit it. Thanks.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Crit] How Not to Get Children to Eat Their Spinach [628][Creative Writing]  by  pj1milin  write[+]pj1mil[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]pj1mil[S] 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoI absolutely agree. It's tough to maintain perspective in this respect. It's like so many arts; it's difficult not to "push" in music, and not to "force" in writing. I actually changed it considerably two or three days before submitting, so it's better than it was (less forced, if you can believe it), but I have more work to do. I should do more speaking it aloud--what do you think of that?

Yes, Adele has a very good voice, but Whitney's voice is practically inhuman.permalinksavecontextfull commentsParody of Dad who posted a video of daughter on FB (link to that in comments).
