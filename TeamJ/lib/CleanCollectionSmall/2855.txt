According to your logic, the solution would be collecting sperm from pubescent boys before they become violent, then euthanizing them? What is your endgame for "the problem is men"? Also, I'm a man and I think this is sickening.  To you, I'm what,  a dud? One that didn't go off?permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I'm not suggesting any change if that's what it is. If it's not at all about popularity, you can write in a made-up language, so who cares? As for self-posts on reddit, a large chuck of my posts have been original content. All of the least-popular ones. The most upvoted stuff is always third party. Reddit typically asks for OC then ignores or downvotes it in favor of established content or repetition. So I think the whole "All your links shouldn't be to.your own page" perspective is both a contradiction of the spirit of generating new and interesting content and reflective of the real tendencies of the site.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTwelve Days of Netflix #2: 12 Dates of Christmas with Amy Smart and Mark-Paul Gosselaar  by  heyscottmarshallin  netflix[+]nutsocharles 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)[]nutsocharles 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoI'd seriously consider modifying your title if these are meant to be crappy Christmas movies, because right now your post sounds like you're genuinely recommending twelve xmas movies for people and starting with terrible ones. 12 Days of Netflix is clever and catchy but doesn't convey what you're trying to get across, and most people are likely to downvote the post without coming into.the thread to read your caveat that these are 'dubious' coices. Your posts from yesterday got almost no attention,  except for some comments about the movie being terrible, not bestof, and someone accuses you of only promoting your blog with all your posts. After a quick check of your submissions, this rings pretty true. This is not to say that's totally unacceptable. If your blog becomes popular with reddit, people will want links to new content. But here are a few serious suggestions: 1) these aren't good movies or Christmas classics. Be very clear about that. As a title, how about "On the worst page of Netflix, my true love made me see..." -- you don't have to use that obviously, but now I know it's about watching a crappy xmas flick. 2) make your blog about that, and flesh it out. Your review of Snow could fit on my hand if I was cheating on a test. It could also be summed up as "Not bad." This is the opposite of what could actually get you some traction, both on reddit and in terms of blog hits. You're watching bad holiday movies! Celebrate that! Tell us why this is a bad movie. How can you tell it was cheap? How is the acting bad? (Ravage every performance, especially children, unless it's the one role that almost, but not quite, saves the movie). Pick it apart, tell us every way it should've been better. If a movie is bad enough and you can make a good case why, people will watch it to see what you're talking about. Spending a little more time talking about the movie (major) scene by (major) scene and important (and bad) plot points will also flesh out your reviews, which is a necessity. Your review of this movie, for example, was ten sentences if I'm being generous. I'm certain what I'm posting in this thread will be longer. And this may sound harsh, but it's not an entertaining ten sentences. It's a wildly condensed synopsis that has no fun with the movie being bad. If I were going to watch this movieright now and review it, I'd take detailed notes on it and when I reviewed it, if I.compared it to Groundhog Day I might say "By the fifth date, I was contemplating whether I'd rather have a bath with a toaster or step in front of a speeding bus."I hope you take this in the spirit in which it is meant. Your idea sounds great in your head, but it isn't coming across to anyone else. Let people know up front that you're having fun watching bad Christmas movies,  and in your blog, make me feel like I watched it with you even if I don't watch it at all. Describe no movie as not bad, and put in some effort and write more! I can't imagine a blog with a serious readership but no content. Movie #3 should be a lengthy, detailed review, and if your blog is more than succinct reviews of bad movies, it should be a writing piece. Showcase what you have to say. Work for the upvotes and pageviews you're after, be clear about what you're saying, and say something that at least a significantly sized readership can agree with and for more of which they will return.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Request] I am unemployed, trying to become a teacher.
