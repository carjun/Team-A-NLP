That doesn't seem completely necessary. I'd also like to know why the US has so many more school killings than the rest of the world. Not sure I know the answer, but it is interesting.edit: and why this gun is legal.permalinksaveparent[+]MakesShittyAnalogies 7 points8 points9 points 35 minutes ago*(5 children)[]MakesShittyAnalogies 7 points8 points9 points 35 minutes ago*We don't. We just get the most press about them. In China, school stabbings are rampant.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_attacks_in_China_(2010%E2%80%932011)Also, that gun only shoots as frequently as a semi-auto pistol. Assault rifles in the United States are for aesthetics only.permalinksaveparent[+]Sieziggy 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes ago (4 children)[]Sieziggy 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes agoIt's much harder to kill 28 people with a knife than it is with an assault rifle. permalinksaveparent[+]MakesShittyAnalogies 1 point2 points3 points 16 minutes ago (3 children)[]MakesShittyAnalogies 1 point2 points3 points 16 minutes agoWell yes, it is. But a ban on guns (Assault rifles in the US are semi-automatic, by the way) will drive crimes like this towards easier targets and not necessarily stop the crimes. There's a reason that the stabbings in China take place in elementary schools. The casualty counts are still high.permalinksaveparent[+]Sieziggy 1 point2 points3 points 11 minutes ago (2 children)[]Sieziggy 1 point2 points3 points 11 minutes agoAn isolated stabbing is still far less damaging than a mass shooting. A mentally unstable individual who is intent on hurting someone for whatever reason will find the best suited tool. If you take the most potent tools away their options and potential harm are reduced. permalinksaveparent[+]MakesShittyAnalogies -1 points0 points1 point 8 minutes ago (1 child)[]MakesShittyAnalogies -1 points0 points1 point 8 minutes agoBut the data just doesn't support that. These aren't isolated incidents. As much as I wish it was as easy as banning guns (which will never happen, America has too many guns in circulation and a much too conservative voter-base) to stop massacres, it wont happen - people will switch to knives or bombs and choose different, easier targets.Many of the stabbings I have mentioned have >15 casualties. It's just not a simple problem to solve. It probably looks like I'm super conservative here, but I'm really not. I just think the most obvious answer here might not be the best one.permalinksaveparent[+]Sieziggy 1 point2 points3 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]Sieziggy 1 point2 points3 points 2 minutes agoIt's obviously still a problem but can you really make the case that it's somehow worse than if any of those stabbers had a gun instead? Obviously we should be doing our best to ensure that no weapons enter our schools but not all weapons should be considered equal. Any countermeasure you would implement for guns, say moderately armed security guards or police patrols, would be even more effective against someone wielding a knife. permalinksaveparent[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes ago (1 child)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes agoWe could also talk about why a 24 year old felt he needed to get 4 guns and a bullet proof vest.permalinksaveparent[+]possiblyFibbing 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]possiblyFibbing 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoHobbyist? I have 6 myself, for hunting, protection, and range shooting. No vest though.
