The police are under no obligation to protect you.  The big problem that is causing this is a violent culture and a serious lack of mental health outreach.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNorth Korean satellite 'tumbling out of control,' US officials say  by  twolf1in  worldnews[+]egonil 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]egonil 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoEventually they will get to the point where the corpse is more competent than the person working on the problem.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI found this next generation console at a market in Vietnam  by  Very_kafkaesquein  gaming[+]egonil 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]egonil 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoWould make a great gag gift though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat video game quote has stuck with you, and why?  by  Craythin  AskReddit[+]egonil 8 points9 points10 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]egonil 8 points9 points10 points 1 day agoTo be fair, the tank being Soviet, there was a 50/50 chance it would blow up to begin with.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's one food you have tried and will NOT ever touch again?  by  pinkwaff1ein  AskReddit[+]egonil 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]egonil 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI just don't like any candy flavored like peaches.

His powers were recuperating without it, the ring would have just sped up the process.  He had a physical body and had the willpower to command both his Nazgul and his armies without the ring.  Even when the ring was destroyed it was a temporary setback at best.  Sauron remains a Maia and will still slowly regain all of his powers, it may take a thousand years but what is a thousand years for someone who is immortal?  There only reason he wanted the ring was because it was an immediate weakness that would take a while to recover from if exploited and it would give him an edge in controlling the lesser rings.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the biggest movie plot hole you have ever seen?  by  kickster777in  AskReddit[+]egonil 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]egonil 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoWhy not reforge the scissors into metal fingers?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the biggest movie plot hole you have ever seen?  by  kickster777in  AskReddit[+]egonil 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]egonil 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThat wasn't Skynet, it was a subsidiary super computer charged with running that facility.

Apparently someone decided that these pukes shouldn't get the lash anymore.  Something about protecting their poor sensibilities from a bit of honest work.

QUIT YER GRUMBLIN, the Eye has plans for these prisoners.  E's got plans for all of us.  Honest pay, fair treatment, maybe even some personal freedoms and all.  And I don't want to hear no words about the Eye goin soft.  I got all your numbers and there is plenty of knife work to be done on the front lines for them likes.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJon Stewart says if he'd known about Yusuf Islam's views, he wouldn't have included him in 2010's Rally to Restore Sanity.
