  Fatal Shooting at Connecticut School   | Maboot.comHomeAbout usDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyEntertainmentFashionHealthPoliticsSportsTechnologyHomePolitics Fatal Shooting at Connecticut School Fatal Shooting at Connecticut School    13 hours ago    by Bobby Simmons 0Just when we thought our biggest problem over the last several months was getting out of debt as a country, we have been hit by much worse. It all started with the shooting massacre at the Batman premiere showing in Colorado. This was followed by several other threats of violence, and some actual acts were carried out, on campuses throughout the United States. Kansas City also had an alleged threat from someone wanting to know if they were on the terrorist list, which prompted them to close down some of their federal office buildings in the city for the remainder of that day. All of these events are scary, and when you have a situation of anyones life ending or being threatened it is bad.However, when you talk about what happened today at the Connecticut school, you are looking at a true problem that needs to be solved. Did the other situations give the alleged criminal a right to end someones life or threaten to do so? Absolutely not. These people all have loving families who, for one, were extremely worried about their wellbeing. Secondly, the criminals in the previously mentioned cases also took the right of freedom and security away from the victims families as it is safe to bet they no longer go anywhere in public anymore without wondering if something could happen to them.Todays event was a little different. This man, Mr. Lanza, a 20-year old, walked into two different classrooms and killed 20 students. To make matters worse, these were kids in a kindergarten through fourth-grade facility. Twenty kids who will not be with their families to celebrate the Christmas festivities. Twenty families who will never get to see their kid graduate high school, pursue their dream career or even get married.The total fatality count is now up to 28, which includes the original 20 students plus eight adults. Mr. Lanza fatally shot his mother, who is a teacher at the school, the schools principal, the psychologist and five others that we know of so far. This has brought about an even stronger push for gun control, and Obama spoke on the issue this afternoon after receiving word of the horrific event.The strongest argument is not necessarily to take away the right to own a firearm, but to require those who wish to own one to have to face a rigorous process including a more-extensive background check.
