"Part of the reason I'm feeling this way is because I can't stand all of this digital stuff, this is not what I signed up for"  by  feureauin  movies[+]DChapgier 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]DChapgier 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoOh yeah, no doubt it's getting higher. However, film is a great medium to capture on in my opinion. As a filmmaker, it forces me to make creative choices on set in terms of lighting and camera placement instead of being lazy with it. That isn't to say you can't be creative with digital. It's just in my experience, with film everyone on set is on point all the time. On digital sets, it's easy for the director to say "keep rolling, go back to one ..." With out giving people the break they need. Plus i love how film flares and how the highlights roll off. On digital, highlights tend to blow out easily. I gotta say the Alexa has a nice roll off though. In terms of projection, I think the quality of 35mm is still the top. The color and grain look gorgeous.  4k projectors are good, but they still feel flat, dead and too sharp. Actors faces aren't very appealing in a close up. Film has a much more appealing and organic look to it. Also, and this is shallow, but I enjoy the aesthetics of watching 35, with the weave, the cigarette burns, and mag change over. I feel like its part of the experience of watching a film. It reminds you what you are watching isn't real life. So yeah, sorry about my last comment. It was dickish. permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuentin Tarantino explains why he wants to quit making movies.

They rented them from rental houses. That's what was great about them. You could use a camera from the 70's, use the latest film stock and lenses, and get the same look as if you were using a newer camera. permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuentin Tarantino explains why he wants to quit making movies.

And they shouldn't. In my mind, it still looks the best, and is honestly the best way to archive.permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuentin Tarantino explains why he wants to quit making movies.

The cigarette burns and reel change over that remind you that what you are watching isn't real, it's separate from reality. Now with digital, its all so slick, its like sitting at home watching tv, but in public, as he says. I think he probably feels the same way with 48 fps. permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuentin Tarantino explains why he wants to quit making movies.
