Sollazzo greets parents and students returning to Hawley Elementary School on Tuesday in Newtown, Conn.By Tracy Connor and Alexandra Moe, NBC News Hearts were heavy and security was tight as thousands of children in Newtown, Conn., returned to school Tuesday for the first time since a gunman killed 20 students and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary.It was a tiny glimmer of normalcy in a town that was also burying two more youngsters, but officials made it clear this was no ordinary school day.This is a day to start healing, Newtown High School Principal Charles Dumais wrote in an e-mail to parents before six schools opened two hours later than usual, with police officers and counselors on hand.Sandy Hook, where a rifle-toting Adam Lanza turned two classrooms into a shooting gallery on Friday, remains a crime scene, with no indication if its 600 students will ever return to the building.

Meanwhile, more details emerge about the gunman. TODAY's Natalie Morales reports. He said that as Newtowns children head back to school, he hopes the nation learns a gun-control lesson from the horrific tragedy that rocked the quiet bedroom community.I just hope that this is sort of a tipping point in some way to really do something meaningful," he said. "I am a hunter, a bow hunter just so you know, but I can't imagine why anybody would want these assault rifles. It just doesn't seem to me to make any sense."Newtown High School senior P.J.

I feel safer here than anywhere else in the world.Newtown Police Lt. George Sinko said the town prepared for a lot of apprehension from parents."We just had a horrific tragedy. We had babies sent to school that should be safe and they weren't," Sinko said. "You can't help but think ... if this could happen again."Even as schools were reopening, two more kids -- 6-year-olds Jessica Rekos and James Mattioli -- were being laid to rest.Wakes also were scheduled Tuesday for Charlotte Bacon and Daniel Barden and for teacher Victoria Soto, 27, hailed as a hero for shielding her students in a closet.Funeral directors from throughout Connecticut have come forward to help the grieving town, another example of support that's so desperately needed. NBC's Anne Thompson reports. On Monday, the first two funerals for shooting victims were held, with Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto, both 6, laid to rest in tiny coffins.Pinto so idolized New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz that he was buried in his jersey.

There is so much that can be done THAT WILL MAKE AN IMPACT THAT WOULD REDUCE THESE TRAGEDIES but it involves everyone doing their part. Relying on government to ban high capacity gun magazines or waiving a magic wand isn't going to fix this problem. Our society is broken....I wish people would find this "we demand something be done now rage" when it comes to alcohol. More deaths are caused by alcohol every year than guns. To the tune of 75,000 to 16,000. Drunk drivers kill just as many people as murderers who use guns.

As culpable as issues about guns and mental health is the insane media coverage of the event and the notoriety of the shooter.  I think it is fair to assume that one of the motivations for going on a big rampage is the notoriety that comes with it.  Why feed that beast?  I think we should know nothing about the shooter.  Not his name, not his troubles, not his family life.  He should be - as in Harry Potter - "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named".  Rather than becoming infamous they would become forgotten.  Just a thought.4 votes#1.12 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 11:47 AM ESTCult of PersonalitySay What has it partially right.  Video games and television shows that are marketed to kids are littered with violence.  We have a culture that would rather see someone die than trying to help and research these criminals (even though it costs more to kill someone than jail them for life).However, there is no need for assult rifles.  And places with gun control measures such as banning private sales, banning semi-automatic rifles, and requiring a central database with up-to-date registrations of each gun to the individual, have seen drops in homicides, suicides, and home invasions.#1.13 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 11:55 AM ESTseriousmomIt's not only gun control that needs to be looked at. The trouble with mental Health should be looked at as well as this is the first thing that the state budget takes away. Medication management is extremely important for these troubled souls to thrive in our society. Mental Illness is a handicap that cannot afford to lose help. I also feel it's far too soon to send these children back to school. I understand that they need to understand that life goes on but children are affected far worse with trauma than us adults are. #1.14 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 12:05 PM ESTIrish 21Maybe the people of Newton will start to heal once you @!$%#s in the media get the cameras out of their faces.

Imagine for one moment that somebody, in a position of authority at the school, had afirearm and was able to confront the deranged gunman.  Would the outcome have been different?Maybe less children taken from their families. The facts are that by making it harder for LAW ABIDINGcitizens to purchase a firearm, the Government is making it harder for that citizen to protect himself,and making that citizen a much easier target.  We all know that criminals get their firearms legally, andthat the Police can prevent crime before it happens.  Until our Government can make its citizenry safefrom the criminal element, and by "safe" I mean the criminals have no access to firearms, firearms willbe necessary.  The Second Amendment right was a guarantee for every citizen to not just protectthemselves from criminals but also a guarantee to protect themselves against a tyrannicalGovernment.  If more firearm legislation could fix the problem, this country would not have the needfor an armed Police force or even an armed Federal police force ( FBI, ATF, etc.).  It really is prettyamazing that the public usually only hears about the mass shootings.  Why is it that the public doesnot hear about the incidents of  mass shootings that are stopped or the deaths and/or injuries are limited because somebody was carrying a firearm?#1.19 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 1:02 PM ESTQ22Before the next kindergarten massacre:BAN high-capacity magazines and assault weapons NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWDo something, show some backbone, Politicians!!!And when another rampage happens using banned assault rifles and banned magazines  - then what?

Outlawing guns won't solve this problem that humans have to kill others. Hitler, Saddam, Pol Pot - they murdered millions.This from the news article about the school attacked there (All this happened in China):...There were six similar attacks in just seven months in 2010 that killed nearly 20 people and wounded more than 50. The most recent such attack took place in August, when a knife-wielding man broke into a middle school in the southern city of Nanchang and stabbed two students before fleeing.  In one of the worst incidents, a man described as an unemployed, middle-aged doctor killed eight children with a knife in March 2010 to vent his anger over a thwarted romantic relationship. Tight controls mean that gun crimes are rare in China and make knives and sometimes explosives the weapons used in mass attacks in China.No motive has been given for the recent school attack. Ku Jianhui, a lawyer with the Beijing Xindong law firm, said the social environment is a 'factor', adding: 'A person who chooses extreme acts to voice his or her grievances usually believes that his or her cases were unable to be handled fairly through normal channels or legal procedures.'1 vote#1.24 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 2:38 PM ESTCult of PersonalityJon S.,Read what you posted.....One of the worst incidents in China was in 2010 in which 8 children were killed.

Each of the following three days after that shooting, December 12, 13 and 14, the Gun Shops in my community reported all-time record gun sales; including the sale of many semi-automatic assault-style rifles similar to the weapon which was used in the the shopping mall shooting murders. Four days after the shopping mall shooting, December 15 -- the day following the horrific massacre inside an elementary school of 20, six and seven-year old children and six teachers and administrators in Connecticut with another semi-automatic assault-style rifle -- a large, well-attended Gun Show was held in the Exposition Center of my community. Thousands of guns changed hands from private sellers to private buyers at that Gun Show. Their were no background checks for the buyers of those thousands of weapons due to the loophole in the Brady Bill, which Congress has thus far refused to close, or to even debate.The NRA and gun manufacturers have spent millions of dollars lobbying and giving political campaign contributions to members of Congress to make certain that our elected representatives in Congress do not act to close this loophole which allows the buyers of 40% of all gun sales in America to avoid a background check on their gun purchases, and to continue to purchase semi-automatic assault-style weapons, high capacity ammunition magazines and unlimited quantities of ammunition.Think about that:  40% of all gun sales in America ... no background checks.Am I alone in seeing this state of affairs in America as absurd? Can anyone argue rationally and persuasively that our American society has not lost its collective mind over the possession of guns? Footnotes:   Between the time you got out of bed this morning and the time you get out of bed tomorrow morning, 34 more people will die of gun violence in America; an average daily toll which continues 365 days a year, every year. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Report, between 2006 and 2010 47,856 people were murdered in the U.S. by firearms, ....more than twice as many people as were killed by all other means combined.* There are more than 129,817 federally licensed firearms dealers in the United States, according to the latest Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.* There are approx. 36,569 Grocery Stores in the United States (source:  Food Marketing Institute, 2011) There are approx. 14,098 McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. (Source:  McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011)Ok, now make that rational and persuasive argument that we have not lost our collective mind in America.4 votes#1.29 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 5:32 PM ESTIRESPOND-2315268Why worry about an attack from the Taliban, if we have the NRA in this country providing weapons of mass destruction in this country!!!!!2 votes#1.30 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 5:50 PM ESTSSP-TXRobert, I don't think anyone can argue with you.

You can hate me all you want sir, but I would never support guns over children. I support actual parenting. If more people had better parenting skills, maybe things like this would not happen. It's easy to regulate guns, but it's pretty inconvenient for parents to teach right or wrong to their children. Only problem with your solution is that you can ban guns completely from the United States and things like this will continue to happen.3 votes#7.1 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 11:48 AM ESTLellie416Who would you blame then?2 votes#7.2 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 11:56 AM ESTmsannomalleyRick, I'm a grandmother myself and the idea that a gun has more value than the lives of my two beautiful granddaughters makes me so angry.

I've never heard of video games providing the experience of indulging in binge murder of 1st graders. Really, the killing at Sandy Hook looks like the exact opposite of killing villains: killing the totally vulnerable, innocent, and unable to do anyhing to fight back. How could Lanza have been angry at 1st graders? I think what we have here is much worse than any motives one might find in games. I believe that what happened is ultimately understandable, but, right now, it's not within range of my understanding anyway.#8.3 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 11:22 AM ESTSayWhat-3485804MelJM - You clearly have never played Call of Duty: Black Ops. There is one chapter where the character goes undercover and YOU as the player of that character participate in a mass murder at an airport where you mow down innocent travelers. Call of Duty is one of the most popular games ever to be sold. My son would come home from the 4th grade telling me how all of his friends were playing this game and he couldn't understand why I wouldn't let him.We are desensitizing our children to violence and empathy!3 votes#8.4 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 11:30 AM ESTMelJMI don't have an interest in playing any of these gsmes. I can see your point about keeping kids away from them, but, lookimg the game up at Wikipedia, I didn't see the feature you mentioned and it wasn't mentioned in the "criticism" section either. The CIA agent protagonist shooting up a bunch of innocent people would be pretty gross. Whatever, Lanza at 20, knew very well that he wasn't playing a game. I think killing 1st graders and teachers with multiple shots each is pure evil and way beyond any kicks one might get from a game unless one were practicing for murder. There is such a thing as hatred of the good for being the good and destruction for the sake of destruction.  Unless Lanza is shown to have been insane, I won't be surprised if this sort of evil doesn't show up here.As for banning such games, I wouldn't support that unless it could be shown that there was an inextricable connection between playing the game and psychological damage to the player and subsequent violence. I'm always very concerned about the abuse of a right by some being used to deny the right to everyone. The argument from abuse could lead, if consistently applied, to no rights at all -- even no freedom of speech. I run on to the argument when I support doctor assisted suicide. Yes, somebody might get hurt, but that's not enough to deny the right to me and everyone else; people must be responsible.1 vote#8.5 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 1:08 PM ESTSayWhat-3485804Mel - I completely understand and agree with your rationale. Now we replace the game in this scenario with guns and you can see why gun owners are fighting tooth and nail to keep the government from restricting them even further.Millions of people can own guns and shoot them responsibly without anyone ever getting hurt.

Gun violence is merely a symptom of a far worse sickness that is afflicting us as a people.  We live in a society that has determined that there should be no such thing as God-given truth.  We have elevated a philosophy that everyone can do what is right in their own eyes and things will continue to go along well, and even get better. How could we ever have duped ourselves into thinking that the God of the Bible is no longer needed for us to function as a healthy society? Since the 1960s, we have pushed God out of our schools, out of our government, out of our stores, out of our public squares, out of our press, out of our marriages and out of our families. We have even pushed Him out of some of our churches.   We have twisted the original intention of the separation of Church and State and purged His ways from being our guide for living. We have set ourselves on a mission to silence the God of the Bible, as we pursue our pleasures and vain pursuits of life.  Our entertainment industry is now driven by sexual immorality and extreme violence and we flock to watch it, intoxicated by perversion. We are rapidly losing sight of what a healthy family looks like anymore. We try to remedy this by creating redefinitions of what a family is. Then we somehow are surprised when the offspring of our redefinitions turn on us in revenge.  While shocked by the loss of these precious school children this past week, there seems to be little concern over the 3,000,000 innocent unborn children whose lives we passively allow to be snuffed out every year by our abortion industry.  Since 1973, we now are missing 1/8 of our nations population due to our self-serving use of abortion, and yet, we shamelessly continue to push forward, even supporting the use of tax dollars to take more innocent lives.  Because we, as a nation, have refused to stop this genocide, we now have the blood of all of these innocent ones on our hands!No, mere gun control is not the answer to cure our woes, America.  We are sick and dying in spirit, soul and body. We must end our hostility toward the only One who has our remedy.  We must admit that we are the problem. We are in critical condition and it is high time for us to turn back to Him and His Truth. He, alone, offers what we truly need to heal our land.5 votes#10 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 10:09 AM ESTOVUgirlYea, God will help.  Yea, right.

Guns are inanimate objects and if a person is filled with Satan they will find another object like a knife or a car or whatever to do their evil deeds. 22 children in a school in China were attacked by a knife wielding nut on the same day this happened.

Big difference.Jesus said that He did not come into the world to condemn people for their sins, but rather to rescue and save people from them.  God did do something.  He let His Son take our guilt and judgement upon His own self.   We can be fully forgiven, whatever our misdeeds - free inside, changed and filled new with His love.  It is our choice.  He does not force it upon us.

It's so easy to blame God for not doing anything in this situation, but do we give Him credit for thwarting a school shooting in Oklahoma?

Someone who wants to commit a mass murder is not going to bother going through proper channels to legally obtain a weapon. These types of incidents always happen where guns are not allowed, like schools, movie theaters, etc.  Places where no one can protect themselves.  None of these chicken @!$%# shooters ever attempted to do something like this at a police station, or military base, where people are obviously going to be armed.  Why did Adam Lanza kill himself when he heard the police approaching?  He was a coward.  If he had thought for an instant that those teachers would have been armed, and could have protected those children, he would not have gone to that school.  I have kids in school, and after this incident, it would not bother me one bit for my children's teachers to carry guns on them, if proper controls were in place.

I've had my turn at serious grief and bought a book to find some help. The book mentioned that many will think that a week or so is enough and will get impatient if it runs longer.  What I figured out for myself though (it wasn't in the book) is that it's not reasonable to think that the pain will go completely away. Sure, one can be happy again, but, from time to time, there will be some pain. IMO, one cannot simply erase a devastating loss. Some grief symptoms, as bad as they seem, are in the normal range, but grief can be much more serious and require professional help. Some surpress the grief at first only to have it pop up years later. I fear that many of the parents are going through hell and that many of their friends and relatives won't understand it at all. Before I went through grief myself, I had no idea what it was like.#19.1 - Tue Dec 18, 2012 1:40 PM ESTMike-907826To all the Libs blaming white republicans for blocking gun control, google the Rachel Maddow episode from Friday night where she pointed out that 71% of NRA members want certain controls put in place.

One thing she cited was that there is no law stopping someone on the terrorist watch list from purchasing weapons.
