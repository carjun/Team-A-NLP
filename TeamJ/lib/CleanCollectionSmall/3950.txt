See More We turn to our abc news ongoing commitment to the search for solutions to gun violence. President obama promised action on sunday at that interfaith vigil for the victims of the newtown shootings. At least one pro-gun rights advocate in the senate said everything should be on the able. Abc's pierre thomas has the latest on the call to action. Good morning, pierre. Reporter: Good morning, elizabeth. Many americans are demanding that something be done to stop nightmares like what we saw in newtown. What that something should be is where the fight begins. At nra headquarters in virginia monday, an angry crowd. Shame, shame. Reporter: Hordes of activists protesting the gun lobby. And the debate ignited again. But those in the a questioned whether the assault rifle used in the newtown massacre was really the issue. John fund called in yesterday. The laws don't work. These mass killings are because of psychotic or mentally ill individuals. Reporter: But some political leaders are fed up with the nation's gun violence. 34 americans are killed every day by firearms. This is ridiculous. This is an outrage. We are killing each other. And we're the only industrialized country in the world doing it. Reporter: The nation has fought this battle before. In 1994, congress passed an assault weapons ban, after a surge in gun violence across the nation. The law banned 18 types of rifles. But after ten years, it expired, as the gun lobby's power had grown. According to a university of peia study, the number of mass shootings did decline during that decade, except for the year 1999. That was the year columbine. 13 students and faculty killed in a murderous rampage. Since the ban ended, the country has seen a spate of mass shootings. But little in the way of significant gun control. Supporters of gun control point to australia. In 1996, after a mass shooting there, that country banned certain types of rifles and launched a massive gun buyback campaign. Since then, australia has not had a single mass shooting. Is it the will or the desire to do something like that in the u.S.? We don't yet know. Elizabeth? The nra has been notably silent since the attacks on friday. What about retail stores? Sporting goods stores that sell these guns? Any actions or statements from them? Reporter: Dick's sporting goods, a major chain, is banning certain types of rifles. All right. That's one step. We'll keep our ears posted to see if anything changes. Pierre thomas, thank you very much. 3View CommentsABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSsections:Most PopularU.S.WorldPoliticsBrian Ross InvestigatesHealthEntertainmentMoneyTechTravelExtreme VideoABC News AudioHome > Video > U.S. Thieves Make Off With Wii-ly Big HaulThieves Make Off With Wii-ly Big Haul$2 million worth of Wii gaming consoles were stolen from a Washington state warehouse.Newtown Elementary School Closed Over ThreatNewtown Elementary School Closed Over ThreatHead O' Meadow students were turned away from school after officials received a threat.Illinois Frat Members Charged in Hazing DeathIllinois Frat Members Charged in Hazing DeathNorthern Illinois University student David Bogenberger died after a night of heavy drinking.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooter: What Caused Shooting?Sandy Hook Elementary Shooter: What Caused Shooting?Forensic Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Welner discusses the shooter and possible cause of shooting.Sandy Hook Shooting: What Was Wrong with Adam Lanza?Sandy Hook Shooting: What Was Wrong with Adam Lanza?Brian Ross reports on clues to the possible motivation for the elementary school shooting.Gun Control Debate Resurfaces After Sandy Hook ShootingGun Control Debate Resurfaces After Sandy Hook ShootingThe president promised action on the search for solutions to gun violence.Who Was Newtown Gunman Adam Lanza?Who Was Newtown Gunman Adam Lanza?Troubling picture of Connecticut mass murderer slowly emerges.A Message of Hope from Newtown, Conn.A Message of Hope from Newtown, Conn.Sandy Hook shooting survivors stay hopeful in wake of tragedy.The Reality of Raising a Troubled ChildThe Reality of Raising a Troubled ChildParents speak out about the issues that can go with raising a mentally ill child.President Obama Pledges Action to Prevent More TragediesPresident Obama Pledges Action to Prevent More TragediesA new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows 54 percent of Americans favor stricter gun control.Day of Mourning in Newtown, Conn.Day of Mourning in Newtown, Conn.Funerals began for the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting.American Kids Head Back to SchoolAmerican Kids Head Back to SchoolAfter the shooting in Newton, Conn., schools across the country increase security.Sandy Hook Victims: Jack Pinto's Funeral HeldSandy Hook Victims: Jack Pinto's Funeral HeldThe 6-year-old shooting victim's favorite football team was the NY Giants.Sandy Hook Victims: Noah Pozner's Funeral Sandy Hook Victims: Noah Pozner's Funeral The 6-year-old, the youngest victim, and schoolmate Jack pinto were the first to be laid to rest.Newtown School Shooting Sparks False Postings on WebNewtown School Shooting Sparks False Postings on WebConnecticut police say people are posing as the 20-year-old shooter on social media sites.Previous | 2 of 3 | Next External links are provided for reference purposes.
