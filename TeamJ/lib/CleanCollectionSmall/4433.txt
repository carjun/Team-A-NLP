The bodies of most of the children killed in the morning remained inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Friday evening, along with the bodies of six adults and the gunman himself, Connecticut State Police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance told "CBS Evening News" anchor Scott Pelley.  47 PhotosConnecticut elementary school shooting  As SWAT teams surrounded the school, state troopers moved students to safety. Some children were told to close their eyes to protect them from seeing the carnage. The police eventually found the gunman dead from a self-inflicted wound, the police said.  Among the dead was the school's principal, Dawn Hocksprung. One teacher was wounded but survived. The attack, coming less than two weeks before Christmas, was the nation's second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the Virginia Tech massacre that left 33 people dead in 2007.  "This is most definitely the worst thing that we have experienced in town - tragic," Newtown police Lt. George Sinko told reporters.  "Evil visited this community today," Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy told reporters at a news conference attended by Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen.-elect Chris Murphy, who represent the state.

Law enforcement sources had earlier told CBS News that the gunman was Ryan Lanza, Adam Lanza's older brother.

As of Friday evening, Ryan Lanza was not considered a suspect, CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reports.  Police shed no light on the motive for the attack. The gunman, Adam Lanza, was believed to suffer from a personality disorder and lived with his mother, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to discuss it. Law enforcement officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that Lanza killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, then drove to the school in her car with at least three guns, including a high-powered rifle that he apparently left in the back of the vehicle, and shot up two classrooms around 9:30 a.m. The New York Times reported that Lanza wore combat gear.  Officials worry about copycat shootings  A federal official told CBS News that, according to state records, all three weapons that Lanza had with him were bought legally and were registered to Lanza's mother.

Eighteen children died at the school, some as young as 5. Two more died after being transported to area hospitals, he said.  A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said investigators believe Lanza attended the school several years ago but appeared to have no recent connection to the place.  At least one parent said Lanza's mother was a substitute teacher there. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the law enforcement official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.  The school teaches about 700 students between kindergarten and fourth grade.  On Friday night, hundreds of people packed a Newtown church and stood outside in a vigil for the victims. People held hands, lit candles and sang "Silent Night" at St. Rose of Lima church.  At the vigil, the priest said the altar holds 26 candles, all of which were lit in memory of the victims. Lyrics of the last hymn of the ceremony rang out: "I will raise him up on eagle's wings."  The parish priest, Robert Weiss, said he spent much of Friday with victims of the families but he could not give them any answers about what happened.  David Connors, the father of three triplets at the school, said at a vigil that his children were taken into a closet during the lockdown.  "My son said he did hear some gunshots, as many as 10," he said. "The questions are starting to come out. `Are we safe? Is the bad guy gone?"'    Orr reports that authorities found two guns on the gunman's body, a Glock 9 mm pistol and a Sig Sauer pistol. A Bushmaster assault rifle was found in the vehicle, Orr reports.   Meanwhile, a law enforcement official says authorities found more guns inside the school than the initial two that had been reported. The official would not say what type of guns were found but says all the weapons were being traced by state and federal authorities. The official was not authorized to speak to reporters about the investigation and spoke only on condition of anonymity.  A law enforcement source told CBS News' Pat Milton that casings (spent shells) from a .223 semi automatic rifle were found inside the school.   Authorities also recovered three other guns  a Henry repeating rifle, an Enfield rifle and a shotgun. It was not clear exactly where those weapons were found.  President Obama promised action to prevent such tragedies again but did not say what that would be.  "Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost," an emotional Mr. Obama said Friday afternoon in a statement delivered from the White House briefing room.  "Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors, as well," said Mr. Obama. "For, as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain."  White House spokesman Jay Carney said Mr. Obama was informed of the shooting at 10:30 a.m. ET by homeland security adviser John Brennan.  A dispatcher at the Newtown Volunteer Ambulance Corps said a teacher had been shot in the foot and taken to Danbury Hospital.       no previous page     next    1/2    2012 CBS Interactive Inc.

There are more alternatives for legitimate self defense than there have ever been before in the history of mankind, and I am quite sure that once we finally recognize as a sane society that firearms need to be licensed and registered, and these licenses issued based upon LEGITIMATE NEED, and that gun owners should have to pass rigorous psychological tests, qualification training, and background checks, even more safe alternatives to firearms will eventually present themselves to the public marketplace. - Rick Carter     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  xamlliw says: 20 kids killed in America = Rabid nationwide outcry.Thousands of innocents, including 200+ children killed in Middle East drone strikes = Not a ******* whisper!*Moral of the story.* Killing innocent people is bad, but only when they are American.     reply         linkicon reporticon emailicon  talesanura says: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=bHQ3P99TqlkThis song...

Local tax revenues can easily fund this. Or I guess we could leave everything the way it is.

Yes, he was at work in the shooting, and now he has the shooter where he wanted him, but that is not what I mean. One of the evil one's tools is to distract. What ought to be done now is our country should turn back to Jesus Christ, Who is God Almighty. Sadly, one of the major headlines I saw was about "gun control." Satan already won. The only way trajedies like this will slow down and maybe cease, is if we repent and turn from our wicked ways. We are a very evil world. The USA is wicked too, just like all the countries in the earth. God knows it. This is sad what happened. If we think the evil in our society and in our families and in our foolish political correctness and in our evil entertainment do not have any impact, then we are wrong. No one knew this would happen, but this kid was impacted somewhere, by something, and not be something else. Divorce. That's not good. God said, I hate divorce! Did he fear God? No. The fear of God is thrown in the gutter in our society, and people rejoice in their chosen lifestyles. Woe unto us.     reply        Hail666 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Yeah that is what we need, God. So where was your loving and just God when a psycho walked into a classroom this morning shot and killed 20 innocent children. Where was your God when James Holmes walked into that movie theatre and killed all those innocent lives. Where was your God on September 11 when over 3000 innocent lives were snuffed out when some other religous nuts flew airplanes into buildings. More atrocities and murder have been done in the name of your God than any other reason. So yes that is the answer to all the troubles in the world, a God who stands by and does nothing to save while the innocent are slaughter, a God who breeds mindless prejudice sheep who ramble on about a magic man and a book of fairy tales. What we really need is to abolish religion and God from this world, then and only then we will actually have peace on earth. If there was a God the sickening and horrific event would have never happened.            rikimaru65 replies:   linkicon reporticon emailicon  Wow. You are nuts NLEEKLEE. Out of your mind wacko.
