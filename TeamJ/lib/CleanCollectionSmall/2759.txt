It's been that way for a long time. The elementary school is a gun-free zone; it's not even supposed to have guns. The point is that increasing our laws in violation of the second amendment does nothing to affect crime. Reasons being that you cannot affect the lawless by legislating the law-abiding. One would think that all these guns are just going around murdering people but that's not the case at all. Our homicide rate with a firearm in the U.S. is 2.7 per 100,000 as of the most recent FBI statistics. It's very, very small and much less compared to many countries that outright ban guns. But I also want to know why these shootings happen. Why are people going crazy, hitting the breaking point, and committing these atrocities. What was wrong with the Oregon shooter? His GF and him split, he had been evicted, his flight got canceled/missed, etc. He was so hellbent on leaving this world and taking people with him that he stole a gun to do it. So he illegally murdered and wounded people, and stole a gun which is also illegal. That guy is a pretty typical case of who does shootings in the U.S.. IE crazy people. The only way to stop them is a combination of making people alert and willing to get involved when they see someone in such obvious distress (what about his friends, family, etc?). Just being evicted should put up warning signs that the guy isn't going to be stable. The other solution that works now and has been gaining popularity is to arm the lawful populace. Self-defense shootings rarely make it past local news but they happen often. I myself carry a gun concealed because I simply do not want to be at the absent mercy of one of these crazed lunatics. I suggest to everyone feeling competent enough to do so to actually partake. Even Illinois is readying to pass a CCW statute because they've tried all the bans and it doesn't do anything. Criminals and crazies keep committing murder and meanwhile their victims remain unarmed and defenseless. Like I've said before, when seconds matter, the police are only minutes away.permalinksaveparent[+]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes ago (2 children)[]flashman2006 0 points1 point2 points 45 minutes agoAlright fine. I'm just about ready to sign up for gun classes for my mom, brothers, and myself. Seems like we are simply heading for a society in which everyone will need to be armed. Can we at least institute federal background checks to weed out the people with a disturbed history? permalinksaveparent[+]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 42 minutes ago (0 children)[]Volucris 0 points1 point2 points 42 minutes agoWe already have it...it's called the NICS system. People could do private sales which are impossible to track, but they still have to abide by the same laws those who buy from a dealer have to (look at a form 4473). Again, the lawless don't give two shits but they're also the same people who don't care about murdering others.If you want to make a legitimate improvement to the NICS system...and it'd be the only one I can really recommend, it would be to fix our healthcare bureaucracy. Those with mental illnesses go undiagnosed and often unreported to the FBI.permalinksaveparent[+]Samueul 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]Samueul 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoWe would need a very robust mental health infrastructure in our country before we could even begin to know who may have disturbed histories....
