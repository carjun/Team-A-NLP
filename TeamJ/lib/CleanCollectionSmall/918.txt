From what I have heard, Shaw purposefully takes their time setting up customers on the Teksavvy account. If this is ACTUALLY true, that is very shady on Shaw's part. As I've mentioned here, I believe a Shaw guy disconnected my internet when I was on holiday while setting up someone else in my house with Shaw.The initial fees: The price of the modem can be as high as $120 and there's no rental option. It definitely gets in the way of the regular consumer deciding to switch over. I can't remember what it cost me, but I was planning on buying a modem no matter who I went with anyways. All of the rental modems I have ever had absolutely suck. I had to reboot the Telus one several times a day. Support never had an answer or an upgrade. Online reviews and research showed it was a piece of crap that was also limited by Telus and loaded with Telus bloatware. It was the Siemens Gigaset SE567 for those of you playing at home. The one I got from Teksavvy is rock solid. I never have to reboot it.As well as a $79 connection fee + another $79 connection fee if you decide to stay with them when you move.It looks like its $75, minus a $20 discount. So $55. I cant remember if I got charged with Telus when I moved. I have a feeling I was, but I'm not certain what or if.Reliance on a third party: With the way things are, Shaw could decide to make their lives hell for offering plans that are better than what they offer.Customer service has been great. The one time I had to get a person out to service the line, Teksavvy took care of it all. I never had to talk to Shaw at all. For everything else, they know their stuff. I think they must have access to some lower-level tools because they were able to do everything then and there. And the biggest reason I have switched: I feel Shaw, Rogers and Telus are unethical companies. They are backing terrible laws and have bad business practices. Rogers has been caught traffic shaping. (Again). So much for net neutrality. All 3 are for Vic Toevs surveillance bill. And after they lost the fight against usage based billing (Credit to Harper), they have started lowering their data caps so they can charge overages. So they have their UBB via a loophole. Blatantly. This is to squeeze out companies like Netflix that want to come to Canada. Want to watch shows via BellTV, Shaw TV, Telus TV? That won't count against your data limit. But Netflix will.I'm not a hippy about causes. I still eat meat and I've never sat in front of a logging truck. These 3 companies are doing SERIOUS harm to Canada. Teksavvy has been doing a great job of keeping Canadians informed without the confusing technical jargon. Even if I was paying more per month (which I'm not), I would do it to support the small bit of competition we have in the market.TL;DR: Ive had great experiences with Teksavvy, bad ones with the big 3, and am happy that being with them actually helps fellow Canadians. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis is why I like Teksavvy - They are open and honest with their customers  by  greenRiverThrillerin  vancouver[+]greenRiverThriller[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]greenRiverThriller[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI had MUCH more trouble with Telus.

The internet is more reliable than I ever had with Telus, and the support has been great. The only bad experience I had was when a SHAW guy came to hook someone else up in my building, he disconnected me. Accident or spite I'll never know. They are a "real" ISP, they just don't run their own lines. Kind of like how Virgin Mobile runs on the Bell cellular network.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis is why I like Teksavvy - They are open and honest with their customers  by  greenRiverThrillerin  vancouver[+]greenRiverThriller[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]greenRiverThriller[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI'm not sure.
