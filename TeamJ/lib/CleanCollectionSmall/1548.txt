I'm sure his mother thought he was going to shoot her in the face and rob her, that's what all mothers think you know? That their child is going to murder them in cold blood. For all we know those guns were in a safe, locked away, but hey guess what? He murdered his mom meaning, and this logic might slap you in the face so get ready, meaning he could have gotten the guns anyways because he killed the owner! Hey here's something else: If you beat the owner of a car, you can steal the car and use it to commit crimes. But hey in your world the person who was beat close to death and dumped into a ditch after having his car stolen is responsible for the crimes committed with that car because he had a responsibility to keep it out of the hands of others.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBill allowing concealed guns in Michigan schools, churches heads to governor.  by  ngamauin  news[+]FrugalNinja 1 point2 points3 points 9 hours ago*(0 children)[]FrugalNinja 1 point2 points3 points 9 hours ago*The mother was in full control of her facilities, so now we are going to deny people rights based on who their children are? Interesting precedence, your son had a DUI so no one in the household is allowed to own a car. Your daughter has a history of drug abuse, so no prescription drugs are allowed in the home. So no, gun laws would have done nothing since the mother was sane and was not about to go on a murderous rampage, your screen name suits you well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf you could choose a theme for a block what would it be and why?  by  AmunRa666in  magicTCG[+]FrugalNinja 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]FrugalNinja 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours agoHigh technology, to move away from fantasy for awhile.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI just started working for Game Show Network and today my first video will air on TV!

They should not be trusted with firearms inside or outside of prison.Also that was the worst anti-gun argument I have ever seen in my entire life, lacking focus or intelligent thought. Also blatantly stupid for comparing a responsible adult in charge of the security of children with prisoners.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCall of Duty = Gun violence in schools?  by  shafablein  gaming[+]FrugalNinja 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]FrugalNinja 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours agoWell apprently the guy in china had no issue ramming a knife into 20 people so yes.

Gun control does not help cut down on violence, a culture built on as little violence as possible and effective help for the mentally ill does. You are comparing apples to oranges that are only similiar on a sub-atomic level.permalinksavecontextfull comments17678This is the Catholic church down the street from the shootings today in Connecticut.

Maybe if someone responsible had a gun inside that building there wouldn't be a pile of bodies currently or 22 slashed children in China either.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOfficial 'Gatecrash' spoilers and preview week dated.
