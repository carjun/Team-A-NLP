But, in reality, this guy is more like the Italian Fascists under Mussolini.  They are using violence and deceitful propaganda to weaken the majority of working people in order to advance the interests of the wealthy and to exert increasing control over them in the name of "law and order."  The more I learn about the rise of fascism in Italy, the more it seems like a useful warning to us today (in contrast to the more obviously insane Nazis in Germany).permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

If, as I suspect, guns are significantly more effective at killing and severely wounding people than knives, then it would make sense to focus more on the more dangerous weapon type.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

In reality, certain people have been saying that all the teachers should be running around with guns all the time in order to "prevent" these school shootings.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

We periodically re-test drivers to make sure they are sane(ish) and physically capable of safely operating a motor vehicle.  Vehicles themselves are registered and their ownership is tracked, in part so that stolen vehicles can be recovered.Thanks to the recent Heller and McDonald rulings, the current SCOTUS has created a new individual right to own guns.  So be it.  But rights are balanced by responsibilities, and gun enthusiasts should welcome a higher level of responsibility that protects the general public from the side-effects that can come from their pursuit.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJust started working at a sandwich shop a month ago.

So good.  by  LurkForeverin  videos[+]tomdarch -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours ago (0 children)[]tomdarch -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours agoThe key or "secret" to that style of eggs is that the egg itself never gets hotter than 154F/68C - in other words, it's semi-raw egg.  That's why he's stirring constantly and taking it off the heat - he's preventing the egg from cooking fully.  I'm not 100% grossed out by that style of egg, but it certainly does fall close to the "squidgy" food group.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlot of you have seen Ramsay's video on scrambled egg.

Chop it up like he shows (and maybe peel/chop the stems rather than throwing them away), toss in a little olive oil and roast at 425F for 8 to 10 minutes - it will concentrate the flavors, and you'll get some browning and caramelization to enhance the broccoli flavor.  In order to get it back to soup consistency, you'll be watering that flavor down a bit with, well, water, but it will be a significantly different flavor than boiled broccoli.(I'm basing this on this Alton Brown recipe, which is fucking awesome.)permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlot of you have seen Ramsay's video on scrambled egg.

But the key to the technique he's showing is that he's working hard (with the constant stirring and moving the pan on and off the heat) to keep the eggs from never getting all that hot.  At around 154F/68C they "cook" enough to get to that texture, but much hotter and they will begin to harden up and they will never be as "creamy" as this style.  The butter and crme frache are key to the flavor, but the technique is key to the texture and they combine to make this end result (which I don't like personally - maybe because I know in the back of my mind that the eggs are still semi-raw).permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlot of you have seen Ramsay's video on scrambled egg.

The trick with this style of preparation is that the egg material itself never gets all that hot - literally around 154F (68C), in order to keep them very soft and creamy.  A pretty heavy, multi-layer stainless steel pan (AKA $$$!!!) would make it much easier to apply even, moderate heat to the eggs, without the sides of the pan getting hot enough to cause the eggs to overcook and stick.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlot of you have seen Ramsay's video on scrambled egg.

Crme frache is much more mild in it's sourness (acidity) than sour cream, and cream cheese should melt pretty well in the warm eggs.edit: soft, mild goat cheese would also be a great sub in this!permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlot of you have seen Ramsay's video on scrambled egg.

His name is associated with enough restaurants that when you total the stars they have been awarded, they add up to 13.  Big whoop.  I find folks like Alain Passard or Ferran Adria much more impressive - they each had one restaurant and were in the kitchen constantly actually involved in the cooking.  In contrast, having your name associated with restaurants that are getting stars, but you aren't in them very often isn't terribly exciting.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlot of you have seen Ramsay's video on scrambled egg.

Also, Ramsay has Michelin Stars because he consciously plays the game to get them.  Wether you compare him with folks who have earned 3 stars by simply cooking what they want to cook like Adria or Achatz on the one hand or Alain Passard on the more traditional end, Ramsay is a PR driven putz.  It's nice that he sees it as profitable to do the sort of basic cooking education that OP linked to, but he is anything but influential in terms of his food - but he's highly influential in terms of his business model and celebrity status.permalinksavecontextfull commentsA friend in my Secret Santa group got this.

I'm too lazy to dig into this, but when making stuff like caramel, light corn syrup is used to prevent the normal sugar (aka sucrose) from crystalizing - you might try adding some (like a tablespoon or two) and see if it prevents or slows the formation of crystals.  It shouldn't be noticeable in terms of flavor or texture.  (I just realized - I am assuming that you are in North America where corn syrup (like Karo) is available.)permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhere is the camera?
