Some TV's also have separate audio in for HDMI too, as DVI > HDMI can be done with the proper cable, just without audio.  In either of these cases it would just take a 3.5mm to RCA cable in addition to the HDMI cable.  There are some converter things out there but they're expensive and not worth it really.permalinksavecontextfull comments[FOR SALE] Wusthof Knife Set-$175  by  kniveyknivesin  Phillylist[+]erkston 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]erkston 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoNice offer :Dpermalinksavecontextfull commentsKaya Scodelario  by  deceptivenarratorin  gentlemanboners[+]erkston 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]erkston 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago/r/kayascodelario permalinksavecontextfull commentsI think I like the off-season even more than the regular season.
