It's what happened in 1973.There is apparently a correlation between abortion and crime rate. Legalizing abortion means that fewer children of lesser means and/or less capable parents, which means that there are fewer children at higher risk of becoming criminals, which means a lower crime rate in general. With Roe v. Wade being decided in 1973, you only start to see the impact in the early 1990s, when those aborted embryos would have become late teens/early twenties.It's one of the stories in Freakonomics (the first one). If you have Netflix, there's a documentary version of Freakonomics on there which covers the abortion/crime rate correlation.The tl;dr of it is that a few states legalized abortion a few years prior to Roe v. Wade, and the drop in crime correlates with those earlier legalizations, whereas everywhere else correlates with the SCOTUS decision.Wikipedia has a long article on it as well.permalinksaveparent[+]Faltriwall 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]Faltriwall 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes ago... the ultimate in pre-crime...  *I'm not sure if I'm joking...permalinksaveparent[+]glass_daggers 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes ago (0 children)[]glass_daggers 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes agoSuper Nintendopermalinksaveparent[+]ahalenia 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]ahalenia 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoThat's all violent crime; doesn't distinguish shootings or school shootings.
