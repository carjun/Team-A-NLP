This site is nuts.  now this may seem weird, but here goes. about the same time as Hurricane Sandy in Oct, there was a media blitz (especially Today Show) about the search for the new dog to play Sandy in in the Broadway musical Annie. I noticed it at the time.with the response of:DANG.. And ANNIE is also the name one of the most famous songs of John Denver of Colorado. and his Rocky Mountain High Fame.. Colorado of course is the state of Aurora and Columbine shootings.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow long till someone else notices that SuperStorm Sandy and Sandy Hook school both contain the word "Sandy"?  by  GitEmSteveDavein  conspiratard[+]GitEmSteveDave[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]GitEmSteveDave[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoYou see this one:Also I saw the name of the town change before my eyes.

The kids were at a separate location that no one but parents could get into so that they could inform some parents and release the children to the others.  Once they left the secure location, the parents had to stop to talk to reporters.permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.

The children were in a secure location(with no reporters) and released to the parents.  After they left the fire house is when the parents pulled over and spoke to reporters with their children. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

That a company that makes stuff for the military also sells a civilian version that is made to the same specs and not marked as military?  I own a pair of BDU pants that I wear at least twice a week and are over 20 years old.  I buy military grade stuff because it's sturdier than normal. As for reports of a 2nd/multiple shooters, what happens is people see something unusual and connect the two events.  I have a family friend who was out shooting some "varmints" in his fields many years ago, and all of a sudden a helicopter flew over and police came rushing towards him. Turns out there was a bank robbery nearby, and someone reported seeing someone with a rifle(it was a .22) walking in a field, so they swarmed.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
