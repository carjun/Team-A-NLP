Did you have to shave your head?No, but it wasn't an issue if I had to. I cut it short. There are two scenes where I have to show it. But it's a comedy and a romantic story, so I was not allowed to go too deep into that. I really love the scene where she's coming out of the water. It's a metaphor for a lot of things. She's totally exposed.Why aren't there more female directors?Well, I've mostly worked with female directors, so I don't see this as such a big issue. I don't think there's so much of a difference between female and male directors. Of course, I hope women can and will work.Alec Baldwin called you the finest actress on the planet. Have you had the chance to thank him?Actually, I met him after that compliment, at the Hamptons film festival. I had two films at the festival [Dancers and Troubled Water]. He saw them and was blown away [laughs]. It's a very nice compliment. I was very honoured by it.Did you discuss [your Love Is All You Need co-star] Pierce Brosnan's experience, dealing with cancer, before the film?Of course. He is charming and very sweet. And when you work together, you share a lot of personal, private things. I have a lot of personal experience with cancer up close. I think a lot of people have. It's touched a lot of us.What about your singing? Do you still perform?Only at home! I did this Eurovision Song Contest at 14. I was young. I'm still singing it sometimes [laughs], Dancing in the Moonlight. It was only third in the Danish competition. But it was a big hit. Love Is All You Need is now showing in cinemas.Tweet      Print StorySaveLatest News Funding boosted for 'carbon and capture' project Killer forced his wayPerfect pupil's next big test - finding a jobMan dies as inflatable raft upturnsClass heroes save lives Editor's Picks Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireFun at the Clunes show.Newlyncouple shocked by truck accident Popular Blaze destroys iconicBoathouse cafeMemories flow of Daylesford's Boathouse cafeA Daylesford woman of many brushesFloats needed for DaylesfordNew Years Eve GalaDiesel shortage hits Hepburn ShireMultimediaGallery: The Boathouse Cafe burns      Gallery: Keele BreenHannah Knight catches up with local artist Keele Breen.
