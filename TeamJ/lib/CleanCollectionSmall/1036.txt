By the time he was 16, Adam Lanza enrolled in courses at Western Connecticut State University and managed to earn a B average over the next year while studying philosophy, macroeconomics and history.Lanza, who shot himself this week after killing 26 students and staff at a Connecticut elementary school, did not appear to show up for his senior year at Newtown High School with the rest of the 2010 graduating class, but enrolled in a pair of college computer classes in summer 2008, university officials confirmed Sunday.He went on that fall to study data modeling  a class from which he withdrew  and introduction to ethical theory, earning a C in that class.PHOTOS: Connecticut school shootingIn spring 2009, he earned an A- in American history but dropped out of a German class he was on the verge of failing, according to university officials and a professor.He got a B in macroeconomics in summer 2009, ending his stint at the university with a cumulative GPA of 3.26.Paul Steinmetz, interim associate vice president for institutional advancement at the Danbury, Conn.-based university, said having a student enroll in college so young was rare, but not unique.Usually students in this situation are concurrently enrolled in high school or home-schooled, he said.A family member said that Lanzas mother, who was shot to death by her son before the attack at the school, had had conflicts with administrators at Newtown High School and had pulled him out of class for home-schooling.Neighbors and others familiar with the family said Lanza rode the bus with other neighborhood children for at least his first year of elementary school at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where the shootings occurred.Authorities still have not revealed what clues, if any, might suggest a motivation for the attacks.At Newtown High School, students have said Lanza cut a quiet profile, making few friends because of his extreme shyness. Family members told others that Lanza, who was 20 when he died, may have suffered from Aspergers syndrome, a mild form of autism characterized by strong cognitive abilities but social awkwardness.Olivia DeVivo, who attended Newtown High with Lanza, said he was very fidgety and quiet and had a nervous disposition.He didnt participate in class, but I dont think it was because he was unintelligent  I think he felt very uncomfortable talking in public, she said. When he was called on, he would get really nervous to speak. His face would get bright red.Kateleen Foy, who was in Lanzas seventh-grade class at St. Rose of Lima School in Newtown, said he joined the class after the school year began and left before it ended.He was just really shy, really shy, she said. I know I said hi to him once or twice, [but] he was really  hard to talk to.At the university, not far from his home, Lanza appeared to cut a low profile. It was hard finding anyone who remembered him.WHO THEY WERE: Shooting victimsHis German professor, Renate Ludanyi, said she barely remembered him, though her records showed she gave him a repeat at the end of his time there  just short of failing. I must have had some hope that he was smart and could do it again, instead of really flunking him, she said.She said Lanza took one test, in which he was not outstanding, and then failed to take the final.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Times12next|  single pageComments24Comments (24)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQTrisha10 at 12:11 PM December 17, 2012                who cares about his gpa? the 20 children he killed will never earn a gpa. this is not about gun control, it is about a problem child that was probably emotionally distrubed and needed medication left at home with an arsenal of weapons. makes no sense and no excuses for him. he was weird and a coward.ontheupandup at 12:02 PM December 17, 2012                I wonder what the religious atmosphere, if any, was in his household.If he was an atheist he wouldn't have had concerns about any judgment day, otherwiselikelyswiftlycoming to himright after killing himself. At any rate, it'sprobably safe to say that there areno "sixteen virgins" waiting for this guyin heaven...or hell!areyou solame at 7:48 AM December 17, 2012                Everyone is shouting "gun control" but in this case the guns were legally purchased and registered. Seems that the mother's belief that her son was a safe gun owner is what allowed Adam to have access to them in the home (versus being locked up with a combo only the mother knew).My concern here is not with guns because with any killing device, people who want to get their hands on one, will. Legally or not.The issue is mental health care. If this kid was so off-balance for so many years, why didn't the parents get him the help that he needed?If they didn't notice he needed help, what about the other people in his life? Doctor? Teacher? Pastor/Rabbi?Neighbor?People are saying that the mother "did everything she could" to help him grow and progess, but hey--maybe her best wasn't good enough. Was she qualified to diagnose his issue/potential for harm?Probably not, that is why there are trained medical specialists...but people need to have the courage to USE them or they're of no value. What does the kids' regular doctor say? Isn't he partly culpable? Areparents ashamed for their kid to see a psychiatrist?You can tip off the DMV about an elderly person who seems to not be a danger at the wheel. Are thereprograms to tip off the authorities to someone's mental state? About someone potentiallyunsafe to be out and about in public?Orwellian, I know, but necessary?Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
