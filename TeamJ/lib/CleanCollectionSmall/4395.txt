This time, the shooter killed 27 people, including his elementary-schoolteacher mother, her principal and 20 children, most of them kindergartners. Then the shooter killed himself.Friday mornings massacre in Newtown, Conn.  the second-deadliest shooting event in U.S. history  took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where more than 600 children from kindergarten through fourth grade spend their days. About 9:30 a.m., the day was interrupted by a burst of sound on the school intercom: screams. Loading...CommentsWeigh InCorrections?Personal PostVideoFriday's deadly mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. has been one in a "terrible" year in terms of the number of incidences similar to this one.Updates from ConnecticutA look at the minute-by-minute updates as the shootings story unfolded: Confusion over suspected shooters identity; 20 children killed; Gun violence protest outside White House; President Obama  speaks on Newtown, Connecticut school shootingPresident Obama spoke at the White House,  wiping tears from his eyes as he addressed the mass shooting.I am ashamed to be an American Washington Post Staff LIVE BLOG | Todays shooting has elicited a flood of emotional tweets. Here are a few that stuck out.The worlds deadliest mass shootingsTIMELINE | Scroll through for information on some of the deadliest mass shootings around the world.That was enough for some teachers to move their students away from doors and windows. In one room, a teacher locked her students in a closet, a move parents said saved their childrens lives. In another class, a teacher heard two blasts and ordered students into a corner.Jessica Eisele, a fourth-grader at Sandy Hook, was in the gym when the shooting began.  On the loudspeaker, there was screaming and crying and she heard gunshots and then silence, said her brother Nick, 15.A janitor ran through the halls, shouting that a gunman was in the building. Witnesses heard dozens of pops coming from two classrooms and a hallway.In the main office, the principal, vice principal and school psychologist heard the noise and stepped into the hall to investigate. A witness told CNN that the vice principal crawled back into the office after being shot in the foot. The principal and psychologist were later found dead.Around Newtown, word spread by text, phone and the sound of dozens of emergency vehicles thundering toward the school. At Berkshire Motors, owner Jim Marcucilli thought he saw 40 police cruisers speed by. He had been working on a car, but its owner, frantic, demanded her keys back. Oh, my God, she said, I have to get my kid.Joseph Wasik, 42, wasnt too worried when his wife, Lynn, called to say she had received a text alert from the school. Like schools nationwide, Sandy Hook had been on lockdown before, always for events that turned out to be nothing. Earlier this year, reports of a loose bear seen in town had activated the system. But when Wasik flipped open his laptop and saw a report of a school shooting, he got in his car and headed to Sandy Hook, where his daughter Alexis is a third-grader. I flew down there, said Wasik, an electrician.When he arrived, the backup of emergency vehicles and panicked parents extended half a mile beyond the school. Wasik parked on the first lawn he could find and ran. It was chaos, cars blocking everything, a SWAT team, he said. All these parents screaming for their kids.Children were ushered out of the building, instructed to close their eyes as adults guided them through the halls. Some were so scared they vomited. The students were moved into the parking lot, single file, hands on one anothers shoulders. Some wept, some smiled, some stared at the pavement. A few of the children had blood on their clothes.Helicopters circled above and dozens of emergency vehicles arrived from nearby towns. Firefighters rushed over to parents holding children and wrapped them in blankets to warm them from the December chill.Continued123Next PageEmailTumblrRedditStumbleuponDiggDeliciousDiscussion Policy | FAQ | About DiscussionsLoading...CommentsAdd your commentRead what others are sayingAbout BadgesSuperFan BadgeSuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.More about badges | Request a badgeCulture Connoisseur BadgeCulture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.More about badges | Request a badgeFact Checker BadgeFact Checkers contribute questions, information and facts to The Fact Checker.More about badges | Request a badgeWashingtologist BadgeWashingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.More about badges | Request a badgePost Writer BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.Post Forum BadgePost Forum members consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on politics, national and international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgeWeather Watcher BadgeWeather Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on climates and forecasts.More about badges | Request a badgeWorld Watcher BadgeWorld Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgePost Contributor BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post contributor.
