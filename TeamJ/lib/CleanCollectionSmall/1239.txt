The White House, seeking rises on tax rates above $250,000, rejected the offer.Boehner didnt solely offer the millionaires bracket, he also wants social insurance cuts in exchange:Boehner also wants to use a new method of calculating benefits for entitlement programs known as chained CPI, which would slow the growth of Medicare and other federal health programs and save hundreds of billions over the next decade.The speakers offer would not include extending federal unemployment benefits, and it is unclear how it would address sequestration  the tens of billions in spending cuts scheduled to go into effect for the Pentagon and other federal agencies starting Jan. 2.And Republicans remain unyielding on agreeing to raise the U.S. debt limit as part of any agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff.Boehners offer on tax rates was a significant move toward Obamas position. But the proposal, as a whole, still isnt acceptable to Democrats because of the level of revenue, the changes to entitlement programs that would hit beneficiaries and the absence of an extension for unemployment insurance benefits, according to a source familiar with the talks. The president has also been adamant that any deal include an increase in the debt ceiling.You mostly see chained CPI relative to Social Security.  There isnt really any such thing as a Medicare cost of living adjustment.  So thats probably just a mistake.  The chained CPI would slow the cost of living increase across a range of programs, including Social Security, food stamps, and veterans benefits; basically anything with a monetary award that includes a COLA.  Its also a regressive tax increase if applied to tax brackets, about the most stealth tax increase you can muster.I wouldnt call this a significant move toward the White House position at all.  It leaves out unemployment benefits, it leaves out the debt limit, its ambiguous at best on the sequester, and it goes not even halfway toward the tax rate increase.  Thats why the White House quickly rejected it.Meanwhile, Boehner is losing support in the other chamber.  Senate Republicans are more inclined to have the House pass the tax bill that already made it through the Senate, which would extend the Bush-era tax cuts on only the first $250,000 of income, increase capital gains taxes for high-income earners, patch the alternative minimum tax for 2012 only, and extend three stimulus-era tax breaks for the middle class and working poor, among other measures.Republicans have some options.  The House could pass a bill that includes the extension of the tax rates on the first $250,000 of income, paired with some of their priorities, like extending the estate tax at their preferred levels (with a $5 million threshold for the individual and a 35% marginal rate above that), or keeping the capital gains tax rate at 15% for top earners (the Senate bill increases that to 20%).  The media would read that as a concession to Democrats, but Democrats in the Senate would then have to agree to levels on capital gains and estates that they do not prefer.Of course, the main strategic goal for Republicans is to get the tax issue out of the way, and then fight on the higher ground of the debt limit, in an effort to force bigger safety net and spending concessions, and possibly even individual and corporate tax reform.4 Comments Tags: Barack Obama, Republicans, Senate, taxes, House of Representatives, Bush tax cuts, debt limit, John Boehner, fiscal slope, corporate taxes, estate tax, capital gains tax, chained CPI, COLA       4 Responses         to Boehner in Bargaining Phase: Calls for Millionaires BracketjulianiaDecember 16th, 2012 at 12:06 pm1Maybe we should just eliminate Congress all together.  (Im sure somebody could tell us how much that would save us taxpayers.)  We could put plexiglass panels in the Capitol dome and use it for the nations passive solar greenhouse and let Occupy use the steps in summer and the side chambers in winter, really get this show on the road, progressively speaking.  And that reflecting pool  just asking to be part of the system ecowise, carp, catfish, you name it And whilst we are about it, chop down those cherry trees, George, and put in a real orchard.  All that prime growing dirt is just going to waste right now, monuments and all.  The poor worms trying to survive under that MLK monstrosity!My cost of living increase for next year is 1.9%, a little more than $10 per month.  Id happily donate that towards those panels.Sorry, David, it must have been that higher ground that set me off.

Any House Rep who votes for even this compromise will face a Tea Party Primary challenge.
