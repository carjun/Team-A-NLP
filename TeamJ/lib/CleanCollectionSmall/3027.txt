I can't do anything about that. Probably better for everyone to keep that lie afloat.I had a guy tell me that for a while (I had told him it was never gonna happen but we still hung out). Finally he couldn't take it anymore and professed his undying love for me in an obscenely long text. I don't really talk to him anymore because that was just too weird and awkward and hell - I already knew that, putting it all out on the table isn't going to change anything.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAll right Reddit, time to 'fess up.What's the biggest lie you've ever told?  by  timelessdreamerin  AskReddit[+]UnicornPanties 6 points7 points8 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]UnicornPanties 6 points7 points8 points 15 days agoShe was never pregnant, trust me - I used to be a high school girl.

What's the most useful fact you know?  by  furmat60in  AskReddit[+]UnicornPanties 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]UnicornPanties 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoI generally double the first two numbers so 43.27 would be 43 + 43 = 86 = 8.60That is my 20% tip, I live in NY so that's standard. Works for me. $150 bill? Double the first two numbers and you get $30. 20% of 150 is 30. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, forget the useless facts.

I get invited to all kinds of parties on Tuesday, Wednesay, Thursday nights (at clubs) and they all START at 11pm. Really? I have to work tomorrow and if I'm not already hitting the scene by 8 or 9 I'll be in my jammies FOR SURE by 11pm. No way I'm gonna start getting ready for action at 10.30pm, I'm probably cozied up in front of the TV. I used to crave clubbing, now ... well ... it's kinda all the same.  :(permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat did you find yourself saying that officially signaled to you that you were, in fact, getting old?  by  Tamkoin  AskReddit[+]UnicornPanties 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago (0 children)[]UnicornPanties 0 points1 point2 points 16 days agoI'm trying to take a month or so off drinkning so I can work on that non-smoking thing - saw you over there too.
