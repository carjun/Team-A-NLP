Obama is a supporter of renewing a ban on the sale of assault weapons, which expired in 2004, but has not tried to move legislation through Congress.The president, a father of two, has clearly been affected by the shooting. In his first remarks on the shootings, made Friday at the White House, the typically reserved and composed president tried and failed to hold back tears as he read a brief statement.AlsoPhotos:Massacre at elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Who they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsOn Sunday, the president sat in the front row, hands folded under his chin, as he listened to prayers from local religious leaders.Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, introducing Obama, said he had spoken with the president moments earlier. Obama told him Friday was the darkest day of his presidency.Obamas remarks reflected a personal note. When a parent sends a child out to the world, he realizes he cannot always protect her alone, he said.In that way, we come to realize that we bear responsibility for every child. That were all parents, that theyre all our children. This is our first task, caring for our children. Its our first job. If we dont get that right we dont get anything right, Obama said. Thats how, as a society, we will be judged.ALSO:Sen.

But I can think of worse. Like Rwanda when close to 1million Hutus were slaughted with machettes in 1994. They had no guns to protect themselves. Pol Pot in Cambodia. The communists killed around 5MM who couldnt defend themselves. Joseph Stalin another progressive communist killed aprox 20MM. The Socail democrat Nazis killed 6MM. Look at N Korea, Venezuela etc etc etc. EVERY TIME a tirant does geocide the people are un-armed and have no way to protect themselves.....Couldn't happen here you say????CaptSkip at 5:08 PM December 18, 2012                Coming from Obama?You can keep your changehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvBmWOf8m0&feature=player_embedded#!maxxnsd at 2:47 PM December 18, 2012                Disinvestment.Back in the 80s when the world wanted to affect positive change in South Africa and end apartheid, a program of monetary warfare, aka disinvestment, was undertaken. Colleges, universities, municipalities and States refused to invest in Apartheid and divested themselves of any company doing business in South Africa.It is time for Americans to disinvest in the slaughter of our citizens.Beginning today, I ask all people  colleges, universities, unions, municipalities and States, to shed any investment they hold in the companies that manufacture weapons and/or ammunition.It is time to end the blood-shed. It is time to end the slaughter of innocents.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required. The Times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy.
