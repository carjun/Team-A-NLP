With Siri, you can get directions, set timers and reminders, add things to your calendar, IN ADDITION TO texting and calling contacts easily (more easily than in the Lumia 920, I'll add).  The only thing the 920's voice commands do is call or text someone (which is a two step process vs 1 step for Siri by the way, first I have to say "text john" then say the message, whereas with Siri, I can just say "text john he's late" and boom).  Ask if for directions and it will do a crappy Bing search.  You can't ask it to set a timer (by the way, a timer isn't even built-in, WTF?) which is very useful in the kitchen, or set a reminder, which is also very useful.This is the one part I wish was better.  I'd use it all the time, and I find myself using it anytime I'm with a friend who has an iPhone 4s/5.That said, I love my phone.  I came from 3 years on iPhone and never had Siri, but I'm so jealous of people that do.  It's the one thing severely lacking and would make it an amazing phone.permalinksavecontextfull commentsA project I did in college was just implemented...will save up to $30,000/year on campus electricity costs!!  by  Rory_the_dogin  energy[+]Rory_the_dog[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Rory_the_dog[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoDavis, CA.
