See More shoot those guns. So many victims to talk about. 26 innocent lives lost and, dan, I know you have more on that. Yes, we now know their names. They are so young, all in the first grade, august of them shot more than once by a semiautomatic rifle. They're saying defendant was swift and said this is the worst case he ever seen and home robach is more on this. This is the hardest part. Dan, it's so true. Every day we learn more about the victims and this story just gets harder and harder. This morning we know the names. We see the little faces of those sweet little boys and girls and the teachers who loved them and the parents who so ses separately miss them. 12 little girls and 8 little boys all only in first grade and the teachers who tried to save them. On saturday, photos and details of lives cut short started to emerge. The worst that I know of any of my colleagues having seen -- noah pozner had just turned 6. 7-YEAR-OLD grace McDonnell, family membering tells abc news "our daughter was the love and light of our family. Words cannot adequately express our sense of loss. Ana mark question green, they're struggling to work through this nightmare. Hubbard hubbard s-- catherine hubbard's family said "we ask that you continue to pray for us. Jesse lewis was looking forward to making gingerbred houses. He was in victoria soto's class. She was shielding some of her first graders when she died. Lauren russeau had just started as a full-time teacher in september having the best year of her life, her mother said. Mary sherlach, the school psychologist, her family said "mary felt like she was doing god's work by helping children. S she." She headed towards the shooter when it began. Joined by the principal dawn hochsprung, a mother herself, it is now believed she turned on the p.A. System when the shooting started so others could be warned of the dangers that had invaded their school. It is so difficult to find the right words after seeing how much this community has lost, but somehow, some way the father of little emilie parker found those words when he spoke to cameras outside of a newtown, connecticut church. As the deep pain begins to settle into our hearts, we find comfort reflecting on the incredible person that emilie was and how many lives that she was able to touch in her short time here on earth. Emilie was bright, creative and very loving as those were the gifts that were given to her by her heavenly father. The strength and example she showed us was remarkable. She is an incredible person. And I'm so blessed to be her dad. I don't know how to get through something like this. My wife and I don't understand how to process all of this and how to get our lives going. I'm not mad because I have to make sure that I use this event to do what I can to do whatever I can to, one, make sure that my family and my wife and my daughters are take kane care of and if there's anything I can do to help anybody anywhere, I'd be willing to do that. What an incredibly strong and brave and courageous man. My hat is certainly off to him as a parent. I don't think that I could do that. And covering this story as a parent, I know you've got three little girls, extraordinarily difficult. It is incredibly difficult. School is closed here in newtown, connecticut tomorrow, but everyone around the country, every who is going to take their school tomorrow, it is going to be a fundamentally different experience. There is a fear factor and the sense that you don't know, that elementary school isn't sacred anymore. It's not a safe place anymore that we once thought it would be and a lot of parents will hug their parents more tighter before they send them off. Taking things not so much for granted anymore. I know lara in the broadcast and you will be back about how to talk to children about this. Amy, excellent reporting.
