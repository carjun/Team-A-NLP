A good guy will come along eventually. You've got plenty of time anyway, so don't rush yourself and only do things you know you're ready for.

I can't see that changing, and in all honesty, I do find people who are overwhelmed by baby cuteness to be very odd, but if that's what floats their boat, go for it.Just don't drag me into it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI think he may be a wee bit insecure...  by  sugarhoneybadgerin  TwoXChromosomes[+]you-would-know 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]you-would-know 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoThis is one of the most disturbing blogs I've ever had the misfortune to read.What a vile human being.

Because it looks like you don't." Men aren't beyond getting involved either, with ex's telling me that my spine made me "look like a dinosaur" and that I was "so skinny that it's disgusting." This is literally just my natural size, I can't help it. I eat lots, the majority of it being quite healthy though, but it doesn't make any difference. It does affect your self-esteem massively, having people constantly judging your body size, health and eating habits. You start wondering, "Am I a freak? Is there something wrong with me? I wish I was more like Christina Hendricks or whatever."It's just not cool.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadians love lost rabbits!  by  Majormapleleaf1in  Rabbits[+]you-would-know 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]you-would-know 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoAw!

And it's not "seeking karma"; we just both really like this section of Reddit.I fail to see how posting his new bun is a cause for concern. Not trying to be rude here btw.(Btw, girlfriend here, who actually does own an adopted rabbit - 3 year old Dutch.) permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo, adopted a little baby bunny.
