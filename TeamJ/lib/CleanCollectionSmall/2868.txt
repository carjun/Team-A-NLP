We both stopped eating and just stared at the screen as the numbers were coming out. I was praying there were no children injured.. just a false dream.

Maintenance wise, you won't have to worry about coil packs or spark plugs, few other things saving around $1k. The only draw back is filling up, at a cost of $4.27 in CT, but for my puny 13 gallon tank, it roughly equals out to what I used to pay to fill up my Subaru. Do more reading into the Mazda and what it has to offer as more information comes up. There is plenty of information on the internet, all depends on the practicality of how you plan to use the car.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMazda will offer a diesel Mazda6 in the US next year.  by  CraigRCarterin  cars[+]LesShots 4 points5 points6 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]LesShots 4 points5 points6 points 15 days agoI'll stick with my diesel VW.
