Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]accel169 10 points11 points12 points 34 minutes ago*(0 children)[]accel169 10 points11 points12 points 34 minutes ago*I am from Newtown, CT and I live right down the road from Sandy Hook Elementary... I grew up here but went to a different elementary school. Please pray for all the families affected as well as our town. If anyone in the area wants to talk or vent feel free to PM me. This situation is downright horrifying, and I will keep updating what I hear from families and the CT state police.Edit: 27 dead is confirmed by NBC Connecticut, claiming 18 children included. Also a second person is in custody, they are trying to figure out what part he played in the incident.Edit: Paul Vance from CT State Police about to give details. He is not confirming the number of deaths, but has confirmed that adults and children were killed in the shooting. President Obama has pledged to give whatever resources needed to the effected families. They have made it clear they won't be answering any questions until they have another briefing. They claim the area is now secure, though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGMAIL is down, repeat, GMAIL is down!  by  rockaportin  technology[+]accel169 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]accel169 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoTHIS JUST IN..
