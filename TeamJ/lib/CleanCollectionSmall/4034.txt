Then, it was a place of fear and grief.On Friday morning, officials directed teachers and students to safety at the firehouse around the corner from Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a gunman had opened fire on children and teachers.But by the evening, the firehouse had been transformed into the shooting rampage's epicenter of sorrow, where authorities sent families to wait for news of their missing loved ones.A gunman opened fire at a Connecticut elementary school where his mother worked, killing 26 people, including 20 children. The shooter was found dead inside the school and another person was found dead elsewhere in Newtown, putting the total toll at 28. Aaron Rutkoff has details on The News Hub. Streams of officials, counselors, rabbis, priests and frightened families descended on the modest one-story Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire & Rescue Co. building, its roof festooned with Christmas lights that sent a glow across the night sky on a chilly evening.More:Streaming Coverage: Live Updates and VideoHow to Talk to Your Children About the ShootingsMetropolis: Newtown School Therapist: Principal 'Didn't Think Twice' About HelpingMetropolis: Teacher Describes Shooting at Newtown SchoolWashington Wire: Shaken Obama Says Hearts 'Broken,' Pledges ActionRelated VideoDavid Cullen, author of the book "Columbine," joins The News Hub to discuss what would cause someone to commit a mass shooting such as the one that left at least two dozen dead at a Connecticut school.

Photo: AP.In a news conference at the White House, an emotional President Barack Obama reacts to a shooting at a Connecticut elementary school that has left at least 25 people deadGilles Rousseau and his wife rushed to Newtown Town Hall after learning of the shooting at the workplace of their 30-year-old daughter, Lauren Rousseau, a substitute teacher. They consoled themselves with the thought that their daughter never brought her cellphone into the school and couldn't have called them."I'm 98% sure she'll be OK," Mr. Rousseau said on Friday afternoon at Town Hall.Then, he and other family members were ushered to the firehouse. They walked into a large, open area where firetrucks normally parked. The space was filled with folding tables, throngs of officials and groups of families. A series of people asked for his daughter's name, and what she had been doing at the school.When he asked the officials if they knew about his daughter's whereabouts, they demurred, he said."They were telling us nothing. They weren't telling anybody anything. But three families started screaming and crying," he said.He and his wife finally left, frustrated by the lack of information. He said they were told to expect a call. By 5:45, they were sitting alone in their homes, still waiting."It doesn't look good," he said Friday evening. "If she were alive, they would have taken her out of there. It looks bad. We're trying to hold ourselves together."Officials summoned grief counselors from around the state.Tom Quinn, a psychotherapist called in to help counsel families, said that the scene was strangely calm. "I thought there would be more people in tears," he said.Firefighters and police officers also received counseling. "This was a very tragic, horrific scene that they encountered," said Lt. J. Paul Vance, spokesman for the Connecticut State Police.Write to                 Sophia Hollander at sophia.hollander@wsj.comA version of this article appeared December 15, 2012, on page A7 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Hope Turns to Sorrow as Families Wait for Word.Copyright 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
