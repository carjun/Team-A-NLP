Can someone please let me know what their personal exprience with the uni is like?  by  999realthingsin  northernireland[+]enjee 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]enjee 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoIf you're studying at the Jordanstown campus I'd suggest looking for a room in a flat in Belfast rather than staying in the halls of residence. UUJ is quite a bit outside the city centre and it can be a real pain getting in and out at night if you're meeting someone in Belfast and have nobody to share a taxi with. There's a train stop just up the road, but with the last train at around 11 it's not much good for a night out. There's also not much to do in the area. If I had it to do again I'd definitely look for a flat in Belfast.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOprah has relaunched her influential book club.

He still holds Tig accountable for Opie's death. The plan was always for Pope to die but if Tig were to get killed in the progress then I think that would have been acceptable. Maybe he changed his mind at the last minute about Tig, or maybe that was the plan all along and he knew Pope would have wanted to make Tig suffer and thus wouldn't have killed him as soon as he walked into the shed.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHas anyone else developed a crush on her or is it just me  by  splice123in  Sonsofanarchy[+]enjee 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]enjee 1 point2 points3 points 8 days agoYeah, give her a good hate-fucking.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat did you just finish reading? What are you reading right now? What's next?  by  smellsmoistin  books[+]enjee 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]enjee 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoJust finished: No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy. Thoroughly enjoyed it. This was the first book in a while that I can say I was fully immersed in; a real page turner. McCarthy's style has really grown on me, too.Currently reading: The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien. Read it as a kid but don't remember a whole pile. With part one of the film coming out I thought now was a good a time as any to re-read it. Only about 70 pages in, but I'm enjoying it so far.Next: Probably going to read A Christmas Carol by Dickens to go along with r/bookclub. Quite a short read, so I hope to finish The Hobbit and read this over the weekend. I got to about 1/3 of the way through A Confederacy of Dunces before putting it back on the shelf, so I'll probably get back to that next. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe books for December have been chosen!  by  thewretchedholein  bookclub[+]enjee 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]enjee 1 point2 points3 points 12 days agoWas actually planning on reading A Christmas Carol in the next week or two anyway.
