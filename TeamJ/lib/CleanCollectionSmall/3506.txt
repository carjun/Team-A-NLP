See More And we are getting a more complete picture of the gunman as police try to learn more about why 20-year-old adam lanza went on his bloody rampage. Abc's chief investigative correspondent brian ross is here with the latest. Brian, you're happening the weapons he used were likely licensed to his mother who is described as a gun enthusiast. Correct according to people on the scene. Authorities are moving with more developments likely to come today in their efforts to determine the how and the why of this stunning crime. Police say they have already found important clues in their home where the killer's mother, 52-year-old nancy lanza was the first victim. Hopefully painting the complete picture as to how and more importantly why this occurred. Reporter: Authorities now say nancy lanza owned the same style of guns that her son used to kill her and the 26 victims at the elementary school. The medical examiner said most were killed with multiple shots from the high-pourered semiautomatic rifle. This is probably the worst i have seen. The connection between adam lanza and the sandy hook elementary school goes back to the time he went to school there and his mother worked as a teacher's aide. According to add gam's aunt. I know she had issues with school. She eventually wound up home schooling him. She battled with the school district and what took place I'm not 100% certain if it was behavior. Reporter: As a fuller picture of adam lanza began to emerge including his membership in the tech club, he was a smart but socially awkward student. He always carried a briefcase. Reporter: Adam's parents peter and nancy lanza went through an uncontested divorce and adam's aunt said that nancy had purchased so many weapons because she was concerned for her safety living alone. I think no reason why nancy may have had them for self-defense and no other reason. Reporter: Friends have told us that nancy lanza enjoyed taking her sons to the firing range for practice. She could have been there when he was learning how to shoot those guns. 1View CommentABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSshows:GMAGMA LIVE!GMA Recipes GMA Concert SeriesWorld NewsWorld News with David MuirNightline20/20Most Fascinating People Primetime NightlineDiane Sawyer SpecialsPrimetimeThis WeekWhat Would You Do?World News NowABC News NowPlaylist:GMA: 12/18/12GMA: 12/17/12GMA: 12/16/12GMA: 12/15/12GMA: 12/14/12GMA: 12/12/12GMA Birthday WishesGMA Backstage PassAround the WatercoolerHome > Video > GMA > GMA: 12/16/12Watch the Full EpisodeGMA 12/16: Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting Triggers Gun Control DebatePastor Explains How Girl Played Dead to Survive; Adam Lanza Got Guns From Mother Pastor Explains How Girl Played Dead to Survive Pastor Explains How Girl Played Dead to SurviveLara Spencer gets firsthand account of a little girl's tale of survival.Newtown Board of Education Spokesperson Speaks About the TragedyNewtown Board of Education Spokesperson Speaks About the TragedyBill Hart has the latest information from Sandy Hook Elementary school.Adam Lanza Got Guns From Gun Owning MotherAdam Lanza Got Guns From Gun Owning MotherBrian Ross investigates Sandy Hook gunman's access to deadly weapons.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Remembering the VictimsSandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Remembering the VictimsAmy Robach describes the impact of the tragedy on the local community.Connecticut Shooting: Churches Services Honor VictimsConnecticut Shooting: Churches Services Honor VictimsJuju Chang details the emotional candlelight vigil in Newtown, Conn.Hillary Clinton Suffers Concussion After FaintingHillary Clinton Suffers Concussion After FaintingDavid Kerley reports the latest on the Secretary of State's health scare.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Americans and GunsSandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Americans and GunsPierre Thomas looks into the spotlight the Connecticut shooting has placed on America's thriving gun community.Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Explaining the TragedySandy Hook Elementary Shooting: Explaining the TragedyWillow Bay explains how to answer children's questions about the shooting.1 of 1External links are provided for reference purposes.
