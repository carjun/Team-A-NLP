You are making very grand generalizations. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI recall a member of TSOL talking about how rap music like NWA encompasses the punk spirit and I happen to agree, what about you guys?  by  Durpinkindin  punk[+]I_ruined_everything 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]I_ruined_everything 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoI agree, but as far as the violence they address is concerned, I think it depends on the Punk ethic you are talking about. If your an anarchist, yes, if your a Baypunk, not as much. Some punks want to stop violence (like Fifteen, Op Ivy, 7 Seconds, Minor Threat) and some promote it (GG). If doing what you want and saying what you think is what you are getting at, that is not a skill or a trait only unique to punk. That's human nature. Punk is very osmotic and takes on traits of all that is around it and shows a mirror to society, much like hip-hop. Punk is very broad and I think a little 'deeper.' Shock is only 25%. It doesn't always use broad strokes of the pen.  NWA was all about saying what wasn't said yet, punk did the same, but not on MTV, so no one gave a shit. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL ...
