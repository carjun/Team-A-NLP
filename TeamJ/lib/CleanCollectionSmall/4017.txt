Wayne Carver II, who held a press conference this afternoon  only the second in his career  in Newtown, Ct. "This probably is the worst I have seen or the worst I know of any of my colleagues have seen."Carver, who said he conducted seven autopsies himself, said the victims he examined had been struck between three and eleven times, and that wounds were "all over" the victims' bodies. He said he believed all of the children killed were first-graders, who had gone to school that morning dressed in normal children's attire."The kind of stuff you'd send your kids or grandkids out the door to first grade in. Cute kids' stuff," he said.Carver said all the shots he knew of had come from the rifle involved in the shooting. He described the injuries as "a very devastating set of injuries," but said he had not shed a tear over the tragedy yet."Notice I said yet,' Carver stressed.State police said the names would be made available on the Connecticut state police web site.Autopsies were completed by 1:30 p.m. today, and bodies were being released to funeral homes, Carver said. Ten technicians were involved in conducting the autopsies, he said.More than 24 hours after a gunman forced his way into an elementary school in the quiet Connecticut town, Newtown is reeling from the massacre of 26 adults and children. Police since morning had been preparing to release the identities of the victims, after the medical examiner finished his investigation. All of the families have already been notified.Carver said identifications had been made through photographs of the victims' faces. "It's easier on the families," he said. "There is a time and a place for up close and personal."RELATED COVERAGE: Guns used in Connecticut massacre purchased legally, registered to shooter's mother Police may have evidence of why Connecticut shooter went on rampage Reports: Gunman had altercation at school days before shooting Profile of an alleged killer emerges in aftermath of Conn. shooting Connecticut school shooting: Psychologist killed had family in South JerseySome of the names have already leaked out. Family members and law enforcement sources say school principal Dawn Hochsprung, first grade teacher Victoria Soto and school psychologist Mary Sherlach are among the dead. Sherlach has ties to Gloucester County, New Jersey, where her daughter lives.Law enforcement sources also say the shooter, Adam Lanza, killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, at her home before forcing his way into the school. Adam Lanza, 20, shot himself at the school after his shooting spree. His brother, Ryan, lives in Hoboken and was misidentified as the gunman in early reports yesterday.Michelle Saviano attended Newtown High with Adam Lanza, graduating two years ahead of him. She, like many others in town, said she does not have any strong memories of the quiet student.I probably walked past him in the hallway every day and wouldnt know him from anybody else, said Saviano, 22, a medical secretary who is studying psychology at Norwalk Community College.EnlargeSaed Hindash/The Star-LedgerDanielle Collins, of Waterbury, CT., lights a candle with her children during a candle light vigil Friday Dec. 14, 2012 at St Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church in Newtown, CT. A service was held for all the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. 27 people were shot and killed at the school, including 20 children and 6 teachers.

The couple is awaiting the release of the list of the victims.My fianc is really scared that some of the kids from his class were murdered, said Saviano. Its a scary thing. Its a small town, nothing ever happens here and all my friends are posting on Facebook, Can Newtown please go back to the town no one ever heard of?Police said this morning they have evidence found at Sandy Hook and Lanza's house that could help explain why he forced his way into the school. NBC News is also reporting Lanza was in a confrontation with four people at the school in the days before the shooting. Three of those four adults are among the dead.Investigators found at least three guns were found at the shooting scene a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer pistol inside the school and a .223-caliber rifle in the back of a car, according to law enforcement sources who spoke to the Associated Press. Lanza, who was 20, was too young to own guns under state law. But his mother had legally registered four weapons and his father legally owned two weapons, according to the Associated Press.Debora Seifert, a spokeswoman from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, would not verify whether the guns were registered to Nancy Lanza.Several local gunshops and shooting ranges either denied selling guns to the Lanza family or declined to comment when asked whether members of the family were customers.But gun experts said the weapons used in the shooting  a Glock, a Sig-Saur and a .223 caliber rifle  are regularly carried by police departments and military personnel. John Eldridge, an associate at Parker Gunsmithing in Bethel, Conn., said the popularity of those models has grown because they are relatively light, easy to use and easy to clean. "This person is a maniac who never should have been able to own or access fire arms," said Eldridge, who added that neither Adam nor Nancy Lanza were patrons of his business.Staff writer Jessica Calefati contributed to this report.Follow @starledgerRelated StoriesAuthorities release list of victim names in school massacre Newtown, nation awaiting list of victims killed in school massacreCopyright 2012 NJ.com.
