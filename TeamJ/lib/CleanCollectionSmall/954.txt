Lots of technical info, and good history in there too, Dark Sun also has a huge amount about the Russian espionage in the manhattan project, that Roosevelt allowed to happen because of his communist nature. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWould it be possible to dampen or completely cancel a Tsunami wave by sending the same wave pattern in the opposite direction?  by  batmanEXPLOSIONin  askscience[+]Truck43 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]Truck43 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours agoActually, you'd want the same amplitude, but 180 degrees out of phase.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJews visiting Copenhagen have been advised not to wear religious symbols in public  by  nafiozin  worldnews[+]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoAs necessaryhttp://i.imgur.com/6ODaJ.jpgpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the most dangerous situation that you have been in?  by  amywamyin  AskReddit[+]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago (0 children)[]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoOn the roof of a burning high school while the Mohegan Indian fire dept (incompetent assclowns) was cutting a big ass hole behind me. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGood Guy Anderson Cooper says no.  by  scoobsteinin  news[+]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoDoes anyone else think that journalists for the most part are no better than the idiots that dive into discussion threads to post "first" ?

But, when they "need" to travel to specialized clinics across the country for treatment, all travel expenses are covered by the state along with treatment, so, instead of flying or taking the train for a couple hundred bucks, they go by taxi, to Wisconsin. Oh , and of course, the cab is owned by someone in their community.permalinksavecontextfull commentsU.S. judge says victims' bodies can prevent rape  by  moviegeek81in  news[+]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoYes, if that bodies hand is holding a pistol, but California prohibits that, don't you?Other than that, this guy needs to be removed from the bench, period.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo a mob destroys a hot dog vendor's stand, calls him a "nigger," it's on video, victim tells his story, and it's not on the major networks?  by  dbe944in  news[+]Truck43 -11 points-10 points-9 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]Truck43 -11 points-10 points-9 points 1 day ago*No, and it won't be , because as much as they deny it, every mainstream media outlet has a strong liberal bias, and they always , always , will bury a story that makes their side look bad. Remember when those congressmen claimed, with zero evidence, that they were called "nigger" by a  tea party rally? Huge news, interviews, demands for "civility" , but no proof that it ever happened. This time, union thugs, on the correct side politically, assault people, destroy property, use racial slurs, all on video, and it never happened , apparently, because the press supports their political stance. and see, can't handle the truth, or contradict it in any way, downvote instead. typical behavior, thanks for proving the point, you learned well from your example in the media.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRabbi who fought against child sex abuse is attacked with bleach - 'Revenge' street assault comes one day after the conviction of prominent offender  by  shallahin  news[+]Truck43 18 points19 points20 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Truck43 18 points19 points20 points 1 day agoThe hasids are among the worst groups of religious fanatics out there. They are about one suicide bombing different than islamics .  Furthermore, they have institutionslized welfare fraud, and abuse of every social system. An example: the kiryas joel community in NY used to pay the nearby town of Monroe for fire protection frim their volunteer FD, because they didnt have a fire department. Then, they figured out that if they bought an old truck, and opened a volunteer department of their own, but didn't bother to staff it, they could call Monroe for every alarm under mutual aid, and get it for free.They get whatever they want because they all vote how the rabbi tells them, so every NY democrat bribes them for votes. Clinton pardoned one if their criminals in his last year of office, and bought 30k votes for Hilary that way, when Mario cuomo was governor in the 80s, he hired a rabbi as "spiritual advisor" to the state police, for almost 100k a year, plus a state car and driver, no hasids in the NYSP, of course. permalinksavecontextfull commentsJews visiting Copenhagen have been advised not to wear religious symbols in public  by  nafiozin  worldnews[+]Truck43 133 points134 points135 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Truck43 133 points134 points135 points 1 day agoOr a civilized human being.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEd Miliband: every Briton should speak English  by  heisakukosawain  worldnews[+]Truck43 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Truck43 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoTough, no country is obligated to accept people that make no effort to assimilate and add to the nation, and isolating oneself in a group of their former countrymen does not add value to the host nation. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the Mens Rights Movement as a Hate Group  by  DreadlockedCanuckin  todayilearned[+]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Truck43 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoEssentially they're a political advocacy group, their methods are to call everyone that they disagree with racist. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL that The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the Mens Rights Movement as a Hate Group  by  DreadlockedCanuckin  todayilearned[+]Truck43 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Truck43 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoThey call everyone that disagrees with them, or their methods a hate group, and are probably one themselves by their own metrics.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
