Enforcing a no-talking rule for Ponderosa jurors would be incredibly different, not to mention awful for the jurors. A lot of them would check out of the experience entirely and would be messes at the FTC.Anyway, numerous contestants have said they talked to each other in the pre-game phase and even made alliances. If they can't enforce no talking rules in the pre-game phase, I don't see how they do it in Ponderosa. And anyway, you could put them in solitary confinement until the FTC, but those who want to influence other jurors would just stand up and address the jury with their thoughts like David Murphy, Erik Cardona, Sue Hawk did etc making it all a waste of time. permalinksavecontextfull comments18123Twelve year sentence for tourist's murder (stuff.co.nz)submitted 9 days ago by TERQN to newzealandcommentsharecancelloading...AMA I was Carters roommate before he went on survivor...  by  badluckwilliamin  survivor[+]TERQN 3 points4 points5 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]TERQN 3 points4 points5 points 9 days agoHow about from past seasons?

The bad kind of recruit, that is.Rebecca Boreman was probably the weakest cast member and she was a superfan applicant.
