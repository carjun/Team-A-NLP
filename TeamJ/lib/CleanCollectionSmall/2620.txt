I've spent much of my time awkwardly removing myself from such conversations.I've found that open windows are best. Making your exit through one will change the subject almost immediately.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThat Australian hurdler is back.

I need help finding guidelines to web logos  by  SenorDieg0in  web_design[+]tranquilpie 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]tranquilpie 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoI typically don't include the sitename.tld in the logo if it's a .com.However, I sometimes include it if it's another tld. I keep it there for a year or so, until the site has some developed roots. I don't think it's a bad thing to include a URL in the logo if it's not a .com.From my experience it does help provide a visual they're on a .net, .org, etc.A good design can make it subtle.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRedditors from non-English speaking countries: what is internet culture like in your first language?  by  Falsum2in  AskReddit[+]tranquilpie 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tranquilpie 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoCouple of questions ... Are Japanese aware of how their animation culture is idolized on the internet here? Every once in a while I'll see some Japanese criticism of how that niche is glorified in the US.I've heard some Japanese criticize their US counterparts who believe they live in a world of Hello Kitty and constant 'KAWAII!!!'. From what I understand Japanese youth are still hurting from 'the lost generation'. Just wondering how that translates into internet culture, and their possible resentment of western interpretations.On the other side. Here in the western world Japan is known as the place to go for WTF porn. Overall, what's internet porn like in Japan? Is it much more tame than we imagine, or is there competition in Japan to create the next mind melt of filth?permalinksavecontextfull commentsAn amazing tribute to Dave Chappelle and his escape from Hollywood.  by  CaptainAmericanin  videos[+]tranquilpie 230 points231 points232 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]tranquilpie 230 points231 points232 points 1 day agoHey, hey, hey - That's Charles Sciascia you're talking about. A quick google search tells me that Charles is 'an internet entrepreneur who utilizes the internet and social networks to turn ideas into a profitable & micro manageable business websites.' - CharlesSciascia.comA quick look through many of his highly profitable sites I discovered his ingenious idea of reposting youtube videos. He's the real fucking deal.

I just watched the trilogy over the weekend, my first time seeing TDKR. I didn't like it. I agree with all that you posted.In addition, it's really jarring watching all three back to back. I realize eight years has passed between TDK and TDKR, but they don't flow into each other as well as BB to TDK.What was really jarring was that there were so many call backs to the previous two movies - Ras Al Guhl and Harvey Dent, yet not a mention of the Joker. After all the chaos and terror he caused, he must have been heavily sedated. I understand not wanting to put another actor in the role owned by Heath Ledger, but a reference to the Joker would have helped.Perhaps Tahlia could mention that it was time to bring Gotham to its knees when a clown was able to bring it to chaos. Just some reference to the chaos of 8 years ago. I mean, even Scarecrow returned!permalinksavecontextfull commentsFox Nation Headline: 'Rachel Madd-Cow Gets A Grammy Nomination?' - Either Fox Nation has an intern doing its headlines or it has no shame in its bias. Of course, the Nation page is normally more opinionated than the main site, but calling names in headlines is ridiculously childish.  by  kimat-qn-gurruodin  politics[+]tranquilpie 4 points5 points6 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]tranquilpie 4 points5 points6 points 6 days agoI think most jokes and criticisms of Palin were based on her lack of intelligence. Palin, Sean Hannity, and other conservative hacks labeled people who dared to criticize her hate speech as an 'attack on women'.Having someone as truly awful as Palin being labeled a victim due to her own ignorance devalues women who are truly victims of misogyny and sexism.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHappy Birthday?  by  DownTheHall1in  WTF[+]tranquilpie 16 points17 points18 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]tranquilpie 16 points17 points18 points 7 days agoExactly.
