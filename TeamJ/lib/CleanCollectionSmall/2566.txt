This is the real issue we should be discussing rather than more or less guns.  We're creating a society that makes everyone miserable, and people are going nuts because of it.permalinksaveparent[+]skyfail 1 point2 points3 points 34 minutes ago (0 children)[]skyfail 1 point2 points3 points 34 minutes agoWe're creating a society that makes everyone miserable Maybe, how many "misery" shootings are there? Great public ones, yes, but is it endemic? permalinksaveparent[+]SoleusRex 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]SoleusRex 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour agoThe two positions are not mutually exclusive. You can support better mental health services and still maintain that the wide availability of guns creates an unacceptable risk. I'm pretty sure no gun control activists think that our prevailing culture is peachy-keen and that it is solely the guns themselves that the reason for shootings.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 3 points4 points5 points 50 minutes ago (0 children)[]montyjack 3 points4 points5 points 50 minutes agoI do know some people who think it's just the guns themselves.  Most of them work in the media.permalinksaveparent[+]vvelox 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]vvelox 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour agoI don't think it is nothing new. It is just that with in the last few decades or so people have begun placing the blame on tools, instead of the perpetrator or the what gave rise to it.For example where I grew up in KS, there are plenty of old time mass killings that happened, but the massive change is in how they reported. It was reported as unfortunate and with the events in question, with massively less emphasis on the tool used.Another interesting thing is it seems like more recent ones seem to go after society or certain chunks of it, while older ones seemed to focus on their immediate family.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 4 points5 points6 points 46 minutes ago (1 child)[]montyjack 4 points5 points6 points 46 minutes agoYes, I've noticed this too.  Anything to place the blame on something mechanical and incidental, rather than something systemic.  No one wants to address the elephant in the room.permalinksaveparent[+]WTFReally21 2 points3 points4 points 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]WTFReally21 2 points3 points4 points 19 minutes agoExactly.  They've tried to blame video game, movies, music and guns, but no one wants to admit that there are monsters that walk among us.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
