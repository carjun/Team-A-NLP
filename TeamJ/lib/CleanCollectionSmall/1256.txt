In Newtown, many of the children will likely know one of the victims or the families through the web of social ties, including sports leagues and churches.A local plumber, who asked to remain unnamed, described how he took his three children to a local restaurant Friday night. His 3-year-old son stopped and asked if there was a shooter waiting outside.They needed to know that they were not in danger, the father said. No one is going to hurt them.ALSO:A Connecticut town reels from heartbreak Principal died in Connecticut school shooting, official confirmsSuspect in massacre tried to buy rifle days before, sources saySusman and Bennett reported from Newtown, Conn., and Muskal from Los Angeles.

STOP DISUCUSSING THEM!!!Salmon at 4:47 PM December 15, 2012                Id like to see the media focus on the shooters pathology, who knew about it, and what people close to him did to keep him from hurting people. There is ALWAYS evidence of the pending shooting! In Aurora the psychiatrist knew that the shooter was a danger to others, but did not move to involuntarily commit him. In Arizona, Many people knew of the shooters mental state, yet let him continue to live freely. Many of the other recent mass murderers families knew their son/ shooter was having difficulty fitting in or depressed or exceedingly angry. Its always too late that people act.We need to make it easier for family and friends to involuntarily commit loved ones for evaluation. The potential for saving lives far outweighs any relatively temporary suspensions of a mentally ill persons freedoms.I am tired of having to tolerate the fringe and seriously mentally ill in society because of the progressive theme of least restrictive environment for the mentally ill.Enough is enough. Its not about guns, people, its about aberrant behavior. billpeet at 4:15 PM December 15, 2012                I am sick and tired of the scared gun fetishists who stand in the way of reasonable and responsible gun policy in this country.30 years ago, there was no gun culture that centered around automatic and semi-automatic weaponry. That is a recent development. And no one can reasonably say that these kinds of tactical weapons have any true use in defense or hunting.Rather, they are for recreation. They are human-killers, and that is their sole purpose. They need to be banned.Stick to the true spirit of the 2nd Amendment--single action guns useful for hunting, and no more.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
