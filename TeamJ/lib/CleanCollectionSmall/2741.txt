I'm pretty sure more people own guns in Canada. permalinksave[+]furrowedbrow 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]furrowedbrow 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour agoWhat is mental healthcare like in Canada?  It always comes down to this.  Identify those with problems and get them treatment (and limit their ability to access guns).  It's good for everyone - the ill and society at large.permalinksaveparent[+]m4tthu 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]m4tthu 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWell I haven't really gotten to talk to anyone yet, but I'll put it this way, checked into emergency for mental health issues in late November, will have an appointment with a therapist in January. I would have been able to see someone this coming monday, but can't due to the holidays.So there's a bit of a wait, but if you really really need help, you'd probably get it sooner. permalinksaveparent[+]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]furrowedbrow 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes agoThat's not good enough.permalinksaveparent[+]faultlessjoint 20 points21 points22 points 1 hour ago (5 children)[]faultlessjoint 20 points21 points22 points 1 hour agoUS Population: 311,591,917Canada Population: 34,482,779Not looking into any other aspects of the two countries the US should have 10x more shooting just based on population.permalinksaveparent[+]Mapleleafaaron 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]Mapleleafaaron 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour agoUS has morethan 10x theshootingsIts more like 18 x the shootingspermalinksaveparent[+]Negro_Napoleon 0 points1 point2 points 57 minutes ago (0 children)[]Negro_Napoleon 0 points1 point2 points 57 minutes agoDoesn't matter. You know damn well its not a linear relationship.permalinksaveparent[+]TerraAustralis 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]TerraAustralis 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoSorry, should have said shooting per 100000.permalinksaveparent[+]jij 0 points1 point2 points 38 minutes ago (0 children)[]jij 0 points1 point2 points 38 minutes agoAlso socialized healthcare is a factor... mental disorders can be treated better with socialized. permalinksaveparent[+]shootx 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]shootx 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes agoI'd say population size and healthcare.The difference between getting mental health assistance in Canada compared to USA has to be extreme.permalinksaveparent[+]pilotbread 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour ago (8 children)[]pilotbread 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour ago88.8 guns per 100 people in the US30.8 guns per 100 people in Canadapermalinksaveparent[+]I_PISS_HAIR 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]I_PISS_HAIR 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour agoMental health services are harder to obtain as well. More guns + lack of mental health services= whackos with lots of guns.permalinksaveparent[+]pilotbread 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]pilotbread 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoOh, absolutely. I don't mean to indicate that prevalence of guns caused this attrocity, just pointing out numbers to add to the conversation. Mental health must be the issue that we really look at seriously.permalinksaveparent[+]TheIcelander 25 points26 points27 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]TheIcelander 25 points26 points27 points 1 hour agoFree mental health care in Canada.Mental health care is often not covered on health insurance in the US.permalinksaveparent[+]Yossarian33 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes ago (0 children)[]Yossarian33 0 points1 point2 points 44 minutes agoJust because it's free, it doesn't mean there's easy access. Mental health resources are strained beyond belief, people who need it can't get it. They're hospitalized for a day then released to make room for more, but they're just as crazy as before.permalinksaveparent[+]Lucky_Mongoose 0 points1 point2 points 33 minutes ago (0 children)[]Lucky_Mongoose 0 points1 point2 points 33 minutes agoThis is the core of the issue. Mental healthcare heavily depends on insurance, but as you might expect, those with really severe psychological problems often don't have it. (Hell, most people probably have crummy mental health insurance)permalinksaveparent[+]TerraAustralis 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]TerraAustralis 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoAh my mistake. Still doesn't explain why. permalinksaveparent[+]Negro_Napoleon 0 points1 point2 points 57 minutes ago (0 children)[]Negro_Napoleon 0 points1 point2 points 57 minutes ago10x the population.permalinksaveparent[+]mjschultz 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes ago (0 children)[]mjschultz 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes agoNote that these numbers are going to be skewed a bit because it measures # guns / # people, not # gun owners / # people. If only 50% of the people in a country own a gun, but they all own 4 guns you'd have 200 guns per 100 people.[Edit: obviously the US is still probably going to have the highest gun owner:people ratio, but the skew should be noted.]permalinksaveparent[+]Mapleleafaaron 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]Mapleleafaaron 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoWell we don't have more guns in canada but we're like in the top 5. It's all culture. Canada doesn't have a violent history and the US does.permalinksaveparent[+]faultlessjoint 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]faultlessjoint 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWell, the US has over 300 million people and Canada has 30 million people.  So, you know, that would increase the frequency of everything. permalinksaveparent[+]TerraAustralis 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]TerraAustralis 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI am talking per 100000 so that is irrelevant.permalinksaveparent[+]Jade_jada 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]Jade_jada 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoType of gun and ease of gettin them, I would guess? Most of the legal guns owned here are for hunting purposes, iirc, and it's really hard to go on a shooting spree with a rifle. And it takes a while to qualify. I could be wrong, but that's my guess. permalinksaveparent[+]fordry 0 points1 point2 points 50 minutes ago (3 children)[]fordry 0 points1 point2 points 50 minutes agoI don't think Canada has as much of a gang culture. The population is much more sparse. less population overall.permalinksaveparent[+]TerraAustralis 0 points1 point2 points 47 minutes ago (2 children)[]TerraAustralis 0 points1 point2 points 47 minutes agohttp://imgur.com/Bn7qs How much does it have to do with gang culture?permalinksaveparent[+]fordry 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes ago (1 child)[]fordry 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes agoyou know, it would be nice if people would not just latch onto ONE thing someone says like its their entire point and then call them on it like this! Seriously? I gave 3 reasons and im sure its not the entire list. Its A reason. And that picture means nothing in this conversation without Canada included as well.permalinksaveparent[+]TerraAustralis 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]TerraAustralis 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoYou were trying to imply that a lot of the shooting are done by gangs, which this shows they are not. permalinksaveparent[+]sailingthefantasea 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]sailingthefantasea 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes agoI think it could be one of those things where people who have the potential to kill, see things like this and get ideas, especially teenagers or young adults who are more impressionable. Then again, maybe the idea has always been there, but seeing other people do it and became infamous, able to generate all that hype, makes them want to do it too. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
