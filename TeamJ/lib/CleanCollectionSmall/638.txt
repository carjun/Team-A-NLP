Dianne Feinstein of California told Meet The Press on Sunday that she plans on introducing a bill on the first day of the new Congress that would ban assault weapons. Weinstein, a Democrat, said she expects President Barack Obama to support the bill.I believe he will, Feinstein said in response to whether the president would give his backing to the bill.Though there are few details known at this time as to what Feinsteins proposal would include, the bill could be based on the state law in California that controls semiautomatic weapons, barring the majority of weapons with detachable magazines and an additional extra feature like a folding stock. The Albany Times Union reports that Feinstein is expected to be joined in the effort by N.Y. Sen. Chuck Schumer.There have been a rash of these unbelievably horrible incidents, culminating in yesterdays shocking act in Newtown, Schumer said in a statement Saturday. I am hopeful that yesterdays unspeakable events will cause the nation to re-examine its position on guns, and allow us to come to a solution that still preserves the right to bear arms for law-abiding citizens, but makes it much harder for those who would do us harm to obtain firearms.The renewed fight against assault weapons comes in the wake of the elementary-school shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Friday that killed 27 people, including 20 children.View CommentsMore ActivityFacebook ActivityWhat's this?Add to Timeline - What's ThisClick "Log in" to publish  what you read to FacebookSee what your friends have read  on CBS Local sitesUse "Remove" or "Turn off" to disable at any timeblog comments powered by DisqusListen Live!Take Our PollLatest GalleriesPHOTOS: Deadly Connecticut...Sports Junkies Christmas ShowSesame Street Stars at...Cheerleader Roundup - Week 14NFL Recap - Week 14The Most Fearsome Monster Jam...Ugly Christmas SweatersRGIII Injured in Redskins...Christmas StreetStuff-A-Truck 10th AnniversaryGrammy Nominations Concert ...Junkies Poker OpenKids Deck the Halls of Dulles...NFL Recap - Week 13Cheerleader Roundup - Week 13RGIII, Redskins Triumph Over...Page 0Page 1Page 2Page 3The GRAMMYs onCBS Ronnie MervisContest!
