Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoSo fucking sad right now. I haven't stopped crying since I found out 10 minutes ago.My thoughts to everyone. :(permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat would you want for Christmas if you knew your gf was broke?  by  Mesajinxin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoNothing. I don't do xmas and I certainly don't heap the unrealistic expectation that other people consume their equity just to get me shit.I wouldn't ask for her for anything. If this were the case [shit happens but I do not date females that are financially unstable] then I would try to talk to her about why she feels the need to buy me something, knowing full well that there is a type of love expressed by people who enjoy gifting.I would then try and explain to her that as I am a person who receives love through affection and kind words that me not getting presents, while important to her, doesn't define the relationship I have.If I were your boyfriend.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHave you been raped by a woman?  by  Catastroshein  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 43 points44 points45 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 43 points44 points45 points 3 hours agoYes.I was drugged at a party and within 30 minutes of being there I was blacking out.I finished the night in a trifecta of beautiful trauma - I "lost" my virginity to a complete stranger, I contracted genital herpes and I was raped.If there is any case where someone thinks a woman cannot or isn't a rapist then ... well, that's ignorance. It is understandable that some men would think this because there simply isn't a prevalence of female sexual predators although it obviously can happen.I am unsure as to whether or not this goes unreported but I have no qualms about telling people I was taken advantage of and victimized.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre you happy with your life?  by  FrenchFuckin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoNever getting out from that until it's paid off.I hope the education was beneficial to you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre you happy with your life?  by  FrenchFuckin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoLoved the response. Would you mind explaining how you arrived at the conclusion that my view is Stoic or Eastern [and how that is juxtaposed against Western or non-Stoic]?Interestingly enough you ended your initial statement by expressing in a continuum that you are not happy with your life but stood by your original comment in the response that it's a matter of quadrants.Pray tell, are you taking it as a whole or not? :)permalinksavecontextfull comments[REQ] $5 on Paypal so I can cover the rest of my car insurance.

Taking drugs alters your environment but that isn't willpower.Do you think thoughts and emotions are separate? I view them as one in the same. I used to separate them until I learned that thoughts and emotions commingle to a point of inseparability. You cannot have one without the other and by willpower I mean that you can influence your emotional state by using your creative and energetic impulses to think differently about your environment, yourself, your anything.The last sentence implies to me that people are chained to their past. You may or may not be saying that but to me most emotions are reactions to the immediate environment although the past helped to shape those reactions... but they can be altered through willpower, the desire to become something different than what a fragmented past has to offer us. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho do you think gets rejected more often (when doing the approaching), men or women?  by  redsliderin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoWell, based upon your qualifier, I have no answer.You specifically stated that WHEN the approaching is being done, who is rejected more?Well, I think everyone agrees that men approach women more than women approach men.So for 100% of all "approaches", regardless of gender initiation I have absolutely no clue who gets rejected more often. How would you even begin to tell?Now my feeling on the matter is that women can overall afford to be pickier because numbers-wise, more men approach women, so I'd lean towards men... but that's nothing scientific or verifiable.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDo men really think women are illogical?  by  Malakhiahin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoYes of course I do. So are men.But before you can get anywhere meaningful with this you have to define what you mean by illogical.I see the world in two different spheres - structured and unstructured. So do you and so does everyone else. It's how we divide out reality. Chaos & Form. Left-brained & right-brained. Rational & irrational. Logical and illogical.To me, when someone starts speaking Korean or Japanese I do not immediately consider them illogical - they are simply speaking another language and I learn how to decode the language or I never reach common ground with them.What those men are really saying is "I do not understand my girlfriend."permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre you happy with your life?  by  FrenchFuckin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoI want to have more fun with things, I want to have money, I want to get a job that I enjoy, I don't know what I want to do for the rest of my life, everyone around me seems to be getting their shit together, I still miss the love of my life, but I can't hate the guy who has her because he's me but better, I want to travel, I just want to go to bed but I go too late and I wake up too late and sometimes I just wish I wouldn't wake up at all.One simple change can make all of the difference.When you say I want, stop dreaming and use language that makes it real.I will have...Eventually "I want..." will become "I have..." or "I am..." Your focus will switch from the future that will never get here and TRULY ground you into the present with what actually is.And all you have to do is change a few words around. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre you happy with your life?  by  FrenchFuckin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoBravo!I'd like to throw out a challenge - do you recognize the role that you play in shaping your environment? That your environment becomes a natural manifestation of chemically-induced changes in your brain as a result of your willpower/thoughts?permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre you happy with your life?  by  FrenchFuckin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoIf this is a mortgage, you could always walk away from the contract by handing them the keys to the house.

No? Good - you would have some wiring problems in your noggin' if you were. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsAre you happy with your life?  by  FrenchFuckin  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoTherapy works but you have to want it first.

This is no different from asking if someone is angry with their life. So the answer to that is no. I'm not anything with my life. My life just is.Am I happy? Right now I'm happy. I'll be elated in a few hours and tomorrow I'll be confused.Because happiness is a transitory state the question ultimately boils down to this:Are you aware of your emotional states?And the answer to that is EXTREMELY aware. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsAskMen, what things do you do to make yourself feel manly?  by  Laid_Back_Turtlein  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoapplausehttp://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq2u0cmb2s1qii6tmo1_500.gifpermalinksavecontextfull commentsHeterosexuals of Reddit, when did you realize you weren't gay?  by  TheBastardTrollin  AskReddit[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago0 or 6 are completely hetero/homo. 7 was for people who self-identify as asexual, FYI. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: PTSD, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  by  SomeGuyinAtlantain  explainlikeimfive[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoFor example, I had an anxiety attack the other day in my sleep. One of my triggers is heart palpitations or pain [which creates a wonderful downward spiral, let me tell you]:So I just literally picture the chemicals in my mind's eye being stopped by a gate or some force so that the signals don't get to it. It doesn't LITERALLY stop the flow of the norepinephrine surge but it does cause me to realize/think that the problem is controllable, which ends up relaxing me... so it's an indirect approach to hacking the fear signals in my body.The only way to break the cycle is to literally stop it. Cognitive behavioral therapy, as I understand it, aims to do exactly that.If you don't act on your fears and you aren't afraid then the anxiety is no longer a problem so try to literally DO [behave as if] something ]is] different - eventually it will be. :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsAny thoughts on raising a boy without a father, given the recent post on "manning up" that made me think of such things?  by  Dragoness42in  AskMen[+]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DownhillYardSale 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoYou know, that brings up an interesting point.My father left the house when I was 8 or 9 due to a divorce and I never cried. I never felt a reason to, though - I knew my parents were unhappy so when they explained he was moving out I wasn't surprised at all.But my problems had started well before then [adoption and whatnot and my father was... a bastard basically].So I completely get it from a slightly older perspective. No tears, no nightmares, no "I want him back." or "When is he coming home?" either... but I knew my parents were happier that way so that's probably why it never upset me.I still hated my mom, though. :(permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
