Since then, the representative (an older man) has been using my personal info on the application to contact me personally. First by email, then by text and just about an hour ago, by calling me. Should I be worried?  by  runningandguitarsin  AskReddit[+]songswesing 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]songswesing 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoYea I know that but if someone is making multiple credit inquiries it negatively effects your score. That was my main point. That was just based off of her saying she keeps applying and getting denied. Usually that means she needs to get one of those cards you put like 200 dollars on and build credit that way first. permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, have you ever responded to (or posted) a 'casual encounters' type ad on Craigslist or elsewhere? If so, what happened? Did you meet someone? How did it go? What advice or cautions would you offer? Possibly NSFW  by  chotoin  AskReddit[+]songswesing 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]songswesing 1 point2 points3 points 10 days agomaybe it's because I'm from a city where many different races hang out and date each other. I find it unnecessary to keep pointing out that she's black over and over. No one ever says "this white chick did this or that" but any other race has to be pointed out like it makes a big difference. Racist is the wrong word to use here, though, so sorry but I guess your use of stereotypes offends me! I would just like to be at the point where no one finds it necessary to point someone's race and all of the obnoxious stereotypes they fit in to. I also know that reddit is mainly white straight males so thats unlikely to happen here. whatever though :) Cheers! permalinksavecontextfull commentsYesterday I signed up for a master card.

Usually they involve me pulling them out one by one. The most recent one I had was a few months ago where my GUMS were falling out of my mouth and I was trying to find my mom so she could schedule a dentist appt for me, but a crackhead homeless woman kept harassing me on the streets so I couldn't get home. It's pretty terrifying. permalinksavecontextfull commentsQuick, before the power comes back up on the east coast.
