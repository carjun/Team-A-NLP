Much like other tragic events in American history  September 11, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the Columbine shootings come to mind  millions of Americans continue to feel a profound sense of sorrow and loss for all of those who have been impacted.As I did after the planes crashed into the World Trade Center buildings, I spent a few hours of the Friday afternoon following the Newtown shootings watching the ongoing news coverage as it unfolded. I was simply trying to make sense of why a human being would march into a school with a weapon and open fire on children roughly the same age as my own.For a father of two it brought about the emotions and questions one would imagine: Who did this? Why? Could this happen to my children in their school? How must the parents of these children feel?Then on the drive home, listening to more coverage on NPR, I started to cry, and Ive done so every day since as Ive watched the ongoing media analysis. Because, while I am not the most empathetic soul, I now share some level of commonality with the parents of all those who perished in Newtown: I also have lost a child.On February 15, 2003, my wife gave birth to twins  a boy and a girl. My son would come home from All Childrens Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla, but my daughter would not, contracting a hospital-born infection in the neonatal intensive care unit where she died June 1 of that same year.How did I manage my sorrow? It wasnt easy. Nearly 10 years later it still isnt.I began by leaving St. Petersburg  a city I loved but needed to put behind me to heal. I also realized I could not change what happened and chose to celebrate those four months we had with our daughter as opposed to the nine-plus years Ive missed out on thus far. I thank every day for my son who survived, of course, and I am thankful for our youngest child who was born some 18 months later.Another way I remember and honor my daughter is with a tattoo that I had placed on my leg, which among other things reminds me of her each day as I put on my socks. Ironically, when people ask me about it  jesting that perhaps it was the name of an ex-girlfriend  it makes them more uncomfortable than it does me when I tell them the story. I actually look forward to being asked, as it gives me an excuse to talk about her with others.So yes, I have a shared connectivity to the parents of Sandy Hook. I have lost a child as well. But there are also distinct differences.Its so easy to paint a broad brush and say that because I have lost a child, I can understand what the families of Newtown are going through. The reality, however, is that is not necessarily the case.I remember being at the funeral of a friend of mine about two years following the death of my daughter. I walked up to his mother and gave her a hug. She said, I know you understand what Im going through. Well, yes and no. Her son was well into his 20s. She had built a longterm relationship with him to degrees I cannot fathom. My daughter never spoke. She sat with tubes running in and out of her in a hospital while all we could do was sit there, hold her, sing to her, and pray.The human condition is complicated, and if there was one lesson I learned from my daughters death  and I continue to learn each day  its that all of us react to adversity in different ways, and this includes grieving.My wife has, and continues to grieve differently than I do. In fact, before agreeing to write this piece I asked her if she would mind. Her response, Not at all. I think you struggle with it more than I do. Not to say that my wife was being cavalier or callous in any way about the memories of our daughter. Its just that she has made greater peace with our tragedy, whereas I, perhaps, have not.Each of us manifests pain and loss in differing ways, whether its losing a child, not winning an athletic competition, divorce, or underachieving in school. Our manifestation and subsequent reactions to discomfort thus often allows others to attempt to define us, because as human beings  for better or worse  we instinctively tend to judge each situation or person we meet.So as we approach this New Year in our ever-evolving world, here is my wish for 2013: Endeavor to save your judgment.To those who speculated and reported that the Sandy Hook murderer went to the school to kill his mother the teacher, which we later learned to be false.To the armchair psychologists whove never lost a child, nor been to Newtown or spoken to someone from from there regarding the insights into their psyche.To those who believe there is a set timeframe for psychological recovery from such a tragedy.To those who wish to blame gun owners or the National Rifle Association for gun violence.To those who seek to characterize the young man who committed these atrocious murders.
