He began taking college classes at 16.Comments44previous12|  single pageJohn Bergquist, who got to know Nancy Lanza at a neighborhood bar where both were regulars, described her as a New Hampshire farm girl turned sophisticate, a Red Sox fan with season tickets who traveled to ride hot air balloons, attend jazz concerts in New Orleans, and visit friends in London, New York and San Francisco, sometimes taking her older son Ryan along.She drove a silver BMW. She also hunted with falcons.Bergquist remembered going with Nancy Lanza to see another friend from the bar who was having trouble getting a turkey back into its coop. After watching the struggle, he said, Lanza  who was elegantly dressed  "lifted the gate, walked in, grabbed the turkey by the feet and said, 'This is how you do it.'"AlsoPhotos:Massacre at elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Who they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsSchool shooting: How do you tell a child his protectors are dead?See more stories XFor victims of Jewish center shooting, massacre renews their pain It's time to target gun violenceWHO THEY WERE: Shooting victimsLanza had a soft side when it came to her younger son, he said."She always spoke very lovingly about him. She was devoted to him, catering to him and his limitations," he said. "He wasn't troubled or violent in any way  he was a normal kid with a disability.  He had trouble being with people."Nancy Lanza appeared to have made the decision to move so that Adam could attend college in another state. She started looking at schools in Washington state and North Carolina."She was willing to uproot her life," Bergquist said. "Nancy pretty much made it clear that she needed to be with him because he couldn't handle being on his own."At Western Connecticut, Adam Lanza did not work toward any major or degree, said college official Paul Steinmetz, and was still on the rolls at the time of the shooting, though not actively enrolled.Few remember him.German professor Renate Ludanyi said her records showed she gave him a "repeat" at the end of his time there  just short of failing. "I must have had some hope that he was smart and could do it again, instead of really flunking him," she said."Probably he didn't come to class very often," she said. "You get so many students, they come and go. Some speak with you, some are outstanding, some  you barely remember when the semester's over."Lanza fit into that last category, she said. "He never talked to me. He came in, sat down and left. He was just there."shashank.bengali@latimes.commolly.hennessy-fiske@latimes.comkim.murphy@latimes.comBengali and Hennessy-Fiske reported from Newtown, Conn., and Murphy from Seattle.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Timesprevious12|  single pageComments44Comments (44)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQMitch Labuda at 3:59 AM December 19, 2012                The noise of the world, visual and auditory is simply too much at times, for some of us.I can relatee to the noise, the voices, growing ever louder to hear over each other, the noise from radio's and TV's, the noise from a city, etc.People need to understand others.Kazem Spahi at 10:15 PM December 17, 2012                Live in peace with one another. Abandon guns people. How many more people need to die before you realize that the right to bare arms is causing more harm than good? 10K people died in the US last year alone becasue of easy access to guns in the streets.Mat Helm at 12:30 PM December 17, 2012                It pisses me off that we can't mourn this loss because of idiots politicizing it. FYI, Bad people are bad regardless of what they use to be bad with, and the 2nd amendment wasn't put there for hunting or even self protection. It was put there to protect all the other amendments. To protect us from the government, which if you ever read the constitution, you will see that the whole thing is to protect us from the government...Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
