Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]frosty 47 points48 points49 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]frosty 47 points48 points49 points 23 hours agoThe news media on all sides (Fox News, Huffington Post, CNN, etc) are all interviewing children and linking to the Facebook page of the WRONG guy.  While I despise what this piece of shit has done to innocent children, the news media needs to also be condemned for their glamorization of a very tragic event.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI had a near tearful, awesome retail experience; it's not all hell I guess!  by  jcast747in  TalesFromRetail[+]frosty 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]frosty 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoGreat post!

Best guess get Limbo on steam for Mac or PC.  by  AskACapperDOTcomin  homeland[+]frosty 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]frosty 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoPersonally, I think we'll see Carrie be the one who is killed on the finale.  I know it would be a huge thing to do, but it makes sense in a way. She's gone off the deep end this year, and what better way for the show to get back to Brody being a terrorist, than for him to kill the person who loves him?  I think we'll see either Brody kill Carrie, or Carrie "save" Brody by taking a bullet for him. Either way, Brody becomes the new Big Bad of Season 3.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey male Redditors, when was the most awkward time that you've had an erection?  by  VisualReaperin  AskReddit[+]frosty 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]frosty 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoNah...
