Any other posts about will be removed.  by  IronChinin  guns[+]whubbard 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]whubbard 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoA shooter, any shooter could have bought an assault weapon anywhere, including the (by federal loophole) completely unregulated gun show market.  You are an idiot. That's not how it works.  The shooter in CT used a gun that can fire six rounds a second. Six rounds a second. Gun control action needs to happen at the Federal Level and in a serious way if it is ever going to have an impact.  That has nothing to do with the gun (well not really). It has to do with how fast somebody can pull a trigger. Not everybody can make the gun fire 6 rounds/second, actually almost nobody, I go as far to say nobody.  Sadly, you are clearly not personally educated on the topic and passing forward what you read in slate (also likely written by somebody who knows nothing about guns), isn't going to help. If you want to have an educated conversation. Please do some research first.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI just learned of the Connecticut shooting, why the hell haven't we figured out/solved gun control?  by  gandalfv31415in  guns[+]whubbard 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]whubbard 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoSee here.

I accept the outcome likely would have been the same. It seems he walked into one classroom, killed his mother, then killed her students. It's still a big minority of us in CT that have permits and carry. That said, it should still be an available option. Nobody should be left defenseless.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMyth Busters Gunnit Version: In a scene in the Bourne Legacy the protagonist shoots down a UAV with a single shot from a breakdown rifle.  by  mikenewhousein  guns[+]whubbard 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]whubbard 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours agoThat's a photo of a Reaper.

Almost. What I'm actually saying is who am I to say it's wrong? What gives me the right to believe my morals are correct. See most people think that everybody else's moral compass is wrong if it doesn't perfectly align with their own. I am merely speculating that there may not be a correct moral compass.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis ignorance is ridiculous.  by  gyoungofficialin  guns[+]whubbard 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]whubbard 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoI'm liking this.
