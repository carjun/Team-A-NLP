Maybe not ostracized, but perhaps there should be a ribbon you get after having been tested, and if it takes wearing that ribbon for a year to stop mass shootings, I think it's worth it. America, we can do it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat socially acceptable behavior in 2012 will shock the young people of the 2060s?  by  k115810in  AskReddit[+]awelldesignedavocado 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]awelldesignedavocado 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoITT and every other similar thread; gay people.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat socially acceptable behavior in 2012 will shock the young people of the 2060s?  by  k115810in  AskReddit[+]awelldesignedavocado -1 points0 points1 point 6 days ago (0 children)[]awelldesignedavocado -1 points0 points1 point 6 days ago*huge tomepermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat socially acceptable behavior in 2012 will shock the young people of the 2060s?  by  k115810in  AskReddit[+]awelldesignedavocado 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]awelldesignedavocado 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoWow, I didn't think of that.

Why?  by  dipatelin  AskReddit[+]awelldesignedavocado 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*(0 children)[]awelldesignedavocado 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*I'm really surprised. It is the worst redesign I have ever experienced. Normally, I'm the one advocating for the new Facebook layout, or Twitter layout, or even Gmail layout. This time, I am flabbergasted. I hope I'm not growing old and losing touch with what's cool, but for the first time, I honestly think this is terrible. I think this is the worst iteration of YouTube in history, since 2006.It looks too much like Google, when I want YouTube to be separate. Too much empty space and it actually looks unfinished. Normally, I love simpler versions of websites, but I fell in love with the last YouTube. It had polish, and this just strips it bare. I loved the textured grey on the old YouTube.I'm not a fan of the logo being shrunken down, and what happened to all the Trending and Music tabs on the home page? I actually used them.I will say that I like the new video player marginally better, however I think the video viewing area should be bigger. That's the trend, and there's space for it, after all. If the design is so bare for the video to take centre stage, then let the video take centre stage.I love good design, and maybe it's finally time to move to Vimeo.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPSY with Gangnam Style has now surpassed Justin Bieber's Baby on YouTube's most viewed videos  by  Hakonanin  Music[+]awelldesignedavocado 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]awelldesignedavocado 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoHowever, the population on the internet has exploded in that time as well, so you have to factor that in.
