We only ever hear about the BRD and the DDR and the sectioned bits of Germany over here. Want to learn more about it and be entertained at the same time? Go watch The Third Man. It's one of my favourite films. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhere is the line between religion and myths?  by  rednexicanin  atheism[+]TSC 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago (0 children)[]TSC 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours agoCould have.

Bastards.Somehow I don't think that's what this guy meant, though. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhere is the line between religion and myths?  by  rednexicanin  atheism[+]TSC 12 points13 points14 points 11 hours ago (0 children)[]TSC 12 points13 points14 points 11 hours agoWhat's the fine line between religions and myths?Religions still have believers.

The place got blown up pretty bad, and it was sectioned up just like Germany. It's just that, since then, they've recovered magnificently. But things didn't really get better until the mid-1950s, due in large part to the Marshall Plan and Soviet withdrawal. And Schwarzenegger?

Nonsense. "Most recent," thank you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadianFeels.jpg  by  tikki_roxin  canada[+]TSC 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]TSC 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago*Uh... yes? That's what I meant. And what I said. A felony is a serious offence and a misdemeanour is not. It has nothing to do with what level of government is responsible for the law. Felony =/= state law. Felony also =/= federal law. There are state and federal felonies, and there are state and federal misdemeanours. It just has to do with seriousness, not level of government... just like indictable vs. summary offences. I don't know why you're suggesting otherwise. Given all that, felonies are analogous to indictable offences and misdemeanours are analogous to summary offences. What are you talking about?permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadianFeels.jpg  by  tikki_roxin  canada[+]TSC 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]TSC 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoMaybe he's ambidextrous.

The prices will not be that high no matter what Obama does.B) Petroleum prices should be increased to include all economic externalities - in this case, the cost of carbon. That's basic economics.C) I'm Canadian. Your gas prices don't affect me beyond reducing the demand for Canadian oil. Which is probably a good thing given the harm the Alberta oilsands do to the environment. permalinksavecontextfull commentsELECTION OVER, ADMINISTRATION UNLEASHES NEW RULES  by  pc25in  politics[+]TSC 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]TSC 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoWINNING POLITICIAN ACTS TO LEGISLATE IN WAYS CONSISTENT WITH HIS POLITICAL VIEWS AND PROMISES TO THE ELECTORATEScandalous.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadian Debit Card Not Working In States -- Help?  by  KarmaSaverin  canada[+]TSC 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]TSC 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoUh... well...
