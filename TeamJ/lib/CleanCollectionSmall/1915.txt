I thought I got mine across having written 3 posts about mental health and MY personal experience suffering from a mental illness.I don't care if you feel as though memes aren't funny. Are you someone whose feelings about memes I should care about? No. Do I respect that you have the right you your ignorant opinion of me. Sure. Be ignorant. But learn to use reddit's comment history to see I have contributed to the conversation with personal anecdotes rather than jumping on the bandwagon of putting some guys person information on reddit and facebook and twitter.Do I have the right to say that someone who was accused of murdering innocent children and getting death threats as having bad luck? Yep. and 111 people agree. You point is noted.

Back in the Saydrah days. This is my third account. My first had well over 10k karma. I got divorced and was sick of my abusive ex husband harassing me. But call me the new guy...funny.

Am I still a noob as well? permalinksaveparent[+]escalat0r -3 points-2 points-1 points 18 hours ago (1 child)[]escalat0r -3 points-2 points-1 points 18 hours agoSince there weren't any subreddits there weren't any defaults.How does either 10k karma or a GW account give you more drediility?Apostolate get's that much in one hour and is just rambling shit that the hivemind will eat up.permalinksaveparent[+]yetanotherpoop 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago*(0 children)[]yetanotherpoop 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago*You will cling to anything to be correct.
