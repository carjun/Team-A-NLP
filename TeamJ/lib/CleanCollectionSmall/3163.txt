And though every person in the UK will eat an average of 15 sprouts this Christmas, according to one survey, theyre the most hated vegetable in Britain. But we reckon trying out these delicious Brussels sprout recipes will change your mind on this nutritious seasonal vegetable foreverGive sprouts a chance this Christmas RexRoasted Brussels Sprouts with Shallots and Caraway Seeds by Hugh Fearnley WhittingstallServes 4:Ingredients: 750g Brussels sprouts, trimmed 200g small shallots, peeled but left whole3 tbsp olive oil  tsp caraway seedsFlaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Method: Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Tip the sprouts into a bowl along with the shallots, olive oil and caraway seeds, and season generously with salt and pepper. Tip the lot into a roasting tin and roast for about 40 minutes, until the sprouts are crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Shake the pan from time to time, so that everything cooks evenly. Season the cooked sprouts with a little more salt and serve immediately.[Related: Five ways to stay healthy over the Christmas season]Smokey Bacon Sprouts with Garlic and Chilli Flakes by Gordon RamseyServes 4Ingredients:400g sprouts, trimmed 100g smoked bacon lardons 1 cloves garlic1/2 tsp chilli flakesSaltMethod:Cut the sprouts in half and blanch in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes then drain well. Fry the lardons until crisp. Lightly crush the garlic cloves and add to the pan with the sprouts. Sprinkle in the chilli flakes. Cook for 1-2 minutes tossing occasionally. Transfer to a baking dish and finish in the oven at 220C/gas mark 7 for a further 12-15 minutes.Liven up your sprouts with pancetta Rex[Related: Five healthier options for Christmas dinner]Marsala Sprouts with Chestnuts, Pancetta and Parsley by Nigella LawsonChestnuts are another of natures ultimate super food so combining both together creates a dish so immune-boostingly (is that a word?) good, nothing will be able to bring you down. Nigellas original recipe uses a little more pancetta, oil and butter (no surprises there) but this reduced fat version still tastes divine.Serves 4:Ingredients:1lb Brussels sprouts tbs vegetable oil1 oz pancetta, rind removed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes1 tbs butter4 ozs vacuum-packed chestnuts1 fluid oz Marsala wine1 handful fresh parsley, chopped, dividedFreshly ground black pepperMethod: Slice the bottoms off each of the Brussels sprouts, cutting a cross onto the base as you go. Place the sprouts into a large saucepan of salted boiling water. Cook them for 5 minutes, or until they are tender but still retain a bit of bite. Remove the pan from the heat and drain the excess water from the Brussels sprouts. Heat the oil in a large clean saucepan. Add the pancetta cubes to the pan and cook until they are crisp and golden-brown in colour, but not cooked to the point of having dried out.Add the butter and the chestnuts to the pancetta saucepan and with a wooden spoon or spatula, press down on them to break them up into pieces. Once the chestnuts have been warmed through, turn the heat up and add the Marsala to the pan. Cook until the mixture has reduced and thickened slightly.Add the sprouts and half the parsley to the saucepan and mix well. Season the Brussels sprouts with freshly ground black pepper.To serve, place the sprouts onto a warmed serving plate and sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley over the top.

I absolutely love them just as they are, especially cold or bubble and squeaked with cold cuts.  Wonderful.  They do make people a bit windy though.  :)v1/comments/context/73f51b29-9f1e-383f-a3df-3f75aa58ab46/comment/1355607433457-ab8041d9-944f-4b1c-949a-b0364cf80003Sue23 hours agoA gene known boringly as TAS2R38 enables us to distinguish certain bitter flavours, particularly the glucosinides in Brussel Sprouts. There is a marked dicotomy in the expression of this gene which means that either a person hates sprouts or likes them.Now I must see if something similar can be applied to Marmite!v1/comments/context/73f51b29-9f1e-383f-a3df-3f75aa58ab46/comment/1355645159119-f41a8a85-e830-4821-be1c-d0ec04d4a856JUDITH B12 hours agoI'm glad I'm not the only one who really likes them.

My hubbie cooks the dinner (I stay in bed reading).  His slices the sprouts thinly and fries them with smoked bacon, some herbs, toasted chopped hazelnuts and a splash of cream - delicious.v1/comments/context/73f51b29-9f1e-383f-a3df-3f75aa58ab46/comment/1355595752453-c1e64c4e-1762-4982-b41d-3411fbf96917Edward1 day 2 hours agoProperly cooked, and topped with a nob of butter, and a light spinkle of sea salt and black pepper, they taste great.
