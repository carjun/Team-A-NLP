Someone listed an article that quoted a guy saying something from Reuters (the news agency).  Someone else asked for a source for the thing; the source was the guy from Reuters.  I quoted the part of the paragraph that said the guy from Reuters said the thing.  And now here we are with you talking about aliens and calling me retarded while reflexively downvoting my posts.permalinksaveparent[+]IsaacLeibniz 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (2 children)[]IsaacLeibniz 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoFirst, I didn't ask for a source. Secondly, no one listed an article. The guy said "blah blah blah" according to guy from reuters. THAT'S NOT A FUCKING SOURCE.I ask again, are you fucking retarded?Do you see a link here, you fucking idiot? http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/14uh3l/shooting_at_connecticut_elementary_school/c7gkf42permalinksaveparent[+]rocketvat 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (1 child)[]rocketvat 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoI'm sorry I made you so angry by answering a question, try not to start any shooting sprees on the way to the parking lot.Seriously, you need to calm down.
