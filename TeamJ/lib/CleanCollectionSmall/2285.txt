How anyone could do something like this I just... I can't even wrap my mind around it.permalinksaveparent[+]Shiftkgb 70 points71 points72 points 37 minutes ago (3 children)[]Shiftkgb 70 points71 points72 points 37 minutes agoThe fact that it bothers you and so many others so much is humanity's redemption. Don't let evil deeds twist your being and change who you are. permalinksaveparent[+]real_nice_guy 3 points4 points5 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)[]real_nice_guy 3 points4 points5 points 21 minutes agoseriously, this. You can question all the shittiness, but there are redeeming qualities in there too among all the terribleness.But now isn't the time to dwell on that, this is the worst kind of tragedy, innocent kids and teachers. permalinksaveparent[+]AndyL194 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]AndyL194 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoThank you for that.permalinksaveparent[+]wrcftw 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children)[]wrcftw 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute agoThis.  Extremely well said.  We have to accept that a tiny percentage of the population are completely insane and capable of horrific things...permalinksaveparent[+]hot_skillet 5 points6 points7 points 28 minutes ago (1 child)[]hot_skillet 5 points6 points7 points 28 minutes agoThere are A LOT of people out there today. Questioning humanity as a whole because 1 out of 7 billion does something like this is like losing hope in survival after getting a splinter.permalinksaveparent[+]xafimrev 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]xafimrev 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoAgreed, I suspect more children died in car accidents across America today, that doesn't make it less painful for the parents of the victims though.permalinksaveparent[+]simonsarris 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (0 children)[]simonsarris 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoTake a step back and remember that the percent of all humans that do things like this is vastly, incredibly, vanishingly small. That's why it's on the news.permalinksaveparent[+]Delheru -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes ago (0 children)[]Delheru -1 points0 points1 point 14 minutes agoDon't be silly.It makes me worry about humanity and wonder if it's worth it just like software crashing makes me wonder about whether software is worth it. Some shit just doesn't work right, and the thing you do is fix it instead of moping.The fact that out of 1 billion people in developed countries this happens maybe 10-20 times a year globally... (and this is certainly about as bad as they can get) is not exactly armageddon stuff. Roughly 1 person in 100,000,000 does it. Considering something like 1% has a clearly diagnoseable mental illness, it means that roughly 1 in 1,000,000 mentally ill people does this sort of stuff.If anything, I find it rather amazing, considering how great odds you had of dying of violence just a few centuries back (if the events never stop being terrifying).permalinksaveparent[+]bobsagetfullhouse 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]bobsagetfullhouse 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoDon't let the acts of 2 insane people let you question the worth of all of humanity. If humanity didn't give a shit about something like this happening then you could question it. permalinksaveparent[+]xafimrev 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]xafimrev 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoMental Illness.permalinksaveparent[+]Ze3ks 2 points3 points4 points 23 minutes ago (1 child)[]Ze3ks 2 points3 points4 points 23 minutes agoHumanity as a whole? Really? You have Stephen Colbert on the front page right now who donated $800k, Eric the sandwich man who devoted 15 years to feed people on a subway, a random stranger on Reddit giving a man living in a shelter a wonderful XMas for him and his kids and all it takes is one lunatic to completely wipe that slate and make you question humanity.I apologize for being rash but that's just stupid. Every fucked up thing that happens in the world is usually sensationalized but it's always the good deeds that go unnoticed.permalinksaveparent[+]Vanetia 1 point2 points3 points 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]Vanetia 1 point2 points3 points 18 minutes agoAnd you have another incident similar to this one in China. You have the TSA detaining a wheelchair-bound girl because omg terrorism. You have drone strikes and actual terrorism. Every day there are murders, rapes, and other acts of violence not just once but hundreds if not thousands of times.And you have a "what's the worst thing you've ever stuck your penis into?" thread that I don't even want to click on at work. Oh and this thread. (joking on these ones but seriously: wtf people?)Yes. Humanity as a whole does some pretty fucked up shit and it's sickening and disheartening and hard for me to wrap my mind around sometimes.permalinksaveparent[+]egmou -5 points-4 points-3 points 38 minutes ago (1 child)[]egmou -5 points-4 points-3 points 38 minutes agothe 2 guys obviously weren't humanpermalinksaveparent[+]TwistTurtle 4 points5 points6 points 33 minutes ago (0 children)[]TwistTurtle 4 points5 points6 points 33 minutes agoMindlessly demonizing them and refusing to acknowledge them as human will just make it easier for it to happen again.permalinksaveparent[+]caindaddy 3 points4 points5 points 54 minutes ago (0 children)[]caindaddy 3 points4 points5 points 54 minutes agoThe pictures on this are making me cry for the first time in a long time.

My heart goes out to the parents of kids at that school. permalinksaveparent[+]pitlord713 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]pitlord713 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoIf most of it took place in a classroom, then this guy literally kicked in a door and started just unloading on the entire specific classroom. Try to imagine that image for a second. Just a dude opening the door, pulling a gun out, and shooting your friend Timmy in the chest.permalinksaveparent[+]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 1 point2 points3 points 53 minutes ago (0 children)[]Hungry_Freaks_Daddy 1 point2 points3 points 53 minutes agoNo....please god no...permalinksaveparent[+]gonzal61  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]gonzal61 -11 points-10 points-9 points 32 minutes agoMurica permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
