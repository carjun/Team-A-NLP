Heck, it's even a Friday.  Just dismiss and let kids come back on Monday.permalinksaveparent[+]krisdafish 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]krisdafish 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour agoHard to release kids early like that, a lot of parents are working and can't skip out easily to get their kids.  I have a funny feeling the rest of the school day won't be very productive. permalinksaveparent[+]slopdonkey 1 point2 points3 points 36 minutes ago (0 children)[]slopdonkey 1 point2 points3 points 36 minutes agoI have a feeling you get a free pass on leaving early based on the circumstances.permalinksaveparent[+]lazzylo 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]lazzylo 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoIf they don't know if/where the second gunman is loose in the area, it's probably safer to keep them all in one place then on the road.permalinksaveparent[+]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]derrick81787 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoWell yeah.  School should be let out after the ordeal is over.  People shouldn't be wandering around while a shooter is on the loose.permalinksaveparent[+]illyiarose 0 points1 point2 points 49 minutes ago (0 children)[]illyiarose 0 points1 point2 points 49 minutes agoBut then again, it may be the best place to keep the kids where everyone knows where they're at. Like was said above, I'm sure lots of parents are at work... but this would definitely be the time where I'd just leave work to get my kid. Job be damned. I'm sure they'd understand. permalinksaveparent[+]alphageek8 1 point2 points3 points 18 minutes ago (0 children)[]alphageek8 1 point2 points3 points 18 minutes agoOn top of that instead of letting idle thoughts take over, it's better to at least try to have the kids focus on something else as futile as it probably is.  Still better than nothing IMHO.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
