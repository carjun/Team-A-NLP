Jackson to participate in LIVE taping if you didn't want to get fined by the FCC. Not his fault, since that's what he's KNOWN for. In fact, I & someone else on Twitter were HOPING he'd drop an f-bomb. Christmas wish granted.3) Doubt anyone will care if NBC gets fined, thanks to the Conan, Ann Curry & Olympics coverage debacles. This is just karmaReply 8 Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Diva380's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Diva380's comment.Sign inAll Comments (14)RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserDiva380                55 minutes agoUh-oh... didn't think about THAT, lol.

Definitely not a kids show. But you're right about some parents cursing around their kids.But so far there's been much less fuss about this than I thought there might be and more focus on the Children's Choir singing "Silent Night" in memory of the Newtown, CT shooting victims, as well as Paul McCartney onstage with the remaining members of Nirvana. Other distractions...Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Diva380's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Diva380's comment.Sign inin reply to kives1985(Show the comment) RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Userkives1985                2 hours agoThey won't get fined by the FCC because Saturday Night Live is on late at night, and it's OK to swear late at night according to the Supreme Court. Although let's be fucking honest here, most of us use the word fuck around our kids and it is also very funny when little kids use the word fuck.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate kives1985's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate kives1985's comment.Sign inin reply to Diva380(Show the comment) RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Useryourballsareinert                4 hours agoMotherfucking great.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate yourballsareinert's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate yourballsareinert's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock Userlaterdaaaze                13 hours agoThe supreme court ruled that the Fcc can't fine anyone anymore I think NBC could fine SNL though.Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate laterdaaaze's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate laterdaaaze's comment.Sign inin reply to Diva380(Show the comment) RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserChefboy Rd                13 hours agoLol I'm still singing "How bout that!"- I hate I didn't record this whole episode!!Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Chefboy Rd's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Chefboy Rd's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserBill Boyd                13 hours agoLoved itReply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Bill Boyd's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate Bill Boyd's comment.Sign inRemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserSpankyHotDog                13 hours agolol this was amazing Reply  Sign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate SpankyHotDog's comment.Sign inSign in to YouTube      Sign in with your YouTube Account (YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Orkut, Picasa, or Chrome) to rate SpankyHotDog's comment.Sign inShow more Loading comment...Loading...2:05Forever Alone Meets Michelle Jennekeby Alecofthechive3,418,908 views1:35Rg!!! - awfulannouncing.comby rss8434878,582 views1:42Christmas Sweatz  (a Song)by RhettandLink903,190 views1:21UNIONS ASSAULT ON CAMERA!!by StevenCrowder1,252,964 views0:20NINTENDO SIXTY-FOURby TerminalMontage145,148 viewsLanguage:  EnglishCountry:  WorldwideSafety:OffHelpLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...
