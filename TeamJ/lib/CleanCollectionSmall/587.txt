(Getty Images)Amid all the hyperbole that surrounded Lionel Messis record breaking achievements in surpassing Gerd Mullers 40-year-old landmark for the most goals in a calendar year, one man has been seemingly forgotten - Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova.Which is probably just the way Vilanova likes it.When he took over from Pep Guardiola in June afterhis former boss decided to take a sabbatical from the game, Vilanova looked like he was on a hiding to nothing. In much the same way that Bob Paisley must have felt when he took over from legendary Liverpool coach Bill Shankly.Over four years Guardiola - with Vilanova as his assistant - had won 14 trophies as Barcelona steamrollered the opposition both at home and abroad.From the anonymity of the Barca boot room, suddenly all the pressure was on a 43-year-old man who had arguably only once come to the attention of the worlds media after being poked in the eye by Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho during a Spanish SuperCup game in 2011.

(Getty Images)When Lionel Messi collided with Benfica goalkeeper Artur on Wednesday, the football world held its breath.Introduced as a late substitute in the European Champions League tie, the Barcelona star left the field on a stretcher. Fans across the globe wondered if fate had put paid to Messis attempt to score the most goals in a calendar year.The Catalan club later announced Messi, who has netted 84 goals for club and country in 2012, had bruised his left knee and, while he may miss Sundays match with Real Betis, he should be back to full fitness shortly.

(Getty Images)So did the "Beckham experiment" work?In my book it was always going to be unfair to charge him with the near impossible burden of becoming America's soccer saviour. It was simply never going to happen in a land where the beautiful game is routinely forced to play second fiddle to its more established alternatives - and I'm sure deep down Beckham himself knew this.Realistically- his inner goal when he signed for the Galaxy would have been to make an impact and there's no question he's certainly achieved that.Strikers Thierry Henry and Robbie Keane were both likely influenced by Beckham's move to the U.S. Other stars will follow too, with Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard already being linked with a high-profile move to LA.

(Getty Images)When UEFA president Michel Platini declared any footballer who left the pitch as a result of racial abuse would be yellow carded, he set a dangerous precedent.Platini, head of European footballs governing body and speaking ahead of Junes Euro 2012 tournament, was placing the emphasis on soccers referees to tackle an issue which has plagued the sport over the last 12 months.The Frenchman declared match officials had the authority to halt a match and they would decide when discriminatory chants or behavior had reached unacceptable levels.

(Getty Images)Why Rafael Benitez? A question asked by many upon learning Liverpools former manager would replace the axed Roberto Di Matteo as interim Chelsea manager.But when the Spaniards haul of titles across Europe is examined it begs the question, why not? And when a list of viable and available candidates is also surveyed, who else?Chelseas Russian owner Roman Abramovich may dream of luring Josep Guardiola, the architect of Barcelonas recent dominance of European football, to Stamford Bridge, but the Catalan is intent on completing his year-long soccer sabbatical.

(Getty Images)So here we go again. Another manager bites the dust at Stamford Bridge. Even considering Roman Abramovichs record when it comes to sacking managers, I have to say I was very surprised he dropped the axe on Roberto Di Matteo.I am aware of the numbers: two wins in eight games. I am also aware that Chelsea are close to becoming the first European Champions League winner to be knocked out in the group stages of the competition the next season. However, I am not convinced changing managers at this point in the season is going to accomplish much, especially when whoever comes in will only have until the end of the season to work with these players.

(Getty Images)The Los Angeles Lakers' management baffled their own fans when they decided to look past former coach Phil Jackson and instead hire Mike DAntoni as the new team coach.After all, Jackson has won a record eleven titles as coach (five with the Lakers) while DAntoni has reached the playoffs just five times in his 10 seasons as a head coach.The argument should be over here. Jackson wins over DAntoni 11-0. Period.But for arguments sake, lets see what possibly would have led Jerry and son Jim Buss to go with the latter.

(Getty Images)The 2012 Formula One season may yet have delivered the new drivers' champion, but even before the world's fastest racing cars finish their cylinder-driven samba around the Interlagos Circuit in Sao Paulo next week we can be certain of one fact ... the new champion will be crowned an all-time great along with this year's best.Both Germany's Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso of Spain are used to superlatives from motor racing commentators: they are both exceptionally talented and boast back-to-back double-champion pedigree.And as the two sole pilots left in the hunt to finish top of this year's grid, they also both stand on the edge of joining an elite members' club.

What do you make of the mercurial Zlatan Ibrahimovic? (Getty Images)Wow. WOW. Wow.That word was on repeat in my head as I watched Zlatan Ibrahimovics spectacular bicycle kick sail past Joe Hart on Wednesday. That goal against England in Stockholm epitomized everything the Swedish striker stands for. It was audacious, outrageous and even a bit cheeky to boot. I wont enter into debate on whether it was the best goal of all time, because I definitely dont think it was, what I will discuss is Zlatans standing in the game and his legacy.

(Getty Images)I hear it all the time.Cristiano Ronaldo is a great player, its a shame he is so arrogant.Yes, the 27 year-old Portuguese superstar has an image problem. His serious, distant and sometimes petulant behavior on the field of play means many, if not most fans, have quite a negative impression of him.So who is the real Cristiano? Well, I have known him for nearly a decade and I can tell you he is nothing like that.
