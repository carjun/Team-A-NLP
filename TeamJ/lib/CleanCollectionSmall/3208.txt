"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years," he said from the Brady Briefing Room in the White House. "And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesnt feel the same overwhelming grief that I do.""The majority of those who died today were children  beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them  birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own," he continued. "Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost."Just prior to his speech, the president issued a national proclamation calling for flags to be flown at half-staff around the country until sunset on December 18.Earlier, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters asking about gun control that there "will be  a day for discussion of the usual Washington policy debates, but I do not think today is that day." In his speech, Obama only alluded to the topic: "As a country, we have been through this too many times," he said. "Whether it is an elementary school in Newtown or a shopping mall in Oregon or a temple in Wisconsin or a movie theater in Aurora or a street corner in Chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."RelatedMore Than Two Dozen Killed in Connecticut Elementary School Shooting [Live Coverage]        [WP]Get more:speeches,           connecticut school shooting,           sandy hook elementary school,           barack obama,           sad thingsPhoto: Mandel NGAN/AFP/GettyTop StoriesNewtown Prompts Pledges to Address Gun Control Obama May Have Already Chosen Kerry for StateEuropes Bizarre Bonus-Capping PlanEverybody Misinformed About Right to WorkAdvertisingComments Add CommentNewestOldestPicksMost RepliesThreadedMost Popular StoriesMost CommentedMost ViewedNymag.comVulture.com1.Eight Things We Learned on Anne-Marie Slaughters Lecture Circuit2.What the Critics Are Saying About The Hobbits High Frame Rate3.The 25 Best Red-Carpet Moments This Year4.This Artist Paints Boobs on Presidents Faces5.Winter White Inspiration Gallery6.Gifts to Buy for Five Impossible-to-Shop-For Personalities7.Forty-four Stylish Gifts We All Really Want8.Project Runway All Stars Recap: Let the Ribbon Do the Worknymag.comNews & FeaturesRestaurantsBarsEntertainmentFashionShoppingAgendaDaily IntelligencerThe CutThe Sports SectionThe Magazine  Also In Our Network:Vulture24-hour coverage of the entertainment world.Movies  /  TV  /  Music  /  Books  /  Art  /  Theater  /  ClickablesGrub Street & MenupagesGet restaurant menus and deals, as well as the latest food news.BOS / CHI / DC / LA / NYC / PHI / SF / S FLAJobsPrivacyTermsAbout UsContact UsMedia KitRSSNewslettersAppsAd choicesCopyright  2010 2012, New York Media LLC.
