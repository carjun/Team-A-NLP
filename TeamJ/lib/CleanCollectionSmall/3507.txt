You managed to get the murderer's name into the title and a  pic of him smiling. Now make sure you do a nice long expose' on his  life, how he was a victim of the world around him and his bad  relationships. I'm sure you can uncover better photos of him and maybe  some really juicy videos. Don't forget to interview all his relatives  who will say he was a great kid.  You can explore his life in detail for weeks - there's lots of money to  be made here with sick people who love to know everything they can about  the murderer.   And the best thing is that he would want you to do it. It's a great  motivator for someone who feels they have led an insignificant life. And  it will be a great motivator to others - look how famous the media will  make me if I just kill a lot of innocent people.  Oh, by they way. 20 children lost their lives. But if you do your best  to sell the news and make this murderer famous, we'll never remember  their names. Only his. After all, there's no money to be made telling  the life stories of a bunch of innocent kids. All the money is in  profiling the  murderer.   So go for it. See how much money you can make. It's a golden  opportunity. And again, it will help future motivate future copycat  shooters. So what do you have to lose?Mr Ree at 12:21 PM December 15, 2012                According to ABC News,  Adam Lanza, the alleged shooter, has been labeled as having mental  illness and a personality disorder. These are precisely the words  typically heard in a person who is being treated with mind-altering  psychiatric drugs.One of the most common side effects of psychiatric drugs is violent outbursts and thoughts of suicide.The Columbine Shooters  were, of course, on psychiatric drugs at the time they shot their  classmates in 1999. Suicidal tendencies and violent, destructive  thoughts are some of theadmitted behavioral side effects of mind-altering prescription medications.No gun can, by itself, shoot anyone. It must be triggered by a person  who makes a decision to use it. And while people like NY Mayor  Bloomberg are predictably trying to exploit the deaths of these children  to call for guns to be stripped from all law abiding citizens who have  done nothing wrong whatsoever, nobody calls for Medication control.Why is that? After all,medication alters the mind that controls the finger that pulls the trigger.  The saying that guns kill people is physically impossible. People  kill other people, and as we all learned from watching the O.J. Simpson  trial, you dont need a gun to commit murder.We should be outlawing psychiatric medications, not an inanimate piece of metalMr Ree at 12:16 PM December 15, 2012                We have gun rights to defend our selves agains Tyrants Aka Criminals/EvilAnd Dont you think if some one in one of these shootings had a gun Would have saved Lifes?But  no they have to rescrict our right to bare Arms, so that leaves People  Susceptible to Attack like in Malls, Schools, Theaters, sound familiar?it should because the more they Restrict our Rights to Carry the more Criminals will have Advantage Over Good CitizensI Strongly Believe Its accompanied upon All Real American Citizens to Bare Arms Every where and any whereWe seriously need to take our Rights that where stolen from us Back!Evil prevails when good men do nothing. And how can we without our Sword, Protect what we love and Cherish.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required. The Times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy.
