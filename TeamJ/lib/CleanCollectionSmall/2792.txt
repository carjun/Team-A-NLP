I feel like it would be a poor resolution for Deb's conflict that goes against her character. If this is the direction they go in, I hope that they give some kind of reason for her to take this huge risk when she already had a solid way to get Hannah in jail. Ideally I'd like to find out that the girl had refused to testify, or was killed; Something to motivate Deb to use these extreme measures.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGW16 Live Rant Thread  by  Taffy711in  FantasyPL[+]CuoreAzzurro 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago*(0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago*Oh dear god, I also benched Bassong. I was SO close to playing him. I'm now grasping at straws hoping someone won't play. I actually said it yesterday as well, that Michu might disappoint and Bassong had a chance to score. I did not captain Michu, but I didn't follow through with Bassong.EDIT: Michu goal making me hate myself less. I'll miss 8 points if he doesn't get subbed in, not 12.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGW 16: CAPTAINS THREAD  by  IrelandGirlin  FantasyPL[+]CuoreAzzurro 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoI'm having the same thoughts as you. Usually whenever someone does well one week, they'll disappoint the following week. Michu is great, but I have a feeling he won't score in this "obvious" game.I also have Bassong, and I'm thinking of playing him one way or another, as he is a goal threat.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOk, national bias is a given, but here is the 10 best players ever.

You're going to keep Zidane off the list because of a red card? No matter the importance of the match in which he was carded, it's irrelevant to his overall skill as a player. Keep him off your list if you wish, but have a reason that fits. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSO9EO9 "Dwight Christmas" Episode Discussion  by  Prefer_an_astronautin  DunderMifflin[+]CuoreAzzurro 11 points12 points13 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro 11 points12 points13 points 7 days agoAm I the only one who wants Andy to stay with Erin? The Erin/Pete scenes were cute but they can't possibly throw away YEARS of build up because of this new guy. I don't agree with the Jim/Pam comparison either; Roy was an asshole, Andy isn't. I did LOVE this episode, and I'm very pleased with this final season so far.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGameweek 15: Discussion/Complaint/Rant Thread  by  Cool_Wallin  FantasyPL[+]CuoreAzzurro 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago*(0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago*Put Baines on the bench due to his 50% chance of playing and the fact he was playing City at home. (2/3 on the bench) He plays and gets an assist. I benched Begovic in favor of Bunn (Norwich at home as Stoke away is usually weak defensively). Oh well.EDIT: Bullet dodged: Michu was on my bench but Morrison didn't play.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJohn Ruddy out for up to three months.  by  Sgbin  FantasyPL[+]CuoreAzzurro 2 points3 points4 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro 2 points3 points4 points 15 days agoHm, I guess my FT is going to be used to swap him out.

Nolan on the other hand sparked my interest earlier due to his previous seasons and the positive things I keep reading about him. So I was already leaning that way, but I definitely appreciate the added push in the right direction.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNoble to continue taking penalties for West Ham?  by  NachoTheGreatin  FantasyPL[+]CuoreAzzurro -1 points0 points1 point 3 months ago (0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro -1 points0 points1 point 3 months agoI'm in a similar situation, though I have less in the bank to spend.

I said before this tie we had already surpassed my expectations and even my most wishful thinking after that group stage draw; It's just unfortunate.I'm incredibly proud of my team and what they've accomplished.Also, for the neutral this has probably been one of the best ties of this round.Sempre e solo forza Napoli!VITTORIA, PAREGGIO O SCONFITTA SONO SEMPRE CON TE!permalinksavecontextfull commentswas it just me, or were the commentators for the napoli v chelsea game really hating on napoli?  by  loonquawlin  soccer[+]CuoreAzzurro 28 points29 points30 points 9 months ago (0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro 28 points29 points30 points 9 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onCould not agree more. It was really hard to listen to. I'm fully aware of our defensive errors, as I'm the first person to call them out, but hearing nothing but negativity towards Napoli was really obnoxious.Whatever, maybe for the return leg I'll turn off the audio or something.permalinksavecontextfull commentsUm...

I'm not trying to be a jerk, simply stating that he may or may not make it to the second leg. I don't want to see him sacked; however with the amount of pressure AVB and Chelsea are under, they can either completely turn it around, or change managers.Hopefully they wait until after the tie to do either of those things. ... :Ppermalinksavecontextfull commentsUm...

Napoli and its fans get a really bad reputation for no concrete reason. Unfortunately it's a big city, and there are certain zones that should be avoided, and as a result there are a minority of people that want nothing more than to stir up trouble.I would be more concerned in Rome than Naples, the Roma and Lazio fans aside from being extremely racist, have a long list of violent acts attributed to them.Ideally there would be zero risk for people wanting to see a football match, but that's not the case in Italy. Though this doesn't mean you're going to get stabbed just for stepping foot in the country; you simply need to be careful.Let me know how everything goes for you, but again, Naples is made to out to be much worse than it actually is. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWe made a live score app with video highlights. What does /Soccer think?  by  footballaddictsin  soccer[+]CuoreAzzurro 2 points3 points4 points 10 months ago (0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro 2 points3 points4 points 10 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI've only just downloaded it, and therefore I don't want to get ahead of myself, but WOW. I've been dying for the definitive live score application, and while some are acceptable, they're always lacking in one way or another. I love the speed (which is most often the biggest issue), the UI, and the awesome video feature. I'll be sure to put the app through its paces and get back to you with some feedback, but as it stands this is going to be my go-to score application.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, what is something unique that you enjoy doing in bed?

What with every brand making unique SKUs for whichever store they're being sold in. I realize this is strictly to discourage comparison shopping from store to store, but what's the best way to get around it?Also, how much money is honestly too much money for a mattress? At what point is there no discernible difference in quality between a higher end and lower end model?

They were pathetic? Here's the reality, I'm not a fan of diving, and I honestly can't think of anyone who would ever say otherwise. But it's an unfortunate reality of the sport, that in turn has severe consequences on the way outsiders view it. However, it exists, and it's common. But saying that Napoli was "pathetic" as if we're on the far end of the scale is absolutely absurd.I will give you that Cavani didn't exactly try to keep himself upright as much as he could have, and thusly went down easily, but as you said Bayern had it's own incidents.But arguing over diving in this game seems out of order. The referee was all out terrible, both for Bayern and Napoli. He seemed "decisive". With his inexistent yellows or calls here and there. And that should NEVER be the role of a referee, a referee is there to officiate and step in if needed.Anyway, this is how the game went: Napoli came out of the gates flying, and was the better team for the first 16 minutes of the match. Then out came Bayern and dominated for almost the entire rest of the half. After the 2-0 Napoli risked to truly lose their composure and turn it into a 5+ goal disaster. Spurred on by the Aronica injury and the will to do something and they managed to put one away.In the second half there was more Napoli than Bayern even if Bayern still managed to be extremely dangerous when it pushed forward. And in the end honestly it could've gone either way (a tying goal for Napoli, or a fourth for Bayern).permalinksavecontextfull commentsMatch Thread: FC Bayern Mnchen vs. SSC Napoli  by  BenderTimein  soccer[+]CuoreAzzurro 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago (0 children)[]CuoreAzzurro 2 points3 points4 points 1 year agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThank you for saying that.
