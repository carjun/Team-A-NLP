Of  course, the policy itself is vaguely worded and wasn't explicitly saying "go ahead and lie in the news", but legally it could, and was, interpreted that way. Fox News tried to establish a version of itself in Canada, but due to protests and also due to the fact that we have very strict regulations on journalistic integrity, they withdrew.permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]pantsfactory 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]pantsfactory 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoI'll echo the top post on the election results thread"thank god we elected a human"permalinksavecontextfull commentsObama during his remarks on the Connecticut shooting  by  frickmann123in  pics[+]pantsfactory 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]pantsfactory 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agodigital cameras are only so high-res.

"soldiers in WWII were the best generation. Vietnam vets are grizzled hardass motherfuckers nobody messes with. You just slack off all day." and laugh whenever they beat up on eachother or on women with "ah boys'll be boys, it just means he likes you", tell them they are stupid when they don't understand something right away, and then say there's an avenue where they can become a hero like the people in the video games their older brother plays. Give them a complex where they're fighting the bad guys and that the bad guys are less than human, they're enemies in a game. Compassion and empathy is regarded as "lol gay", any sort of criticism is anti-patriotic and anti-nationalistic, and anyone who speaks out needs to "chill the fuck out bro- you're the one getting offended, so it's your problem"Correlation doesn't equal casation but if someone says this isn't related, they are fucking stupid and live in a damaging dream world where this won't get fixed.permalinksavecontextfull commentsLogic  by  99-LS1-SSin  funny[+]pantsfactory 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]pantsfactory 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoI hate throw pillows, but I fucking hate "lol women logic" more. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy little brother had an interesting night . . .  by  corbantdin  pics[+]pantsfactory 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]pantsfactory 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago4 siblings is big? edit: well, shit, I guess nowadays. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy nephew Blake, his mom died 3 days after he was born and the adoption papers just went through!

If someone has lost the right amount of blood or if someone's calculations are off in any way, this can, and does, happen.
