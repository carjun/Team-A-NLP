(Physical or Emotional)  by  ZoidbergForPresidentin  AskReddit[+]Terricz 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Terricz 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI know people here are talking about parents and other human beings passing away, but what has hit me the hardest so far is my pet ferret, Kubrick. It hasn't even been two weeks since he died. Saturday morning is when my family gets regular chores out of the way. Cleaning Kubrick's cage is what I do last, since it tends to be the dirtiest job (ferrets poop a lot). I went to our garage where we keep his cage (don't worry, our garage is heated and was perfectly fine for him to be there. My parents just didn't like the musky smell which is understandable) but I couldn't find him anywhere. I thought he escaped his cage, so I started searching everywhere, only to be stopped by my dad. I saw his face and didn't even have to hear him say it to know what happened. Kubrick died the night before, but my parents didn't want to tell me because I had work all day and then went to a music show afterward. They didn't want it to ruin my night so they waited to tell me.Later that night my dad told me where he put Kubrick's body. He was wrapped in towels in an air-tight bin underneath the back porch. My parents were going out somewhere and both of my brothers were spending the night at their friend's houses, leaving me completely alone with no one to talk to. When I stopped crying, I headed to the garage, trying my hardest not to glance over to Kubrick's cage, and got a shovel. I then headed out through the back porch to pick up the bin and tried to find a decent place to bury him. I ended up finding a dirt spot next to a tree and began digging. It felt like hours, especially when there were roots that I had to jab the shovel through so I could keep digging. When the hole was deep enough, I opened up the bin and saw him for the first time dead. I picked him up and was instantly shot with numbness. His eyes were blank, his mouth was propped open, and the rest of his body was stiff and lifeless. At this point I was about to burst into tears so I set him down and then quickly filled the hole back up. I stood there for a good hour or so afterwards, just letting all of it sink in. It still hasn't.It seems stupid to me that I get this worked up over a pet while people lose a parent or loved one and take it better than I can. But I feel like I pretty much buried a portion of my childhood that night. Kubrick lived for 7 years, and it was an awesome 7 years having him around. Also, yes I know that Kubrick is a default name for a pet in Torchlight II. I actually got it a couple days afterwards and the ability to have a pet ferret with that name showing up was a swift kick to the feels. It sounds cheesy, but I kept the name Kubrick for my ferret in Torchlight II in memory.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMost unnerving thing you've ever heard or read?  by  neverlurking77in  AskReddit[+]Terricz 7 points8 points9 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Terricz 7 points8 points9 points 3 days agoA few years back I spent the night at my friend's house. My friend's brother has Schizophrenia, and used to hallucinate somewhat frequently. My friend and I were upstairs making food while he was in the basement watching tv. After about ten minutes or so we went back down and see my friend's brother on the floor shivering in panic. He sees us and instantly charges me, almost knocking me back, while yelling "Thank fucking god! It's fucking scared of you! It's scared! The beams! Don't make it come back!"He claims to have seen a demon that was coming through the TV. His description is that it was some sort of zombie-like thing covered in flames with its flesh melting, revealing bone and muscle. He thought it was going to pull him through the TV and drag him into Hell. As if it wasn't strange enough, he told us that when we came downstairs I had angel wings and bright white eyes that shot beams of light. Apparently I made the whole room flash which terrified the demon, and then banished it back to hell.Now that I think of it, this is probably why I want to be a psychologist because after this happened I was so interested in learning more about Schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMost unnerving thing you've ever heard or read?  by  neverlurking77in  AskReddit[+]Terricz 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Terricz 4 points5 points6 points 3 days agodm;hspermalinksavecontextfull commentsThe downside of having a redditor girlfriend  by  subsetin  funny[+]Terricz 16 points17 points18 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Terricz 16 points17 points18 points 3 days agoMine replied with "ChaCha was unable to figure out your question.
