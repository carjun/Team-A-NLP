It works amazing when it's new and clean, but it definitely breaks down over time and starts to fall apart. As it deteriorates it becomes very hit or miss when it comes to getting good rips. It's pretty ideal for sneaking into concerts though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn need of tickets for IZOD N1?  by  4d2in  DMB[+]sc00p_and_slam 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (0 children)[]sc00p_and_slam 0 points1 point2 points 14 days agoYeah I have Warehouse GA as well tomorrow night.

Depending on when I get out of work and traffic, I may not be down there in time to tailgate until close to 7pm. I plan on tailgating until right before DMB hits the stage though.EDIT: If I have relatively smooth sailing, I could be there as early as like 5:30 though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn need of tickets for IZOD N1?  by  4d2in  DMB[+]sc00p_and_slam 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]sc00p_and_slam 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoIf someone takes yours, I have an extra pair in Section 101 that I'm looking to unload as well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, on December 21 2012, I plan to stay home all day, doors locked and blinds down because I feel that some idiots are going to go crazy thinking the world will end.

Yeah if it was dank then that can be plenty if you're new to smoking. I've had very similar situations smoking with my coworkers after work and then having to drive back home. I just started less than a year ago and they've been smoking a lot longer than I have. Trust me, you get used to it and it doesn't freak you out as much.permalinksavecontextfull comments11001I'm always convinced I come up with comedy GOLD when I tweet while high.

But after a little while you realize the fear is all in your mind and you're able to drive while stoned no problem. I like to think it's your mind freaking the fuck out over how much control you have over everything driving-related.
