I do agree that the standards are dominated by economics, and they may require more stringent "safety factors" to account for the uncertainty of service loads. The Radiohead stage collapse could have been avoided if the stage was slightly over-designed, only adding a marginal increase to the final cost.permalinksavecontextfull commentswhy the hoosier grandstand collapsed in 2010  by  dscipionein  Physics[+]felimz 7 points8 points9 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]felimz 7 points8 points9 points 20 days agoA PhD in physics doesn't make you an expert in physics as much as a PhD in engineering doesn't make you an expert in engineering. What a PhD does is make you an expert in a very small field.In this case, I am a Structural Engineering PhD, which does not make me an expert in SE; I am an expert in structural health monitoring and assessment, which happens to be what you are alluding to in your video.So, here's what I think about it: simplifying the concept of lateral bracing for a YouTube audience is fantastic, and I think your model provides an intuitive understanding of the fundamentals of bracing at work.You are, however, linking your demo to the collapse of a temporary structure, which is not as close as you suggest to a pinned parallelogram. All of these structures have LOTS of lateral bracing, as they would be impossible finish constructing were there not a sufficient lateral support. Specifically, a pinned parallelogram (such as the one you are modeling), will have ~2% of the vertical component of the load acting laterally on the structure due to imperfections. The structure does not collapse due to this load for two reasons: guy-wire and ballast systems, and the small moment-resistivity at the joints and supports.Here's where it gets interesting: even with sufficient guy wires, your structure can still collapse due to torsional failures, column buckling, and shear failures at the joints. This hints at the importance of DESIGN in structural engineering. You can have accounted for all of the critical elements in a structure, and it can still collapse if EACH of the individual components isn't properly designed to account for service loads.In fact, most of these stages fail due to column buckling and torsional failures precipitated by lateral wind loads. The Indiana State Fair stage collapse comes to mind; in that case, the weak point was not mainly in the wiring as much as it was the concrete barriers that the guy wires are usually attached to were not heavy enough to counterbalance the load.permalinksavecontextfull commentswhy the hoosier grandstand collapsed in 2010  by  dscipionein  Physics[+]felimz 2 points3 points4 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]felimz 2 points3 points4 points 20 days agoWell, a PhD in EPP does not tell you anything about how these stages have been historically constructed to allow for economic erection and deconstruction. The columns, joists, and tie-downs that are used in these stages are STANDARD, and the engineer simply has to estimate the expected service loads, look the members up in a table, and specify all the cross-sections in the design accordingly.This stage is unremarkable in its design, but it is evident due to the collapse that it was underdesigned, perhaps as a way to cut costs, or due to negligence.permalinksavecontextfull commentswhy the hoosier grandstand collapsed in 2010  by  dscipionein  Physics[+]felimz 5 points6 points7 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]felimz 5 points6 points7 points 20 days agoI'm a structural engineering PhD, and this gentleman has absolutely no idea what he is talking about. All of these stages have guy lines that work as lateral bracing elements and usually prevent collapse due to swaying.These tension lines can be used effectively as cross-bracing members between the columns, and this may have prevented collapse in this situation, but the guy lines to the ground, provided that they are adequately designed, should be able to laterally support this stage even during a wind event.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy uncle got a 40" LCDTV on Black Friday for $200.

Most interior partitions are not load-bearing (i.e. 6in drywall partitions). Look near stairs, elevator shafts, building perimeter, and near the centroid of the building. Also, note that load bearing walls often come in pairs, so if you find one, there is probably another one running parallel to it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday I was in a 15 story building during an earthquake.

At that point, it's either a matter of surviving a fall amongst a ton of rubble, or having that ton of rubble collapse on top of you. There won't be many "safe regions" in that case, as you will most likely get pinned by rubble even if you're hugging the largest column in the building core.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday I was in a 15 story building during an earthquake.

It turns out, this is much easier on high-rise buildings. You can, however, design a mid-rise building intelligently by playing with diaphragms, shear walls, and the overall building dimensions to modify the natural period.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday I was in a 15 story building during an earthquake.

The framing itself should remain in place, albeit with permanent damage and deformations.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday I was in a 15 story building during an earthquake.

If the building collapsed, would I have been safer on the first floor, 15th floor or somewhere in between?  by  creedofwheatin  askscience[+]felimz 38 points39 points40 points 1 month ago*(0 children)[]felimz 38 points39 points40 points 1 month ago*Structural engineering PhD here attempting to weigh in.Let's assume that we are dealing with a severe seismic event:1) The majority of buildings will suffer member failures (i.e. concrete spalling and delamination, shear failures at joints, beam buckling, bursting of column covers, etc.)HOWEVER,2) Most buildings will remain standing despite these type of failures.So, assuming there are three deformation modes due to seismic displacement (shear, flexural, and axial), the question comes down to a "member failure rate vs. elevation" problem.In the shear case, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near the first floor, since shear forces are transferred and are stronger at the foundation.In the flexural case, if we assume the building acts like a cantilevered beam, then failure will still be greater at the first floor and none at the top floor.In the axial case, the forces should dampen with height so, again, the top floors will be safer.Based on all of these premises, and if the building sections are constant throughout the elevation, then the TOP floor will be the safest during an earthquake.Now, if the building sections become larger with decreasing elevation, then the behavior will depend on the specific design and whether it adequately offsets the greater loads experienced at the base.Note: If you were in a building that suffers catastrophic collapse, then height becomes irrelevant (i.e. a penthouse roof caving under your head is no safer than a basement roof caving in under your head). Under those circumstances, I'd want to be near a shear wall near the core of the building, hopefully under a door-frame or desk in order to minimize the chance of debris injuries.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
