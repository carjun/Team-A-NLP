Accused elementary-school shooter Adam Lanza forced his way into the Sandy Hook School yesterday in the moments before he went on a murderous rampage, killing 20 children, six adults and himself, authorities said this morning.It is believed he was not voluntarily let into the school, Connecticut State Police Lt. Phil Vance told reporters. He forced his way into the school.Vance said the state medical examiners office remained at the school overnight and into the morning, and has not yet released a list of the dead. Their names may be made available today.Lanza is also accused of killing his mother at the family home in the moments before the unfathomable, heartbreaking attack.Of all those shot, one person survived.She is doing fine, Vance said. She has been treated and she will be instrumental in this investigation.Marianne Jacob, a clerk in the school library, this morning described the chaotic scene as gunshots rang out in the school. Jacob said she was in the library with four other adults and 18 fourth-grade students when they heard the school intercom come on and they could hear confusion in the school office.So I called the office cause it I thought it was a mistake and they didnt realize the intercom was on, Jacob said. And the school secretary answered the phone and she said theres shooting. Im amazed she answered the phone. As far as Im concerned, shes was a hero.Jacob said the adults in the library immediately yelled lockdown, and she ran across the hall to a classroom and yelled lockdown.We told them it was a drill. They knew what to do. Jacob said. We knew it was gunshots first of all because we made the phone call. And I think They were like what is that, whats going on. I dont think they had any idea.They then barricaded themselves in a back storage room in the library until the police came to the library door.Authorities have said little of a possible motive  or anything at all in Lanzas background that may provide answers as to why he carried out the attack.Vance, asked whether investigators have found any of Lanzas emails or other writings, said detectives did produce good evidence ... our investigators will be able to use in hopefully painting the picture of how and more importantly why this occurred.Developing ...

But the bigger question might be was his sense of disgust and dismay in the end directed not necessarily at himself but the privileged society and well to do surroundings that ran so ominously false in the tortured young mans mind? Or was his sense of disillusionment and disgust morbidly directed at something that had no real correlation in the real world which he was so maladjusted for? Or even more perversely was his conflict directed at his mother who he couldnt please given her reputation for high standards he was constantly reminded he never measured up to.?http://scallywagandvagabond.com/2012/12/adam-lanza-was-nerd-and-honors-student-but-very-weird-shunned-by-the-community/   Posted 1 hour 19 min ago          Log in or register to post commentsCurmudgeonFrank+0  -0  Scallywag: I read your post and this is the paragraph that is overlooked by everyone it seems.....the part the pharmaceutical industry plays in this type of behavior.  Clearly this is intentionally suppressed....heaven forbid anyone should question the almighty medical industry in their treatments.  Of course we know the agenda is to get rid of the guns....certainly not the prescribed drugs that could at the root.  Begin quote: And perhaps what may make the whole trauma of yesterdays shoot out even more perverse is the fact that the medicine Adam Lanza was taking may have inadvertently facilitated even wilder mood swings, feelings of suicide (reach the warnings of prescriptions to see for yourself) which raises questions of our societys dependence of pills to treat conditions that may have really more to do with societys inability to accept behavior, viewpoints and attitudes that dont closely correlate the preferred dogma which so often breeds resentment a feeling of deep alienation amongst those afflicted as well as sense that they are being bullied on.

Apologies for how hard my previous post will be to read.

There were no gun laws before the 60s and this sort of thing never happened. Even with the strictest gun laws imaginable, this kid would still have been able to buy a gun. In fact the guns belonged to his mother who was a teacher!  None of the shooters in these mass killings had criminal records, so why wouldn't they be able to buy a gun? Unless of course you're suggesting we scrap the second amendment. No, it's the culture.  It's sick...very sick.  We need to stop pretending it isn't.

He was an avid gamer and you can bet it was the one's that reek of violence, but do we now stop making video games as well?  CT has strict gun laws as does Chi-town and Washington - guess where people are shot on a daily basis and by the dozens on some weekends? A loser in China stabbed 22 kids in school the other day, do we now ban utensils? Ban the sales online and at Flea markets and ban multiple clips and assault rifles to START and have ONE SET of rules for ALL sane citizens.

Just remember it was in a leftie state, gun owned by a teacher who most likely is a lefty. Also murder is illegal, it was a 'gun free zone' But hey thanks for cutting back on the funds for mental ill people and supporting illegals and fraud EBT card using illegals.

In the last few weeks there have been reports of people being killed by bow and arrow or being pushed in front of a subway train in NYC.  The guy who killed those people in the Colorado also put explosives in his apt to kill people.  The connection is that there are some people who are only a pill away from killing someone.  The Colorado shooter was kicked out of school on the advice of a mental health professional yet the local authorities did not have him on the radar screen.  Our society has protected the civil rights of the  mentally ill such that they actually have to do harm to themselves or others before they are put away.  I also fear that also the 24/7 news reports feed into the minds of unbalanced people out there who may start to think about copycat crimes.  It frightens me. I pray for these parents but know that nothing will ever fill the void left by the loss of a child.
