"What did she say?"  "Why don't you ask her yourself?"Petty edit out of sheer irritation: Apparently OP decided to give credit to a later response that addressed a completely different scene than the one OP very specifically described and I responded to.  That's cool, whatever. But if you want to get really specific, since the credited post claimed Donna met Rose in Turn Left, Donna really first met Rose in Partners in Crime, when she told her to tell her mom where the car keys are.
