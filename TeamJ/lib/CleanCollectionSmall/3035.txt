Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoI agree, more laws would just mean more crimes... but there won't be any change to the glorification of violence, the shows that focus on murder cases, the news reports that make psychopaths famous... all those, to me, contribute much more to this problem than guns do. Guns are the tool, but the blueprint for this horrific crime was designed by American culture and a lack of mental help for this person, not by his access to guns. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]hockeysauce 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour agoThis is so sad, and yet we will, once again, not learn or change anything. In the next few days people will use this tragedy to argue their sides on gun control. Of course, nothing will be done, the debate will slide off the public radar, and we'll all go back to watching our primetime shows about serial killers and child molesters, but it's okay because nobody will say the F word or show a titty. And then, when this happens again (it will), we'll all wonder why...Sometimes I really fucking hate my country.My heart goes out to those who lost loved ones this morning. I cannot imagine such a tragedy. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat professions would be the most valuable in an apocalyptic world?  by  lets_be_truantin  AskReddit[+]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoIt's good to be a plumber...permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's something about you that would make Reddit hate you?  by  TheBastardTrollin  AskReddit[+]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago<--- Conservative white male. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoLawyers retainage and general billing practices. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMust be a crazy secret  by  jesuzin  pics[+]hockeysauce -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoSo hot.

It should be awarded to the best professional hockey team that is playing this season. Organize a UEFA Champions League type tournament for the AHL and Euro Champions. It's a disgrace to not award this trophy, and maybe it would be a nice message to the NHL...

A website where the majority of users spend their days reading through  and commenting on posts instead of doing their job/class work is overwhelmingly liberal? Shocking.Edit: I feel I should state that I do enjoy this site and some of the liberal points of view. I myself lean conservative, but I understand that the answer lies in compromise. Being constantly bombarded by liberal opinions (both rational and ridiculous) has me contantly analyzing, adjusting, or reinforcing my own opinions. TL:DR - You're all a bunch of hippie jerks, but I love ya for it... :)permalinksavecontextfull commentsCommunication has ceased between the NHL and NHLPA  by  mrbelsoonin  hockey[+]hockeysauce 4 points5 points6 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 4 points5 points6 points 29 days agoJust cancel the season officially please so I can get my season tickets money back and move on with my life... permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt's this shit, ladies...  by  gnome_championin  facepalm[+]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 29 days agoDear Ms. DeLores Tucker.... permalinksavecontextfull commentsInstaller downloading.  by  LakesideHerbologyin  AdviceAnimals[+]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 29 days agoIs the fact that the title isn't "Installing downloader" bothering anybody else?

What are you best "That's right, I'm a Jedi" moments?  by  Ninja_Please117in  AskReddit[+]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 1 point2 points3 points 29 days agoAbout 8 years ago a friend of mine and I were on a train coming from Grand Central in NYC. My buddy had gone to HS in the Bronx and had rode this line (Harlem line) to school every day. He says, "Watch bro, we'll get there at 4:35" or whatever the actual time was. We're watching his digital watch as the train approaches our stop, and its 4:34 as the train is stopping. I watched as the seconds counted up and my friend's right foot touched platform at EXACTLY 4:35:00. He looked at me dead seriously and just ran down the platform with his arms in the air. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSecond trailer for Grand Theft Auto V is out now!  by  MikkoKin  gaming[+]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 29 days agoAs a resident of NYC I said the same thing about GTA IV. The city/map is the game's true main character, and R* really seperates themselves from other games with the atmosphere of their settings. LC felt like NYC and watching the trailers for V I'm already flashing back to time I've spent in LA. I can't wait to get to Los Santos. God. Damnit. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHomeless man jailed for "theft of city utilities".

He was charging his cell phone in a public picnic area.  by  TheKiddin  WTF[+]hockeysauce -1 points0 points1 point 1 month ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce -1 points0 points1 point 1 month agoI'm sorry, I just can't see why a homeless man would be spending $20/month just to find a job. Contact number? Where's he applying, Goldman Sachs? No, the kind of jobs he'll need at first to pull himself out of poverty would not be the kind of jobs requiring a resume, contact number, etc. Who wants to keep in touch with a family that allows a member to walk around homeless? You'd think one of them has a couch for him... so, again, I don't see the reason for a cell phone here. Just because cell phones have become the standard doesn't mean old communications cease to exist. Find some quarters, buy a stamp, send a letter. If his family is local he can walk over and tell them how he's doing....Web browser? All day bussing around the city? He's HOMELESS! Tough times are, get ready for it, TOUGH. Look in the classifieds of the paper everyday. Walk, hell steal a bike if you have too...I do not understand how you can justify all the "expenses" of a homeless man trying to keep up with the modern world. There are still old-world and cheaper ways to get things done, and if you're homeless you should start using them. Any person who doesn't have a home but has a monthly cell phone bill is a fucking idiot.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHomeless man jailed for "theft of city utilities". He was charging his cell phone in a public picnic area.  by  TheKiddin  WTF[+]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]hockeysauce 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoHe doesn't have a HOME. I don't care how cheap his plan is, he should be using that money to find whatever kind of shelter he can find on a weekly or monthly basis...Work... he's homeless, not legless. Get his ass to the places he usually finds work every morning... plenty of people in major cities looking for laborers, every day, and a ton of those laborers don't have cell phones yet still manage to find/get the work...Did you really just mention drugs when the guy is homeless? Maybe drugs are why he's homeless.... permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
