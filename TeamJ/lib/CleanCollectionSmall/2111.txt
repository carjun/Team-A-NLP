If there's time, an announcement will come over the loud speaker saying "Mr. Red is in the building" which means stop whatever you're doing, lock the door, turn out the lights and get your kids out of sight and far away from the door.If there's not enough time, aka someone just walks in and immediately starts shooting then it's more of a free for all to just react and lock yourself in.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJ.J.

After Columbine we started having "Mr. Red" drills twice a year every year just in case something like this happened at my school. It's horrible that she had to take action like this, but thankfully she was able to think and act that quickly to save more lives.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJordan's "Other jerseys"  by  source24designsin  nba[+]Inquisitive_Ender 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Inquisitive_Ender 5 points6 points7 points 2 days agoYou're a saint.permalinksavecontextfull commentsJordan's "Other jerseys"  by  source24designsin  nba[+]Inquisitive_Ender 19 points20 points21 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Inquisitive_Ender 19 points20 points21 points 2 days agoMan, I would kill for a MJ Space Jam jersey.permalinksavecontextfull comments7001Google's Year in Review, Zeitgeist 2012 (youtube.com)submitted 2 days ago by Inquisitive_Ender to videoscommentsharecancelloading...WE FUCKING WIN!!!!!!!!!!  by  Hawk_Bluein  eagles[+]Inquisitive_Ender 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]Inquisitive_Ender 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoGood on you, Sakrie.

I feel like Once our line comes back healthy next year we'll be fine without drafting a tackle so high. I'd much rather draft someone like Teo, who's supposed to be billed as the closest thing we've seen to Ray Lewis since Ray came out of Miami.I'd love to see us address defense first since it seems to be more of a glaring problem than our line (when it's healthy) for next season.permalinksavecontextfull commentsESPN Rumors reports Phils considering 5 OF options  by  Muggiin  phillies[+]Inquisitive_Ender 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Inquisitive_Ender 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoIt did in fact cost us Vance.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPhillies and Rangers in "advanced talks" for Michael Young  by  metssuckin  phillies[+]Inquisitive_Ender 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Inquisitive_Ender 1 point2 points3 points 9 days agoI mean we're going to have to settle at one position for next season. Whether that means 3rd/CF/BP is up to RAJ. There's not really anything else in the 3rd base market this off-season so I'm alright with this, especially considering what we'd be giving up.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDavid Sterns 10 Most Infamous Acts As Commissioner  by  dallashoosierin  nba[+]Inquisitive_Ender 7 points8 points9 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]Inquisitive_Ender 7 points8 points9 points 9 days agoHornets have to be glad they didn't end up with Bynum.
