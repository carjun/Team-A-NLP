(Stephen King, John Saul, Jonathan Kellerman, Kathy Reichs)  by  knieuwlandtin  sandiego[+]BewRadley 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]BewRadley 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoi lurv bookoff.  i hate selling shit.  they'll give you like 40 cents for one book.  they're not about the title.  they're all abotu the book condition.so basically, you go.  you dump off a pile of books.  they encourage you to browse while they check the "quality" of the books you bring.  then when they're ready, they'll page you and tell you how much $ they'll give you for your books.if you DGAF about getting $ for your books (like op's case where he was ready to give free books away), then you miiiight have enough to buy a cookie from subway, lol.  either way, it's a nice place to buy used books, manga, comic books, dvds, games, etc.  i love that place.it's located on kearny mesa road, right off balboa.  i'd recommend checking it out.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
