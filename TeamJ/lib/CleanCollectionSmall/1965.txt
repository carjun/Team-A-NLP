For instance I see no place for that sliding down scene (though in another scene the using the ramparts as a shield was a nice touch ), though I thought the moria staircase falling apart scene was a LOTR equivalent of what I was worried about so I will only speculate.I am also a bit tired of continuously hearing 'the hobbit is a more childlike story', a director can still go ott on the sillyness aspect so it's still a topic one can debate without blanket 'the hobbit is made for 12 year olds so your opinion is invalid' statements.      permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Hobbit Post-Production Diary  by  mwilcoxin  movies[+]camsis -5 points-4 points-3 points 21 days ago (0 children)[]camsis -5 points-4 points-3 points 21 days agoI am a bit worried of the Great Goblin scenes like when he was editing the scene where they were sliding down some massive 'cave slide' 2.15 and some goblin walkway scenes but apart from that looks good. permalinksavecontextfull comments11123Scottish dancing: Aristocracy level (youtube.com)submitted 24 days ago by camsis to videoscommentsharecancelloading...Sister was watering the garden when she came across this monstrous fungi.  by  Capricorn94in  WTF[+]camsis 13 points14 points15 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]camsis 13 points14 points15 points 29 days ago'first native Australian fungus to be formally described' fucking had to be Australia didn't it.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsScenes where music is used perfectly?  by  Acekardoin  movies[+]camsis 0 points1 point2 points 29 days ago (0 children)[]camsis 0 points1 point2 points 29 days agoBronson Harmonica bar scene in once upon a time in the westhe knows how to playpermalinksavecontextfull comments14001Just watched a few good men - if Cruise did that in real life, went in contempt of court and then everything happened, would it still be admissible/fine?
