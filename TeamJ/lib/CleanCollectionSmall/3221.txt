This just has a feel that they wont get away with doing nothing this time. The response to mass shootings, even the one that nearly took the life of a member of Congress, Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, has followed a familiar pattern. On the day of the attack, politicians express shock and grief but maintain it is not the time to talk politics. A few members of Congress dust off long-dormant gun control bills in the days to follow. Then the issue fades away.Representative Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York, who came to the House after her husband was killed in a mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road, said Friday that she would not let that happen this time.The time to talk about it should have been after the last shooting or the shooting before that, she said.Ms. McCarthy said she had met with her staff on Thursday to plan her legislative battles for the coming year. At that meeting, she said, she declared that she would resume her quest for far-reaching gun violence legislation, reinstating the assault weapons ban, banning high-capacity ammunition magazines, instituting criminal background checks on gun buyers at gun shows, and improving instant background checks to more thoroughly catch people with histories of mental illness.Im not going to be shy anymore, she said.
