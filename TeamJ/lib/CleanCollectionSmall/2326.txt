My dps went down over 30k, looking for guidance to bring it back up!  by  Dusty129in  Diablo[+]LetsTalkRampart 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours agoA few things:1) Get an IK helm. They're SOOOOOOOOO cheap nowadays it's amazing.  They all have open socket, so you'll get a lot of life from that, you'll continue to get high crit chance and a lot of strength. It also means that when you can afford it, you'll get the IK Chest and get the 5-piece IK set bonus, which isn't horrible and definitely helps with keeping up WOTB.2) Upgrade your main hand weapon. You do NOT need to have life steal on this weapon. Instead, simply make sure that you have a high DPS axe or mace with STR, an open socket and, if possible, crit damage. A strength echoing fury with an open socket will do just fine. If you cannot afford this yet, go to the next item on this list.3) Upgrade your gems. They're really, really, really bad gems. You should have flawless star emeralds for your weapons. Insert a flawless star amythest in your new IK helm.4) Get an amulet with crit chance. You need at least 8% crit chance on your amulet, with strength and preferably life. You don't need any LOH on it - your DPS will soon be high enough where you don't need LOH to sustain yourself at all. Get the best amulet you can get.Once you've completed this list you're going to be in pretty good shape, and you'll almost certainly be over 100k DPS.Good luck!permalinksavecontextfull commentsSchool shooting reported in Newtown, Conn.  by  yezplzin  news[+]LetsTalkRampart 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agoWho the hell shoots up an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

The only thing is, amulets with CC but without CD or IAS are at a severe discount, no matter how good everything else on it really is.That said, this is great for a fire monk.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPC NA-SC Barb Ice Climbers max move speed. Can't find other's with similar stats on the ah.  by  Oldirtyin  d3loot[+]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoHmmm... no vit, and low STR for Ice climbers with 12% move speed. That said, they're still very valuable, and pickup radius is really nice. As someone who owns 12% MS Ice Climbers and is always looking to upgrade, I agree: about 150-250 mil is right for these.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPC NA Sc: lamentation mighty belt  by  echowonin  d3loot[+]LetsTalkRampart 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours agoNot worth a lot. IK Belts are simply better. 1% CC isn't worth all that much, and it's otherwise just a 190 STR / 75 VIT / life steal belt. You can get (for very cheap) a 190 STR / 3% lifesteal / 70+ AR IK Belt, and just two of the IK items gives barbs 60 more AR.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan you carry a uber mp10 run? i got machine.  by  Vanstraatenin  diablo3[+]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoUm.... You need 3 machines. Not one. You use them all in one uber run.Secondly, MP10 carries are very nice, but it's a lot faster for the person doing the running to do MP8 runs (that's what I typically offer). It's better to accumulate 6 machines and then ask to be carried MP8. You'll end up with (odds are) at least one ring and parts for another, and both runs could be finished in the same amount of time it takes to do one MP10 run, where you'll end up with, maximum and minimum, one ring without leftover parts.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]LetsTalkRampart 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours agoChiropractors.

It's the perfect coffee table computer. I know that Apple wants everyone to buy their own, but it just doesn't make sense for a family to buy each child their own iPad. It would make more sense for there to be a "family iPad" with multiple accounts on it with different contacts/photos/media for the various different people that use it. I certainly don't want access to my work (or personal, for that matter) email granted to every single person who touches the iPad that usually sits on my couch.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan of Steel - Official Trailer #2 [HD]  by  lic4ru5in  movies[+]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoOk, Phillip. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan of Steel - Official Trailer #2 [HD]  by  lic4ru5in  movies[+]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoSmallville was a TERRIBLE extrapolation on his origin.

Really, really, really bad. I watched every episode at least twice, but it was really bad, and really cheesy.In the end, it's hard to watch a superhero show that's soapy or full of cheesy, low-budget gimmicks.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan of Steel - Official Trailer #2 [HD]  by  lic4ru5in  movies[+]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoSuperman is supposed to be (almost) always 29 years old.

ORDo you post it to d2jsp and hope that you don't get scammed? I'd do the latter, because even if you sold it for just 2 billion the savings of 300 million is worth it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat works better against Reflect Damage affix for a Barb?  by  Fabrizio89in  Diablo[+]LetsTalkRampart 11 points12 points13 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 11 points12 points13 points 3 days agoReflect Damage hurts you at all?

What should I buy?  by  shewantedtoleavein  diablo3[+]LetsTalkRampart -1 points0 points1 point 7 days ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart -1 points0 points1 point 7 days agoYou need to make several improvements before you plunge on buying new weapons. 1) Upgrade that belt. It's INCREDIBLE how cheap IK Belts are nowadays. Buy one with at least 2.8% lifesteal and 190 STR. They automatically come with 70+ AR, and you can select one that adds Frenzy damage. It's well worth losing the VIT from your belt.2) I don't know what build you're running now, but you really should move to a standard WW build. That means: Frenzy (or Bash) with your favorite rune, Whirlwind - Hurricane, Sprint - Run Like The Wind, War Cry - Impunity, Battle Rage - Into the Fray, and Wrath of the Berserker - Thrive on Chaos.Don't deviate from this at all until your DPS is at least 150k or your AR is much, much higher than it is now.3) Upgrade that chest. You can keep running Blackthorne's for the fantastic 2-piece set bonus, but get one with a lot more STR to begin with. It can't be too expensive. Also, look into upgrading your shoulders to some with a lot less HP but a lot more (200+) strength.4) Upgrade your weapons. You're going to lose HUGE amounts of strength when doing so because of the Bul-Kathos set bonus and the inherent strength on both weapons. However, you're going to REQUIRE an open socket on both main hand and offhand, and that alone is going to vastly boost your DPS when you put in some nice, expensive emeralds. Right now your crit damage is very, very, very low. You need to boost that by at least a couple hundred, at which point you'll have a significant DPS increase. DEFINITELY keep a mace in the main hand (perhaps an echoing fury), and make sure that your off-hand has lifesteal and an open socket. If it has crit chance, all the better.permalinksavecontextfull commentsDiablo 3 (Patch 1.06): How to price/find a Stone of Jordan - YouTube  by  shadorianin  diablo3[+]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]LetsTalkRampart 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoSadly, this doesn't help those of us looking for just Cold Damage or WW Crit %.
