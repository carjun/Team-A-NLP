It would arguably reduce the number of victims.  It could also potentially increase the number of victims if the "good guy" hits bystanders instead of the shooter.  The goal should be to find ways to prevent the shootings from occurring in the first place, not recreate the wild wild west the hallways of an already bloody school and pretend that it's justice.  Putting a gun in the hand of a faculty member does NOT guarantee a better or different outcome.  It provides the possibility of both better and worse outcomes and doesn't alter the original situation in any way, and that is all that it does.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I'm just saying that when he shot somebody, the answer isn't to give every other faculty and staff member a gun.

Is there an excerpt of the passage immediately preceding and following it somewhere?  I just get the impression that there is a context I am missing.  He's certainly said some things that I think are assholish, but this just doesn't feel like his particular brand of snide.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsAm I the only one who loves Hitchens but found some of his final words despicable?  by  ragabooin  atheism[+]Cylinsier 1 point2 points3 points 40 minutes ago (0 children)[]Cylinsier 1 point2 points3 points 40 minutes agoI find it kind of dubious that he would have said that.

Shootings like this are just one branch on the tree of consequences of mental health stigmatization in our society.  The culture around it needs to change.  It's still difficult for a lot of people to get insurance that will cover mental health, even through employers, for example.  That's just unacceptable.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

"I killed my sister because..." and that's the fight club moment, but if they did it would need a contradict her acting and attitudes to that point entirely.  Which, to me, isn't at all problematic.  If were are to believe Lorelei when she planted the handshake clue, then Jane has already met Red John in some other context and shaken his hand.  And Red John was not being himself.  Therefore, it is already 100% guaranteed that they are going to contradict someone's acting and attitudes to that point entirely.  It's going to happen.  The only question is who.  That's why it's "impossible", unless they rewrite something that's been aired to an extent which explains her attitudes and actions, which would be a lot of work  It's very little work.  She's Red John and she's toying with him because that's what Red John does.  She's also obsessed with him just like he is with her, so she is working a con on him to get him to trust her with the hopes that he will turn and join her.  Everything else about them is mirrored.  They are both intelligent, obsessive, and arrogant.  Therefore, it only stands to reason that because Jane is a master liar and con artist, so too would be Red John.  Jane plays roles all the time to catch criminals.  Red John is playing a role to catch Jane.  Again, we know that for a fact if we accept Lorelei's clue as being genuine.  Red John is hiding in plain site and pretending to be someone else.  It won't be anymore jarring for it to be Lorelei than it would for it to be Mashburn.  It would take very little work on the writers' parts and is completely consistent with everything we've seen so far.  They wouldn't have to change a thing.  Mashburn is this  They are friends now.  CBI Ron, Creepy RJ expert and euthanized med examiner  Too obvious, too easy.  Would be a lazy, cheap out for the writers.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe universal greeting!

Red John wouldn't allow himself to be trapped in an institution.  Unless she really was taken by surprise by Jane's ruse at the end of the last season.  In which case, that would explain why Red John hasn't killed her yet like he has every other associate who has been captured.  It would also explain why Red John didn't rescue her despite it being so easy.  She knew Jane would rescue her and she knows they are looking for a man for Red John and she is considered a key witness to that, so it was only a matter of time before he came and got her and that being a woman gives her a step up on law enforcement.  The acting surprised that it was him was just more of the plan.  Her sister's murder - the story where she's unsure if Red John really did this - that's too convincing. Her acting itself - she's going through these emotions.  And that's exactly how she would have to sell it if she were Red John.  The more convincing it is, the more drama we experience later with the reveal.  The sister's murder is likely her first, which is why it doesn't match the MO of the others.  She was still figuring out her style.  Allowing herself to be out of control, Patrick Jane manipulating the situation like that - there wasn't enough room in the writing for other levels.  All designed to get inside his head and gain his trust.  She is just as infatuated with him as he is with Red John and she acts in irrational ways in response to him when she otherwise wouldn't.  I think Loralei is just Loralei, the sister of a Red John victim that shows Red John likes to recruit like that.  Except John's never recruited like that before.  Every other recruit has been a murderer or psycho in their own right.  Lorelei doesn't fit.  She's an innocent, seemingly, another victim.  John has no problems killing the most trusted recruits who are killers and in awe of him.  Why would he recruit a women who seems stable and non-violent (aside from being a Red John recruit) to perform the most important role in his game with Jane, which is to seduce him and try to ascertain if he is willing to turn?  The trust level is way too high, and that he wouldn't IMMEDIATELY kill her after capture makes absolutely no sense in regards to his past behavior.  It's completely inconsistent.  A more consistent explanation is that Lorelei is Red John and only she would only trust herself to be the one to try and test Jane to see if he will flip.  And not only did she trick him into breaking her out of prison, she tricked him into letting her go.  Patrick will break Loralei and she will help, but at the cost of her life.If she isn't Red John and he's going to kill her, the only consistent way for it to happen is essentially right after she is let go.  He's not going to give her the opportunity to get back to Jane.  If her next appearance in the show isn't on a morgue table in the very first shot, then either she's Red John, or the show has jumped the shark.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsIntroducing Westvleteren XII buyers to Belgian Beers  by  Luco_Din  beer[+]Cylinsier 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]Cylinsier 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoAwesome haul!  permalinksavecontextfull commentsSuspect thread results - Who is Red John?  by  youre_all_sickin  TheMentalist[+]Cylinsier 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Cylinsier 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoJane also shot Red John to death in the food court of a shopping mall.

Just across the border in New York, Ommegang also does a number of beers in Belgian styles that are very good.  Crossing the ocean for the real thing, I would recommend van Steenberge beers, particularly Gulden Draak, Augustijn and Piraat.  Other good ones are Delirium Tremens/Nocturnum/Noel, Gouden Carolus, and Bernardus.  Westvleteren is in particular a trappist brewery, of which they are only eight in the world, 6 of which are in Belgium and the other 2 of which are right over the border more or less (there are rules that determine whether or not you can call yourself a trappist).  The four that I can speak to are Chimay, Orval, Westmalle and Rochefort and they all make excellent beers that are worth trying.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Skyfall face swap earlier today inspired me to find out what they really should have looked like.
