We didn't deserve to win based on the second half performance. Torres had his chance and blew it. We don't have a plan B, too much short passing and pretty touches without having the option to hit in a cross and have someone win it in the air. Well done Corinthians.v1/comments/context/70b0629f-c2ce-31d8-b32a-da0b71e6c28c/comment/1355686323621-24996f27-abc7-4349-907d-05621b5b743dMichael Cox1 hour 22 minutes agoAwful time wasting & play acting by the Brazilians, all though I accept that Drogba did the same thing; I would argue that although what Didier did was wrong, he rarely feigned injury to get a fellow professional sent off. There is nothing worse than what that Brazilian did; he hits Cahill in the face, Cahill taps him on the shin & he falls down rolling around as if he's been macheted. I don't know why FIFA don't punish this tumorous behaviour in our game.v1/comments/context/70b0629f-c2ce-31d8-b32a-da0b71e6c28c/comment/1355679356032-460bd2c6-40e7-4184-a213-1cb193d87299Man Utd Fans are benders3 hours agoI see Fernando was on fire again today (not).

RDM we miss you! Pep guardiola will never accept to manage a club with someone like Abramovitch above, the futur don t look good at all and for that Roman you are responsable!

For the first time a defending champion couldn't make it to the knockout phase, what a shame. Proves once again that Chelsea won only because of luck and nothing else. Shame on the blues.
