But when shit goes down and I'm on bad/wrong end of it, I try my damnedest to mitigate the effects instead of letting it all pour on.  He wanted it to stop, so make a comment public and that would help make it stop.I wasn't 'victim blaming', it was a suggestion to get it to stop.  Whether he attempts to mitigate or he doesn't, he has a civil case for libel against the media, and IMO he should pursue it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

That time will come when the dust settles and that screencap is actually legit.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoYou're right.  I kept it in consideration, albeit the perspective of my comments; my comments (in my mind) were both to call the bluff (on the fake) and to also give advice on how to get people off his ass if the s/s img was legit.Since then, the profile has gone completely private, though (gives the same response as it does if you tried to go to my fb profile.)  That's not to say that this particular Ryan Lanza did that himself or if LEOs did or whatnot.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

At 18, there's lots of industries that you can try to go into.  Are you planning on going to college, and if so, what for?  If not, what kind of thing interests you?Try to get a very low-level, entry level job at a company that is in the industry you're wanting to be at in the long run?  Lots of places hire from within, so keep that in mind.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat supposedly legitimate things do you think are scams?  by  Ruddiverin  AskReddit[+]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIn regards to Android, there is a very useful app called LBE Security Master (requires root, though.) It allows you to deny/allow any and all permissions that the app lists as needing access to.  It will also inform you when the permission is being used by the app.  It is incredibly useful and also incredibly enlightening to what (and how often) permissions apps are using.However, the app was written in Chinese but has been translated to English.  The APK can be found on the popular Android dev boards (ie xda)permalinksavecontextfull commentsA friend of mine went swimming at the beach. At night. On Cape Cod.

It's where my weekly skate is... ironically the aux ice (which I'd presume the public skate would be) is better than the main ice.UNMC also has a mini-rink outside which is open now.

He then lets unsuspecting motorists drive away with drug scents still on their vehicles  by  maxwellhillin  Bad_Cop_No_Donut[+]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]the_anj 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoRight, yea, I was talking about it being legalized at the federal level.  Having certain aspects of it being criminalized at the state level is perfectly fine by me (or certain aspects decriminalized, which as you said was the case in CO and WA.)  But anyways, I (albeit, vaguely) was speaking in the context of personal use, as I was trying to stay with the context of the OP.But anyways, yea it will be a long hard road.  In a way, that's what I meant with my OP.  I didn't mean to say it can't be done, but that there are major players acting as huge hurdles that have to be overcome.  But if we get more states to decriminalize it for rec use, then we're making progress.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhile testifying under oath, cop admits to planting drugs or drug scents on cars in hotel parking lots for K9 "training" without notifying the owners.

But I'm still a bit skeptical that MJ will be legalized (federally) or at least "downgraded" from being a Schedule 1 drug in the next few years, unless states start (in rapid fashion) to follow Colorado and Washington's lead.  But even then, MJ being legalized or downgraded from Schedule 1 doesn't end the war on drugs.  It definitely helps, though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhile testifying under oath, cop admits to planting drugs or drug scents on cars in hotel parking lots for K9 "training" without notifying the owners.
