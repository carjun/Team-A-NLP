Cedric would still be dead, but at the same time, Voldemort wouldn't have come back at all.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFamily Research Council Dumps UPS For Citing Anti-Gay Bias In Severing Boy Scouts Funding  by  IranRPCVin  ainbow[+]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoHaha, what?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat does "transphobia" mean to you?  by  -JoNeum42in  ainbow[+]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoI don't like that you misquoted Morgan Freeman. The original quote mentioned homophobia, and while it's still a great quote and one I feel applies here as well, I'm bothered that you didn't specifically mention the change. Don't get me wrong, I don't think you had any sort of bad intention in doing so, it's just poor form to make such an alteration like that.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat does "transphobia" mean to you?  by  -JoNeum42in  ainbow[+]evercharmer -1 points0 points1 point 12 hours ago (0 children)[]evercharmer -1 points0 points1 point 12 hours agoWait, so it's pedantic for us to insist that heterosexual sex is sex between a man and a woman and has nothing to do with genitals, whereas narrowing things down specifically to biology and/or genitals isn't?I'm just confused at this point.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy second favorite Harry Potter trio  by  MetallicSquidin  harrypotter[+]evercharmer 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoVoldemort and Quirrell were better.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I can't see myself bothering to do it except for maybe with the posters I normally see around here, but the thing is, if I recognize their name on here I'll likely recognize their name elsewhere as well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEveryone's sharing personal essentials.

This is even an issue with Pottermore; the prime example off the top of my head being the question that asked you whether you'd rather be known as wise, brave, powerful, or kind, I believe the options were. Ignoring how transparent the question was, it has no idea knowing why you choose which one you choose, and a snake could see any of these images as the most beneficial depending on where they're coming from, where they want to go, and how to best get there.permalinksavecontextfull commentsRemember the 10 y.o. cancer girl who kissed Chase in season two?  by  thegreatchuyin  HouseMD[+]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoWow, sure has been a while.permalinksavecontextfull comments"Friend" of mine erased all my notes about the novel I'm writing from my laptop for petty revenge, here's my idea on how to get him back and humiliate him into submission  by  BananaMeGustaIIin  myevilplan[+]evercharmer 8 points9 points10 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 8 points9 points10 points 3 days agoOh, that is just not fucking okay. Presumably months of work over a couple games. It's great you had a backup, even if it sadly wasn't up to date, but that guy needs to pay.I say glitter on the ceiling fans. All of them, and then also in his dresser and closet.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFlorida man pulled over while driving with traffic sign embedded in his head - Florida, WTF is wrong with you?  by  JoelBlackoutin  WTF_Florida[+]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoNot really that WTF; the guy was in shock. It is kind of crazy though, seeing someone stumble around after being in an accident, often right into traffic. Same thing happened with this guy, only his car could still drive fine so that's what he ended up doing instead.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBattlestar Galactica - Life-sized! - 4+ million blocks!  by  OliverFrenchiein  Minecraft[+]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoNO, YOU BITCH!permalinksavecontextfull commentsThanks, Voldy.

I've never played with it myself, so I can't really tell you much about it, but it certainly looks like it changes things up a bit.permalinksavecontextfull commentsSlughorn on Muggle Born Witches and Wizards  by  donbotish444in  harrypotter[+]evercharmer 14 points15 points16 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 14 points15 points16 points 5 days agoNah, to me it sounded a lot like someone saying, "But I can't believe she's gay, she seems like such a normal girl!" and following it up with, "Don't think I'm prejudiced or anything, though, my best friend is gay!"permalinksavecontextfull commentsTo simplify this as much as possible - Give me one good, solid reason to live.  by  NNoeoNNin  suicidology[+]evercharmer 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 2 points3 points4 points 5 days agoWell, you need to figure out what's best for you, so while something society might find acceptable would be nice, I wouldn't make that I major catching point. Suicide is already seen by most as completely unacceptable, so you're not holding that option to that point.Good luck in choosing the option best for you.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTo simplify this as much as possible - Give me one good, solid reason to live.  by  NNoeoNNin  suicidology[+]evercharmer 6 points7 points8 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 6 points7 points8 points 5 days agoI can't. You have to define life on your own terms, and you're the one who decides the meaning of your own life. Maybe you could do it by broadening your experiences, learning something new, trying to find something you're passionate enough to pursue.While suicide is certainly your choice to make and you won't hear any contrary argument from me, I do think you may have come to the conclusion that it's your best option from a fallacy. You see it as the only rational option, but what pool of options are you starting with? If the choice you're making is simply between continuing on as you have been and ending it all, why not consider changing your life first? It isn't like you have much to lose at this point; for most people the worst case scenario is that if they just pick up and go somewhere they'll end up on the streets with no money or dead in a ditch from running into the wrong sort of person. You're already considering a voluntary death. If you should decide to do something crazy like just leave to see where life takes you and it all goes horribly wrong, well, suicide is still a viable option.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGirlfriend Beats Boyfriend, Girlfriend Gets Arrested  by  nollz69in  JusticePorn[+]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]evercharmer 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoYeah, but the second you start reading the sidebar you realize it's a whole subcommunity with their own SRS subreddits and crazy ideas. Now, if they just stayed there it would be one thing, but sometimes the crazy shit leaks out like they expect the world to be one grand safe space where nobody disagrees with the fempire.It's just weird is all, and oftentimes rude.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
