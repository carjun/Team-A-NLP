His mother, Nancy, was found dead at their home, according to the officers, who asked for anonymity because the investigation is continuing. Authorities plan a news briefing today.The shooting brought chaos and worldwide attention to the town of 28,000 about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of New York City. Students recounted cowering in the corners of the school of 700, while parents told of rushing to discover whether their children were among the dead. Officials have yet to describe a motive.As a country, we have been through this too many times, President Barack Obama said in a news conference, struggling to hold back tears. Our hearts are broken today.It was the worst U.S. massacre since the 2007 rampage at Virginia Tech university, and the latest in a deadly year. Just four days ago, three died after a gunman opened fire inside a mall in suburban Portland, Oregon. In August, a shooter took the lives of six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, before being killed by a police officer. In July, a masked gunman opened fire at a midnight movie in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 and injuring 58.Emergency CallYesterday, it was Newtowns turn.Shortly after 9:30 a.m., police received a call from the school, where students from kindergarten through fourth grade attend, Lieutenant Paul Vance of the Connecticut State Police said in a news briefing. The shooting took place in two rooms, he said.The killer wore combat gear, CNN reported. He shot through glass to enter the building and then shot the principal, Dawn Hochsprung, when she confronted him, said Maryann Jacob, an assistant librarian.C.J. Hoekenga, a Sandy Hook fourth-grader, was in music class watching The Nutcracker when he heard bangs, heavy breathing and then shots. His teacher told them to get into a closet, the youngster said.Saying PrayersAt first I thought it was practice, C.J. said. Then we realized it wasnt.He and classmates said prayers until a police officer arrived. They then exited single-file and ran to a nearby fire station, he said.Im relieved that most of the children got out and the man behind this is dead, C.J. said.Elise Beier, 10, also a fourth-grader, said she could hear the gunfire and shouting over the public address system, which remained on throughout the incident.Many killings took place in a kindergarten class, the Hartford Courant reported.Principal Dawn Hochsprung died in the attack, the New York Times reported.When the police arrived, occupants in one room were so afraid to open the doors that they did so only after an officer showed his badge through the window, said Jacob, who had 18 kids in the library at the time of the shooting.Alerting ParentsAutomatic telephone calls alerted parents. Janet Ziperstein, 39, raced to the school to find her fourth- and second-grader unharmed.It was an eerie, odd, cold chaos, she said.The bodies will remain where they fell until they are identified, Vance said. Parents havent been allowed into the school to see their children, he said.Authorities recovered two 9 mm handguns at the school, one Glock and one Sig Sauer, said a federal law-enforcement official who requested anonymity because the investigation was continuing. A .223-caliber rifle was also found, AP reported.Lanza killed his mother at their home before driving in her car to the school, AP reported, citing a law-enforcement official briefed on the investigation and not authorized to discuss it. The guns he used were of the same makes and models that Nancy owned, state licensing records or permits apparently show, according to the Times.Parents DivorcedNancy J. Lanza and Peter J. Lanza were divorced in 2009, court records show.Louise Tambascio, 70, a friend of Nancys and owner of My Place, a restaurant where the suspects brother used to work, said Adam Lanza had Aspergers syndrome. He had a personality disorder, AP reported, citing a law-enforcement official briefed on the investigation.Lanza was intelligent, quiet and awkward, Tambascio said.Mark Tambascio, her 45-year-old son, said Lanza was introverted.He couldnt deal with regular people, Mark Tambascio said. He was kind of a sociopath.Catherine Urso, a Newtown resident and piano teacher, said her son Nicholas went to Newtown High School with Adam Lanza. She said she used to see Adam dressed in Gothic garb.Lanzas brother, 24-year-old Ryan Lanza of Hoboken, New Jersey, was questioned by authorities, according to a law enforcement official who asked for anonymity because of the continuing investigation. He told officers he hadnt been in touch with his brother since about 2010, the news service said.Police HuddleA huddle of officers and detectives escorted a man with a black jacket covering his head out of the Hoboken Police Department about 8:50 p.m. The man left in a white car with three others.In Newtown, Nick Germak lives about two blocks from the Lanzas in a hillside neighborhood. Many residents are transient, moving to the area to take corporate jobs before moving to follow the next one, he said.At least one neighborhood child, a boy in kindergarten or first grade with blond hair, was killed, Germak said.We moved to this remote town in New England and never expected this to happen, Germak said. How do we put our kids on a school bus again and believe theyll be safe?Holding VigilLast night, businesses in Sandy Hooks town square shut their doors early. Fun Kuts, a barber shop, hung a sign that read Our thoughts and prayers are with the Sandy Hook community. A few hundred residents attended a vigil at St. Rose of Lima Church, crowding into the aisles and listening at open windows because there wasnt enough space inside. A somber crowd heard Monsignor Robert Weiss read a note from Pope Benedict XVI expressing heartfelt grief.The deadliest shooting in the U.S. in recent years is the Virginia Tech campus rampage of 2007, in which Seung-Hui Cho took 33 lives, including his own. In 1999, two students shot 12 classmates and a teacher in Columbine High School in suburban Denver before killing themselves.The victims in Newtown were younger.The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful, little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, Obama said. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.--With assistance from Laura Marcinek in Newtown, Martin Z. Braun and Margaret Collins in Hoboken, Phil Mattingly, Roger Runningen and Mark Silva in Washington, Michelle Kaske in New York and Michael C. Bender in Tallahassee.
