This is a curated space. Submissions determined to fall outside of the stated topic will be removed by the moderators, and a more appropriate subreddit will be recommended instead. >2. Submissions that would be appropriate for /r/Help, /r/Bugs, /r/Circlebroke, /r/IdeasForTheAdmins, /r/SubredditDrama or /r/RedditDev will be removed. >3. Personal attacks, abusive language, trolling, racism and bigotry will not be tolerated. After three violations of this rule, repeat offenders will be temporarily banned for a two week "cooling off" period, pending moderator review. Impersonating other redditors or spamming will earn an immediate ban. >4. If the purpose of your comment is to derail the discussion, troll another user, personally attack a user, or make a racial/bigoted statement then it will be removed. Comments that obviously add nothing to the discussion will also be removed (e.g. "lol", "this", "I agree"). >5. Usernames containing racist or bigoted slurs will be banned without warning. >The Theory of Reddit family of subreddits:/r/TheoryOfReddit/r/TheoryOfIdeas/r/TheoryOfLinks/r/TheoryOfModeration/r/TrueTheoryOfReddit/r/StatTheoryOfReddit/r/ShittyTheoryOfRedditOther related subreddits:Troubleshooting/r/Help/r/Bugs/r/IssuesSubreddits/r/AdoptAReddit/r/FindAReddit/r/MultiReddit/r/NewReddits/r/NotSoNewReddits/r/RedditLists/r/SubredditOfTheDay/r/WeeklyReddit/r/TrafficStatisticsDevelopment/r/CSSHelp/r/RedditHax/r/RedditDevModerators/r/ModClub/r/ModHelp/r/ModNews/r/ModTools /r/PimpMyReddit/r/RedditRequest/r/AskModerators/r/ModsOfTheRealms/r/CollegeMods/r/MusicMods/r/ReadersMilestoneAdministrators/r/Admin/r/Announcements/r/Blog/r/ChangeLog/r/IdeasForTheAdminsRedditors/Culture/r/MetaHub/r/RedditorOfTheDay/r/DailyDot/r/SubredditDrama/r/TheRedditor/r/Circlebroke/r/HistoryOfRedditBrowse AllNeed an answer quickly?Join the discussion in IRC.created by blackstar9000a community for 2 yearsSubmit a linkto anything interesting: news article, blog entry, video, picture...message the moderatorsMODERATORSsyncreticGuaranteedDownVotekjoneslolTheRedditPopeSkuldtick_tock_clocksulfagentlameZazie_LavenderGodOfAtheism...and 15 more 1484950Reddit is a corporate investment and we are the product.
