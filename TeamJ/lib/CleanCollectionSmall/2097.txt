Insurance is only required to cover mental health care "equally" as it does the rest. What this often means is that the psychologists and psychiatrists who would be of the most assistance are treated as "specialists", requiring a copay of 2-3x that of a general practitioner, despite having to see psychiatrists and psychologists at least once a month, on average, for any semblance of quality care. While they are required to cover the care, they are also not required to have any caregivers in-network. They are also not required to treat psychiatric prescriptions in the same way that they treat non-psychiatric meds. Often, this places the psych meds in the "premium" or "non-preferred" category.What does all of this mean, really? It means that I, a gainfully employed, 24 year old woman with bipolar disorder cannot afford the help I need, even with the addition of insurance and my husband's income. Copay for a visit to my primary care physician is $25, no matter how frequently I visit. Copay to see a psychologist or psychiatrist is $60. And that's if there's an in-network doctor. There isn't, through my insurance, a single in-network mental health care provider that isn't part of a hospital. Psychologists and psychiatrists at most of these hospitals are there for consultation or to deal with the mental ward, not to take on patients of their own.All told, in order for me to get the care I need to be "normal", I need to spend, in-network, $300 per month on doctors (psychologist, for therapy, once a week; psychiatrist, for meds, once a month), and another 50% of the $500/month that my meds cost (because, well, they're non-preferred medications). Out of network? I'm looking at $100 per visit (minimum), with the meds still at $250.I'm lucky. I have insurance. Those who are uninsured are even less likely to be able to get the help they need. Let alone those who are homeless.We need to fix the mental health care system. I think it would help everyone, not just those like me. I think it would help us see less violence in our society.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
