I'd say that statistically, we don't.If you're asking "do our mental health services have serious problems?" then I'd give you a resounding holy shit, yes.If you're asking whether or not the U.S. has massive social stigmas against mental illness, I don't think you've lived here very long, or at all.permalinksaveparent[+]philogynistic 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (7 children)[]philogynistic 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoThere's also the fact that we are a really fucking large country. Of the 15 "top" developed countries, we have 314 million people and the closest is Japan with 120 million. Even if our percent of crazies was the same, we'd have a lot more shooters that places like norway or south korea. Of course our relatively lax gun laws contribute, but crazy fucks will find ways to kill people anyway.permalinksaveparent[+]holyice7 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (3 children)[]holyice7 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agocrazy fucks will find ways to kill people anyway.That is wildly defeatist of you.  Weapons aside, the U.S. treats its mentally ill like shit.  It's a very good chance that you wouldn't have as many "crazy fucks" willing to murder people if they had effective treatment, free of the fear of being viewed as a "crazy fuck" for the rest of their lives by seeking it out. _permalinksaveparent[+]philogynistic 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]philogynistic 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoThat's definitely true and a large part of the problem.

That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day."That's the Joker's take on what's needed to drive people to things like this.  Simply because someone's predisposed to it by being further along down that slope of mental health doesn't mean they're too far gone to help.It's not fair or right to simply condemn a chunk of humanity as worthless or hopeless just because an extremely small percentage of them actually are criminally insane.permalinksaveparent[+]philogynistic 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]philogynistic 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI concedepermalinksaveparent[+]rolandog 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]rolandog 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoA gun if a very effective murdering machine.

Estimates say there is at least 1 gun per person living in the US.  These guns are divided among 300+ million people and spread across 3.8 million square miles.  If you can find a way to police all of that for privately owned weapons, you wouldn't need to take away guns to prevent crime.permalinksaveparent[+]victheone 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]victheone 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoYes, really.  How do you rid the whole country of guns?  Have ATF go door to door?  What about the ones imported and sold off the books (illegally)?  There is no way to enforce it.permalinksaveparent[+]ogenrwot -1 points0 points1 point 20 hours ago (0 children)[]ogenrwot -1 points0 points1 point 20 hours agoThank you for this. We glorify the shooters (negatively and positively depending on who you are) and then more crazies want the fame and we give it to them, just like today. But you're right. There is no way possible that the government can collect all of the guns in this country. They can't control those that are illegally owned let alone that hundreds of millions that are LEGALLY owned.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 23 hours ago (23 children)[][deleted] 23 hours ago[deleted]permalinksaveparent[+]Shovelbum26 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (11 children)[]Shovelbum26 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoBased on that logic, all laws are meaningless. You don't make something illegal to create 100% prevention, but to make whatever they're trying to do more difficult and to show that a society disaproves of it.You think that restrictions don't work?  Just look at this list of countries by firearm related death on wikipedia. The US ranks 12th in the world in gun violence. Sandwiched between South Africa and Nicaragua (yes, we have more gun violence than NICARAGUA!!). The Uninted Kingdom, which bans all fully automatic-capable weapons, as well as all handguns, and doesn't even allow the POLICE to carry guns, is 11th from the bottom in gun violence. Restrictions work.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 22 hours ago (10 children)[][deleted] 22 hours ago[deleted]permalinksaveparent[+]Shovelbum26 -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours ago (9 children)[]Shovelbum26 -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours agoNot that bad?

If you just compare the US with other highly developed nations that we can expect good tracking from then it's even worse, because we're way ahead of countries like Iceland, Spain, Australia, Ireland and Japan.  I'm not saying that the prevelance of guns is the sole factor, but denying that it's a factor at all is willful blindness.  permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 21 hours ago (6 children)[][deleted] 21 hours ago[deleted]permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]sola_sistim 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago*(10 children)[]sola_sistim 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago*You don't think that a cultural fixation with violence and easy access to lethal weapons is a bad combination? permalinksaveparent[+]CSFFlame -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours ago (8 children)[]CSFFlame -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours agoeasy access to lethal weaponsWhat, like cars?permalinksaveparent[+]Shovelbum26 -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (5 children)[]Shovelbum26 -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoTerrible analogy. First, these aren't accidents. They're planned incidents. What /u/nachocheese is saying is that people who are not mentally stable enough to own a gun shouldn't. They shouldn't, because they are very likely to put people in danger. It would be more equivalent to "People should be tested for poor eyesight, and those who can't see well enough to drive shouldn't be allowed behind a wheel". Guess what? We do that.Second, the fact is that cars provide a tangible benefit to people. They allow us to move ourselves, our goods and resources from place to place. Our economy couldn't fuction without cars. What do guns provide? Why do people need access to fully automatic-capable firearms? They provide zero benefit to society, and come with huge, terrible, irreversable risks.More checks required. More restrictions. No more gun-show loop holes that allow mentally unstable people, and criminals, to buy guns without any sort of checks. No more legal sale of fully-automatic capable assault-rifles. No one needs that kind of firepower for any reason, all those guns do is put people's lives in danger.permalinksaveparent[+]CSFFlame 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]CSFFlame 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoWhat /u/nachocheese is saying is that people who are not mentally stable enough to own a gun shouldn't.

Sure it's modified as semi-automatic, but it takes a skilled person about 15 minutes to change it back.None of the six things you listed provide any tangilble benefit to society, with the possible exception of self-defense.  However research shows that owning a gun actually makes you far less safe, as you are 43 times more likely to be harmed by your own gun, or have it harm a member of your family, than use it for self-defense source.Sports shooting, collecting, the fact that they're "cool" or that hunting is "fun" are not legitimate reasons to own weapons of mass murder.Also, I call your bluff on how easy it supposedly is to get an illegal gun.  Why don't you go to the "ghetto" and see if "Tyrone" will sell you one.  Come back and update us with the results of that one.  Please.  I'd love to hear it.permalinksaveparent[+]CSFFlame 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]CSFFlame 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoThen why did my friend manage to buy an AK-47 at a gun show?

Making a full-auto weapon is VERY not legal.None of the six things you listed provide any tangilble benefit to societyAh, you've now changed the approach.  Then I'll change mine.  How about that (drinking) alcohol?Sports shooting, collecting, the fact that they're "cool" or that hunting is "fun" are not legitimate reasons to own weapons of mass murder.That's your opinion and you're entitled to it, but there's this little thing called the Constitution that overrides you.Also, I call your bluff on how easy it supposedly is to get an illegal gun.

If it wasn't a gun, it would be a homemade bomb constructed using simple household materials.  The object used to do this horrible act, ISN'T the problem!  permalinksaveparent[+]knyghtmare 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]knyghtmare 4 points5 points6 points 23 hours agoTo be comparable it'd have to be a domestic attack on a school in an area that isn't embroiled in conflict already. Sure, places are bombed and attacked by other means in regions already unstable because of civil wars and other disputes but I wonder how many bombings like you suggest occur in countries that aren't struggling with larger scale conflicts.Also, I think it's fair to say that the USA has restrictions on bomb making materials. If they are no different from guns they should be legislated the same surely? It seems like an apples to oranges comparison to me in this regard.Guns ARE part of the problem. Mental health is part of the problem. I'm sure the culture of intolerance that is fostered in the USA is part of the problem. In short, the issue at hand is a combination of many factors and isn't solved by simply outlawing guns or improving mental healthcare but that doesn't mean we shouldn't review the options related to both in an attempt to solve the larger problem.permalinksaveparent[+]sola_sistim 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]sola_sistim 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoI'm not saying attacks on schools could be completely stopped by introducing gun control in the US. This isn't a subject I've studied in any detail. But I do know that growing up in the UK I have never once been afraid of anything like this happening to me. Shootings like this are completely foreign to me.permalinksaveparent[+]holyice7 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]holyice7 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoBeyond any kind of religious parable, or purely legal document, the social contract that people follow as a whole pretty much starts out with "don't kill people."There isn't any issue this man had with the principle, or the rest of the administrative staff that should have resulted in 30 dead, half of them being kids.  A heated argument, some door slamming, maybe.  Reporting any suspected crimes to the authorities definitely, but not a shooting rampage.From that fact, it is fair to say the man had issues with his mental health, such that he though shooting up a school was a good answer (or quite possibly the only answer) in his mind.The idea is that if you give a gun to someone pissed off at you (within reason), they won't shoot you.  There are exceptions, which fall under the aegis of "temporary insanity," like witnessing the murder of a loved one, or fear for one's own life, but those never involve shooting 15 children to death in a school.The problem is that everyone's going to blame the gun, the gun laws, or the security at the school.  They're more worried about trying to stop the problem long after it's started, than attempting to help the man before he gets there.Thus, it's a shame that the nobody ever actually picks up the argument about mental health services and treatment to try and change the social discussion, and potentially solve the problem where it starts.permalinksaveparent[+]lizlegit000 -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (0 children)[]lizlegit000 -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoAmerica for sure needs some sort of fix up, hold the people liable who own a gun, hit them with a life term if they kill someone or a school, in turn, also fix the mental health industry, hire more people & at a lower price, many cant afford to see a psychiatrist at 200 dollars an hour. If it were lower or medicare paid for it all, more people would certainly see one. But all in all, we really should focus on the ones who lost their lives today.
