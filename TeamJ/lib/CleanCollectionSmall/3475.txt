Then it is time that the rest of us start being trained to deal with people that have guns. As much as gun nuts want you to think that a person without a gun, it just is not true at all. Learn comprehensive self defense. Learn how to use the most effective none lethal that are available, Insist the government start a registry listing anyone with a firearm and those who have recently sought to perches them. have the government make laws that allow for random inspections of gun owners firearms and firearm storage facilities.   If we have guns in the house next to us or down the street, we have every right to know everything we can about the person who caries it. If you have a problem with that, then DON'T have a gun, there will be no excuses as to why the people in your neighborhood should not know that you carry and any personal information such as your mental health. If you are going to carry a deadly weapon, your right to privacy should be muted in favor of everyone else right to life and safety.  It is time to make guns uncomfortable to own, and unsafe for people to use. Learn self defense and insist laws be made to facilitate your defense and discourage the owning of guns.  Your 2end amendment to own a gun is no more important then my 14th amendment right to life. For every amendment you call on to support your guns, i can point to an amendment that will limit that in favor of life.2 votes#1.17 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 10:02 AM ESTmoshuluuThe poor Pakistani children in that photo above, if they only knew the truth how America feels of them.For the vast majority of my life I've been around WMD.  From Basic/AIT I was taught my M16 was my best friend.  I still have weapons.  But here's one statement, and  two questions:  I've never belonged to the NRA, so, 1.) how does belonging to the NRA become a problem, and 2.) taking guns away from law abiding citizens, does that mean the thugs on the street will voluntarily turn theirs in?  NOT!!!!!I believe taking weapons away from law-abiding citizens is not the answer, and I for one am not prepared to give un-conditional control of my life, or my family's life to the government, and it does not matter who is in office, Rep/Dem/Ind, black, white, Hispanic, other, man, woman.  Thanks to the GREEDY rich of this country, the poor/working class/middle class are already under attack, it probably won't be long before they convince your local PD (who they control, and pay) that you are a problem and expect them to "handle" you.I wasn't interested in turning this into some political statement, but some people against law-abiding gun-owners in America are pathetic.Hitler's army had automatic weapons.  Civilians back then did not have access to those types of weapons like they do now.Wrong, why, because after all "gangsters/thugs" are civilians too, and somehow, for some reason...LOL, they couldn't care less about the laws of them not having weapons.Insist the government start a registry listing anyone with a firearm and those who have recently sought to perches them. have the government make laws that allow for random inspections of gun owners firearms and firearm storage facilities.Now that's different.  Are you saying you're in favor of BIG government?If you are going to carry a deadly weapon, your right to privacy should be muted in favor of everyone else right to life and safety.Cool, so when the thug comes to rob you at home, he'll bring a bigger gun since he knows you have one to protect yourself and your family, from HIM...LOL...3 votes#1.18 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 10:02 AM ESTjack from JaxTerry,They just use IUD's...I think you mean IEDs the IUD is used for "other things", LOL but I got your idea.3 votes#1.19 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 10:05 AM ESTQE137@moshuluu If the government has to get bigger to control the flow of guns, I am all for it. Also, I do not have guns for self defense. I have been trained in the use of non lethal weapons and self defense that is highly effective in disarming gun carriers. It is a total myth that it takes a gun to deal with a gun. Anyone breaching my house ( gun or no ) would be blinded, subdued and all tied up and ready for the cops.  Might surprise you to know that my defensive measures make it less likely that I will be shot that someone defending with a gun.  I was also trained on the M16. I was NOT told it was my best friend. I was told that it might be necessary for me to use it in self defense and I was trained in close in physical combat.  Even for gun's my close in combat skills have been far more useful to me then meeting guns with guns. May I remind you that the gun's used to kill 20 kids ultimately came from a legal gun owner.... That proves that any gun owner can be the source of a weapon used in mass murder. So you will forgive me if I am not impressed that you are a legal and "responsible" gun owner. I bet this syco's mom thought the same about herself just before she was the first to die from her OWN weapon.2 votes#1.20 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 10:39 AM ESTBorderlandsIf the government has to get bigger to control the flow of guns, I am all for itSpoken like a true slave.Then it is time that the rest of us start being trained to deal with people that have guns.So you would turn to the exact same weapon that you've been spouting off in here that you would like to see bigger government control? Do you realize that you just lost all credibility here? Not to mention you're a hypocrite.So you will forgive me if I am not impressed that you are a legal and "responsible" gun owner.None of us responsible firearm owners care if you're impressed or not. There's millions of us in this country who will never see an incident like this in their lifetime with their own firearms. And the 2nd isn't going anywhere because SCOTUS has protected it at every turn when you anti-firearm folks attempt to attack it. You anti-firearm nutcases would sacrifice more of your liberty for a little more security only to allow our government to grow to a point where they can give you everything you need, then one day as history has taught us... take it all away.You want to attack our rights? Then move to another country, sign up to their Military (I hear North Korea is taking applications) and come attack us.Let the adults work out this horrific and most tragic event. We will discuss our firearm policies and how we can look to enforce some policies nationwide while giving more power back to the people to protect themselves because educated Americans know that citizens are ALWAYS the first line of defense. Was ANY law enforcement officer capable of stopping what occurred in CT? Of course not, not one of them was capable or able. The only one's who were, were the faculty members at the scene yet the laws forbid them to properly protect themselves.And you would hand more power over to a government that couldn't do a damn thing to stop what occurred that day.You sir, deserve no quarter when it comes to our Constitution let alone speak on behalf of any of us law abiding, responsible Americans.4 votes#1.21 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 11:20 AM ESTStackDatI think we can all agree on this one thing....SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!The 'ideal' response would be that anybody and everybody has easy, and if needed free, access to mental professionals and facilities. But as we all know, that takes money, LOTS of money and face it...that just isn't going to happen anytime soon.The only other viable alternative is gun control.  True....that isn't going to stop it but it can at least slow it down and it's better than just keeping our fingers crossed praying and hoping.2 votes#1.22 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 11:29 AM ESTpeople are cra-zy@moshulu: You're post is misguided. The photo of the Pakistani children actually is proof that hate and prejudice is not something that children are born with. ALL children are beautiful and are of kindred spirits. They identify with each other. They have an understanding that transcends racial and religious differences. The hatred you speak of stems from fear and is taught. Since the birth of this country Americans have taught hatred: Hatred/Fear of the Native Americans, the African Americans, the Hispanics, the Asians, the Jews, the Muslims, the Atheists, the poor, the illiterate, the elderly, the disabled and so on. I am strong enough to recognize the serious character defects of myself and my fellow Americans.But that being said, Americans are NOT the only country where this phenomenon takes place. Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, any other "stan", China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Serbia, Russia/USSR, and ANY every other nation on the planet does this as well. The fear and hate is something that is within ALL of us, once childhood innocence is gone. FYI: Just the fact that you would post such a statement is a reflection of your own fears, prejudices, and hatred. Before you tell others about their issues, you should address your own.The children of the world see what happened yesterday, and their hearts hurt in a way we adults can't comprehend. We have forgotten what it was like to be a vulnerable child. To be at the complete mercy of the adults in charge. But the young ones, they get it. We should strive to be more like them.3 votes#1.23 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 11:34 AM ESTchris-2252558Maybe instead of gun control, they can alter the high schools to be more of a self defense boot camp.  This way for the parents not wanting to be parents, all other people can have a little relief knowing their child at least as some defense skills!  Taking away guns is not the answer, to me if we all were able to have one, even teachers, maybe this freak wouldn't have been able to get a shot off!!!!#1.24 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 11:38 AM ESTVin1112DeletedVin1112DeletedBorderlandsStackDat -CT has some very strict gun control policies let alone this horrific event occurred in a "gun-free" zone.

Knee jerk reactions to such a horrific tragedy is common among those incapable of utilizing rational thought. It's easier to start pointing fingers while acclaiming yourselves spokesperons for the masses when the masses are looking back at such moronic statements wondering how it is some of you can even formulate logical thoughts.Not one law enforcement officer was capable of stopping this tragedy and yet some of you would hand more power over to that same group of people.Some of you keep spouting off the 2nd as if you actually read the entire Constitution which it is clear, none of you have. And if you did your comprehension skills are that of a chimpanzee. The 2nd isn't going anywhere and if you disagree take it to the Supreme Court where the 2nd has been protected time and time again when it has been attacked.CT has some very tough gun control regulations and this atrocity occurred in a "gun-free" zone. And some of you would like more control assuming that would work.

That is the myth of gun to gun that I was talking about. If the average American was trained to use NON lethal weapons and had the same close combat training I do, it would be insane for a gun nut to even be seen with a gun, let alone try to use it.  A gun wont help you against someone who has been trained to deal with you caring it. A gun wont help you when the community at large has been trained to deal with it. You think because you can stand back and pull a trigger that your bullet will always find it's way to those without a gun?  I have several none lethal weapons that will keep you from aiming your gun and while your tring I will be activly seeking to change your line of fire. I will be successful in changing your line of fire and I will take you down and have you ready for the cops. I will do this with the same assurances that you had with your gun and now I will be making sure that as many other people are trained just like me..  Time for meaningful gun control. If the government dose not do it, good people trained at or better then my proficiency at disarmament will be there to make sure people are disarmed. Take your pick. One thing is for sure. You are going to learn just how much the brainwash for guns being the only protection has hurt any real possibility for you to really defend yourself.  I wont carry weapons that have a high probability of harming innocents. I will not take lives in the commission of my defense and I will be part of the gun solution,as many many American's now will be.#1.30 - Sun Dec 16, 2012 1:27 PM ESTKenneth NewmanI'm sure that there is a special place in hell for Nancy Lanza, just another gun nut who didn't lock up her guns and we all know the consequences.

I'm positive it'd fit right in.I hate having to hear this argument over and over again. Gun supporters repeatedly cite that banning guns will not stop criminals from obtaining those guns. You know what the problem is?? Those people aren't criminals! They're just regular citizens until they go nuts and shoot someone. And if guns were banned, they would have a much harder time getting those weapons.

If you want to address the problem, at least do it like compassionate, concerned, intelligent, problem-solving Americans. One reason mass killings can happen is that someone wants a way to get rid of a problem, and with guns easily available it is possible to make a real killing while solving the problem - the point is to hurt.

The minimum liability insurance a FIREARM owner must have is:Bodily Injury and property damage liability:* $25.000.00 Per person; and* $50,000.00 per incident for bodily injury to others; and* $20,000.00 per incident for damage to other's propertyPersonal Injury Protection (for reasonable and necessary medical, dental and other expenses incurred up to 1-year after the incident):* $15,000.00 per personUninsured FIREARM owner:* $25,000.00 per person; and* $50,000.00 per incident for bodily injuryNote: You must certify that you have this insurance each time you register and/or renew registration for a FIREARM, or when you buy FIREARM permit. You must also certify that you will comply with Oregon's FIREARM insurance requirements as long as a FIREARM is registered in your name, or for the duration of the permit. OREGON FIREARM LICENSEWhile handling a FIREARM on any premises open to the public in Oregon, you must have either a valid FIREARM license or FIREARM instruction permit issued by the state in your possession.  If you are over the age of 18 and need to gain FIREARM experience before getting your FIREARM license, you may obtain an instruction permit.To Qualify/ApplyYou must apply in person, and you must: * Be a resident of or domiciled in Oregon;* Be at least 18 years of age;* Have no suspended, canceled, revoked, or otherwise withdrawn FIREARM privileges in Oregon or any other state;* Submit a completed FIREARM Application. If you answer yes to any of the medical questions on the application as outlined the state will not issue you FIREARM privileges until you have established that your condition does not affect your ability to handle a FIREARM safely. You may be asked to provide additional medical information and/or require that you pass additional FIREARM tests;* Present proof of your full legal name;* Present proof of your legal presence in the U.S., identity and date of birth;* Provide your Social Security Number on the application;* Present proof of your residence address;* Pass the FIREARM knowledge test;* Make an appointment for a FIREARM test. If you have a valid FIREARM license issued by a U.S. State, you may not be required to take the FIREARM test;* Pass the FIREARM test. If you do not have proof of insurance for the FIREARM, you will have to reschedule the FIREARM test;* Pass a vision screening;* Surrender any valid Oregon ID Card;* Surrender any valid FIREARM license or permit issued by another jurisdiction (state, territory, etc);* Pay the applicable testing and licensing fees. You must pay test fees prior to taking any FIREARM test. Be prepared to make separate payments for your testing and licensing fees; and* Have your photograph taken.After you meet the requirements, you are issued an interim card to use until you receive your FIREARM license in the mail.   If you surrender a previous FIREARM license, instruction permit or Oregon ID Card, it is hole-punched and returned to you.  The hole-punched card is not valid by itself, but may be used as additional proof of identity with the interim card.

But gosh, why shouldn't we try? I think it would be difficult for the logical and rational citizen of the United States to argue why we should not. Both require significant care and diligence to be owned and operated responsibly, and both can kill, both can injure and both can maim when handled irresponsibly. And why should gun ownership not carry the lion's share of the real costs to our society for gun owners to exercise their 2nd amendment rights. Nothing in the 2nd amendment says that fees, permits and licenses will not be mandated; and no, that is not an infringement of your rights. It is simple regulation.At the very least, imposing these sort of insurance requirements, fees and licensing requirements will greatly reduce the desire by many to own numerous firearms; those wanting their own arsenals. The costs alone will ensure that.And we can be certain that insurance companies and insurance underwriters are going to take a lot closer look at an individual's medical history, prior records and record of responsibility than currently occurs in a 15-minute background check before they will be issueing the insurance coverage required for individuals to own firearms. After all, the insurance companies will be on the financial hook when something happens, just as they are with motor vehicle insurance. The fact that we haven't already taken such actions in the United States to treat firearms with sensible, responsible regulations and controls, such as we do with motor vehicles, is nothing short of absurd.Just my tuppence.#1.37 - Mon Dec 17, 2012 5:21 AM EST1SGFitzsWife4IDOne small difference, owning a gun is a right, driving a vehicle is a privelage.

I was watching the other day ajournalist piece about the survivalists building underground housesand buying arms. But it's not about God and the Apocalypse: it'sabout guns.And the reporting on this story is either a disgrace or aconspiracy theory stunt: from false accusations to one simple fact:the mother as a gun buff and killing educator.

As blanket rules like that tend to ignore the context of gun user ship. For example, if using a gun for hunting or culling purposes then I see no reason to use a semi-auto over a manual loading weapon. However, if engaged in some recreational target practice at a range then yes I can see why people would want to use semi-auto and even automatic weapons. So in all I think an outright ban would not be fair on the many who do own and use firearms responsibly.That being said I do think America has a gun culture that really needs to be addressed.

No, but each time there is an accident we learn something from the event and put in place policies and procedures to prevent it from happening again.

Why was this happening? Pressure and abusive behavior by management of postal employees. The Post Office was being run like a private enterprise and squeezed postal workers until some began to crack.The problem of killing sprees then began to spread across the spectrum from schools to malls and other public places. Many of these sprees were directly related to disgruntled employees or people who had become so alienated by previous abusive environments that they became enraged.Take away the guns and the criminals will still find ways to get them and then there is always other ways to attack people including fire homemade bombs knives and poison.People wail about the loss of morality but say little about a corporate system where CEO's are making over 400 to 1 ratio of salary. Talking about inequality, not only is this greed tolerated but it is encouraged. Even more tragic is how these CEO's squeeze and pressure workers to produce more and more. More than 70 percent of American workers report being unhappy in their jobs.When people are pressured to the point when burnout becomes a national problem then people under this kind of constant stress become sick. Individuals most vulnerable to mental disorders will become even more at risk of "going postal".

Children confused and frustrated in schools under control of Federal Department of Education are made vulnerable to committing horrible reactions.  It's very simple, folks.  The feminist movement pushed to remove control of education from the States to the Federal government, with all power in the Federal Department of Education.  Before that transfer, we had clean efficient functioning school facilities, excellent teachers, high test scores, high graduations, high college entrances and students proud to be students and happy to learn in an environment encouraging character, morals, hope, and plans for successful futures.  The worst infraction sending a student to the Principal's office was to chew gum in class or throw spitballs.  Parents were involved in text book choices, hiring and firing of teachers, curriculum development and in control of education.  Feds took over and exactly like the Postal system, they brought in horrors.  Our children are victims of the Federal Department of Education that has given us inefficient school facilities in many communities, teachers who focus on student's pant instead of their brains and futures, ridiculous curriculums, both prescription and illegal drugs, junk food and pop machines in the corridors, a culture of bullying, students killing school officials and other students and committing suicide.  IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?  Join the growing underground movement that will surge soon to close the Federal Department of Education and return the responsibilities for Education back to the States where parents, grandparents, citizens have control over all of it.  Already those who want to keep control of education have gotten wind of this developing movement and have trotted out their Useful Idiots in panel discussions on various Thoughtless Tanks and Self Important Clubs to shout and prove they are "on top" of the probs with education and boy are they gonna make things right this time.  Even ol' Podesta pounded the podium in a speech about public ed (Fed Dept of) and the great things they are beginning and how great their programs will be to improve education.  LIARS.  They will fight hard to keep control and parents must fight harder and take it back.  The Fed knows if they lose control of Ed, they lose their progress to the New World Order, to the destruction of the sovereignty of the USA changing us to North America Union with NO borders, (which is why Bush/Obbba and politicians hold the fence down for the invaders and grant amnesty).  This is the war they don't want but we MUST take a stand here and now.  Newtown, start talking and make your governor, politicians withdraw funds from DOEd and close it down, and return it to CT.  Be the leader in this as others are preparing to do just that and would jump up and back you with a tsunami on all State Governors and politicians.  LEAD.  You've earned the right by the blood of your children and teachers.

It is not about stopping all killing, it is about removing the most efficient means of killing. If bombs where the best thing people could use for mass murder, we would be seeing a lot of these fools blowing themselves up before they even got to the target. That is why a bomb is not used over a gun. Knives, extremity inefficient. The school attack in china that happened involving a knife resulted in NO fatalities at last check.

I think it started when Madeleine Murray O'Hare (she  was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she  didn't want prayer in our schools, and we said OK.  Then  someone said you better not read the Bible in school...   The Bible says thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal, and  love your neighbor as yourself.  And we said  OK. Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our  children when they misbehave, because their little personalities  would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr.  Spock's son committed suicide).  We said an expert should  know what he's talking about..  And we said  okay.. Now we're asking ourselves why our children have  no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it  doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and  themselves. Probably, if we think about it long and hard  enough, we can figure it out.  I think it has a great deal  to do with 'WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.'  Funny how simple it is  for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to  hell.  Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but  question what the Bible says.  Funny how you can send  'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when  you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think  twice about sharing.

In the end, if those with faith are the ones that did not kill etch other off, then they will be the ones to inherit the earth and God will be there to enhance those who never stopped having faith.  God dose not need man to give him a place to live, he resides every place. Just like to access your computer you need to use the power button, that is vary much how easy it is to access faith.
