Not a problem at all.  And, you are right, I probably should have expanded on what I meant instead of saying 'source' without context like an ass.  Regardless, I enjoy an actual educational exchange with another redditor in which we can admit our faults. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes ago (0 children)[]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes agoI understand that.  I'm reading a bunch of things during this right now, and if someone is presenting information, I just simply asked if they can point to a source since they've apparently already done the investigation.  I don't think that is so terrible.  I am self-sufficient, but I am also smart enough to not do work that's already done.  Technically, everything on reddit you can investigate yourself.  It's convenient when people bring it to you though.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

It being 'around' Christmas is completely arbitrary.  People can attach anything they want to tragedies to add or take away from a tragedy, but it simply dilutes the problem.  Not everyone is Christian.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Corrected  by  bikebison4in  funny[+]StrahansToothGap 11 points12 points13 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]StrahansToothGap 11 points12 points13 points 2 days agoI agree with you, but it is an uphill battle when you live with people who don't clean at all.  I lived with 3 people who did not clean ever.  You tried to clean as much as you could, but as a 19-year-old, you get tired of cleaning up party aftermath by yourself.  I am part of these parties, and it isn't like I was going to live by myself and miss out on all the fun while being at college.  I took it as a phase, a part of college, and worth the trade-off.  I tried to stash personal stuff that I would wash, like a glass and bowl.  Now that I am out of college, I don't regret having all that fun and partying all the time, sometimes in mess, and now I go to a clean kitchen to get whatever I want. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMan struck and killed by L train today.  by  DrSicksin  nyc[+]StrahansToothGap 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]StrahansToothGap 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoIt doesn't stop people from leaping at a train. permalinksavecontextfull commentsOcean NJ to Albuquerque, NM and back...
