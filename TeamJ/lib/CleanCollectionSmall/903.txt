You are 22 yet you are in a committed relationship that is headed towards marriage. Most 22 year old males would feel the same way. Your urges aren't about sexual desires at their core. They are about not being ready to commit...and rightly so. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho or what is the biggest disappointment of your team this year?  by  zipzap21in  nfl[+]grouch1980 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]grouch1980 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours agoDoug Free.

Drugs ruin the lives of the drug abuser AND those that care about the abuser. Most people will tell you to confront him and make him admit his problem. Then you can support him through rehab and hope his change is long-lasting. My advice is very simple. Do you want heavy drugs and heavy drug users to be a part of your life? Is your love for your bf so strong that you are willing to endure the heartache associated with addiction? If so, help him get clean. If you see your life playing out differently, that is, having kids, a responsible spouse, lots of love and trust, then you should consider leaving your bf now.Please don't misunderstand me. I am not saying everyone that does drugs is to be shunned. I just want you to realize what being in a relationship with an addict is like. It may get better than how it's been in the past, but maybe not. Addicts care about the high first and foremost and their loved ones second. If you are okay with this, stick by him. If you are already feeling like you can't handle his behavior, you need to do some soul searching and get out of this situation while you can. Addicts deserve help, but not at the cost of your happiness. I'm sorry you are dealing with this, and I hope you think of yourself first in this situation because I guarantee your bf is thinking of himself first. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlright r/listentothis, we were awesome last time, let's do this again: what was your favorite song of 2012?  by  i_justwanna_knowwwin  listentothis[+]grouch1980 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]grouch1980 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoClear Soul Forces - Get No Betterhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWKLuwR_bFw&feature=youtube_gdata_playerpermalinksavecontextfull commentsKevin Garnett giving Kevin McHale his condolences at the end of the Rockets/Celtics game.

If ratings are low for a card with some major firepower then I'll be convinced. Until then, I'm not so sure. Plus, the more people can watch fights on network TV, the more fans the ufc will grab. More fans equal higher ratings. Higher ratings equal billion dollar TV deals. It's just building the fan base initially that takes time and may cost some money. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBanned from /r/Conservative for being Muslim.

He linked me to some BS study that "proved" black people and white people are different species therefore interracial breeding was comparable to humans having sex with monkeys. Feel free to look through my history to find it, but I'm not wasting anymore time proving something to you when you already know what time it is.

Is he banned? How about stevano? That guy has never posted a single comment that wasn't insulting to someone. Gnome sane, you, jibrish, and a few more regulars are all jerks to anyone you deem to be a troll. And your definition of a troll is anyone with an opinion that differs from the far right christian conservative ethos. For the record, I used to frequent your subreddit everyday for a year and a half prior to being banned. I was insulted time and again with no repercussions from the mods. I know exactly what I'm talking about. But like I said, I support your right to have a subreddit for conservatives. If you want it to be a place where ONLY conservatives are welcome, that's fine, too. Just don't ban anyone who isn't your brand of conservative and tell everyone they were banned for behavior. You know damn well that's a lie. How do I know? Because the conservative "regulars" I listed above are some of the rudest people on this whole site. permalinksavecontextfull comments10000So will the UFC ever broadcast their fights strictly on a network or will it remain PPV for the foreseeable future?

It has absolutely nothing to do with snark or sarcasm. All the conservatives that post in that subreddit are rude, snarky, sarcastic, caustic, mean, and petty. Anyone that you deem to be a true conservative has free reign to say anything they want to anyone they want. You've created a subreddit full of bullies that run wild, and anyone that questions your authority is summarily banned. You can have your subreddit as a bastion for conservative circlejerk-ery. I don't hold that against you. But please don't insult my intelligence by saying you ban people for their behavior. If that were the case, every conservative that runs amok over there would have been banned many, many times over by now. permalinksavecontextfull commentsBanned from /r/Conservative for being Muslim.

Lets find out in /r/cringe.  by  Cptn_Siskoin  SubredditDrama[+]grouch1980 12 points13 points14 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]grouch1980 12 points13 points14 points 18 hours agoI think treedick was saying that that Rob guy should see RG3's behavior/persona/character and be happy that he is such a great role model to young African American men. Instead, the talking head (Rob) is calling out RG3 for who he is and how he acts as if having good character and being a leader is somehow a betrayal of his "blackness." I personally see where treedick is coming from and pretty much agree with him. RG3's "blackness" was called into question for not "acting black" by another black man which means "acting black" (according to Rob) is the opposite of RG3. That's the racist statement. What kind of person is the opposite of RG3? Well, not a good person, I'll say that much. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.
