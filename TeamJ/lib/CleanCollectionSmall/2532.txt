Unable to confirm international numbers but first-glance sources such as Wikipedia and CNN summary articles circumstantially back it up.And in the rare cases where people actually cite something, you can do this yourself too.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes ago (2 children)[]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes agoI understand that.  I'm reading a bunch of things during this right now, and if someone is presenting information, I just simply asked if they can point to a source since they've apparently already done the investigation.  I don't think that is so terrible.  I am self-sufficient, but I am also smart enough to not do work that's already done.  Technically, everything on reddit you can investigate yourself.  It's convenient when people bring it to you though.  permalinksaveparent[+]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes ago (1 child)[]cyclicamp 1 point2 points3 points 17 minutes agoI apologize for being short.  Usually when I see someone typing "source" and nothing else they're doing it to express disbelief, and seeing it in response to a post with a citation seemed lazy since most of the work was done at that point.In other words, I was not expecting it to mean something rational like "Could you please expand upon that citation with a link?" since in all my time here it hadn't before.permalinksaveparent[+]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]StrahansToothGap 1 point2 points3 points 13 minutes agoCool.  Not a problem at all.  And, you are right, I probably should have expanded on what I meant instead of saying 'source' without context like an ass.  Regardless, I enjoy an actual educational exchange with another redditor in which we can admit our faults. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
