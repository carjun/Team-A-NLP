Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]brandonw00 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]brandonw00 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoI don't see what having "freedom" has to do with a shooting. There are many countries that have the same freedoms that Americans have, yet they don't have this kind of violence in their country. I do agree with your statement about these incidents are indicators that people are not happy. It is too bad though, because life is a beautiful thing, and everyone alive has the opportunity to experience it! Every day is a new adventure, every day you get to see the sun rise, the world come alive, the wildlife move about, you get to interact with other individuals. It is too bad people don't value life more. It is the greatest thing ever, and we need to value every day we have on earth, because once it is gone, its gone. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

If someone wants a gun, they'll get one, regardless if it is legal or not. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I used to pirate games quite frequently, but with Steam, I haven't pirated a game in a long time. I loved Contracts so much, and I've been dying to play it again after I built a new PC, plus I played it on consoles when it first came out. I'm hoping since it is in this bundle maybe they'll release it on Steam. I already have all the other Hitman games except the newest one, but I'll be getting that over Christmas break, so I'll only need Contracts to complete the collection. permalinksavecontextfull comments15345While testing some things for a new video, I ended up with a very unique landing on Minmus!
