I'm here with monsenior robert weiss. I know you spent a lot of time with the families in that firehouse. How are they doing? We went to their homes early this morning to confirm the death of their children. It was just horrible. The uncertainty, even though they knew in their hearts this was real. And the questions they were asking, the regrets they had. Why did I send my child to school today? And the parents are sharing the last moments they had with their children. One of the dads shared how for some reason the child got up early and just came down and told the father how much she loved him. And another one said just the day before, the child asked him, what is dying like? So, parents are going through a tremendous amount of pain and hurt, dealing with not just their personal loss, or what happened to their child in the last moments of their life. Nd they found out for sure only early this morning? Early this morning. We were gathered until after midnight. And we were sent out with teams to go to the families of the victims. How do you console a mother like this? We met with people from our parish. It's just settling in now. The hurt and the anguish. And this part of their life is gone for them. And so many of these families are part of your parish. of our parish community. So, you baptized these kids? I have baptized a couple of them. Some of them went to our nursery school. Some attend religion education at our parish, preparing for first holy communion. It's hard to believe that these little children are gone. Whe families turn to you and say why? Right. There's no answer to that question. This was not god's plan. That was a man who has serious issues in his life. Why do you want to destroy innocent children? I can't figure out. That's the question that people ask at that time like this. And no answer comes back to them. Monsignor, thank you for joining us this morning. We're grieving with you. 0Comment on this videoABC News LiveBreaking news video as it happens, continuous live streaming video and special events at our live news hub.Go Now MORE VIDEOSectionsShowsVideo RSSsections:Most PopularU.S.WorldPoliticsBrian Ross InvestigatesHealthEntertainmentMoneyTechTravelExtreme VideoABC News AudioHome > Video > U.S. Sandy Hook Tragedy: Shooter Forced Way Into SchoolSandy Hook Tragedy: Shooter Forced Way Into SchoolLt.
