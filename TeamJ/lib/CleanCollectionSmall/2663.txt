Interestingly since that article we've changed the law so you have to be 18 to buy knives (from 16) and need ID. I can't tell you if thats the reason for the drop though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Tokukachi 7 points8 points9 points 54 minutes ago (0 children)[]Tokukachi 7 points8 points9 points 54 minutes ago13,000 people were stabbed in the UK last year, why doesn't anyone talk about the UKs horrible crime rate. Maybe its their knifing culture.NHS data suggests there were 4,490 people admitted to English hospitals in 2011/12 due to assault by a sharp object.No need to make stuff up. Also we've had one school shooting/rampage in the UK, ever and the guy should never have been allowed handguns in the first place as he should have failed the background check.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAn Australian's kit in Afghanistan.  by  ramblerandgamblerin  guns[+]Tokukachi 7 points8 points9 points 7 days ago*(0 children)[]Tokukachi 7 points8 points9 points 7 days ago*It's still another 5Kg on top of what he's already carrying.

So a violent crime is almost 4x more likely to end in murder in the US, why is this? Is this because we have very strict gun control?FYI: I'm actually a registered firearms holder here and have a collection of guns myself.Source for UK stats: Herepermalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter 29 catches for 475 yards and 6 touchdowns in the last 4 games, Cowboys' Dez Bryant: Im just getting started  by  BAWguyin  nfl[+]Tokukachi 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]Tokukachi 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoThat's true, but there on field production has been overshadowed by there off field drama/attitude and been a poison pill in several locker rooms.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAfter 29 catches for 475 yards and 6 touchdowns in the last 4 games, Cowboys' Dez Bryant: Im just getting started  by  BAWguyin  nfl[+]Tokukachi 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]Tokukachi 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoAs much as I hate the cowboys, it's always nice to see a player getting it together.
