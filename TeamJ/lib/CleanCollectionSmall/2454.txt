The biggest offender? COFFEE (and potatoes)  by  fingerfunkin  Health[+]unfinite 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]unfinite 0 points1 point2 points 10 days agoI didn't leave it out, I just didn't intend to copy the entire wikipedia article, but I did link to it. Also, the last bullet in my post is that one study that found an association: "A Dutch study on 62,573 women aged 5569 years did find a link [...]"The LD50 (median lethal dose) of this stuff is 150 mg/kg, or about the same as caffeine (192 mg/kg). There's a lot more caffeine in coffee than acrylamide:A June 2002 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization concluded the intake level required to observe neuropathy (0.5 mg/kg body weight/day) was 500 times higher than the average dietary intake of acrylamide (1 g/kg body weight/day)Unrelated to acrylamide, but relevant. This one too: part 1 and part 2. TL;DW One study showing a link to cancer doesn't invalidate every other study. But more importantly, even if it is harmful, the dose makes the poison. The dose in food appears to be well below the threshold needed to be considered dangerous. permalinksavecontextfull commentsA gnarly Carcinogen is created when we Fry/Bake/Toast just about anything. The biggest offender? COFFEE (and potatoes)  by  fingerfunkin  Health[+]unfinite 10 points11 points12 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]unfinite 10 points11 points12 points 10 days agohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylamide#Human_cancer_risk_of_acrylamide_exposure_from_foodTo determine the human cancer risk from acrylamide, several studies have been conducted using food frequency data to estimate acrylamide intake and its effect on cancer risk. A Swedish study using 1,525 patients failed to find a link between acrylamide in food and liver, kidney and bowel cancers. A larger Swedish study on 45,306 men also found no link between dietary intake of acrylamide and risk for colorectal cancer. A large Italian study covering 19912000 in Italy and Switzerland analyzed the risk of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, larynx, large bowel, breast, and ovaries from consumption of fried/baked potatoes, and found no association. A 2005 study of 43,404 Swedish women in the Womens Lifestyle and Health Cohort found that the womens greatest sources of acrylamide were from coffee (54% of intake), fried potatoes (12% of intake), and crisp bread (9% of intake), but found no association between breast cancer risk and higher intake of any specific foods. A 2009 Swedish follow-up study on 61,433 women also found no association between long-term dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer. Another 2009 study on 90,628 premenopausal women in the United States also found no relationship between dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk. A Dutch study on 62,573 women aged 5569 years did find a link between acrylamide intake and increased risks of postmenopausal endometrial and ovarian cancer after adjusting for smoking, but not with breast cancer.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlmost half of Fukushima children now have thyroid disorders from radiation poisoning, officials blame 'too much seafood'  by  Orangutanin  environment[+]unfinite 32 points33 points34 points 10 days ago (0 children)[]unfinite 32 points33 points34 points 10 days agoI like how when you click "other discussions" you can see that this is one of the top posts in r/conspiracy.

(which is mentioned in the whois). I have no idea what they do though since there are a number of companies with that name.The "registered agent" also owns this, which appears to be a law firm based out of Oakton, VA - which is in Fairfax county. Fairfax, VA being the same place as the address you gave. I think this is just the lawyer that registered the company, but it gives us the right Oakton.The yellowpages description for that Oakton Press is "Oakton Press is a business dealing in the Periodicals Publishers industry. "The other address is the same address of a suspended corporation INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INVESTMENT SERVICES, INC." but it may just be someone who used to live there.That's all I've found out for now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe first color image from the surface of Mars.  by  macboigurin  space[+]unfinite 0 points1 point2 points 21 days ago (0 children)[]unfinite 0 points1 point2 points 21 days agoNo. It's actually red like. Lighting on mars is scattered red because of dust particles in the atmosphere.It's similar to dust storms on earth. You can adjust the white balance to compensate for the red color of the light and treat it like the light source is white (like you have done in your blue tinted picture), but if the light is actually red, you're not correcting the color, you're falsifying it. This picture shows that it's actually dust making the sun's light red, and not just the white balance being off. The white lights are still white.Further reading on why martian sunsets can be blue: NPRpermalinksavecontextfull commentsMy uncle got a 40" LCDTV on Black Friday for $200.
