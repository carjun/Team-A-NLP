They are not your family anymore, and your ex may need them to lean on during this trying time, it could be selfish of you to break that. I'd recommend not talking to them, maybe tell them why, and then in a year or so when the initial trama is over you can reconnect if you think you have things to connect for that are not your ex.permalinksavecontextfull comments8012The End of the Internet Kit (endoftheinternetkit.com)submitted 1 day ago by dusing to funnycommentsharecancelloading...Had some fun with the holiday greeting card this year.

Besides makes sure you each get a couple expensive things (computers, tvs...)They are your credit cards too bro.Depending on the state, the ring is a gift, and hers I believe. Resale of a 10k ring is probably 2k tops. Decide if you want to fight about that. If she thinks its really worth 10k, let her keep it and use that as leverage against stuff that is actually worth money. you'll get more bang for that 10k dream of hers than the 2k reality.3b. Mediation can work, and you really really don't want to go to a judge, you'll get murdered.
