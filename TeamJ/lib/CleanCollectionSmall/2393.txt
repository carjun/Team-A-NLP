We should not let the monstrous acts of the evil few define us all.permalinksave[+]GreenGlassDrgn 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)[]GreenGlassDrgn 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes agoSurely the world will become a better place if nobody trusts each other and we all live alone & paranoid behind locked doors, legislating wildly against our evil siblings.permalinksaveparent[+]aquapeat1 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]aquapeat1 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoThank you. This doesn't make me question humanity as a whole.. It is just horribly sad. permalinksaveparent[+]Mr_Storm 0 points1 point2 points 19 minutes ago (0 children)[]Mr_Storm 0 points1 point2 points 19 minutes agoThe good people are the ones holding each other together.I see a whole lot of good come from evil acts. It is too bad that it takes a tragic event to bring a community close.permalinksaveparent[+]sailingthefantasea 0 points1 point2 points 17 minutes ago (0 children)[]sailingthefantasea 0 points1 point2 points 17 minutes agoNot to mention this has been happening since humanity started. People will always kill people, but fortunately they're becoming a minority (however, a vocal one). The good people come in by making sure it doesn't happen in such a way again, by honouring the lives lost and helping the families who are suffering from such events.  permalinksaveparent[+]Quarkity 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (0 children)[]Quarkity 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes agoThank you, I just had to tell a friend that because she is messaging me on Facebook horribly upset and losing her hope for humanity. I am firmly optimistic that most people are good. Most people would help you if you fell down, most people wouldn't dream of harming innocent lives. There was something wrong in this man's head. Have hope in humanity. Our disgust and tears from this incident just prove that humanity is mostly good.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
