The presence of Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney makes life complicated for him there.Hernandez has scored nine goals this season in limited action and United would want close to double the 7m they paid for him if he did leave.United have been linked with a move for Arsenal's Theo Walcott in January but Sir Alex Ferguson does not plan to sign anyone, according to the Mail on Sunday."I will not be bringing anybody in, in January - definitely not," the paper quotes him as saying."It means that while title rivals City are targeting Athletic Bilbao's Fernando Llorente, Chelsea are ready to splash on Atletico Madrid's Radamel Falcao and Walcott and Liverpool want Chelsea's Daniel Sturridge and Tom Ince from Blackpool, the United boss will stick with what he has as the club chase a 20th league title," the paper adds.One club that is expected to be busy in January is Arsenal and they are thinking about making a move for Parmas Ghanaian midfielder Afriyie Acquah, according to the Sun.The 20-year-old has been likened to a young Michael Essien and would cost around 8m.Arsenal have also been boosted by the fact that Jack Wilshere is ready to sign a five-year contract at the club. (various)Across North London, Andre-Villas Boas has been told he will not be allowed to spend big in January as Tottenham owner Joe Lewis tightens the purse strings. (Sunday People)The Spurs boss hoped to sign Porto midfielder Joao Moutinho and Athletic Bilbao striker Llorente next month, while also eyeing Shakhtar Donetsks Brazilian star Willian.Instead he will have to hang on to the likes of Scott Parker and Michael Dawson, much to disappointment of QPR, who had hoped to sign the pair. (Mail on Sunday)Rangers could have better luck when it comes to Chelsea veteran Frank Lampard, who would be keen on a January move across West London. (Sunday People)Chelsea are considering a 12m move for Real Madrid defender Fabio Coentrao if Ashley Cole leaves. Coles future is in doubt with his contract running out and interim boss Rafa Benitez recently admitted he could be on his way out. (Daily Star Sunday)Meanwhile, Diego Simeone's name has been added to the list of managers Chelsea will turn to if Pep Guardiola snubs Stamford Bridge. Simeone, 42, has done a superb job with Atletico and helped the club to a stunning 4-1 Super Cup success over Chelsea at the end of August, having won last seasons Europa League. (Sunday Mirror)Liverpool are on trail of Galatasarays Burak Yilmaz. The striker has hit six Champions League goals this season plus 11 in the Turkish league. (The Sun)Demba Ba will hit Arsenal and Liverpool with 90,000-a-week wage demands in January. Striker Ba has told Newcastle he will not sign another contract for anything less and is willing to risk ruining a switch to the Emirates or Anfield by making the same demands if his 7m release clause is met. (Sunday Mirror)West Ham United are hoping to sign up to four players when the January transfer window opens, with strikers Martin Harnik and Marouane Chamakh high up on their list as they try to overcome an injury crisis. (Sunday Telegraph)Finally, Mario Balotelli is taking Manchester City to a Premier League tribunal to overturn a 340,000 club fine. (Sunday Mirror)The controversial Italian striker will appear before an independent two-man panel in London on Wednesday after being docked two weeks' wages by the champions.All Comments                        234 commentsPopular NowNewestOldestMost Repliedv1/comments/context/ba1ef722-259d-33ea-ab66-92a3b7f2b83e/comment/1355677900298-44badbc4-92ad-4cd2-9c55-6b125169264fPolitician Stole My Money3 hours agoChicko is young enough and still learning his trade ,there's no doubt he'll be a world beater under the mighty Sir Alex whilst collecting a bucketful of trophies.

His continued selection of the woefully inadequate Welbeck, the man who cannot score, over Hernandez, the man who clearly can and does, is ridiculous.  Ferguson's refusal to strenghten an ageing squad and get rid of the over-paid journeymen and pensioners littering the payroll is worrying, is he past it?v1/comments/context/ba1ef722-259d-33ea-ab66-92a3b7f2b83e/comment/1355682775762-7a25b044-2881-4519-ba60-7e93780ff3feSir Alex Ferguson2 hours 21 minutes agoHernanadez is my secret viagra. he raises columns othe remedies cant.

No, maybe in a few years if he is not playing reguler and there seems no place in the first team, he might leave then, not because of money, but because its the best thing for him, as a footballer. See thats what some of you cynical people dont seem to realise, some players in the league still love playing football, and if that player does not get the games, well you can see the frustration in that, surely.
