Feinstein, who is the senator from California, said on Sunday that she will propose the bill when the Congress convenes in January.  "I'm going to introduce in the Senate, and the same bill will be introduced in the House, a bill to ban assault weapons," said Feinstein. The senator will need the backing of both the Republicans and the Democrats for the bill to be passed.  A federal ban on assault weapons was in effect in 1994, however, after ten years the ban expired in 2004. President Barack Obama said he would restore the law while running for president in 2008, however, since elected he has not attempted to bring back the assault weapon ban.  Obama has, in reality, relaxed gun controlling while in office by allowing people the right to carry firearms in national parks and while traveling on national trains.  On December 14, a shooter killed 27 people, including 20 children aged 6 to7 years in an elementary school in Connecticut before shooting himself.  Other well-known incidents involving assault-style weapons are the Colorado massacre in August when 12 were killed and 58 wounded at a movie theater, and the one that occurred in 2011, when a gunman used a semi-automatic pistol killing six people and wounding House Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson Arizona.
