Who the hell said anything about condemning the film?The fact that you are so narrowminded as to think that filmmakers should cater to your ideas on torture is mind boggling.Oh yes, sure. It's mind boggling that I'm so narrow minded. Dude, everyone can make the fucking films they like. Just because they do, doesn't mean that people have to agree with them. I can find parts of a slug propaganda film like Red Dawn enjoyable while absolutely hating most of the rest. Same goes for oh so many other films.What you don't seem to get is that I don't want film critics and film consumers swallowing every movie that comes in front of them like a cheap burger. I want people to dig a little deeper and look at what a film is saying about our society because ultimately, film is the most contemporary medium we have - the perfect echo chamber.  I want exactly what you call for but then you call me narrow minded for that.There is a major consense narrative. From what I've read this film is following it. Now, the major consense narrative isn't something I have to contemplate deeply in a movie. I have reality for that. Movies that break the major consens narrative are the ones that promote critical thinking and actually challenge my own thoughts and beliefs.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn 2004 CIA agents tortured a German citizen, sodomising, shackling, and beating him  by  heisakukosawain  worldnews[+]DV1312 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]DV1312 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours agobut from an artistic viewpoint (you know, the viewpoint that film critics take for when they judge works of art)If they go so far. I've read far too many reviews that don't contemplate what the film throws at you. They just swallow the packaging.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn 2004 CIA agents tortured a German citizen, sodomising, shackling, and beating him  by  heisakukosawain  worldnews[+]DV1312 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (0 children)[]DV1312 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours agoUnfortunately, many people who see the movie will associate the torture with the successful killing of UBL.That's actually something you can't criticize a film maker too much for. Society has a weird way to take over and completely distort works of art to fit the message they want to hear. Think about "Born in the USA" or Ride of the Valkyries in Apocalypse Now.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn 2004 CIA agents tortured a German citizen, sodomising, shackling, and beating him  by  heisakukosawain  worldnews[+]DV1312 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours ago*(0 children)[]DV1312 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours ago*Granted, I haven't seen it yet. I've only read many reviews about it and I can't recall anyone writing that she glorified torture. Quite the opposite actually, it was described as a "necessary evil" by some critics that took the time to write more than a sentence about it.The critics who actually went in depth extrapolated a rationalististic and equally fatalistic justification for the various reprehensible actions by the CIA. Something in the vein of "it had to be done" in an extremely toned down approach. The way I read it, they criticized that it carried the same mindset as let's say 24 but put it in a seemingly real environment which 24 never was. Sure, Bigelow has to portray that mindest, it surely was the one many people held in that field but she doesn't seem to pin a counterpoint to it in an artistic way.If indeed the pointlessness becomes a central mainstay of the whole tale as you say, I could see how such an analysis could be inherently flawed. I will have to judge that on my own when the film comes out in February here in Europe.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn 2004 CIA agents tortured a German citizen, sodomising, shackling, and beating him  by  heisakukosawain  worldnews[+]DV1312 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago*(0 children)[]DV1312 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago*That's such a bogus argument. If you make a film that is very clearly not just mindless escapism, you can't expect to not be judged upon the message you willingly convey to your audience.Even if you make a film that supposedly is just mindless escapism, you have to take its moral implications into account because those are the films that shape a public perception even more than specifically non-escapist movies do.Considering the impact that films about contemperary history have on the publics perception (there are more than enough examples where people see movie pictures in their mind when reminded of real world events), you simply have to pay attention to that. If you do not, you're not doing much more than writing a synopsis and some basic impressions - a feat that is accomplished by countless IMDB users nowadays, and they do it for free. Film critics have long been nothing more than film fans who can write when they should be contemporary film scholars who can write in a popular way.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn 2004 CIA agents tortured a German citizen, sodomising, shackling, and beating him  by  heisakukosawain  worldnews[+]DV1312 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]DV1312 1 point2 points3 points 18 hours agoTrue, but I can speak from my own experiences when I say that those films are shown in film schools explicitely dissecting the propagandistic tools they used.Eisenstein is one of the most important figures of early cinema, especially in the field of editing. But we don't watch his films as if they were made in a vacuum. The mass psychological effect of films like Battleship Potemkin, Triumph of the Will or Birth Of A Nation is one of the most important topics in basic film history as it is taught, at least at my film school.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHat irgendwer eine Ahnung, was S21 der Bahn berhaupt bringt?  by  lufseyin  de[+]DV1312 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]DV1312 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoAber genau das war doch in Berlin auch... klar, nicht ganz so wild unterm Tiergarten durchzugraben aber trotzdem.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIn 2004 CIA agents tortured a German citizen, sodomising, shackling, and beating him  by  heisakukosawain  worldnews[+]DV1312 42 points43 points44 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]DV1312 42 points43 points44 points 22 hours agoZero Dark Thirty, a movie about the CIA hunt for Al Qaeda including torture scenes, is coming out next month. Surefire Oscar candidate from Kathrin Bigelow. New York Magazine's summary of the movie:"As a moral statement, Zero Dark Thirty is borderline fascistic. As a piece of cinema, it's phenomenally gripping - an unholy masterwork."The film is getting near perfect reviews, based on the second sentence. The first sentence is overlooked by almost anyone.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHat irgendwer eine Ahnung, was S21 der Bahn berhaupt bringt?  by  lufseyin  de[+]DV1312 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]DV1312 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoIch hab auch eine Frage.

Taking this allegory to the extreme can mean things like winning the war against these sea monsters halfway through the movie and then falling into the trap of using these giant machines against the human population.To be honest, the only thing that interested me in this trailer was this one sentence. There are only a few directors who could do something like what I described in the storywise flat and uninspired monster-of-the-year-3D-explosion-fest genre.It would be a brilliant game with people's expectations. Maybe in the vein of Spec Ops: The Line as a First Person Shooter. Imagine the cinema full of 12 year olds who have to contemplate the overmilitarization of their home country.Everyone who would willingly refuse to give his audience the escapism they seemingly want in a summer blockbuster is to be admired.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm Sick Of Pretending: I Don't "Get" Art  by  rick_2047in  TrueReddit[+]DV1312 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]DV1312 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThose sound cool indeed.My favorite happened in the early 2000's in Austria by Christoph Schlingensief, a kind of provocateur performer from Germany (I'm from there too). Back then Austria had just put a populistic right wing party into government. Schlingensief put up a container house in the middle of one of Vienna's most crowded places to basically play "Big Brother" (which was brand new back then) with immigrants and asylum seekers. Everyday one asylum seeker would be voted out and had to leave the country. The container house had barbwire on top and there was a huge sign above it that read "Illegals out of Austria".What followed were unbelievably heated discussions. Old Austrians hated it because it was criticizing the right wing party and it was made by a German who didn't have a right to comment about Austria. And then there were other Austrians that hated it because it gave a wrong impression of their country. Others hated it because they thought it was for real. At some point left wing antifascists climbed the walls and started to tear the whole place down. Schlingensief always went outside and confronted the crowd with changing opinions to rile them up, which was pretty dangerous since some of them came short of smashing his face in.permalinksavecontextfull commentsNorth Korea launches rocket  by  ch4mp1onin  worldnews[+]DV1312 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]DV1312 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoJust out of curiosity... what is the novelty in naming my account DV1312?permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
