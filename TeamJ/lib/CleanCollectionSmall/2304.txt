Even if he isn't dropping crazy lines just the way he flows over his tracks makes them all really easy to listen to. A lot of other rappers can't do that. Anyway this tape rides.

I'm looking for my first bike  by  Squbein  tall[+]imsecretlyadog 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]imsecretlyadog 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoI'm about 6'4", and the most comfortable I've ridden is the Katana. That's basically because it's a sport-touring rather than a full on sports bike, meaning you don't have to maintain an uncomfortable position and you can sit more towards the back of the seat as a tall person. I haven't been on a ton of bikes but as long as you find one in that category, you should be fine. Hope that helps.permalinksavecontextfull commentsFlatmobile  by  68Cadillacin  pics[+]imsecretlyadog -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (0 children)[]imsecretlyadog -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoNeeds moar lowpermalinksavecontextfull commentsOhio State Defensive Linemen Jonathan Hankins To Forego Senior Season.  by  doubleUsquaredin  CFB[+]imsecretlyadog 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]imsecretlyadog 2 points3 points4 points 3 days agoAs a Jaguars fan, I'm very very hopeful.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOhio State Defensive Linemen Jonathan Hankins To Forego Senior Season.  by  doubleUsquaredin  CFB[+]imsecretlyadog 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]imsecretlyadog 4 points5 points6 points 3 days agoAny predictions how early he will go?

Telling everyone how you feel about a certain album / artist is fine, and that happens constantly. But creating posts like "Is Gucci the dumbest rapper ever?", isn't the way to start a discussion. All I'm really saying is I'd rather see positive posts celebrating all the diversities in hip-hop rather than this negative shit on the front page.permalinksavecontextfull commentshas eminem fallen off?  by  RockoTreezin  hiphopheads[+]imsecretlyadog 11 points12 points13 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]imsecretlyadog 11 points12 points13 points 7 days agoAlso I just noticed the last two posts you made were: Is F&L2 the worst album of the year, and: Has Eminem fallen off.Maybe instead of making posts asking questions putting down artists like Eminem and Lupe Fiasco, you should focus on finding and sharing music you actually appreciate.permalinksavecontextfull commentshas eminem fallen off?  by  RockoTreezin  hiphopheads[+]imsecretlyadog 21 points22 points23 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]imsecretlyadog 21 points22 points23 points 7 days agoIf you didn't like Bad Meets Evil - Hell: The Sequel, then I'm sorry but you're not a huge Eminem fan.

Was it the best rap album to come out this year? Far from it? Was it Lupe's best? Again, far from it. But overall, this album is not all that bad. ITAL, Strange Fruition, Around My Way, Bitch Bad, Put em Up, Form Follows Function, Lamborghini Angels, are all bangers, and put Lupe's skill on display. I can't say much for the rest of the album, because I didn't like it all that much, but with those songs alone it's impossible to say that this album was the worst of anything. Obviously LASERS wasn't what Lupe wanted to put out at all, and I think Atlantic is still pushing him to put out a certain sound on all his songs. I don't think Lupe has a really strong grasp on hooks or beat selection that will sound good to a lot of people.. but he's done it before, and I have no doubt he can do it again. I've heard some Lupe fans say this was one of his best albums, because he does go into a lot of detail on subjects he only touched on before. Opinions aside, I don't think anyone should be calling this "the worst of the year." /rantpermalinksavecontextfull comments24181920Free Album: Meyhem Lauren - Mandatory Brunch Meetings (complex.com)submitted 7 days ago by imsecretlyadog to hiphopheads13 commentssharecancelloading...Trying an apple bong for the first time at a [7]  by  phizzlekin  trees[+]imsecretlyadog 2 points3 points4 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]imsecretlyadog 2 points3 points4 points 8 days agoCan someone post that picture with the information on how to smoke out of an apple?
