Mostly because my brain can't comprehend one person doing this, let alone convincing another person to participate as well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your useless talent?  by  IamSofaKingIttyin  AskReddit[+]ayriana 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]ayriana 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoapparently I can do this toopermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your useless talent?  by  IamSofaKingIttyin  AskReddit[+]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoOften I feel this can be a curse, especially when combined with lackluster social skills.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThrow the goddamn stick  by  PhoneDojoin  funny[+]ayriana 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agomine does something similar, but she's afraid of the stairs. Instead she hides the ball under the coffee table, then gets it out, then hides it again, gets it out until she gets bored. Usually this can occupy her for hours.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThrow the goddamn stick  by  PhoneDojoin  funny[+]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agomy border collie boxer mix is the same way. I say she has two modes- on or off. When she's on she will play with that ball, frisbee, stick or other thing with you for HOURS. Then she turns off, when she's not being played with while I'm working she is almost always asleep.She does try to herd children though. It is adorable.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL 1 sheep jumped off a cliff in Turkey & 1500 sheep followed. only about 400 died because the other sheep fell on a soft pile of wool/ sheep:)  by  djaybein  todayilearned[+]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoThat's an excellent question, and it's been over a decade since I've worked closely with sheep, I do know that when he bit her it didn't break the skin. I do remember the bottle babies having teeth at a very young age... This link seems to back up my memory. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL 1 sheep jumped off a cliff in Turkey & 1500 sheep followed. only about 400 died because the other sheep fell on a soft pile of wool/ sheep:)  by  djaybein  todayilearned[+]ayriana 6 points7 points8 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 6 points7 points8 points 3 days agoI've had both and they both do stupid things, but have much different instincts. Chickens seem more likely to hide when scared, and will eat whatever is available, even if it's poison, where sheep seem more likely to run when scared and will do stupid things in order to get at something more tasty. Turkeys are worse, I had one stick it's head through the fence to say hi to the neighbor dog.   permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL 1 sheep jumped off a cliff in Turkey & 1500 sheep followed. only about 400 died because the other sheep fell on a soft pile of wool/ sheep:)  by  djaybein  todayilearned[+]ayriana 17 points18 points19 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 17 points18 points19 points 3 days agoThey really are too stupid to understand whats going on, I fear if I left them they would literally break their necks. I did take pictures if they managed to do it in a particularly funny position, or the time they got stuck in the chair- unfortunately I don't have the pictures anymore though.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL 1 sheep jumped off a cliff in Turkey & 1500 sheep followed. only about 400 died because the other sheep fell on a soft pile of wool/ sheep:)  by  djaybein  todayilearned[+]ayriana 103 points104 points105 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 103 points104 points105 points 3 days agoI had sheep repeatedly get their heads stuck in fences so they could eat the grass on the other side- they get their head through, but their ears won't bend back when they try and get their heads out and they sit there helplessly until they are rescued. Luckily we didn't lose any this way, but it was quite possible for them to break their necks or for a wandering coyote to decide to go for the free meal.We also had a sheep get stuck in a plastic lawn chair that had been sitting in the barn for months. After we got her out, another ewe got stuck in the exact same way, an hour later. They were not smart animals at all.My favorite has to be when my mom was pulling a lamb. It needed to be born but was being stubborn, so my mom sticks her arm up there to get him out. He bit her. Damn thing wasn't even born yet and he was already a stupid jerk.permalinksavecontextfull comments50% of voters believe that President Obama and the Democrats are being more reasonable in the negotiations than House Speaker John Boehner and the Republicans, compared to 38% who believe that Boehner and the GOP are being more reasonable.  by  wang-bangerin  politics[+]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI've never gotten anything but form letters like that from my republican representative. When I write my democratic senators I don't even get that back, which annoys me even more because I'm often writing them in support of what they do. I know I shouldn't EXPECT a response, but it's nice to know I'm heard.permalinksavecontextfull comments50% of voters believe that President Obama and the Democrats are being more reasonable in the negotiations than House Speaker John Boehner and the Republicans, compared to 38% who believe that Boehner and the GOP are being more reasonable.  by  wang-bangerin  politics[+]ayriana 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoI usually get letters back from my "in the party leadership" representative. They are form letters. They never actually have to do with anything I wrote. I have written him about health care, internet regulations and taxation. It's actually quite insulting.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the biggest movie plot hole you have ever seen?  by  kickster777in  AskReddit[+]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoThis is what I always assumed- they accomplished two things- got the humans out of their way and also got their energy source.

There are lots of jobs in education that aren't teaching directly, and many of the reasons that you got into teaching in the first place are probably still there, just buried by the misery. Taking this advice early in my career was a very good move.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat crucial advice do you wish you never ignored?  by  Boohooimsadin  AskReddit[+]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoand if you want to go back- it's never too late.

I'm just bad at all of them, I'm okay at the basics and the mechanics- and I even get a few cheap shots in right when I start, but I will never be able to hold my own.

It was really frustrating. They ended up lying to my entire office, had me re-design the whole program for my office's main client to "spread out" the work load and make it "easier" on us, then laid off my whole office.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMost cringeworthy classmate you've had?  by  panda_poacher69in  AskReddit[+]ayriana 3 points4 points5 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 3 points4 points5 points 8 days agoFederal regulations require the school to provide an education in the least restrictive environment, and the parents have to agree to the accommodations. Many parents are in denial and insist that their student be placed in more mainstream situations. On the other end many parents want their child to have accommodations when they don't need them. Schools fear lawsuits, so they often have to go along with what the parents want even when it's not really the best environment for the student. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMost cringeworthy classmate you've had?  by  panda_poacher69in  AskReddit[+]ayriana 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (0 children)[]ayriana 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago"That guy" is the entire reason I decided not to get a Political Science minor in college.
