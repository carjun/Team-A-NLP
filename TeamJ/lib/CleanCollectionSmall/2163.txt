However, these events are quite rare, and are ultimately ineffective at preventing future incidents.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Violence with firearms that manifests itself in this form is a social medical problem, not a problem of property rights.   Gun crime where robbery and assault is involved, is also not a property rights issue, it is a socioeconomic one.Mental health is a serious problem, that often goes unchecked.  It is when it goes unchecked, combined with a unique circumstance, that tragedies like this occur.  While people are quick to blame guns, the same sort of thing happened in China quite recently with a young man armed with a knife was able to kill 9 people before he was stopped.99% of all firearms are never used to intimidate, hurt, or kill people.  For those reasons, and more, I think anyone who is staunchly anti-gun is barking up the wrong tree.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Defenders at least have a chance against knives of defending themselves.I do not know what magical world you live in, but that's not true.  You watch too many movies.Well, how the hell do we know who is a law-abiding gun owner without these laws?If you pass a criminal background check, it is assumed you are an upstanding citizen.You can't distinguish the criminals from the non-criminals without strict laws, which is why we have them.In the eyes of the law, a person is only legally a criminal if they get caught.  No amount of licensing will stop people from falling through the cracks, or lying about their intentions if they otherwise have a clean slate.  It will not stop potential future criminals who have not committed a crime yet. Since a vast majority of murders are committed by people who have criminal records, and who have obtained guns illegally in the first place, it is unlikely that any amount of gun legislation is going to change that.  For this reason, it is little wonder that criminal use of firearms went pretty much unaffected in Canada, in spite of strict gun control laws.And the long-gun registry was flawed, it didn't have enough power. A gun should be registered in the same way as a vehicle in my opinion.How is that exactly?  You obviously have no idea how gun registration worked/works.And I think safe storage certainly prevents people from stealing guns.The problem with safe storage laws is that anyone intent on stealing a gun, will be able to regardless if it is locked up in a secure storage container or not.  This has been proven many times.  The whole point of safe storage in Canada is to prevent children, or untrained people, from gaining easy access to firearms and having accidents.  The only way to keep people from stealing guns is to keep your ownership of guns a secret.  There is little distinction between having a gun locked up in a closet, or hidden in a closet in a locked home, as having it locked up in a safe.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadianFeels.jpg  by  tikki_roxin  canada[+]hafetysazard 2 points3 points4 points 8 hours ago*(0 children)[]hafetysazard 2 points3 points4 points 8 hours ago*Unfortunately, what you said can not be more wrong.Guns are not designed primarily to kill people, they are primarily designed for self-defense, hunting, or target shooting.  That is after all what guns are used for 99.99% of the time. While judicious use of firearms in self-defense often results in a person dying, it is understood that stopping the threat and protecting others lives became paramount at some point over the right of the attacker to remain uninjured and being allowed to continue their assault.Firearms are unparalleled in stopping people hell-bent on hurting others.  However, in many circumstances, being shot is not enough to stop a person.  Firearms are no intuitive to use, and it takes a great deal of skill to be useful with them.  It is quite sad if you trust that depictions about firearms in movies, television, and video games is an accurate representation of what firearm use is like.While you may argue it is easy for a person to murder another at close range with a gun, the same can be said with any weapon: knife, baseball bat, axe, vehicle, etc.You have obviously never shot a gun, nor studied the effects of gun shot wounds to make such an assertion.  This is quite obvious, otherwise you would not hold such distorted views on firearms.  If what you said was correct, most people who get shot, should die.  However, that is not the case.It takes a very well aimed shot to vital organs, such as the brain, and heart, to kill a person immediately, and a lack of medical attention to kill a person who was shot in non-vital parts of the body.  Bullets are not magical grenades that explode inside the body and rip it to shreds, they just punch a holes through the body.  The same way knives, and other blunt instruments do.  Guns are not lights out switches for a person's life.  They can be, but so can many things, it all depends on knowing how to use whatever that weapon is.Guns have the same inherent moral characteristic as any other inanimate piece of machinery.  Any symbolism you attribute to those objects, is purely internalized, and is not real in any sense.  Nor, is it shared with everybody.  Gun owners obviously do not view their firearms as being immoral killing machines, since they know better.  The first time I fired a gun, I immediately change my opinion on them and thought, "well, what was the big deal about?"The parallel I was drawing with racism, is no different than any other form of bigotry.  You fail to understand the issue with honesty, and it reinforces your prejudicial views, which reinforces your failure to understand the issue.  You look at firearms from an extremely shallow perspective, and while you think you are correct, millions of gun owners, and reasonable people, know you are wrong.You must think to yourself, "If so many people are asserting that guns are no big deal, maybe they are not, and maybe I should look more into them instead of having an intellectually corrupted opinion."  In a country like the U.S. where the amount of guns is approaching the population, with rates of gun crimes dropping every year, you would think to have some common sense and try to understand the issue instead of being a bigot.  But hey, that's up to you.I do not see how an opinion based on falsehoods, and emotional appeals, will ever stand the test of time, nor ever be an accurate description of how things are, or aught to be.  For that reason, anti-gun sentiments, are completely ridiculous, and like racism, they aught to go.  While you think championing gun restrictions is going to save lives, what you fail to see is that such ambition is ineffective, and laughable to the people you fear the most.  What is worse, is that millions of people who know better, and hurt nobody, stand to lose their freedoms, and rights, if uneducated people like yourself are to be listened to.  It happened here in Canada, when the political party in power at the time had many staunch anti-gun advocates.  Their ignorant opinions saw millions of Canadians lose privileges, and by the strike of a pen, created thousands upon thousands of criminals.  There is little evidence that gun control measures in Canada had any real effect on crime, and murder.  In fact, there is plenty of evidence that such laws were useless in that regard.It is sad that anyone who chooses to owns firearms, are looked down upon by less educated people, and vilified for making a harmless choice.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWere the first trains on the London Underground steam-powered?

In either case, if you, or any Finn, is more than casually interested in owning fully-automatic firearms, they should speak to the Poliisi, and figure out what is legally required.  It would be a great privilege.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCanadianFeels.jpg  by  tikki_roxin  canada[+]hafetysazard 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]hafetysazard 10 points11 points12 points 22 hours agoIt is because people associate them with bad things, even though they being what they are, have nothing to do with those bad things.  It is the same sort of thinking that goes into developing a racist attitude: shallow observation, and no attempt at understanding.  The shallow observation is used to reinforce, and dissuade the person, and others to attempt to understand, so that it remains not well understood.Some people tend to think that criminals do not seek out guns, but that guns seek out them.permalinksavecontextfull comments16181920Men's 25m Rapid Fire Pistol (youtube.com)submitted 22 hours ago by hafetysazard to Firearms4 commentssharecancelloading...CanadianFeels.jpg  by  tikki_roxin  canada[+]hafetysazard 28 points29 points30 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]hafetysazard 28 points29 points30 points 23 hours ago*So if somebody breaks into your home and steals your kitchen knives, and uses them to commit a robbery, and double homicide, you as the home owner should be responsible?  What if somebody stole your car, and ran somebody down?  You should also be responsible as the owner?That sounds incredibly stupid.  How are you supposed to have any control over an object that is not in your possession, never mind control over the individual who wants to use said object to hurt somebody else?  It is not as if your firearm magically motivated a person to steal it, and magically motivated a person to murder somebody with it.There is no point in being tough on law-abiding gun owners, since they are not the problem.  It is the criminals who choose to break laws which are the problem.  Plus, a criminal can get a gun anywhere.  They do not depend on robbing legal owners' homes to get guns.  Something like 4% of all gun related homicides in Canada involved registered guns.  There's no mention if they were stolen, or used by the owner.Given things that have happened in Canada, safe storage requirements do little to prevent guns from being stolen by people who are highly motivated to steal them.  All that aught to be required is that people do not advertise the fact that they own guns, as that would prevent most target crimes.  The whole point about safe storage is to keep those people, such as children and unlicensed individuals, from having easy access.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsVigilante punishes woman for littering, in his own way...  by  BlueElephantsin  JusticePorn[+]hafetysazard 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*(0 children)[]hafetysazard 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago*Russia has a really high rate of gun murders, and their firearms laws are considered very strict.  The truth is, how well armed law-abiding citizens are, does not necessarily translate into additional killings with guns.  Hot heads will flip out and try to hurt people, in any way they can.  It does not matter if it is a gun, a knife, or a baseball bat.Anybody who carries a firearm every day for personal protection would understand that getting a bucket of water thrown at you, is not a justifiable reason to shoot somebody.It is not as if people are walking around with guns, treating them like cap guns to scare people away.  That is probably your viewpoint, but you obviously know very little about guns.  Honestly, you can not expect everyone to be as ignorant as you about how deadly firearms actually are, especially those people who are required to take classes and be proficient in order to carry them.In any case, people who who are licensed to carry firearms in public are not a problem for public safety, it is the people who choose to break the law who are the problem, and no amount of gun control is going to stop them.There is a great moral responsibility in being armed.  Who would you rather have be armed?  People who are trained and knowledgeable about how and when to use their weapons, or people who have no clue?The reason there is not a high number of gun murders in France is because it is a fairly peaceful place.permalinksavecontextfull commentsVigilante punishes woman for littering, in his own way...  by  BlueElephantsin  JusticePorn[+]hafetysazard 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]hafetysazard 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoSince they do not own guns, people kill each other in rage by stabbing, beating, and running them over in their cars.

They are not hurting anybody.  People need them for self-defense, and for hunting.  The only way to become proficient in either of those skillets is through practice, which is  what target shooting is.  Some people make sport out of target shooting, which becomes their main purpose for owning firearms.  It has been in the Olympics since its inception.  What is so bad about it?  Are you trying to suggest that those people are wrong somehow, immoral even?What makes it unconstitutional?   Does something have to be in the constitution to be allowable?  I do not understand.  The second amendment is designed to protect the country, by allowing all people to be armed, it is not about hunting, or target shooting.  Since it is understood that those things would always exist as a result of gun ownership, and a hungry stomach.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
