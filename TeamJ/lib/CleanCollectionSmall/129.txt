(AP)  A man opened fire Friday inside two classrooms at the Connecticut elementary school where his mother was a teacher, killing 26 people, including 20 children, as youngsters cowered in corners and closets and trembled helplessly to the sound of shots reverberating through the building.The 20-year-old killer, carrying two handguns, committed suicide at the school, and another person was found dead at a second scene, bringing the toll to 28, authorities said.Police shed no light on the motive for the attack. The gunman was believed to suffer from a personality disorder and lived with his mother in Connecticut, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to publicly discuss it.The rampage, coming less than two weeks before Christmas, was the nations second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the Virginia Tech massacre that left 33 people dead in 2007.Panicked parents looking for their children raced to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, a prosperous community of about 27,000 people 60 miles northeast of New York City. Youngsters at the kindergarten-through-fourth-grade school were told to close their eyes by police as they were led from the building.Schoolchildren  some crying, others looking frightened  were escorted through a parking lot in a line, hands on each others shoulders.Our hearts are broken today, a tearful President Barack Obama, struggling to maintain composure, said at the White House. He called for meaningful action to prevent such shootings. As a country, we have been through this too many times, he said.Youngsters and their parents described teachers locking doors and ordering the children to huddle in the corner or hide in closets when shots echoed through the building. Authorities didnt say exactly how the shootings unfolded.They also gave no details on the victim discovered at another scene, except to say that the person was an adult found dead by police while they were investigating the gunman.A law enforcement official identified the gunman as 20-year-old Adam Lanza, the son of a teacher. A second law enforcement official said his mother, Nancy Lanza, was presumed dead.Adam Lanzas older brother, 24-year-old Ryan, of Hoboken, N.J., was being questioned.The law enforcement official who said Adam Lanza had a possible personality disorder said Ryan Lanza had been extremely cooperative, was not believed to have any involvement in the rampage and was not under arrest or in custody, but investigators were still searching his computers and phone records. Ryan Lanza told law enforcement he had not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.All three law enforcement officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the unfolding investigation.The gunman drove to the school in his mothers car, the second official said. Three guns were found  a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols, inside the school, and a .223-caliber rifle in the back of a car.State police Lt. Paul Vance said 28 people in all were killed, including the gunman, and one person was injured.Robert Licata said his 6-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher.Thats when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door, he said. He was very brave. He waited for his friends.He said the shooter didnt utter a word.Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter was in the school and heard two big bangs. Teachers told her to get in a corner, he said.Its alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America, he said. His daughter was fine.Theodore Varga said he was in a meeting with other fourth-grade teachers when he heard the gunfire, but there was no lock on the door.He said someone turned on the public address system so that you could hear the hysteria that was going on. I think whoever did that saved a lot of people. Everyone in the school was listening to the terror that was transpiring.Also, a custodian went running around, warning people there was a gunman in the school, Varga said.He said, Guys! Get down! Hide!' Varga said. So he was actually a hero. The teacher said he did not know if the custodian survived.Varga said he tried to kick out an air-conditioning unit in the window so the five teachers in the room could escape, but he only managed to knock out the wood next to it, and the space wasnt big enough for all of them to squeeze through.Continued...
