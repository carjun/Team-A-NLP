Some people, despite themselves would freeze or flee in fear.  Some stay and do their best to help.  I tend to consider the latter heroes, but that's just my take.  _^permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I'm from LA and want a similar experience elsewhere. Where should I go?  by  poopyfartsin  LosAngeles[+]kudomonster 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]kudomonster 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoAs someone born in LA who has lived in Santa Cruz and is currently living in NYC, I love the Bay Area.  It can be a bit boring depending where you are, but if you have a car, its not too hard to get to some sort of excitement.  NYC is...crazy and expensive, but it is a nice place to grow up a bit.  Unless you score an amazing job, you will likely be living paycheck to paycheck, but it definitely gives you a chance to really test everything about yourself.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm taking my girlfriend to NYC for 3 days.

Its a study that was done almost 20 years ago (archaic, I know, but the principle points are still relevant) that goes into the major language gaps between students from low and high SES communities.  Other tips:1) Use a point or token system to keep learning fun. Let them buy free time, snacks, toys, bookmarks, etc.  Its may cost you a bit, but if you can establish a consistent and motivating classroom environment, it'll be worth it for everyone.2)Use communication books. If you can take a couple minutes every few days to write a quick blurb about how their child is doing, it means a lot.  Plus it gives you another means of keeping in contact with parents.3)If you can afford to, have "office hours." Sometimes a kid needs somewhere to hang out or get help.  If you make time for your kids, that can mean the world to them, especially if their parents can't make time for one reason or another.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTo the people who have been to the WWoHP:  by  kitkat1026in  harrypotter[+]kudomonster 6 points7 points8 points 17 days ago (0 children)[]kudomonster 6 points7 points8 points 17 days agoGo to Olivander's.
