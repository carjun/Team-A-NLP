(Turner) network of affiliated sites is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. Advertising enables us to provide the rich content for which sites on the Turner Network are known. Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across the Turner Network's diverse websites. You may learn more about our practices by reading our privacy statement.How do we do it? An example:If you often visit content on the Turner Network about travel, we may use "web beacons" to infer your possible interest in travel and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest. It's important to understand that these technologies do not use personally identifiable information to make this happen but instead use anonymous identifiers within the "cookies" stored in your browser.What happens if I opt-out?If you opt out of interest-based ads on this site or another Turner Network site, please be aware of the following:You will no longer receive interest-based ads on the Turner Network sites.

If you use other computers or browsers and want to opt out of interest-based ads on any of those, you will need to repeat this process for each computer or browser.If you delete your browser cookies and want to continue to be opted out of interest-based ads, you will need to return to this page and opt out again.You can change your preferences at any time to enable interest-based ads by returning to this page and selecting "opt in."I'd like to opt out of interest-based ads.
