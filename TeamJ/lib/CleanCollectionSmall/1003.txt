Do you spank or plan to spank your kids when you have them?  by  por_que_noin  AskReddit[+]juneberri 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago (0 children)[]juneberri 1 point2 points3 points 12 days agoReading through some of these replies, and I'm wondering if we need to redefine the world 'spank'. Some of it reads like downright physical and emotional abuse. And I hurt for a lot of them. I can't imagine having to grow up with that kind of action and abuse taken against me for something I'd done.And it makes me question whether what my parents did was spanking. :\I was spanked maybe three times as a child, and slapped once as a teenager. I never remember the spankings, let alone them being painful.And the slap was well deserved. Mum was trying to verbally discipline me about not disrespecting my older brother, and letting him have his time watching what he likes on TV. I was talking back, and just being a brat in general and she told me to go to my room. I laughed in her face, and kept laughing when she'd tell me to leave the room or stop. Kept asking her why, what is she going to do, she wasn't going to do anything... Got a swift slap and shut right up. Mum was home alone with us so she couldn't switch off with dad like she normally did.Anytime one of them got too angry in a situation, they'd literally tap out and the other parent would take over. I can remember multiple occasions where dad was trying to discipline me and would just leave the room mid-sentence and mum would appear seconds later. I never understood it until later. I'm thankful for that.As for the topic question. I don't know. I'm 25 and my boyfriend and I are in no rush to have children. And if/when we do, I have no idea how we'll discipline our children. I know for a fact that no harm will ever come to them, regardless of what they've done. No child deserves the abuse that some have endured in this thread.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am a certified Dutch nail tech and would love to help any of you with questions you may have  by  LIMWZin  RedditLaqueristas[+]juneberri 0 points1 point2 points 23 days ago (0 children)[]juneberri 0 points1 point2 points 23 days agoOh, but it's such an ugly duckling sometimes. :3 But you're right, I shouldn't complain.

I've inherited very strong, thick nails from my mum and they tend to hold their shape quite well when they get long. Is there a reason my middle fingernail tends to 'flare' out when it gets any length to it? Kind of like flattens out.And if so, is there some way to remedy it? Different way of filing it or?Also, a quick edit for more information. The middle nail does tend to be a bit softer and thinner than the rest.permalinksavecontextfull comments13171819Very Verdant!
