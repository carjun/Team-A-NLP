These reporters are sick.-edit-My wife pointed out probably the kids are the only ones who can actually talk, the adults are probably a wreck. The kiddos don't fully understand what happened to them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThat smell... (Tram very crowded)  by  standsurein  stopdrinking[+]OddAdviceGiver 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThe other day at the grocery store there were about 4 people who reeked of alcohol. At my daughter's event a few parents smelled of it too.I used to think I didn't smell, but yea, I was pretty pickled even days after drinking. Wine was the worst.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEasy Quit, Easy Relapse?  by  Ambivalent_Fanaticin  stopdrinking[+]OddAdviceGiver 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago*(0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago*How do we keep from forgetting how horrible alcohol makes us feel?Constantly writing about it, for me... but there were some fun times too. Actually, some damn ugly ones mirrored by some damn awesome ones.The thing is, there's a risk factor. My bottom hit hard, but I didn't even know it until I became sober. Yep, looked back. Even with the good, that bad was really bad, not worth the good. Or maybe it was, for a learning lesson. But the brain tends to forget the bad. The "good old days" are remembered because our minds want to forget the bad, that's the way our mind protects itself. We wall it up. Even after breaking down the walls, we tend to re-wall it up, but after we forgive ourselves of it it's still there and we made mistakes and we have to constantly remember them.There is no final penance. It's something we have to live with. It sucks, but we have to remember it, constantly, or else we'll relapse.I quit easily. I didn't stay sober, however, without a LOT of help from others. I think the first few weeks were fine. It was around the 6mo mark that I started to go insane, I think the point where the body starts realizing that the habit is gone and the little red devil on the shoulder is really making noise. Easy to quit, so easy to relapse... but that could be said of anything too.Hard to quit, easy to relapse too. This morning I could really use a drink, but it's not going to help me at all, so I'm not. It's like that every once and a while, almost... the demons get louder and louder, though infrequent. Handling the holiday parties is easy, because when I had a problem it wasn't when I went out... I was usually the designated driver. I would socialize while sober. If someone else was driving I'd still stay sober because that designated driver usually wound up drinking one or three or a dozen anyway. My problem was drinking by myself when I didn't have to go anywhere, so my problem is my own selfishness.I also quit out of selfishness; I didn't care about anything else but if shit was gonna go down in my life it was going to happen while I was sober, not drinking. So that's my drive to stay sober.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe police officer that barged into a student's dorm from the youtube video "i hate cops" is now fired.  by  Inffectedin  news[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoAs much as I want to hate the cops on this one, some of the shit we pulled in our dorm rooms would've been considered felonies of some sort; my neighbors liquid-nailed the doors of another room's totally shut. The rooms had steel doors, like prison doors too. The fire department had to go through the walls to get the guys out. They were pretty much not amused.That is an example of a light prank, too. Nobody fessed up to it, but believe me there were some pissed off police and firemen there that night. Sometimes they have to go through some weird shit, no wonder the bad apples show themselves to be rotten to the core.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHeterosexuals of Reddit, when did you realize you weren't gay?  by  TheBastardTrollin  AskReddit[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*(0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*Wow what a question. I guess I didn't know what I was until I fell in love with a girl my freshman year in high school. That pretty much solidified it. I mean anything turned me on, but falling in love with girls I suppose was the defining moment.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCensorship: As of past two hours, Google images safesearch is MANDATORY for US IP's (XPost to /R/WTF)  by  MileyRay-XOin  technology[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoJust search for whatever and the word porn, but it's not the same results as non-us google returns for whatever (and not the porn)permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo, before my ex-coworker left the company a few months ago, he decided that random stored procedures should stop working when the world ended.

Constant quitting/restarting is worse overall than just tapering and stopping, but it's good you go see a doctor about it. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGetting over the feeling that a day I don't drink at night is a wasted day.  by  braxis684in  stopdrinking[+]OddAdviceGiver 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoHaha that went through my mind a lot at first, boy did it. The thing is, those days are overshadowed now by the thankfulness that I didn't have a wasted day... so much more happens and can happen when I don't drink.Can't say I don't miss it, can't say that there were no bad times either, but at last I'm on solid ground and with my feet flat can state that heck, it's better being sober. For me, anyway.permalinksavecontextfull commentsOur Very Own Saul Goodman  by  terriblemothrain  Dallas[+]OddAdviceGiver 9 points10 points11 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 9 points10 points11 points 4 days agoShould've gone for the laser tag....permalinksavecontextfull commentsWil Wheaton & Science of Star Trek - StarTalk with Neil deGrasse Tyson  by  cybrbeastin  scifi[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoHe should wear a different sweater.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI now have a gigantic, full-on crush on Claudia Black.  by  Warlizardin  farscape[+]OddAdviceGiver 4 points5 points6 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 4 points5 points6 points 5 days agoYea when Pitch Black came out I was seriously angry and throwing popcorn.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPeople have been bugging me to watch Farscape for years. I just started and it's really entertaining!  by  Warlizardin  farscape[+]OddAdviceGiver 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago*(0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago*Probably one or two before it gets weird, then the storyline starts. I think S03E15 is where it starts to really really get going and the writers thought up something to present, solidly and without question, as for why Chriton is being chased down for his knowledge and what could be done with it in the wrong hands."I... I have no prayer for that."I think the only real true example besides the Peacekeeper Wars. Once you see that episode, "Icarus Abides" (which is foreshadowing in a name) you're kinda hooked for life, beyond the point of no return, so to speak, and will stay with us forever.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTwo days from a star, bought a case of booze.  by  jatzillain  stopdrinking[+]OddAdviceGiver 3 points4 points5 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 3 points4 points5 points 6 days agoMy wife drinks occasionally, and being the holidays some really good craft brews float around the house, but she usually finishes them up.There's been a six-pack in the fridge now for about 2 days that's freaking me out at times, but to me I think it's a test. Sometimes I think I can make it, most of the time I think I can anyway, but lately it's really haunting me.permalinksavecontextfull commentsEx pot heads - your thoughts?  by  feetonarmin  stopdrinking[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoI stopped smoking it a while back... to be honest, I'm too paranoid by default, let alone trying to find a new contact to pick some up or carry it about with me. Smoking was OK in my mid 20's, but it tapered off as my job demands increased. By 30's it dropped off of the radar. Oh I knew people who smoked it, but as I moved and the job demands changed my location from place to place it really wasn't much of something I craved.Yet today, when people do have it around, I really even don't want to be around it. Not because its effects, but because I don't want to risk an arrest for something stupid as having a plant on me. A fucking plant. Sheesh.Now if it were legal where I live and I didn't have to worry about drug tests, maybe I'd partake to see what it'd be like again, maybe not, but I have enough troubles right now as it is.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow I felt about chronic relapsers when I first got sober.  by  cake_or_radishin  stopdrinking[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoI can relate; it happens to most to an extent, I think. When I was younger I never understood it... and the thing is, it doesn't happen to everyone who drinks. Life's chances, random events, physiological and psychological makup affect our outcomes.But every day is a learning day.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTime to try again..  by  nomorehoochin  stopdrinking[+]OddAdviceGiver 2 points3 points4 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 2 points3 points4 points 6 days agoAwesome. I know the days can be easy or hard, good or bad, just like regular life... good to know you are fighting the good fight.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGabe Newell says Valve will release its own 'tightly controlled' console for the living room  by  robotmaxtronin  technology[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoAnd there's going to be a "Steam" distro.

Anyhow, it takes 1 hour of service time per 1 hour of flight time for these drones, and most of them aren't even recommended for use yet.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIf the President of the US were to get assassinated in today's age, how would America react compared to when Kennedy was assassinated?  by  chendoguyin  AskReddit[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoI'd think there'd be riots, but you didn't mention specifically the current president, so I don't think that was your question.If it was the current president then yea all hell would break loose about all sorts of racist undertones and actions, our country would be torn apart.I think if he or she were any other president, our nation wouldn't handle it as it would a black president. If it was a woman president then I'd imagine the nation would unite in ways that you couldn't predict, etc. etc. need more context, but I think no matter what there'd be riots if it was the current president.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan Murder Be Tracked Like An Infectious Disease? A study in Newark, N.J., found that homicides committed over a quarter century spread out very much like an infectious disease epidemic. Using this information, cities might be able to predict when and where murders will occur.  by  Libertateain  science[+]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*(0 children)[]OddAdviceGiver 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*No, someone got ahold of a data dump and already was familiar with the software used, and decided to write up a paper and get published.Some people will do anything to get published. I could do the same thing with housing values rising or falling and the data would be the same, it would look like a "disease" and people could bicker and balk about the reasons behind the results yet the results would still mirror the same as the murder data...but since I don't have a degree in finance... even if I were to publish it, it wouldn't get picked up in the news.If you could just watch/record/scrape/data dump/etc. housing prices and how they rise then use the same software, you might make a small mint if you could convince the right investors.(I'm familiar with the software and do lots of healthcare data mining)permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan Murder Be Tracked Like An Infectious Disease?
