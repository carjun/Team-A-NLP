The students are in a secure location and only released when the parents show up and they can confirm identities.  The reporters are outside this area, and parents are stopping as they leave.permalinksaveparent[+]flibbertygiblet 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours ago (14 children)[]flibbertygiblet 3 points4 points5 points 19 hours agoThis is, honestly, what sickens me the most. These children have just been through the most horrific event of their short lives, possibly their entire lives. Then these parents that are letting their children get interviewed are all, "Me! Me! Look at us! My child went through something! Attention on us!". And the fucking media is like a pig in shit about it. What the fuck is wrong with our country?permalinksaveparent[+]GitEmSteveDave 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours ago (1 child)[]GitEmSteveDave 3 points4 points5 points 18 hours agoEven CNN keeps mentioning that the children all had parental consent now.permalinksaveparent[+]palparepa 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)[]palparepa 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoWe just need a news channel that makes a piece about how horrible parents those guys are, and how the other reporters are like vultures feeding off despair.permalinksaveparent[+]thatsboxy 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours ago (11 children)[]thatsboxy 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours agoTo be fair all of the stuff i've seen on cnn all the kids and parents interviewed almost seemed like "whateves." They were not emotional or even kind of spaced out. :-/So maybe these people just didn't give a crap.Also, i don't know that in the moment a lot of parents are thinking clearly enough to really say it is ok. Maybe i am too nice.permalinksaveparent[+]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (10 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agotbh the kids probably don't even realize the finality of the situation quite yet depending on their age (most of the kids seemed pretty indifferent now that they're safe).  What's messed up is their parents seemingly having no care in the world at all about it.  Your child almost died...your kid heard gun shots...your child saw bullets flying past them...why are you letting some money grubbing journalist plaster their face all over the news?permalinksaveparent[+]thatsboxy 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago (9 children)[]thatsboxy 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoThe journalists and media need to have ethics that is for sure.But you cannot expect anyone coming out of situation like that to really understand and be able to think out the outcome of what they are doing. I bet most people will wake up today and go "wtf was i thinking?" And fuck the media for taking advantage of that.permalinksaveparent[+]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (8 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours agoI definitely agree!  I'm sure even the parents aren't even in the best state of mind.  Probably so relieved just to have their children safe and sound all things considered that they don't even care about an interview.Tbh I was a bit floored by the child who said he saw bullets flying and smelled the smoke from the gun (is that a thing or is the kid exaggerating?) before a teacher pulled him into a room.  He just seemed so nonchalant about it.  Smiled while giving the interview.  Seemed to me the kid didn't really grasp the gravity of the situation.permalinksaveparent[+]thatsboxy 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago (7 children)[]thatsboxy 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours agoHe just doesn't understand and probably had no clue what was going on. When he realizes that kids around his age were hit by those bullets and died (if he can grasp the concept of death) he will probably feel differently.I remember being a small child during the gulf war and freaking out thinking that the war was happening in my drive way. No one explained to me what was happening but i remember the panic i felt.and a lot of children tonight are feeling that way with parents either making it worse or just ignoring how their kids feel. :( that is what scares me more. I saw a few people on fb talking about pulling their kids from school to homeschool from now on. Parents are freaking out too much. These shootings are still very rare.I don't post this on fb because parents will kill me. calm down and try and think of your kids and how they feel.permalinksaveparent[+]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago*(6 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago*Same thing happened during 9/11.  I remember sitting in school (8 hours away) and children being pulled out of school during it.  I was in 8th grade at the time and my family actually lived in NYC at the time (and my aunt had worked in the towers at one point but I wasn't aware she no longer did when the event occurred).  I was worried for them and all my parents did was call to say they were safe, home and not to worry.  I was fine then.  However, kids with no connection to the event were being called home left and right all day.  Didn't make sense to me then or now.I can understand parents being worried about copycats though.  Psychologist always say that the way the media handles this sort of thing leads to copycats and I'm inclined to agree.  I'd be afraid--but you can't live your life in fear and you can't teach your kids to live their lives in fear.  Random acts of violence like this are rare and it's best to just live life as normal as possible.  Sadly, it always has to be a fear in the back of our minds now (same as getting into a major car accident anytime you drive), but it's nonsensical to base anything else in your life around it.EDIT:I actually intend to be a parent one day.  And I can't even fathom the loss these parents are feeling right now, however, you take just as much as a risk getting in your car every day as you do sending your kids to school.  It's a rare occurrence and unlikely to happen--but when it does happen no one expects it.The homeschooling thing is a short sighted, knee-jerk response.  Proven fact is that kids who are homeschooled don't learn the social skills they need later in life.  And it's generally more of a risk to fly on an airplane once a year than go to school everyday.permalinksaveparent[+]thatsboxy 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago (5 children)[]thatsboxy 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours agoI agree with all of this 100%. My mom wanted to pull me out of school when 9/12 happened. I was almost 17 at the time. When i finally got home did she talk to me about it? No. Did she explain how she was feeling? No. There was no talking about it beyond "that's terrible." Well, ok... so i never talked about it but my mom cried for days.I was 17 and this still strikes me as odd. And i know a lot of parents are like my mom. This is too hard to talk about so we won't.Thank god i have a therapist. I will be emailing her.permalinksaveparent[+]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (4 children)[]TokiDokiHaato 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoYou know, my parents never talked to me about it either at the time.  But I was fine.  I was 13 and I got it.  I knew it was awful, I knew it was going to change the world forever, and I knew a lot of people had died and lost their loved ones.  At 13, I definitely understood it.  I remember not knowing entirely what a terrorist attack was--but that's mostly because I  never really had had such a thing occur in my lifetime that I remembered.  And then I knew.  I knew there were people that hated people so much they could do such an awful thing.  I still can't fathom the logic behind it, but I can understand how people's minds can be tricked and manipulated and so on as an adult.My parents never talked about it with me but honestly, I feel like it helped me as an adult in some ways.  I've learned now, how I can cope and deal with what life throws at me and how to bounce back from bad situations.  I've had a lot of shit go down in my life as a teen and I'm finally at a good point now where I've learned on my own healthy ways to deal with shit.  I probably needed a therapist too, tbh...so kudos to you for being proactive.  There's times where I wish I would have been in that regard but water under the bridge now lol.Best wishes to you :Dpermalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]psychicsword 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]psychicsword 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoIf I was one of the parents and the reporter came up to my kid I probably would have punched the right in the face. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
