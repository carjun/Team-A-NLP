I'd pull my kid out today and not let them go.... EVER!!! permalinksaveparent[+]greatbawlsofire 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]greatbawlsofire 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour agoWe continued to have classes during 9/11/2001. Some teachers allowed us to view the coverage. Obviously, those students whose parents pulled them from school that day were allowed to go. The irony for me is that my AP US History teacher opted to not turn on the TV and lectured. No, I have no clue what the lecture was about.permalinksaveparent[+]WorldofFire 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]WorldofFire 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour agoI suppose you are correct. However, 9/11 was not a local tragedy for most Americans. I would think the administrators would just call it a day for a local tragedy like this.permalinksaveparent[+]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)[]greatbawlsofire 1 point2 points3 points 59 minutes agoThat's kinda the point I was trying to make, while 9/11 was significant, but distant. We, the students, were not focused on the lessons presented to us after that news had been delivered. I can only imagine how a hometown tragedy such as this has captured everyone in the town. I also understand the need to keep children there if parents are unavailable to get their kids from school, I guess the "return to normalcy" is the intended effect there.permalinksaveparent[+]uuuuut 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]uuuuut 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes agoYeah, that's a brilliant idea.  OK kids, your parents aren't here to pick you up and the school busses aren't running but GTFO.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
