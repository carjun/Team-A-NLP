Well, we are contracted by the company and then go to whatever store our boss tells us and we stand by the counter and sell, so we aren't an employee of the store.I was helping this lady who was super sweet and purchasing over $9,000 worth of merchandise like it was nothing. I was grabbing some merchendise for her from my line when this other lady comes over to me.She says, "Can you get me these?" and she points to amagazine picture in her hand with some sunglasses that were from last season and we don't even carry them in the store.I tell her to wait one moment, and I'll be glad to order them, I just need to finish grabbing something for this other customer.The first lady is being sweet as can be and is very patient. The woman wanting the sunglesses? Not so much.She starts saying that she NEEDS the sunglasses "this instant" and how "rude" I am being to her. Technically, I'm not even supposed to help this women find her glasses, but it was like a wednesday and not many sales people were nearby, so I was going to go out of my way and help her. But as I'm searching for another coworker to take this lady off my hands, the sweet lady tells the woman, "Please, she is just going to grab one more thing for me and then she's all yours". The woman FREAKS the hell out and calls me and the sweet lady a peasant. PEASANT. SHE WAS BUYING $9,000 WORTH OF STUFF. While the other woman was looking for some $400 sunglasses from LAST SEASON.Augh. It was the worst. She went on for a minute and the manager hurried over only to tell the woman that they couldn't order the glasses anymore and should try online or some used ones from another store.That really made her happy I bet. permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday, my mom slipped on ice and broke her ankle. The person whose house she fell in front of came out and yelled at us when I came to help, saying I wasn't her son and how dare I use his driveway. Reddit, what moments have you had where you just thought, "What the fuck is wrong with you!?"  by  Locustsin  AskReddit[+]JurassicPFan 8 points9 points10 points 15 days ago (0 children)[]JurassicPFan 8 points9 points10 points 15 days agoI was on an Amtrak train to Miami when I was 17 and my brother was 14. We went alone to visit relatives. This man on the seats next to us started having a seizure. The lady who was sitting next to him(they didn't know eachother) just stands up and moves to an empty seat! Everyone is just ignoring the man.At the time, I wanted to become a doctor, so I had taken many first aid classes and was shadowing a doctor. A few weeks ago we had covered seizures, so I jump up and start helping the man, asking other people to get one of the employees. Everyone just pretends they didn't hear anything. I tell my little brother to run through the train and find someone. My brother comes back with a reluctant worker who is just shrugging his shoulders saying there isn't anything he can do. I am freaking out at this point, telling people "how can you just not do anything? Call an ambulance to be at the next stop!" (We were scheduled to stop at the next stop soon).He walks away to get what I hope is help. The seizing man wakes up, and he's confused. I ask him some questions and see if he can remember things and how he is feeling. More staff come and give him water and he ends up staying on the train, no one calls paramedics or anything.I was soooooo furious. This was over 5 years ago and I am still angry writing this. I have never ridden Amtrak again, and never will. Wish I would have reported this instance.
