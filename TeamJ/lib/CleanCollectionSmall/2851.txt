I took the class 4 times from sophomore to Senior year. I finally was given a C by a teacher who didn't want to be the one to tell me I couldn't graduate because he saw I worked so hard, so he asked me to do a project for him that was completely unrelated to math and graded me on that.The first half of the semester every time I would take geometry, I would ace every test, I had the neatest work, the most notes, and not one wrong answer, I was always the star pupil the first half of the text book. Get to that second half of the text book and that's it, I would stop understanding it. I really really tried to get it, I still am very upset with myself (Ten years later) that I would go from top of the class to bottom of the class with the turn of that one page, every time I retook the class. I just couldn't grasp it. Am I retarded?permalinksavecontextfull commentsReddit, what is the best piece of advice anyone ever gave you?  by  Rudmin  AskReddit[+]poo_smudge 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]poo_smudge 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoFear not growing old, for many are denied the privilege.permalinksavecontextfull commentsA stupid asshole excited for a natural disaster  by  chocolatebutterrin  facepalm[+]poo_smudge 10 points11 points12 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]poo_smudge 10 points11 points12 points 4 days agoAn eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Demetri Martin, AMA.  by  IAmDemetriMartinin  IAmA[+]poo_smudge 64 points65 points66 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]poo_smudge 64 points65 points66 points 6 days agoI requested your presence, also I am a lady :)see- http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/k6zat/iama_request_demetri_martin/permalinksavecontextfull commentsI used to be a Barista and was constantly yelled at by uninformed customers that their cappuccino's had "too much milk" and so on.
