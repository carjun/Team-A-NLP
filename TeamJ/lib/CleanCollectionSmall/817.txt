Just starting.  by  dummyacein  learnprogramming[+]pohatu 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]pohatu 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoGreat explanation. This tripped me up time and again back when I was starting. Especially coming from c where functions can just live on their own. Actually I was learning both at the same time and really confused myself with questions about when I should just have static methods, when they should instead be part of a class. As it turns out this is both a simple and a complex question. The simple rule is that if the "function" can do stuff without needing data that is specific to an object, then it can be a static method. The complex side of it is that you don't need anything to be an object, everything can be passed as parameters. This really sucks to think about. This is a design issue with Java that other languages don't have in the same way - or worse, so it makes me feel a little better that it really can be a complicated matter if you think too hard about it.The other thing that tripped me up about this wad that you can instantiate an object from a class and then call a static method off that object with the object.staticmethod() name. It ends up doing class.staticmethod(), but it looks like it is doing object.staticmethod which makes you think you can modify the staticmethod static method access object variables, but you can't.http://www.leepoint.net/notes-java/flow/methods/50static-methods.htmlThis is a good overview I found.permalinksavecontextfull commentsIt took 12 years and 3 tours to Iraq but today i finally call myself a college graduate  by  nevadogin  pics[+]pohatu -1 points0 points1 point 3 hours ago (0 children)[]pohatu -1 points0 points1 point 3 hours agoCongrats.

Can you help me understand it?  by  sargentsnicklefritzin  askscience[+]pohatu -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]pohatu -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 day agoKudos to you. My good friend's gm had dementia and recently passed away. She wanted to be alone and had everything pre-arranged many year ago when she was still completely with-it. It killed me to see her in a nursing home instead of a family members home, but she wanted it that way. Though, to confess the absolute truth, she was in a great facility where they treated her well and took better care of her than her family could have. But still it was heartbreaking for my friend and shocking to me because my family is very much against that. But anyway, the point is, i guess, other than just me sharing thus with the internet because i haven't wanted to say anything, the point is that you are lucky to have had those moments with her. I met her gm many times when she was healthy and I'm honored for those moments, but i would have taken all the post-dementia moments too. I guess it wasn't my decision to make.When i get there someone better be willing to wreck their house/job/family for me, damnit!permalinksavecontextfull commentsHi AskScience, My grandfather held a patent regarding nuclear fission, he has Dementia now and I would like to be able to talk with him about it.

This is one of those things that once you know it and get it, it becomes not worth mentioning because it is clearly understood. But until then it is often unsaid (because everyone who knows it, understands it, and doesn't feel the need to explain it) so I want to thank you for stating it here where many people won't already know and understand it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am writing a program that scans through a list looking for pairs of words that differ by only one letter (without rearranging the letters), and prints those words out.  by  bbqhamsterin  learnprogramming[+]pohatu 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pohatu 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThanks! Very interesting read!permalinksavecontextfull commentsI am writing a program that scans through a list looking for pairs of words that differ by only one letter (without rearranging the letters), and prints those words out.  by  bbqhamsterin  learnprogramming[+]pohatu -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago*(0 children)[]pohatu -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago*This is interesting to me.Thinking about this some I realized that you probably want to sort, and you probably want a function to compare two strings and tell you the Levenshtein distance.But you also probably need to compare all combinations once you trim the list to 8.For example, using only lengths of 3 for simplicity, if you had the following:1. abc2. abb3. abdyou would need to compare 1 to 2, 1 to 3 and 2 to 3.Then would you report these as pairs? Or do all three of these fall into the same group?That is you could report all of these as being part of the same group:abc, abb, abd; 1 set of 3.or you could report them as being 3 pairs:abc,abb; abc,abd; abb,abd;Likewise if you had the following:1. abc2. bbc3. abdand you compared 1 to 2, 1 to 3 and 2 to 3 again, you'd get that 1 and 2 are one letter apart, 1 and 3 are 1 letter apart, but 2 and 3 are two letter apart and so now depending on your reporting scheme your output would maybe be different. If you followed the first pattern, you'd have two sets of two.abc,abd; abc,bbc;And if you followed the second pattern you'd have two pairs to report, but for different reasons.Etc.Follow? That part makes my head toggle back and forth a bunch when thinking about how to find all these.The other interesting thing is that unlike sorting where you can assume if a < b and b < c then a < c and avoid comparing a to c, you basically have to compare all combinations, but not all permutations.If you were to permute each string then you could have a dumber compare, but you have to spend work permuting the strings and keeping track of equivalency, but this might allow for some useful batch processing if operating on large sets in parallel. Rather than compare abc, abb, and abd, you would permute to have abc, bca, cababb, bba, bababd, bda, dab.Then you could compare the first two letters in each column to find matches. Or in the case of 8, the first 7. In the second example dataset it would look like this:abc, bca, cabbbc, bcb, cbbabd, bda, dabYou can see by looking that if looking at the first 2 letters, the first column matches rows 1 and 3 and the second column matches 1 and 2.Alternatively, if you naively compare all permutations in a nested loop you end up comparing:1 to 21 to 32 to 12 to 33 to 13 to 2Half of those have already been done and don't need to be done. So then you have to do something clever to avoid duplicating that effort.Very interesting problem. So simply stated and so much to think about. Even if this is your homework, thanks for sharing, there's a lot to mull over here.(sorry if this isn't readable, I'm kinda writing as I think more so I'll remember to come back and think about this more later than I am for you, the reader. But hopefully it will be more good than harm even if the formatting is shit.)permalinksavecontextfull commentsUniversity of Texas professor resigns after review finds numerous errors, conflict of interest in hydraulic fracking study  by  mareacaspicain  science[+]pohatu 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]pohatu 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoThat's economics for you. If it's easier and/or cheaper to do it one way than to do it the other way, the cheaper way will be preferred. If not by the producer than by the consumer when the one that was cheaper to produce is sold at a lower price. That's why it is often necessary for government to impose regulations for things such as public and worker safety and environmental protection. There is not enough market incentive for these things.permalinksavecontextfull comments"If you want to get a job at the very best law firm, investment bank, or consultancy, heres what you do: 1.

Imagine a bunch of super bright spot lights/strobe lights to blind and disorient, a bunch of pop-up spray-paint canons, maybe a sprinkler system or something too, all motion activated. The would-be tagger approaches the wall and trips the motion detector. Suddenly bright ass flash-bangs go off, a sprinkler system hoses him down from behind while a permanent-tracking uv-ink thing pops up and blasts him from behind the fence in the face. He'll walk around covered in ink for a few days and be easily identified as the guy who got owned by the wall.
