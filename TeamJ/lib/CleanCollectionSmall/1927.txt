They peddle fear, hate and paranoia, preying on the emotions of people to get a couple points up in the ratings. Television news has become a parody of itself and is continuing to spiral deeper and deeper in this fucked up direction.permalinksaveparent[+]gaen 21 points22 points23 points 23 hours ago (9 children)[]gaen 21 points22 points23 points 23 hours agohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Laundry_%28Don_Henley_song%29I think your sentiment has been around for quite a while.permalinksaveparent[+]Drellion 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (4 children)[]Drellion 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoI agree. But people do need to know that this kind of stuff happened. It's the double edged sword of information.permalinksaveparent[+]AmonFowler 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours ago (3 children)[]AmonFowler 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours agoTelling people around the country makes the shooter famous, and this gives mass shootings prestige in the minds of people who are capable of killing with joy and without remorse. So no, people across the country don't need to know.permalinksaveparent[+]Drellion 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago*(2 children)[]Drellion 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago*I feel your sentiment, but should we cover this up and pretend it didn't happen? I'm not certain which is the lesser of evils, informed or uninformed. I agree it serves the function you describe, I'm genuinely not sure what is best in this terrible situation.Edit: All that stuff about how it is presented and how the media handles it is spot on, though. They shouldn't play it up to the point where it is entertainment. That's sick.permalinksaveparent[+]AmonFowler 5 points6 points7 points 21 hours ago*(1 child)[]AmonFowler 5 points6 points7 points 21 hours ago*People should know, it's the way that they should know that's important. The story should be local, not national. The news should show the facts, and avoid making it a human interest piece. And the news should avoid talking about the killer, because this gives others with homicidal tendencies a template for who they can act like if they want to become famous. Edit: You're right, we shouldn't pretend it didn't happen. Sorry that it sounded like that's was I was saying.permalinksaveparent[+]Drellion 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Drellion 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoUp votes for agreementspermalinksaveparent[+]pilesofwater -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (0 children)[]pilesofwater -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoIt's quite dastardly permalinksaveparent[+]Dfnoboy 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Dfnoboy 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoI had no idea what this song was about, having only heard it on the radio.

People won't watch unless the news promises some crazy hyperbole (Worst storm ever!) or heartbreaking interviews (Man killed in car crash, watch as we break the news to her LIVE).permalinksaveparent[+]FalconHunter 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]FalconHunter 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago(Former) Journalist here:I can appreciate that you disagree with the news, but you have to remember that the news is just reporting the facts. And, when I say the news, I don't mean FOX News Channel (National, not local), MSNBC, or even CNN. I'm referring to your local broadcast stations that have much more of a responsibility to their local communities. They peddle fear, hate and paranoia, preying on the emotions of people to get a couple points up in the ratings.And this is the telling line. It's clear you don't watch local broadcast news. If you actually do, you're already heavily biased going in to any particular broadcast. That's fine. You're not the target market (P25-54) and your priorities aren't the same. Broadcast news seeks to educate and inform with every story. If you feel that there is editorializing, then you owe it to yourself to review multiple sources to determine all of the facts. Most markets have 3-4 TV broadcast outlets. Even if one or two are out to misinform, the others will call them on their bullshit and make a story out of it. It's an inherent system of checks and balances.permalinksaveparent[+]DorkJedi -1 points0 points1 point 17 hours ago (1 child)[]DorkJedi -1 points0 points1 point 17 hours agoAnd then you see the name Murdoch on the ownership of every goddamn one of them.permalinksaveparent[+]FalconHunter 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]FalconHunter 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoThe number of News Corp owned outlets in local markets is relatively small. Before you make this statement, I would advise you to visit the station's homepage and check who the owner is. Just because it has a Fox logo it doesn't mean that it's an O&Opermalinksaveparent[+]Doctor_of_Recreation 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (0 children)[]Doctor_of_Recreation 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours agoI feel like stuff like this needs to be addressed more.  This is the biggest thing that I've taken out of this disaster.I mean, naming the wrong killer?  I have absolutely no doubt that they got a name and released it, without even looking into it the slightest.  Is that good journalism?  Not a single person would say it was and mean it.  Interviewing a third grader about her experience in a fucking mass murder and airing it across the country?  FFS.permalinksaveparent[+]thebloodygrinch 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]thebloodygrinch 0 points1 point2 points 18 hours agoI agree with this.  I had a family tragedy that made the news for a couple of weeks.  We made it a point to avoid the media.  Basically we told them to fuck off when approached in public about it.  They took to parking a truck in front of our house.  Luckily, we had a family friend that would go outside and tell them to leave.  That was awful.  I think about it every time I see a tragedy like this unfold in the media.  They are (mostly) scum.permalinksaveparent[+]SpanishMarsupial 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]SpanishMarsupial 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoNo doubt, it's a shame most media doesn't even report news as news anymore. It's all manipulated to stir up paranoia, fear, and hate in people. Not to mention the fact that most news in the mass media is extremely negative. There's sometimes a lot of good news, but most of the time all you hear is the bad news. permalinksaveparent[+]jesuz 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]jesuz 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoThey did the same thing decades ago.
