When that student learned of the post and confronted Torres, he admitted writing it as a joke, police said.Torres was being held on a $75,000 bond. A search of his home did not recover any firearms, police said.Police say 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed his mother, Nancy, at her home on Friday before shooting his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and opening fire on students and teachers. He shot himself to death following the rampage, authorities say.(Additional reporting by Barbara Goldberg and Laura Zuckerman; Writing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Eric Beech)U.S.Tweet thisLink thisShare thisDigg thisEmailReprintsComments (0)This discussion is now closed.
