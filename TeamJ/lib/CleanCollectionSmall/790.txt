Lots of examples of that particular tactlessness over the years, it's a big reason why I don't watch live TV news anymore. Edit - maybe this is a good time to start a writing campaign to all the news stations asking them to rein in their reporters from asking these types of questions.  The incident that did it for me was the Waco massacre.  A reporter was with David Koresh's mom and they were watching their compound burning on the news.  The fucking reporter asked "what are you feeling right now as you watch this?"  DK's mom just looked at her like she was insane and said "Those are my grandchildren..."  I turned it off at that point, don't know if the reporter got booted out or not.  I think crap like this is why so many people cheer at the reporter getting punched in the die hard movies. permalinksaveparent[+]cadex 192 points193 points194 points 1 day ago (14 children)[]cadex 192 points193 points194 points 1 day agoOver here in the uk a 7 year old girl went missing. When they finally called off the search a reporter for Sky news broke that news live on tv to a volunteer who was searching for the kid, then asked how she felt. As you can imagine she started crying. Scum.permalinksaveparent[+]TrolleyPower 42 points43 points44 points 23 hours ago (4 children)[]TrolleyPower 42 points43 points44 points 23 hours agoEven worse was the Millie Dowler case, when a journalist deleted messages off a missing 11 year old girls phone.

There's someone above them telling them to talk to kids, get reactions. And they're doing it because that's the way media works these days. There will be some good, respectful reporting on this shooting after the fact, but you won't get it from the 24 hour news cycle. permalinksaveparent[+]omgisthatyou 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]omgisthatyou 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoAt some point the journalist holding the microphone has to decide if the questions he's asking are invasive and make a stand against it. You can't always place the blame on the higher-ups who dole out the orders and paychecks. If the bosses aren't going to change things, the you have to change things.permalinksaveparent[+]imaybemeesh 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]imaybemeesh 3 points4 points5 points 22 hours agoWhen you're job is on the line, it's not always possible to make the admirable choice. I mean, I agree with you wholeheartedly that the most noble thing to do would be to take a stand, but I'm not going to look poorly on journalists who aren't in a position to make that decision. permalinksaveparent[+]Dog-Modernist 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Dog-Modernist 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoRight, turn your TV SETS OFF people. Seriously. There is NO need to watch TV news unless you're a lazy fuck. Find another source. Cut off the funding these sycophantic fucks are reaping off of the American public. TURN. IT. OFF.Or you're just another idiot contributing to the problem.permalinksaveparent[+]jhc1415 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago*(4 children)[]jhc1415 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago*They are some serious scumbags that do not seek anywhere close to the truth. Last year my school went through a series of bomb threats to the point where the local news show up. One day I was walking down the street and a reporter wanted to interview me. They asked some pretty biased questions like "Are you more angry or upset with how the situation is being handled." I thought the school was doing everything they could and had no problem with them. The only thing I was pissed about was the asshole making the threats. Clearly they didn't want my actual opinion of what was going on. All they wanted was for me to say something bad about the school so they could make it look like it was their fault. permalinksaveparent[+]KarmaAndLies 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]KarmaAndLies 2 points3 points4 points 23 hours agoAre you more angry or upset with how the situation is being handled?    Yes, I think the media has handled this situation terribly. Fearmongering and hyping up the story for the sake of their ratings.    It would never hit the air but boy would it be fun.   permalinksaveparent[+]Reesareesa 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago*(1 child)[]Reesareesa 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago*Pitt?I (went) there too. Got really annoying as time went on, to where it was what, like 12+ "threats" a day? Constant evacuations, all during finals, my friend lived in the quad and she was evacuated so much that she went and stayed with another friend off campus just so she could sleep...anyway, yeah, I had some shitty news reporters come up to me, asking me stupid questions like that, and I was like "...it impacts my view on how stupid kids are, but the school's just trying to keep us safe...". I don't think they aired my interview, obviously.Anyway, more importantly, my heart goes out to those affected by this tragedy. I have been appalled so much this year to the point where I can't think it could get any worse, but going into a school of elementary children...I can't even fathom what the families must be going through. There are no words strong enough right now.permalinksaveparent[+]jhc1415 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]jhc1415 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoYup. Why does it seem like everyone on reddit goes to Pitt? I see it mentioned fairly regularly on the front page.permalinksaveparent[+]mongoos3 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]mongoos3 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoI would have asked the question, "How do you feel everything is being handled regarding these bomb threats?"Reporters who ask questions beginning with "Are you" and "Do you" are often asking poor questions to assert a their truth rather than asking for your truth. Using questions beginning with who, what, why, when and how are more open-ended. And those questions will always get a longer, more thought out and honest response than close-ended ones.That being said, the former question starters are good for confirming information after a latter question has been asked.permalinksaveparent[+]joeanon 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]joeanon 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThe same stations that deliver live TV also right the articles you read online, FYI.permalinksaveparent[+]sirernestshackleton 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]sirernestshackleton 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThis original link is to a local TV station.permalinksaveparent[+]ZeroAntagonist -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours ago (0 children)[]ZeroAntagonist -1 points0 points1 point 23 hours agoI hate these scum. I'm watching local news (CT here) and it's just sickening. What goes through these people's heads? Is it really worth getting a quote to go National, by prying questions from children who are no doubt in a very fragile mental state now? Have a heart.

It's their call, not the reporters. As any broadcast journalist will tell you - the worst possible dispatch from your Assignment Desk about a story like this is "producer wants you to get sound."

A reporter does an interview similar to this, asking worse and worse question until the interviewed starts crying. Then the reporter does the victory sign and ends the interview.permalinksaveparent[+]TheSaccAttack 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (3 children)[]TheSaccAttack 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agohonestly, i blame the parents more, take your kids away and go home, dont just stand there talking to the news permalinksaveparent[+]incognitaX 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (1 child)[]incognitaX 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoYou don't think they're there waiting for news about their friends or other family?  The reporters are responsible for the questions they ask, not the parents.  The parents (or adults responsible for the kids) can tell the reporter to fuck off, however. permalinksaveparent[+]TheSaccAttack 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]TheSaccAttack 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agothe parents can easily say "no" to a reporter, the reporters arent going to attack the parents or the kid to get an opinion permalinksaveparent[+]blahblahblahdkjdfgj 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]blahblahblahdkjdfgj 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoReports indicate that the families were held there for a while by the police to see who was accounted for and who was missing.

They had him pull $500 from an ATM. When they got him back in the car, they tried strangling him. I guess it didn't work, because afterwards, they took him to an abandoned building, poured gasoline over him, and lot him on fire. The guy took of his clothes, and rolled around on the floor, and extinguished the flames. The four the proceeded to hit him with rocks and clubs, until he died. One "news" program reporter came to the stupid conclusion that he had it coming, because since one of the individuals was a known prostitute, he was probably driving around in seedy parts of the town, looking for trouble. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
