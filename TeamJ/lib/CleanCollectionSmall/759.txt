Especially since the seasons are quite long now and there is a lot of  jet-setting involved.To bring it up to the full 26 however, I would prefer to see full customer teams allowed, with strict rules so that front end teams don't end up using them as testbeds for parts and chassis ideas.  Or even regional customer teams, who buy the ability to run a chassis and race only in the races in their region [not sure this is cost effective to do], but it would give more drivers the shot at impressing in an F1 seat.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBernie Ecclestone says Formula 1 still has too many teams  by  iheartteam5in  formula1[+]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoToo many cars, and smaller tracks like Interlagos will likely fall off the calendar, since there would be a constant stream of cars and backmarkers mid-race.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow does CS 1.6 still have such a large player base?!  by  LaZ3Rin  gaming[+]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoIf you want to get into FM 2013 - try the "Classic mode" in it.  It simplifies a lot of things from the full fat version of the game, and I would reccomend it to someone starting out.  Also, stick to a league that is somewhat simple to manage and doesn't have 'odd' rules, so something like France, Germany or England are good places to start. [for this reason - avoid the Italian league (co-ownership), MLS (I don't understand the draft and Adidas player thing at all), Spain (mandatory Minimum Transfer Fee clause, although Athletic Bilbao is 'interesting' - as you can only sign players of Basque descent)]Match views are a thing of preference but I stick in 2D all the time, there's something soothing about the small blobs running around that I prefer over the 3D view.If you want to have a go - send me a PM with any questions, I'd be happy to try and help!permalinksavecontextfull commentsGabe Newell says Steam Box is a go: Valve will compete in console war  by  osama-bin-dadain  gaming[+]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoGiven a choice, I would personally go for a mouse over a gamepad controller.permalinksavecontextfull commentsGabe Newell says Steam Box is a go: Valve will compete in console war  by  osama-bin-dadain  gaming[+]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoI disagree about a controller being key for car based things; for racing sims, mouse steering is incredible once you get the hang of it.  Its almost-analogue control for people who can't afford the high end wheels - and some 'mousers' can be incredibly fast.  Its just a shame that its not as well supported in games as it used to be.  Heck - there are people who pull incredible times in LFS using the keyboard only.  I'm currently playing F1 2012 with the 360 controller, and the small things that annoy me is that I would have far more control with a mouse - had codemasters deigned to support it, compared to the never quite right feeling of the controller.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe most under-rated game of 2012?  by  bumblebeesscaremein  Games[+]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoReal Time Strategy is usually used to mean games such as Age of Empires, Red Alert, Dune, Red Alert, Starcraft - games where you build a base and can potentially produce infinite.  The strategy of the base build order is more the order of the day - IMOWargame:EE is real time tactics, because you are fighting a battle with a limited number of units and no base building, much like the battle maps in the total war series, which also fit under real time tactics - another example is probably the close combat series.  The defining feature of these games is that whilst you are ordering units around the map in a similar way to the RTS games. The game itself behaves more like an abstracted wargame, in which turns are continuously ticking over.  In these games, the concept of flanking is more pronounced - weaker side armour, morale damage etc...But Wargame is close to being the GOTY for me - close to 700 hours since release, and I'm still loving the game.  The fact that the developers are nice and are a bit more "old school" helps too.permalinksavecontextfull commentsChaps, I feel like we need our own network of subreddits...  by  HarryBlessKnappin  unitedkingdom[+]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoI'm not too familiar with those parts of the UK, so please forgive my ignorance!permalinksavecontextfull comments10444546Dorset (imgur.com)submitted 6 days ago by chimpyang to britpics1 commentsharecancelloading...Chaps, I feel like we need our own network of subreddits...  by  HarryBlessKnappin  unitedkingdom[+]chimpyang 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoI'm going to add support for the following names for a pub theme'd subreddit:The Queen's HeadThe Red LionI am almost willing to bet that some version of those 2 names can be found in most places in the UKAlso - something a bit more Reddit-y - The Upvote Armspermalinksavecontextfull commentsVS Assault Rifles  by  sloo_monsterin  TestOutfit[+]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 6 days agoThe base medic gun does fine for me, I've got the 4x, 1x Reflex and NV scopes for it, and it covers me through most situations.

You bet that there'll be a lot of horse trading and deal making along with this, even with blocs of brinksmanship and political bluffing involved.  This is politics after all.Also, whilst it is quite a bit about the main actors in this production, there will be a lot of regionalised to and fro between all of the countries within the vote.  Hypothetical examples: Would China buy off some developing countries to vote no against an "independence movement" with trade deals and structural aid?  Would the UK use its support for the No vote to gain leverage and kudos within the "special relationship"?permalinksavecontextfull commentsFormula 1 - Brazilian Grand Prix 2012 | Race Discussion  by  Icanhazcommentin  formula1[+]chimpyang 2 points3 points4 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 2 points3 points4 points 20 days agoSee you for pre-season next year!permalinksavecontextfull commentsFormula 1 - Brazilian Grand Prix 2012 | Race Discussion  by  Icanhazcommentin  formula1[+]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 20 days ago (0 children)[]chimpyang 0 points1 point2 points 20 days ago"You make your own luck"permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
