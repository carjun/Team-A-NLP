In the class it's a mix between panic and calmness. Half of the kids half siblings in that school, so they're rightfully freaking out. permalinksaveparent[+]itsokimaplumber 25 points26 points27 points 2 hours ago (13 children)[]itsokimaplumber 25 points26 points27 points 2 hours agoThe "tune in radio" app has local emergency band  scanners.  Something like that may help try to stay informed. permalinksaveparent[+]revile221 16 points17 points18 points 2 hours ago (5 children)[]revile221 16 points17 points18 points 2 hours agoAlso Scanner RadioTune-In Radio linkpermalinksaveparent[+]itsokimaplumber 9 points10 points11 points 2 hours ago (4 children)[]itsokimaplumber 9 points10 points11 points 2 hours agoThanks, I've never heard of scanner radio and I'm lazy, old, and not tech savvy enough to format a link  on an iPhone. permalinksaveparent[+]revile221 6 points7 points8 points 2 hours ago (3 children)[]revile221 6 points7 points8 points 2 hours agoNo worries m8, I'm at a PC so it's far easier. It was a really good idea to mention a scanner app to the OC- good on you sir. permalinksaveparent[+]itsokimaplumber 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (2 children)[]itsokimaplumber 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours agoTo be fair, it's a good radio and podcast app too. I can't imagine sitting there clueless and worrying and while In situations like that ideas don't flow freely, and one cant think of everything, so Hopefully I'm  being helpful. permalinksaveparent[+]Bitter_Britches 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago (1 child)[]Bitter_Britches 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours agoSuper helpful!

Weird...permalinksaveparent[+]Cmb1895 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago (3 children)[]Cmb1895 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour agoThe police is encrypting some of the radio transmissions. permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (2 children)[]Savioritis 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoThat's what I figured. Man, if only there was some way to get through that... I understand it's for our safety though, because the shooter who's still on the loose could be listening in as easily as we are.permalinksaveparent[+]Cmb1895 1 point2 points3 points 40 minutes ago (1 child)[]Cmb1895 1 point2 points3 points 40 minutes agoExactly. We can get the gist of what's going on though. The encrypted audio is most likely just specific names and locations. permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 33 minutes ago (0 children)[]Savioritis 0 points1 point2 points 33 minutes agoI heard that the guy patrolling River Road found nothing and is heading back to the school...
