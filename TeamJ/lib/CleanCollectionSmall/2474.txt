That doesn't seem completely necessary. I'd also like to know why the US has so many more school killings than the rest of the world. Not sure I know the answer, but it is interesting.edit: and why this gun is legal.permalinksaveparent[+]MakesShittyAnalogies 7 points8 points9 points 35 minutes ago*(5 children)[]MakesShittyAnalogies 7 points8 points9 points 35 minutes ago*We don't. We just get the most press about them. In China, school stabbings are rampant.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_attacks_in_China_(2010%E2%80%932011)Also, that gun only shoots as frequently as a semi-auto pistol. Assault rifles in the United States are for aesthetics only.permalinksaveparent[+]Sieziggy 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes ago (4 children)[]Sieziggy 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes agoIt's much harder to kill 28 people with a knife than it is with an assault rifle. permalinksaveparent[+]MakesShittyAnalogies 1 point2 points3 points 16 minutes ago (3 children)[]MakesShittyAnalogies 1 point2 points3 points 16 minutes agoWell yes, it is. But a ban on guns (Assault rifles in the US are semi-automatic, by the way) will drive crimes like this towards easier targets and not necessarily stop the crimes. There's a reason that the stabbings in China take place in elementary schools. The casualty counts are still high.permalinksaveparent[+]Sieziggy 1 point2 points3 points 11 minutes ago (2 children)[]Sieziggy 1 point2 points3 points 11 minutes agoAn isolated stabbing is still far less damaging than a mass shooting. A mentally unstable individual who is intent on hurting someone for whatever reason will find the best suited tool. If you take the most potent tools away their options and potential harm are reduced. permalinksaveparent[+]MakesShittyAnalogies -1 points0 points1 point 8 minutes ago (1 child)[]MakesShittyAnalogies -1 points0 points1 point 8 minutes agoBut the data just doesn't support that. These aren't isolated incidents. As much as I wish it was as easy as banning guns (which will never happen, America has too many guns in circulation and a much too conservative voter-base) to stop massacres, it wont happen - people will switch to knives or bombs and choose different, easier targets.Many of the stabbings I have mentioned have >15 casualties. It's just not a simple problem to solve. It probably looks like I'm super conservative here, but I'm really not. I just think the most obvious answer here might not be the best one.permalinksaveparent[+]Sieziggy 1 point2 points3 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]Sieziggy 1 point2 points3 points 2 minutes agoIt's obviously still a problem but can you really make the case that it's somehow worse than if any of those stabbers had a gun instead? Obviously we should be doing our best to ensure that no weapons enter our schools but not all weapons should be considered equal. Any countermeasure you would implement for guns, say moderately armed security guards or police patrols, would be even more effective against someone wielding a knife. permalinksaveparent[+]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes ago (1 child)[]HeroicGomez 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes agoWe could also talk about why a 24 year old felt he needed to get 4 guns and a bullet proof vest.permalinksaveparent[+]possiblyFibbing 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]possiblyFibbing 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoHobbyist? I have 6 myself, for hunting, protection, and range shooting. No vest though. Obviously he had other intentions. permalinksaveparent[+]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)[]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes agoWhat, should we have a "two guns per citizen" cap? Is he allowed more guns once he hits thirty?permalinksaveparent[+]its_your_their 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes ago (0 children)[]its_your_their 0 points1 point2 points 15 minutes agoI forgot that humans are only capable of having one conversation at a time. We can talk gun control and mental health reform at the same time.permalinksaveparent[+]treedick2011 3 points4 points5 points 53 minutes ago (6 children)[]treedick2011 3 points4 points5 points 53 minutes agoI'm all for a debate about safety. However, blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd. I am glad to talk about how it was allowed to happen, and what steps can be taken to prevent it. First off, we MUST recognize that "gun free zones" are simply the target of choice for these people. What can be done about this?Either we do away with gun free zones, or we start stationing police at every soft target such as elementary schools, movie theaters, and any where people can congregate. Next is the WHY are they doing this? Gun laws haven't changed dramatically in the past 10 years, but these shootings are on the rise? There are a myriad of reasons, and it always revolve around mental illness. I am glad to discuss means of deterrence and prevention, but gun control will be as effective as the drug war. So please, let us have a discussion.permalinksaveparent[+]its_your_their 1 point2 points3 points 16 minutes ago (2 children)[]its_your_their 1 point2 points3 points 16 minutes agoI'm all for a debate about safety. However, blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd.That's interesting because nuclear bombs, chemical weapons, and mines are all inanimate objects which 1. we are all glad are not things you can purchase at Walmart and 2. we work hard to stop the use and proliferation of.So, just saying that a thing is an inanimate object and thus shouldn't be regulated, is itself absurd.permalinksaveparent[+]treedick2011 2 points3 points4 points 6 minutes ago (1 child)[]treedick2011 2 points3 points4 points 6 minutes agoThis is false equivalency. These items would cost (for nuclear bombs) Billions of dollars. Chemical weapons would be absurdly expensive as well. They simply wouldn't be available to the general public.permalinksaveparent[+]its_your_their 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]its_your_their 0 points1 point2 points 2 minutes agoTheir cost is completely irrelevant. Are they inanimate objects? Yes. Are they highly regulated? Yes. If those two things are true, then "blaming an inanimate object and suggesting more control would have changed anything is absurd." is false. Unless you believe that those things shouldn't be regulated at all, in which case you are actually clinically insane. That's as simple as I can get.Also, chemical weapons aren't prohibitively expensive. You can make mustard gas in your garage. And landmines? Developing nations use landmines, so those aren't cost-prohibitive either. But, like I said, cost is irrelevant to the idea that inanimate objects shouldn't be regulated.permalinksaveparent[+]ForRealsies 2 points3 points4 points 30 minutes ago (1 child)[]ForRealsies 2 points3 points4 points 30 minutes agoNext is the WHY are they doing this?There is no why or reason for acts like this. You can't deal with it logically. I'd even argue that you can't deal with this legally. Throw all those crazy fuckers away to rot in jail.permalinksaveparent[+]petedog 2 points3 points4 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)[]petedog 2 points3 points4 points 5 minutes agoThe mindset of wanting to "throw all those crazy fuckers away to rot in jail" is part of what leads to events like this. I think a society that is nurturing and understanding of those with mental illnesses would more often than not avoid mass murders like this. Do you think these men felt understood by society? Or do you think they were lashing out at a system that has no place for them? permalinksaveparent[+]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 4 minutes ago (0 children)[]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 4 minutes agoAre these shootings really on the rise? Certainly, we're seeing quite a few. However, I'd like to see an actual study on it; are the numbers on the rise, or are we simply more aware of them?permalinksaveparent[+]gunsandthings 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes ago (5 children)[]gunsandthings 1 point2 points3 points 39 minutes agoI'm biased here I admit but u can't tell me SNF halftime was the time to start a 2nd Amendment debate?permalinksaveparent[+]chargerland 2 points3 points4 points 35 minutes ago (2 children)[]chargerland 2 points3 points4 points 35 minutes agoI can see why it annoyed people, but it did start a conversation so it was somewhat effective. I think no matter what, people will argue that it is too soon to talk about gun control or that the venue isn't the right one.permalinksaveparent[+]gunsandthings 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes ago (0 children)[]gunsandthings 1 point2 points3 points 12 minutes agoI just don't think it was the place to do it. Just my opinion. I think if he freely cared about the topic he would devote more energy into his cause but sadly I assume once the hype settles he will do nothing about his convictions. permalinksaveparent[+]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]dyslexda 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoYou don't use your position as an entertainer to hold your audience hostage to your views. That'd be like me starting a discussion on abortion during a commencement ceremony. The discussion should be had, but not in that venue.permalinksaveparent[+]TrueSol 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes ago (1 child)[]TrueSol 0 points1 point2 points 27 minutes agoOf course it is, it was a fucking football player that did the shooting. If no one else is going to talk about it he absolutely has the right to do so.You don't have to agree with what he was saying but it's his right to say it in the national theater -- no one else is.permalinksaveparent[+]gunsandthings -1 points0 points1 point 13 minutes ago (0 children)[]gunsandthings -1 points0 points1 point 13 minutes agoWhere is his bleeding heart for the cause now? I don't see him actively talking with legislature on rectifying this issue to how he sees fit? He is no longer a poster child for the cause. He had an opinion on a frantic topic and got up on his soap box for 2 minutes and washed his hands of the topic until something else comes up that he doesn't agree with. permalinksaveparent[+]nixonrichard -4 points-3 points-2 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)[]nixonrichard -4 points-3 points-2 points 59 minutes agoRight, but Bob Costas didn't want a conversation about violence.  Violence is how Bob Costas makes millions.  He depends on violence.He wanted to talk about guns.  Which is fine, but we've been talking about that for decades.  It's not that we don't talk about guns, it's that Bob Costas and others don't like where that conversation went.permalinksaveparent[+]wendysNO1wcheese -1 points0 points1 point 23 minutes ago (0 children)[]wendysNO1wcheese -1 points0 points1 point 23 minutes agoThat crime had more to do with domestic violence than it had to do with gun laws. Costas didn't see that. He had an agenda and used the wrong time to push it. Liberals, instead of being mad at the gunman, get mad at pro-gun people. It's sad. BOTH sides of the spectrum don't want to have a conversation. They stick their fingers in their ears and throw shit up.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
