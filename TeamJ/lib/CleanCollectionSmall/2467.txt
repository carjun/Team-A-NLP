Also if you notice he's a lot less whiny by that point and when he does confront Don(the NAA contract episode) he's right to call Don out. Don realizes it which is why he can't come up with a good argument to his point and just tells him to cut it off.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe only time I ever felt sorry for Pete Campbell.  by  xboxmercedescambodiain  madmen[+]thejerg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]thejerg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI know why I feel more sympathy for Pete than Betty. Pete has worked his tail off to get where he is, despite the lack of help he got from his parents(other than "your name") and coworkers at times. Don hasn't always trusted him and despite that Pete stuck by him(I loved how he handled Duck) and at times has even helped him keep secrets. Betty was handed everything and wasn't happy. Yes, Don should have been more present, but Betty really didn't have any proof Don was cheating, but she treated him horribly even after she found out the truth and that he wanted to reconcile.No one on the show is perfect but Pete is an example of someone who works at the relationships he has and Betty is an example of someone who takes and never gives anything in return. Also Pete feels legitimate remorse over a lot of his actions. Unlike Betty. She only sees her own feelings. When the other characters say she acts like a child, that's what they're refering to. She never considers the other people. It's always about her.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe only time I ever felt sorry for Pete Campbell.  by  xboxmercedescambodiain  madmen[+]thejerg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]thejerg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoBy the time you get to the middle of season 4 your opinions of a lot of people will change.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI loved this shot from the Season 5 Finale; The 5 Partners.  by  OneFriscyPandain  madmen[+]thejerg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]thejerg 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoUmm, I would think that's kind of obvious(if intentional).

The only criticism people had was their size. They did everythign else well. If you aren't a good quarterback, you aren't a good quarterback, but that's true of many tall players too. But this guy is a college freshman and we're already concerned about his size? A lot of teams are kicking themselves right now for not selecting Wilson(some of those teams passed him up 3 times). If he comes out in the draft I hope teams are evaluating him for his ability to play the quarterback position and not whether he's tall enough to see over his linemen. permalinksavecontextfull commentsSo....anyone know the last time that the Browns were the only team in the AFC North to get a win?  by  lereddituser7575in  nfl[+]thejerg 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]thejerg 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoThe point still stands. Everyone bagged these guys coming out because of their size. Hasn't stopped either from being good quarterbacks. If the only thing you can say about him is "He's too short," then you're being ingnorant to the fact that there are players who have been successful at or just under 6 feet.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
