She sat stone faced through dinner and went to bed early tonight. Tomorrow is family holiday cookie making day, I hope it makes things a little better. The reality is she must think about this shit every day. I plan to hug her a lot tomorrow.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]IdiotBastard 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours ago (0 children)[]IdiotBastard 0 points1 point2 points 12 hours agoThey interviewed the teacher tonight on ABC News and she said some kids were starting to cry and saying those things and that they just wanted their mom to hug them. Shit, I'm tearing up typing this. Hers was the first classroom in the hall he entered. She wanted them to know they were loved so she told them all she loved them very much and it would be okay. Teachers are trained to try to keep the kids calm and quiet, but she also wanted their last memory to be that they were loved. She was certain they were going to die because of where her classroom was located.I also heard that in the gym, the Phys Ed teachers gathered classes in the corners of the gym and then held themselves as human shields around them in case he entered the gym firing.These folks are straight up goddamn heroes by every stretch of the imagination.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Don't rule out the crazy in November! Every vote will count.  by  IdiotBastardin  politics[+]IdiotBastard 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]IdiotBastard 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoExiting Best Buy yesterday, a little old lady approached me and handed me a Mitt Romney flyer. She asked me if I was registered to vote and would be doing so for Romney. I handed it back. She told me Romney and Santorum both made her cry during the convention and that Mitt Romney was like "Captain America", here to save the U.S. from evil. I told her I thought he was more likely "Captain Reverse Robin Hood", here to steal from the middle and poor to line the coffers of the elite. She frowned and told me she wishes more youth today would see Mitt for what he is, a hero. I'm 43, by the way. Young whipper-snapper.When I went to leave she asked a couple other people questions and gave them a flyer. I became curious what that thing actually said. (See image) I asked her if she was representing the Republican party? No. Affiliated with any political faction? I support the tea party Oh! Looking at the (crazy) flyer I asked if she was out campaigning of her own accord? Yes. I made this flyer myself because I believe we need Mitt to save the country and take back government. She then went on a rant about how government is killing the country and Romney would end all the waste. I asked if she was on Medicare. Of course! Mmm hmm.As I left she stared after me scribbling in a little notebook. I told my wife about the encounter, who thinks she probably wrote down my plate number. Wonder if I'll be removed from the roll for some reason?permalinksavecontextfull commentsRedirect residual traffic to site not on server to ad page: ethical?  by  IdiotBastardin  sysadmin[+]IdiotBastard[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)[]IdiotBastard[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoI asked him and he replied today he estimates in the hundreds.
