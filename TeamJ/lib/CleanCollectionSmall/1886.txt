Planting a bomb (or bombs) at the exact right spot(s), having the knowledge of building it and making it detonate so it provides maximum death toll makes it much harder for one deluded person to kill people than guns. Guns literally only take a tip of your finger. Even 2 year old children can do it, and have done, when they've found and played with a loaded gun. Guns were designed to kill and to kill only. So don't be surprised when guns end up killing people pretty efficiently.The problem is not guns alone or mental health care alone. It's the two combined, mentally sick not being able to get treatment and having millions of guns floating around the country and easy access to them.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

The "lap record" of Kimi Rikknen was done on grooved tyres and at the end of 46 lap stint where as Rossi ran on slicks (which are over a second faster compared to grooves) doing short qualifying runs aiming for the best possible time (says so in the article).The official lap record of Mugello is 1:18.704 done by Rubens Barrichello in 2004 so Rossi was over 3 seconds off.permalinksavecontextfull comments4163416351636When my co-worker pays for my coffee (qkme.me)submitted 6 days ago by Bosseking to AdviceAnimals313 commentssharecancelloading...I did a presentation on the Evolution of Formula One and I showed this clip.

You lost and your overwhelming ignorance of the subject was exposed. It's over. Yet you still decide to dig your hole deeper instead of just accepting that you had no idea what you were talking about. Also I highly doubt you have a master's degree in anything based on this "debate" (more like a slaughter tbh).permalinksavecontextfull commentsI just saw the interview with Ron Dennis post-USGP.

Of course this is all utter nonsense, Alonso costed the championship himself and so did Hamilton.permalinksavecontextfull commentsI just saw the interview with Ron Dennis post-USGP.
