She is the mother of a boy who shebelieves is not so different from the shooter and she lives in fear.I ponder whether America, in a metaphorical sense is, to a large degree, Adam Lanza?Lanza, dressed in military clothing, killed 20 elementary school children. When Clinton was president, his secretary of state, Madeline Albright, a representative of the American people, was questioned by Lesley Stahl on 60 minutes about the effect of US inspired sanctions on Iraq: We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, thats more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it? Secretary of State Albright calmly responded: I think this is a very hard choice, but the pricewe think the price is worth it.As the representative of the American people President Obama, not unlike his immediate predecessor in office, George W. Bush, has been waging horrendous wars in which hundreds of thousands have been killed, mostly civilians, including, of course, children. Alas, many of these children were the same age as those killed in Newtown. And President Obama claims he has the right to assassinate anybody he decides anywhere in the world and he has been very busy doing just that with drones and other sophisticated methods. The killing is routine.Our culture is one that glorifies violence. Examples making up this culture are so prominent that I need not even provide any to make the point.I had hope when I heard Obama over the radio, in his speech at Newtown, say in part:Ill use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens, fromlaw enforcement, to mental health professionals, to parents and educators, inan effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this, because what choice dowe have? We cant accept events like this as routine.So, today, I read the whole speech carefully but, alas, he was only speaking aboutAmerican children. So, I guess he will not use the power of his office in efforts toprevent more tragedies like the killing of 500,000 Iraqi children. I am sure theparents of those dead children continue to grieve just like we all do for the 20killed in Connecticut. Are non-American children any less valuable thanAmerican children? Is it moral, or even possible, to have a heart so cold that wecan kill children with reckless abandon overseas but at the same time protectchildren here?There is a lesson, I believe, in what Martin Luther King said on April 4, 1967when he publicly spoke out for the first time against the Vietnam War: we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a thing oriented society to a person oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.And I will add to Kings triplets that are incapable of being prevented without a revolution in values: alienation and dysfunction on a national scale.The woman who said she was Adam Lanzas mother is in fear. So should we all.But, if we choose to come together as a people and work for a revolution of valueswe can defeat the violence and dissipate our fears. Many Americans have beenengaged in working for this revolution. Many more are required. Let not thedeaths of the 500,000 Iraqi or the 20 in Connecticut be in vain. Lets honor thoseteachers and first responders who instinctively stepped into harms way toprotect the children in their schools by acting now and not when faced with ashooter when it may be too late. Lets engage in our schools, churches, prisons,work places and unions. If we the people lead, our elected representatives willsurely follow. They always have when enough people united and demanded thatthey do so.Sanford Kelsonis a lawyer in Pennsylvania.CounterpunchTells the Facts and Names the Names        Published since 1996          Copyright  CounterPunch    All rights reserved.counterpunch@counterpunch.orgMailing Address  CounterPunch  PO Box 228Petrolia, CA 95558Telephone  1(707) 629-3683 or  1(800) 840-3683 Editorial          Jeffrey St. Clair, editor            Joshua Frank, Managing Editor  Nathaniel St. Clair, Social Media          Alexander Cockburn, 1941-2012 Business          Becky Grant          Business Managerbeckyg@asis.com          Deva Wheeler          Subscription and merchandise fulfillmentcounterpunch@frontiernet.net Browse the ArchivesSelect Month  December 2012  November 2012  October 2012  September 2012  August 2012  July 2012  June 2012  May 2012  April 2012  March 2012  February 2012  January 2012  December 2011  November 2011  October 2011  September 2011  August 2011  July 2011  June 2011  May 2011  April 2011  March 2011  February 2011  January 2011  December 2010  November 2010  October 2010  September 2010  August 2010  July 2010  June 2010  May 2010  April 2010  March 2010  February 2010  January 2010  December 2009  November 2009  October 2009  September 2009  August 2009  July 2009  June 2009  May 2009  April 2009  March 2009  February 2009  January 2009  December 2008  November 2008  October 2008  September 2008  August 2008  July 2008  June 2008  May 2008  April 2008  March 2008  February 2008  January 2008  December 2007  November 2007  October 2007  September 2007  August 2007  July 2007  June 2007  May 2007  April 2007  March 2007  February 2007  January 2007  December 2006  November 2006  October 2006  September 2006  August 2006  July 2006  June 2006  May 2006  April 2006  March 2006  February 2006  January 2006  December 2005  November 2005  October 2005  September 2005  August 2005  July 2005  June 2005  May 2005  April 2005  March 2005  February 2005  January 2005  December 2004  November 2004  October 2004  September 2004  August 2004  July 2004  June 2004  May 2004  April 2004  March 2004  February 2004  January 2004  December 2003  November 2003  October 2003  September 2003  August 2003  July 2003  June 2003  May 2003  April 2003  March 2003  February 2003  January 2003  December 2002  November 2002  October 2002  September 2002  August 2002  July 2002  June 2002  May 2002  April 2002  March 2002  February 2002  January 2002  December 2001  November 2001  October 2001  September 2001  August 2001  July 2001  June 2001  May 2001  April 2001  March 2001  February 2001  January 2001  December 2000  November 2000  October 2000  September 2000  August 2000  July 2000  June 2000  May 2000  April 2000  March 2000  February 2000  January 2000  December 1999  November 1999  October 1999  September 1999  August 1999  July 1999  June 1999  May 1999  April 1999  February 1999  January 1999  September 1998  June 1998  February 1998  January 1998  February 1993  December 1983
