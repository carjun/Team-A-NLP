Anti-gun advocates do, by definition of their position, suggest abridging our constitutional rights.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour ago (1 child)[][deleted] -1 points0 points1 point 1 hour agoAnd as an anti gun advocate, I don't believe the 2nd amendment gives you the right to carry a gun to the grocery store.permalinksaveparent[+]montyjack 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]montyjack 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoAnd yet people do every day.  Usually in what we call flyover states.  Gun crime is largely a problem of urban centers.permalinksaveparent[+]palealepizza 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (19 children)[]palealepizza 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours agonot so much the NRA, the 2nd amendment gives them the power - there are very powerful lobbies like the NRA on the other side of the issue as well. And current gun laws are reasonable.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 hours ago (18 children)[][deleted] -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 hours agoYes, because the second amendment  applies to hand guns and semi-automatic weapons...And having the ability to carry a gun around is not reasonable.permalinksaveparent[+]palealepizza -1 points0 points1 point 2 hours ago (17 children)[]palealepizza -1 points0 points1 point 2 hours agoYes, because the second amendment applies to hand guns and semi-automatic weapons...correct, it does.And having the ability to carry a gun around is not reasonable.that is reasonable and if you're referring to conceal and carry, then there are already tons of legislation and "safe-guards" for getting one. some guy can't just go down to Wal-Mart and pick one up. the vast majority of these shootings involve guns that were illegally gotten/purchased and committed by people without a license to carry.permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 hours ago (16 children)[][deleted] -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 hours agoThe second amendment is irrelevant today. 2. Your safe guards don't make me feel any better about the dude next to me on the bus having a loaded gun.  Licensed or not, I don't want to be around someone with a gun.permalinksaveparent[+]palealepizza -1 points0 points1 point 2 hours ago (15 children)[]palealepizza -1 points0 points1 point 2 hours agothe dude next to me on the bus having a loaded gun. Licensed or not,that's against the law. the gun can't be loaded and the ammo must be stored separately from the firearm - you don't even know what the law is that you're against/upset with.And with the federal government more powerful than ever, the 2nd amendment is more relevant today than ever before.permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+][deleted] -2 points-1 points0 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[][deleted] -2 points-1 points0 points 3 hours agoAnd of course, don't say a thing if you're a politician. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
