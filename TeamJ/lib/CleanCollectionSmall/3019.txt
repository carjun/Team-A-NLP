Preventing the victims of a tragedy like this when they are but young children is hardly a step in the direction of Communist China. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

I imagine him walking into the bathroom and hearing the water running in the tub. None of the humans are home though. It can't be, he thinks. He promised the 3rd time was the last time.. Hopping on the ledge of the bath confirms his worst fear. Robert is attempting to take his 4th life. Jim - "Robert. Life isn't that bad. Give me your paw. We will talk this through."Robert - "Let me die in peace, Jim. I can't take it anymore."Jim - "I keep telling you that the woman said they were out of catnip. She's going to get some more tomorrow. Now give me your paw."Robert - "Take me away, sweet watery death."permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow to Seize a Moment  by  wisenwitty00in  funny[+]BrokenMasterpiece 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]BrokenMasterpiece 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThe shiny guy who stalks in the name of true love. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow to Seize a Moment  by  wisenwitty00in  funny[+]BrokenMasterpiece 16 points17 points18 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]BrokenMasterpiece 16 points17 points18 points 1 day agoYou've never been to a midnight showing of one of these moviespermalinksavecontextfull commentsHow to Seize a Moment  by  wisenwitty00in  funny[+]BrokenMasterpiece 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]BrokenMasterpiece 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoHe would have to be Edward  if he played the only character we would just end up in a civil war. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow to Seize a Moment  by  wisenwitty00in  funny[+]BrokenMasterpiece 202 points203 points204 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]BrokenMasterpiece 202 points203 points204 points 1 day agoIf we ever want to make change in our country we simply need to debut a new Harry Potter and Twilight movie back to back. As the masses and masses of people formed outside the theatre the main actors from the movies would get on a platform and pronounce "our government doesn't want you to see this film.

He would vow to stick out the struggle to save the animated world. Then after losing a series to the Muppets, Lebron would hold a 30 minute special on Cartoon Network. We would wait 27 minutes as an animated Marv Albert interviews him with fluff questions. Then after the final commercial break (which featured CROSSSFIRRREEE!) Lebron would announce that he was taking his talents to Moron Mountain and joining Techo Super Bowl Bo Jackson and NBA Jam Reggie Miller by signing with The Nerdlucks. permalinksavecontextfull commentsPerfect games for rage-quitters.
