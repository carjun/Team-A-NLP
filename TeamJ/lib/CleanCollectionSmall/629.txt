Not because of any parenting my wife and I have done. But because those were the gifts that were given to her by her heavenly father.He said Emilie was quick to console the grieving, always in possession of markers and paper with which to draw up a get-well card. One of these she placed in her grandfathers casket after he died several months ago. The oldest of three, she helped teach her sisters to read and make crafts, he said, and was almost like a third parent to them.They looked to her for comfort, he said.The family had been in Newtown only a short time. Eight months ago, Mr. Parker, his wife, Alyssa, and their daughters moved from Ogden, Utah, so that he could take a job as a physician assistant in the neonatal care unit at Danbury Hospital, he said.Mr. Parker said he did not regret the move, nor was he mad at the shooter, whom he described as acting under the free will that God gave him. He said that he and his family would in turn use their own free will and use the tragedy to help others.Let us not turn this into something that defines us, but something that allows us to be more companionate, he said.He thanked his friends for setting up a tribute page and memorial fund for his daughter on Facebook.And though clearly overcome with his own emotions, he offered his condolences to all the families affected by the tragedy, saying his familys hearts and prayers went out to them.Then he went further.This includes the family of the shooter, he said. I cant imagine how hard this experience must be for you. And I want you to know that our family and our love and our support goes out to you as well.The last conversation Mr. Parker had with his daughter was in Portuguese, he said, a language they had been learning together.She told me good morning, he said. She asked how I was doing. She told me she loved me.I gave her a kiss, he said, and I was out the door.

And then, shielded the children in the closet, trying to protect them from bullets.Put herself between the gunman and the kids. Yes. Shes definitely a hero.Her life dream was to be a teacher. And her instincts kicked in. And protected her children from the harm that was coming.Im sure she heard what was going on. And went into lockdown.
