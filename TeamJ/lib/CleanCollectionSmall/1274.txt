December 16, 2012 (AP)Boxes of tissues were placed strategically in each pew and on window sills. The altar was adorned with bouquets, one in the shape of a broken heart, with a zigzag of red carnations cutting through the white ones.The Rev. Jerald Doyle, the diocesan administrator, officiated. Letters of condolence from the pope and Archbishop William Lori, who left the Bridgeport diocese this year to become archbishop in Baltimore, were read at the start of Mass.In his homily, Doyle tried to answer the question of how parishioners could find joy in the holiday season with so much sorrow surrounding them."You won't remember what I say, and it will become unimportant," he said.

They heard the shots, saw the bodies.Saturday was the last night of Hanukkah, and the boys celebrated at home with family.

But we all are all together in this."After Mass, Joan and Jennifer Waters stopped by a makeshift memorial of votive candles, flowers and stuffed animals to pray the "Our Father.""Can we get these?"
