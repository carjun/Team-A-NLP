Someone listed an article that quoted a guy saying something from Reuters (the news agency).  Someone else asked for a source for the thing; the source was the guy from Reuters.  I quoted the part of the paragraph that said the guy from Reuters said the thing.  And now here we are with you talking about aliens and calling me retarded while reflexively downvoting my posts.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

They looked into it and said it was pretty much true, even if they couldn't pin down an exact figure (due to regulations preventing such an accounting).  If you don't want to believe it that's fine, but there's more to it than you're pretending.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

Should I take it to mean that you will continue to hold middle-income tax cuts hostage?  by  reeds1999in  politics[+]rocketvat 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]rocketvat 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoThe Democratic party seems to be the one you're looking for.  It's getting more progressive by the day and doesn't need electoral reform to push its agenda effectively.  Yeah it has a long way to go, but if incremental change is your thing then trying to create a brand new party out of whole cloth seems like a much less effective way to go about it.I'll join a fringe party the moment we have coalition governments and slate voting.  But that's not even on a foreseeable horizon.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the probability that everyone on earth blinks at the same exact time, effectively ensuring that nobody witnessed that moment in history?  by  Elvisisdeadin  AskReddit[+]rocketvat 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]rocketvat 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoHmm, I think you misunderstand my point (or I yours, sorry!).  I'm saying that for a species to exist, it has to have a certain number of representative individuals with the collection of features that separate that species from another.  So there's no "first" human, there's collectively a set of first humans.  So there's no 0 to 1, there's 0 to X, with X as whatever that minimum is.  The trouble here is that "species" isn't a particularly precise term.  In a lot of ways, the only "species" on this planet is DNA with a bunch of different individuals that we more or less arbitrarily categorize.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPelosi Focused on Fiscal Cliff Fight :"Do I detect your smirk to mean you dont think Republicans will vote for middle-income tax cuts, Mr. Sessions?

The article doesn't say if he has a family, so we can't say whether he's above the poverty line or not.  Either way, we can probably agree that's not a whole lot of money to live in a city like Chicago.I'm not sure what the exact wage we should raise it to (certainly a good discussion to have, and there's not some magical number where every problem in solved to everyone's satisfaction), but the article gives a good place to start:A November study by Demos found that raising retail workers' wages to $25,000 per year would lift 734,075 people out of poverty and create 100,000 to 132,000 new jobs.At 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, that would imply a minimum wage of $12.02.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPelosi Focused on Fiscal Cliff Fight :"Do I detect your smirk to mean you dont think Republicans will vote for middle-income tax cuts, Mr. Sessions?

It's called the minimum wage.  It should be higher.  Every single person willing to work and contribute to society should live, at the very least, a decent and basic life without hunger, or cold and with the ability to enjoy their time spent on Earth.  If we can't achieve that for every human being in the "Greatest nation on earth" and arguably the strongest empire to ever exist, we are doing it profoundly wrong.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPelosi Focused on Fiscal Cliff Fight :"Do I detect your smirk to mean you dont think Republicans will vote for middle-income tax cuts, Mr. Sessions?
