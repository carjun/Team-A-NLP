Then, if the pattern holds, they will immediately retreat into silence and refuse to engage in any meaningful debate about Americas catastrophically flawed gun laws, which directly facilitate one gun massacre after the next," the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence said in a statement.The Coalition was planninga rallyin front ofthe White House at 4:30 p.m. on Friday. "We expect President Obamaas a man who has seen first-hand the devastation that gun violence inflicts on families and communities during his time as a volunteer in Chicagoto be a leader in this process and to speak out boldly and directly."The Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence, meanwhile, urged supporters to sign a petition in support of tougher gun-control laws."Another day, another horrific shooting eating away at our collective peace of mind. This time at a school in Connecticut. We are better than this this," Dan Gross, president of The Brady Campaign, wrote in a statement. "What matters is not what we do after the sensational tragedies. It's what we do between them -- to make the voice of the American public heard."Obama said Friday that it was time to take "meaningful action" to prevent similar tragedies, though he did not specify what action. His press secretary Jay Carney said it was too soon after the shooting to engage in policy debates about gun control.Read more about: Connecticut School ShootingComments () CommentsPOLITICO 44Search POLITICO 44SearchDonovan SlackEmail:dslack@politico.comTwitter:@DonovanSlackByron TauEmail:btau@politico.comTwitter:@ByronTauTwitter Buzz@jodikantor12/14/12 2:59 PM ESTIt's an obvious room, but still, could Obama's choice of the Brady briefing room-- named for a gun control advocate-- be intentional?View All Previous WhiteboardsObama: 'These children are our children'12/14/12 3:39 PM ESTObama orders flags at half staff12/14/12 3:14 PM ESTObama to speak12/14/12 2:48 PM ESTWhite House daily briefing, 12/1412/14/12 1:26 PM ESTBill signing, Rice meeting12/13/12 7:15 PM ESTView All Whiteboards Most Popular Posts1Intelligence community: U.S. out as sole superpower by 203012/10/2012 9:54 AM2Obama briefed on Connecticut school shooting12/14/2012 12:44 PM3Poll: Obama has a mandate to raise taxes12/12/2012 9:32 AM4Obama: I'm not a socialist12/14/2012 10:20 AM5Extinct lizard named after Obama12/10/2012 5:49 PMCalendarPOLITICO VideoView MorePlay VideoObama: 'Our hearts are broken'VIDEO: Obama briefed on Conn. shootingPLAYBACK: Gay marriage heads to SCOTUSVIDEO: Obama: Wash., Colo. have spoken See All Videos Popular on POLITICOMost ReadMost EmailedMost CommentedLast 12 HoursLast 24 HoursLast 2 DaysLast WeekUpdated: 12/14/2012 4:02 PM ET1POLITICO's new campaign e-book: An early look2Obama avoids Rice fight3Obama: 'We've endured too many of these tragedies'4Albright: Rice situation 'outrageous'5The many faces of Ryan Lanza627 dead in Conn. school shooting7Jindal: Birth control should be OTC8Neil Cavuto cuts off Rep.
