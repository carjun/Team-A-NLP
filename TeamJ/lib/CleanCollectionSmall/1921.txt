People's memories are immediately fresh and this is their best chance to get an idea of exactly how it happened.permalinksaveparent[+]YeNdEz 72 points73 points74 points 23 hours ago (5 children)[]YeNdEz 72 points73 points74 points 23 hours agoIt's a reasonable point, but I don't know that there are any mysteries to be solved here, other than motive, which will likely be revealed more by an investigation into the history of the attacker(s?). permalinksaveparent[+]GitEmSteveDave 24 points25 points26 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]GitEmSteveDave 24 points25 points26 points 23 hours agoIt helps to develop plans and procedures to save lives if something like this happens again.permalinksaveparent[+]helmvisit 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]helmvisit 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoWe should be experts in a couple of years.permalinksaveparent[+]polkadotpotato 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]polkadotpotato 5 points6 points7 points 23 hours agoThere is speculation about a second gunmanpermalinksaveparent[+]natiice 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]natiice 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoSo awful.

I will bet money they are checking IDs of every parent who goes there before they let them in and before they release a child.  Any reporters are sitting outside the secure area, and it's the parents who are letting them speak to reporters.  I saw at least two parents standing with the child being interviewed and then talking to the reporters themselves.permalinksaveparent[+]JFinSmith 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]JFinSmith 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoActually in instances like this with high stress, your memory is much better 72 hours later.I'm a cop, trained in that shit.permalinksaveparent[+]Evilrazzberi09 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Evilrazzberi09 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoBut you have to be so careful when questioning children. I hope they are using specialists, who know how to talk to children and get answers without scaring them or putting words in their mouths. Journalists should not be talking to the children at all.. I hope they are not.edit: Oh, it sounds like they are :(permalinksaveparent[+]BaseballGuyCAA 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]BaseballGuyCAA 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoThe police also have psychologists on staff who are trained to handle children who have been through traumatizing events, and to question them in the least scarring way possible.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
