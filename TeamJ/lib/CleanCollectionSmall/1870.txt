Shit, I'm tearing up typing this. Hers was the first classroom in the hall he entered. She wanted them to know they were loved so she told them all she loved them very much and it would be okay. Teachers are trained to try to keep the kids calm and quiet, but she also wanted their last memory to be that they were loved. She was certain they were going to die because of where her classroom was located.I also heard that in the gym, the Phys Ed teachers gathered classes in the corners of the gym and then held themselves as human shields around them in case he entered the gym firing.These folks are straight up goddamn heroes by every stretch of the imagination.permalinksaveparent[+]Vivalayeo 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Vivalayeo 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours agoAmazing person - can't imagine the fear she must have experienced but was able to act and do the right thing.

Just like was done with terrorist and epic and so many other wordsShe saved her life and the life of her class doing what should be expected of anyone in that situation. To do what she did was her responsibility, and to take refuge in the bathroom was basic sense, and to tell them it was hammering was because she has a brain and understands telling kids that someone is shooting would be a bad idea.Heroism would be someone from outside school doing the same thing, because they are going above and beyond their call of duty to help peopleBut then again, you'd likely be the type to call every dead soldier a hero as wellpermalinksaveparent[+]CowboySpencer 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours ago (11 children)[]CowboySpencer 4 points5 points6 points 21 hours agoUm, wat?  You're saying that she isn't a hero because she did what was expected of her?  Under your rules, no policeman or firefighter or soldier could ever be called a hero.permalinksaveparent[+]che-singh  comment score below threshold (10 children)[]che-singh -6 points-5 points-4 points 21 hours ago*To be a firefighter or policeman or soldier, you're intentionally taking yourself out of safety to ensure the safety of others. And even then I would only consider fire fighters the only consistent hero's, the circumstances of a soldier or cop vary so much you can't call the entire profession "heroic" The teacher was in a position of danger and took those she was responsible for into safety. Which is just what anyone would do in that situation. If this teacher is a hero then you're implying a normal person would just stand around waiting to get shotpermalinksaveparent[+]dih_key 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]dih_key 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoCome on, she's a hero. She worked with what she had to ensure the safety of the children, her responsibility or not. permalinksaveparent[+]Rydel6 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours ago (8 children)[]Rydel6 2 points3 points4 points 21 hours agoBut that teacher wasn't expected to be and work in a dangerous situation. Why are we even debating the propper usage of the word "Hero"?permalinksaveparent[+]che-singh -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours ago (7 children)[]che-singh -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours agoBecause words need to have meaning or else our speech becomes meaningless. Politics and the English language and all that jazzShe was in a dangerous situation and got herself and those she was responsible for to safety. What she did is known as "being a normal person"If you mean to say not everyone would have done that, yes, those people are below average, them being slow doesn't make normal people hero's. Now, someone coming off the street to save kids? That's heroic. Someone tackling the gunman? That's heroicpermalinksaveparent[+]piratemurray 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (3 children)[]piratemurray 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoI think you need to stop now. permalinksaveparent[+]che-singh -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours ago (2 children)[]che-singh -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours agoWhy, am I going over your head?permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]Fagggit -1 points0 points1 point 19 hours ago (2 children)[]Fagggit -1 points0 points1 point 19 hours agoHow would where the person originated the actions from make any difference? If you act to save lives, no matter your profession its heroic, its not part the teachers job to deal with the shooter.permalinksaveparent[+]che-singh -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours ago (1 child)[]che-singh -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours agoNo, it's not heroic for the same reason the guy who landed that flight in the water near NY wasn't. HE WAS ON THE THE PLANE, he was a PILOT, he did exactly what he was supposed to do and saved his own life in the process. You can say he was a very good pilot, but that's allSame with the teacher, she did what anyone past the point of retardation would do and saved herself and the kids in her care. She did exactly what was expected of her, nothing morepermalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]kudomonster 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]kudomonster 5 points6 points7 points 22 hours agoI suppose, but not everyone would/could do what she did in the same circumstances.  Some people, despite themselves would freeze or flee in fear.  Some stay and do their best to help.  I tend to consider the latter heroes, but that's just my take.  _^permalinksaveparent[+]PacoBedejo  comment score below threshold (2 children)[]PacoBedejo -9 points-8 points-7 points 23 hours agoShe did well with the tools she was permitted. It could have also gone another way with another sort of illegal hero.permalinksaveparent[+]kudomonster 9 points10 points11 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]kudomonster 9 points10 points11 points 23 hours agoYou know, I admit there is a certain amount of appeal towards guns at times, I am afraid that I have to respectfully disagree with the general pro-gun argument.  That said, this particular thread isn't an appropriate place for a full on discussion on the topic.permalinksaveparent[+]PacoBedejo  comment score below threshold (0 children)[]PacoBedejo -11 points-10 points-9 points 23 hours agoAs I see it, there are three potential beliefs on the topic:Guns exist, so it's good to have good guys with guns to counter the bad guys. (I'm wearing this jersey)We should somehow eliminate all guns...or at least just the dangerous ones...so that nobody ever dies again.Evil exists, but we'll just pretend that it's a great idea to have buildings with hundreds of undefended children.She pulled a 'Brave Sir Robin' & you're calling her a "friggin hero!". The other guy broke the law & stopped a killer. Also, IMO, this is precisely an appropriate thread for such discussion.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
