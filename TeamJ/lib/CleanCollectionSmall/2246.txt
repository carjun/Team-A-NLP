The other was 20 years old, I believe. It doesn't specify which one was killed and which is in custody though.permalinksaveparent[+]Savioritis -1 points0 points1 point 2 minutes ago (0 children)[]Savioritis -1 points0 points1 point 2 minutes agoI heard about the 24 year old first, which makes me weakly infer that he was the one who the police killed. But it's a very weak inference at best.permalinksaveparent[+]HilariousScreenname 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]HilariousScreenname 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoPlease show me your proof that there was a second shooter before you accuse people of lying. This is a chaotic time with lots of varying information being put out by witnesses. Information is going to be confusing. Likely, the police are only dispensing news that they KNOW, not suspect.permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
