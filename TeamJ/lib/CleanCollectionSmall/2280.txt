I would guess so.permalinksaveparent[+]new_math 2 points3 points4 points 16 minutes ago (0 children)[]new_math 2 points3 points4 points 16 minutes agoI've heard from documentaries that when 2 people do something like this there is usually a dominant personality and then a follower who will do absolutely anything the dominant personality asks him to. permalinksaveparent[+]Ruddiver 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (1 child)[]Ruddiver 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoI doubt there was a second gunman. just a guess thoughpermalinksaveparent[+]jesuz 3 points4 points5 points 14 minutes ago (0 children)[]jesuz 3 points4 points5 points 14 minutes agoIt seems like with every shooting, and we have so many in the US, they always ID a second gunman before confirming there was only one.permalinksaveparent[+]apathetic_youth 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)[]apathetic_youth 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes agoThe second person in custody has not been confirmed to part of the shooting.permalinksaveparent[+]one_among_the_fence 0 points1 point2 points 6 seconds ago (0 children)[]one_among_the_fence 0 points1 point2 points 6 seconds agoColumbine had more than one shooterpermalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
