Some of these reporters seem to only care about getting a scoop and not about those individuals well beings they are using to get that story. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]JulesGirth 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoI can't believe this, I'm so sad right now. I used to live in Newtown, I played soccer at Sandy Hook, my cousin went to that school. Newtown is such a great little community, you couldn't imagine a more quient beautiful small town. I'm so sorry for everyone who lost a loved one today or was affected by this horrible tragedy....I can't even fathom what would drive some one to the insanity to do something like this. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat shitty things did you do to your good friends as a child?  by  astronaut89in  AskReddit[+]JulesGirth 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth 1 point2 points3 points 6 days agoAt my birthday party when I was 11 I had a sleep over and my mom made spaghetti and meatballs.  One of my friends was late,  my other friend decided to make his plate for him, and in doing so found a piece of fresh dog shit in the yard and put it in with his spaghetti. When my friend arrived we were already eating and his plate was made. My mom unknowingly set it up perfectly by telling us she had spent all night making the meatballs. So when he was almost finished we told him he had to eat it all so not to hurt my moms feelings. It was the last bite and be put it in his mouth and immediately said ewwww that tastes like shit, which it was. I almost threw up from watching it, 11 year olds are dicks. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is the worst thing you've ever done for money?

Reddit, what is your weirdest wrong number story?  by  absurdapplein  AskReddit[+]JulesGirth 7 points8 points9 points 4 months ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth 7 points8 points9 points 4 months agoI kept getting these weird texts saying "HEY PRINCESS HOW ARE YOU?" and casual questions like that, over and over, always in capital. One day I responded "who is this and who the fuck is princess?". She responded IT"S YOUR SISTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH! I told her I wasn't her sister and she had the wrong number.  She wouldn't accept this and kept on going like I hadn't said anything.  I finally told her my name and that I lived in California and I wasn't her sister.  She then started asking me questions, about what I do and stuff. i answered not being worried.  This made her think I was her BF and started texting me personal questions about my dating life and what not.  I quickly stopped responding, she didn't.  I asked her to stop a few times and she took this as I wanted to talk to her again and would text even more.  She texted me at least 10 times a day every day for 3 months.  Asking where i was, why i didn't like her anymore, she even sent me a photo of herself.  It was creepy, sad, and hilarious all at the same time.  Finally it slowed down and eventually stopped.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAs a kid, I thought the world used to be just black and white before the invention of color TVs.

Not knowing she was drunk, I agreed. (she only had 2 1/2 bud lights) While I was following her home on the first road we turned down I see her driving too far to the right and hitting every car parked on the side of the road.  One guy saw her and ran after her, while on the phone telling her information to the police. She noticed i guess cause all of a sudden she ran the light she was stopped at and sped off.  I went home.... needless to say, we never went out again.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey Reddit, what is a movie that in your opinion EVERYONE should watch at least once?  by  keightalchemistin  AskReddit[+]JulesGirth -1 points0 points1 point 4 months ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth -1 points0 points1 point 4 months agoHoly Mountainpermalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat are your favorite things to do with friends that are cheap, easy and instantly fun?  by  Noedelin  AskReddit[+]JulesGirth -1 points0 points1 point 6 months ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth -1 points0 points1 point 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onMy friends and I get really high and go on bike rides at night, it's blast, most the roads are empty and it's very tranquil. In my town as well every Tuesday 100-300 people meet up to do the same thing. We go for about 1/2 - 2 hours. It's called the Tuesday night bike ride and it's amazing! People play music drink beer and just enjoy the spectacle and each others company. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'm driving across america in June/July; what do I see?  by  Onsalefor10centsin  AskReddit[+]JulesGirth 0 points1 point2 points 10 months ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth 0 points1 point2 points 10 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onWow that's awful, but also kinda funny, the place is staffed by a bunch of grumpy old war vets, I've been yelled at by a few of them for going places I'm not supposed to.

Definitely check out the Airplane Grave Yard, where every plane that's been retired since WWII is stored.  You can take tours of it through the Pima Air and Space museum which is an amazing museum in itself.  Also check out the Titan Missile Museum where you can check out a Nuclear Launch Bunker.  Stay in Hotel Congress, where John Dillinger was arrested and is a really cool hotel with a awesome nightclub on the bottom floor where you can get $1 drinks about 4 days a week. Tombstone is also 45 min south of Tucson where you can go to the real OK Coral. Go from Tucson to San Diego, then take the Pacific Coast Highway up to LA stopping at some of the beach towns along the way, then continue from LA to San Fran along the PCH which is one of the most amazing stretches of road in the U.S. if not the world.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy do we sometimes have "on" days, where for no particular reason we are quicker, more articulate and alert etc for a day. How can one increase the frequency of "on" days?  by  brutalgashin  AskReddit[+]JulesGirth 0 points1 point2 points 10 months ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth 0 points1 point2 points 10 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onIt probably has to do with whether or not you woke up in the middle or after a sleep cycle.  If you wake up in between sleep cycles you get that refreshed "woke up on the right side of the bed" feeling, when you wake up in the middle of one is when you feel groggy.  When I have a big day the next day I use a website called sleepyti.me. On the site you put in when you have to wake up and then it tells you what times it's ok for you to go to bed in order to make sure you wake up in between sleep cycles. It works really well for me and has been a great asset to my life!permalinksavecontextfull commentsWant to play a game?  by  cowhuggerin  Music[+]JulesGirth 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth 0 points1 point2 points 11 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onToo Much Pain - The Bugpermalinksavecontextfull commentsI am Neil deGrasse Tyson -- AMA  by  neiltysonin  IAmA[+]JulesGirth 0 points1 point2 points 12 months ago (0 children)[]JulesGirth 0 points1 point2 points 12 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onWhat is your take on UFO's?
