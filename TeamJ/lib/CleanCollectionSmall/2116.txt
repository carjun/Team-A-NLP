I try to be open with my own kinks, but it's still restricted to the internet, the bedroom, and a very select group of friends.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow long would you let someone pee on you for $300 a day?

I really like this comic! Personally, I don't see it as sad, because it reminds me that if someone is bothered by who I am, I don't need to pay them any attention and that there will always be people who don't mind who I am one bit! (They'll probably even appreciate/like it!)permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school. Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]Silver_kitty 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 8 points9 points10 points 23 hours agoWhen I was in elementary we had 5 or 6 legitimate "lockdown code red" moments. (Usually someone running from police was taking refuge in our school.) No one was ever injured during them, but I definitely had similar ideas. The person isn't going to be fooled that the classrooms are empty by hiding in the corners of our classrooms.permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy teacher claimed that her pencil sharpener is, "Possessed by Satan."

Though, since it is doubtful this post would make it, he's also probably safe. Hmm... is he just gambling to try to hit the sweet spot of lots of karma without shelling out money? Almost certainly. I'll reward him for the effort anyway.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCollarMe alternative?  by  boiling_penisin  BDSMcommunity[+]Silver_kitty 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoI second the recommendation for getting into your local scene if you have one.

Sorry if this is in the wrong place.  by  throwaway919912in  TwoXSex[+]Silver_kitty 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoFirst off, you'll be fine either way. Just take a second to breathe and relax. It is unlikely that the symptoms that you're listing are from being pregnant so early on. For example, most women don't start experiencing morning sickness until the 6th week of pregnancy. (I've been really stressed lately and it's got my stomach in knots and my skin is breaking out. I can't wait for finals to be over!)I do think that it would help rest your weary mind to go to a pharmacy and pick up a pregnancy test. They aren't terribly expensive for the peace of mind knowing (either way) it gives you! Your mum sounds like she would be reasonable and go with you to the pharmacy. Don't stress out about the future until you know for sure that you're pregnant. Just take it a step at a time and you will be able to work it out.permalinksavecontextfull commentsBBC News - US, UK and Canada refuse to sign UN internet treaty  by  rydtixin  worldnews[+]Silver_kitty 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoIt seems a little bit crazy, but it is an issue of national sovereignty in a way. The way that people in the US get upset with the US government taking away decisions from the states, the UN is perhaps stepping into things that it shouldn't have jurisdiction over. I do think that everyone should have access to an unfiltered internet, but I suppose I question if this is really the role of the UN. Thoughts?permalinksavecontextfull commentsJeez, kid. You're only 10.  by  folxifyin  AdviceAnimals[+]Silver_kitty 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI'm 19 and my main Christmas gift this year were plane tickets to make it home for Christmas. I'm sure I'll get a few little things (my mom likes food-related gifts). My boyfriend on the other hand is getting an iPhone 5 and a couple new Xbox games from his parents. Not to mention that his 10 year old sister ALSO got an iPhone 5 for Xmas and an iPad for her birthday. permalinksavecontextfull commentsLet's see if you've learnt how to fetch yet.  by  forscienceyeahin  petplay[+]Silver_kitty 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI love this picture.

Is it because the rod is wearing out/ has less hormone left in it? If I got another implanon put in, do you think it would get better again? I have been noticing it getting worse and worse in the last 6 months (I'm currently in the 2 weeks on 2 weeks off phase) but didn't know it was something that happened to other users.Do you have any suggestions of other long term BC that might be less evil? permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe TSA has gone too far...  by  NHJORDANin  videos[+]Silver_kitty 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoTo be fair, it does state that she missed her flight in the end.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe TSA has gone too far...  by  NHJORDANin  videos[+]Silver_kitty 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoSomeone further down mentioned that, if she has a 7 month old, she may have reduced lactation by this point and be trying to keep her baby on as much breast milk as possible by pumping and storing. I still personally think that having the baby have formula for a meal isn't the end of the world, and she should have just scanned or tossed it and caught her flight.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe TSA has gone too far...  by  NHJORDANin  videos[+]Silver_kitty 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI agree that there should be punishments, but I don't think that arresting them is a good solution. Also, did they really harass her? They inconvenienced her for sure. They detained her, but only until they came to some form of agreement on the screening process. I'm not saying that they are good guys, but I don't know that I would classify this as a jail-able offense!permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is something that you are glad you have, but don't like using?  by  Not_A_Novelin  AskReddit[+]Silver_kitty 9 points10 points11 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 9 points10 points11 points 2 days agoMy boyfriend is quite allergic to nuts, seeds, and shellfish and I carry an epipen in my purse and he has one in the backpack he takes to work, but I am terrified of ever having to use it. I know it's important, but it freaks me out for some reason.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe TSA has gone too far...  by  NHJORDANin  videos[+]Silver_kitty 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoHonest question, can you show me where it says that it's a federal law? According to the TSA site on medical liquids, it outlines that there is a separate screening, but not if it's actually a federal law that they offer that screening, etc.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe TSA has gone too far...  by  NHJORDANin  videos[+]Silver_kitty -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoAlso- your belongings get as much radiation being in the airplane as going through the scanners.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe TSA has gone too far...  by  NHJORDANin  videos[+]Silver_kitty -7 points-6 points-5 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty -7 points-6 points-5 points 2 days agoThat's absolutely how I felt about it. The woman seems angry almost immediately, and, given the lack of sound, we don't know what's happening. She could have been really disruptive the week before and uncooperative, especially because she doesn't seem particularly cooperative here! Also, if a TSA agent is checking out my bag I would never go to take something out of it without their express permission, while she reaches for it several times.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe TSA has gone too far...  by  NHJORDANin  videos[+]Silver_kitty -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Silver_kitty -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days agoI wondered that myself. I could see carrying breastmilk if you're going to need to feed your child while in the airport or on the plane and don't want to breastfeed in public, but why is she carrying 12 ounces of breastmilk without a baby near her? It says in the video that she needs to feed him for dinner, but surely it's not the end of the world if she throws out that bottle of breastmilk and make more later instead of missing her flight and almost certainly missing baby's dinnertime.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
