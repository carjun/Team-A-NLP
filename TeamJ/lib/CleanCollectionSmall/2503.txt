Partially to blame is the fact that Myrick had to leave the property to retrieve his gun because the law wouldn't let him carry it in the building. permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

My family lives in Newtown and are in a panic. This has to stop. I can't support these gun laws any longer.  by  c00perin  news[+]barrett51bmg -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)[]barrett51bmg -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 hours agoI agree gun restrictions are to blame. Without them then the teacher or other adult at the school would have had the opportunity to stop the shooter just like Joel Myrick did to end the Pearl High School shooting in Pearl, Mississippi. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_High_School_shootingpermalinksavecontextfull commentsThe answer to any question regarding military prowess is inevitably "The 40K universe would win."

However, we can't use helium, because of the shortage, and hydrogen is also not an option because it is flammable. IS there another option?  by  Schoritzobanditin  askscience[+]barrett51bmg 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]barrett51bmg 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours agoWithout a heating element, no. The next lightest common gas at normal temperatures and pressures is Nitrogen, which makes up most of the Atmosphere, so it wouldn't go far up at all unless the balloon were large enough to take advantage of the differences between the weight of pure N2 vs Atmospheric Air. And by large, I mean impractically freakin large. However if you were willing to construct a balloon that could withstand the necessary temperature then you could use just about anything that would not decompose at the requisite temperature required to reach the volume necessary for the altitude you wish to reach. For that I would start with Nitrogen.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy is it that there aren't stars in the video footage of Astronauts on the moon?  by  That_Ian_Dudein  askscience[+]barrett51bmg 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)[]barrett51bmg 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours agoCheck Wednesday's and Thursday's broadcast schedule for The Discovery Channel and I bet you find some Moon hoax crap was on. permalinksavecontextfull comments2013 Golf "Scavenger Hunt"/"Trophy Ball" game ideas and suggestions.  by  jakhammain  golf[+]barrett51bmg 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)[]barrett51bmg 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours agoHole out from the sand (Score irrelevant) Break 100,90,80 etc, whichever is more appropriate for you.
