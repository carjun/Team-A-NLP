Let's develop new treatments, new diagnostic techniques, new technologies. I've been thinking for a while now that we need a "Manhattan Project" for psychology. The technology is here now to research genetics, neural systems, and disorders. And there are no shortage of enthusiastic researchers at universities. The problem is that 99% of funding at universities goes to 3 or 4 diseases: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Autism being the "big 3" that everyone is working on. Those are important diseases, but unfortunately there are considerably fewer researchers working on depression and schizophrenia. That lack of funding is one of the reasons that depression is still such a "murky" disorder. Given that a significant portion of the population will suffer from depression at some point in their lives, and that everyone's lives would be better if depression was better understood and had more treatment options, I really think it should be more of a focus for research. permalinksavecontextfull commentsElementary school mass shooting took place in a Kindergarten classroom.
