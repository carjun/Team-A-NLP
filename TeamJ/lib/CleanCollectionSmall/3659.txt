"It will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession.   Not retroactively but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips,   drums or strips of more than 10 bullets," she told NBC News, adding   that she expected Mr Obama to support the bill. The move  which would essentially revive the Bill Clinton-era assault weapons   that was allowed to lapse in 2004  is expected to be highly controversial   with the powerful gun lobby and politicians whose constituents cling   fiercely to their Second Amendment gun rights. Mr Obama has faced a sharp political dilemma over gun control, almost entirely   ducking the issue in his first term because it would cost him votes in the   key battleground states  Florida, Virginia, Ohio  which secured his   re-election last November, but only by a collective tally of about 250,000   votes. Chuck Schumer, another senior Democrat senator, said he believed that a deal   could be done, but it would require both camps to show flexibility in their   previously hard-and-fast attitudes on the subject.

However Mr Obama's support for a revival of the ban is still   seen as critical in ensuring that the outrage currently galvanising the gun   laws debate is not allowed to dissipate without effect, as it has after   countless recent mass shootings. Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, repeated his call that the   ineffectual hand-wringing that followed previous mass shootings must not be   repeated, arguing that gun reform should be "number one" on the   president's agenda. "If he does nothing during his second term, something like 48,000   Americans will be killed with illegal guns. That is roughly the number of   Americans killed in the whole Vietnam War," said Mr Bloomberg, a   co-chair of Mayor's Against Illegal Guns. As an alternative, Joe Lieberman, an independent Senator for Connecticut,   called for a national 9/11-style 'commission on mass violence' to find ways   to reduce future shootings in the United States, including an assault   weapons ban, and circumvent legislative gridlock, but cautioned that there   was "no one solution" to the problem.  "We ought to restore the assault weapons ban, not to take anybody's guns   away that they have now but to stop the manufacturing of these weapons,"   he said. "We've got to continue to hear the screams of these children   and see their blood until we do something to try and prevent this from   happening again." However gun control remains a deeply polarising issue   in the United States, with other political figures, including William   Bennett, the former Reagan administration education secretary, arguing that   the Sandy Hook shootings made the case for more guns, not fewer. Louie Gohmert, a Republican congressman from Texas, agreed saying that "an   open mind" was needed in future negotiations over guns, arguing that if   the school's principal, Dawn Hochsprung, had been armed the situation could   have turned out differently.  "I wish to God she had had an M4 in her office locked up and so when she   heard gunshots," he told Fox News, "she takes his head off before   he can hurt those kids."
