Among them are New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California's Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who are both calling for stricter gun-control laws.This will be denounced, of course, as opportunism by many conservative gun-rights proponents, who will say that the wake of a tragedy is no time to talk about politics. Yet it's a fact of democratic life that disasters are often the only thing that can bring about profound political change. Moreover, one would have to be as deranged as the Connecticut gunman not to be moved by the events in Newtown to want to take some action that would prevent such tragedies in the future.When it comes to gun control, though, that brings up two profound questions: Are there really laws that would stem mass shootings  which seem to have reached epidemic proportions in the United States  and is there any chance of getting them approved at the federal level? The answer to the first question is, probably yes. To the second, probably no.PHOTOS: Connecticut school shootingA host of sensible laws have been proposed over the years that would make it harder for dangerous people to obtain guns, or which would ban the kind of guns that are good only for mass killing. For example: The federal government could close the gun-show loophole, which allows unlicensed dealers to sell used guns without conducting background checks on buyers. It could enhance the background-check system to search more thoroughly for evidence of mental illness. It could ban assault weapons, or weapons with large magazines that are only useful if one intends to kill a lot of human beings very quickly (the Connecticut gunman used two such large-magazine weapons, a Glock pistol and a Bushmaster .223 M4 carbine rifle). We would favor passage of any or all of these laws, which would do nothing to prevent responsible gun owners from protecting themselves or hunting.Gun-rights proponents argue that these laws would be ineffective because anyone depraved enough to plan mass murder wouldn't hesitate to break the law to obtain a gun. Maybe, maybe not. But in any case, that's no reason to make it so easy for them. One can't help but be struck by the fact that on the same day as the Newtown massacre, a deranged man in China, where guns are very hard to obtain, slashed 22 children with a knife outside an elementary school. None of them died.Much as we'd like to see a modicum of sanity in U.S. gun laws, it doesn't seem forthcoming. Liberals from urban states such as Boxer are unlikely to overcome opposition to gun controls from Republicans and moderate Democrats in the Senate. The idea that the Republican-dominated House would do anything to restrict gun ownership is a vain fantasy. And President Obama has thus far proven himself unwilling to expend the kind of political capital necessary to move meaningful gun reform into the forefront of the national debate. Hug your children and protect them as best you can; politicians are unlikely to do so.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles TimesComments25Comments (25)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQGaryDMN at 1:52 PM December 15, 2012                Chicago leads the nation in gun violence, after implementing the toughest gun laws in the country. Canadians have nearly as many guns per capita, looser gun laws and almost no gun violence, so its not the guns or the gun laws, its the criminals and attention seeking nut cases that are the problem.edwardskizer at 1:45 PM December 15, 2012                Here's an idea; keep a more careful eye on those individuals (key word, individuals, not groups)thatfit the profile of a possible mass murderer. In the schools, at work, anywhere, investigate and proscribe appropriate methods to keep them in check. Don't restrict the rights of the innocent and lawful person to deter those of the wrong doer.edwardskizer at 1:36 PM December 15, 2012                The reason why the gun rights proponents oppose "reasonable" limits on gun possession is the same reason why the pro-abortion groups oppose "reasonable" limitson abortion.Gun control advocacy groups, like the anti-abortion crowd are not really interested in reasonable legislation; they support it merely as a means to gain total restriction, and thus the line in the sand must be drawn before it is too late. Besides, aperson legitimately exercising a right does not have to prove it worth; if they did, it would not be a right, but a privilege.ConnectRecommended on FacebookFollow @latimesAdvertisementCartoons Photos: Flip through Ted Rall's editorial cartoonsYear In Review Slideshow: Worst insults to women in 2012 Slideshow: Best and worst outcomes from the 2012 election$13 million for 'Hobbit' at midnight showsWounded vets lobby for fertility helpWhat the Bible doesn't say about gaysPhotos: Snow in WrightwoodMost ViewedLatest NewsLike rest of nation, neighbor in Sandy Hook awaits victims' names12/15/2012, 12:44 p.m.Militants attack Pakistani airport; 9 dead12/15/2012, 12:17 p.m.Amir Khan aiming for 'a good win' Saturday against Carlos Molina12/15/2012, 11:50 a.m.Hillary Clinton faints, suffers concussion, recuperating at home12/15/2012, 11:45 a.m.Suspect in massacre tried to buy rifle days before, sources say12/15/2012, 11:40 a.m.Audio: Dispatchers hear 'someone shooting in the building' - Nation - latimes.com12/15/2012, 12:57 p.m.Las Vegas police search for clues in Excalibur casino shooting - Nation - latimes.com12/15/2012, 12:45 p.m.Football: Marin Catholic 14, Madison 0 - Varsity Times Insider12/15/2012, 12:42 p.m.Jodie Meeks' best game of season helps Lakers topple Wizards - Sports - latimes.com12/15/2012, 12:35 p.m.Like rest of nation, neighbor in Sandy Hook awaits victims' names - Nation - latimes.com12/15/2012, 12:04 p.m.VideoSave.
