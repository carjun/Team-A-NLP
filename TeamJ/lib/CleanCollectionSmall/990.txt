All they do is fuck everything up.permalinksaveparent[+]vsal 9 points10 points11 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]vsal 9 points10 points11 points 22 hours agoExtremely brave. All news stations have been fucking up reports. All outlets are prematurely reporting malleable facts in the hope of being the first.permalinksaveparent[+]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]reddixiecup 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoThey've changed the name of the shooter twice and were the ones to show a "confirmed" photo of the wrong guy. Sounds reliable to me.permalinksaveparent[+]vsal 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]vsal 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoCNN just did the same thing. They've stopped saying "Ryan Lanza." I don't like Fox either, but everyone else is fucking up just as hard. permalinksaveparent[+]mlurve 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]mlurve 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI've been listening to NBC News at work all day, and they have also been (possibly wrongly) reporting "Ryan Lanza" as the name. So as much as I hate Fox's political biases, it seems that they're the first to break the new info here.permalinksaveparent[+]Quork 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Quork 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoI'm not from the US, so just a curious, honest question:How the fuck is everyone still watching Fox news after all the bullshit they "report"? Is there no better News Source on US TV?permalinksaveparent[+]Soviet_Sam 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]Soviet_Sam 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoThe NY Post is also reporting that the shooter was Adam Lanza.permalinksaveparent[+]FlimtotheFlam 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]FlimtotheFlam 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoWell remember they first said it was a 20 year old shooter than it went to 24 and now back to 20permalinksaveparent[+]Iphotographboobs -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours ago (3 children)[]Iphotographboobs -2 points-1 points0 points 22 hours agoyou have the source or what? dont post this type of crap unless you have the source.. permalinksaveparent[+]mlurve 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours ago (2 children)[]mlurve 6 points7 points8 points 22 hours agoSure, here you go: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/14/police-respond-to-shooting-at-connecticut-elementary-school/Also I've been listening to this livestream, which is where I heard about it first: http://live.producermatthew.com/p/live-channel-2.htmlpermalinksaveparent[+]Iphotographboobs 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]Iphotographboobs 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agothanks for replying so kindly and not saying anything rude. sorry.
