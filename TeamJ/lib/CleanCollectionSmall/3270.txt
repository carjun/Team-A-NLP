Log InBy Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatch SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch)  Fiscal-cliff negotiations, once again, are likely to edge out other market catalysts in the coming week, but investor fatigue as the stalemate drags on may refocus attention on how the drama is taking its toll on economic indicators. Three weeks have passed since Congress returned from the Thanksgiving recess and public sparring among President Barack Obama, House Speaker John Boehner and other leaders has delivered little in the form of a compromise plan to avoid hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts after Dec. 31.Click to PlayU.S. week ahead: Cliff, not SantaThe big news is more likely to be about the fiscal cliff than Santa Clauss impending arrival. Photo: AP.Everythings getting trumped by the fiscal cliff, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. Theres no better example of that this past week than the [Federal Open Market Committee] getting trumped.Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernankes announcement on Wednesday that the central bank would buy $45 billion a month in Treasury notes on top of its $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities purchases did little to cheer markets, which generally respond enthusiastically to further easing measures.              Read more on Wednesday's Fed announcement.    Thats whats been supporting markets but its not something thats fundamental to overall market health, said Doug Cot, U.S. chief market strategist at ING Investment Management.All three major U.S. indexes finished down for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average                     (DJI:DJIA) fell 0.2%, and the S&P 500 Index                     (SNC:SPX) shed 0.3%, snapping a streak of three weeks of gains for both. The Nasdaq Composite Index                     (NASDAQ:COMP) declined 0.2%. /quotes/zigman/627449 DJIA13,135.01,    -35.71,    -0.27%Dow Jones Industrial AverageEarlier in the week, Boehner reportedly told fellow Republicans not to make holiday plans, signaling that negotiations could go down to the Dec. 31 wire.              Read more on Boehner's holiday message to Republicans.    While politicians appear to be making little progress on a deal, Luschini said it would be interesting to see whether the drama in front of the microphones has affected economic data, especially with regards to consumers, who until recently had a fairly high confidence level.With that in mind, housing data will be a big focus, with the December home builders index coming out on Tuesday, and November existing-home sales on Thursday. Recently, Fannie Mae reported that Americans confidence in the housing market is growing.              Read more on Fannie Mae's housing confidence survey.    Also, Cot said November housing starts data on Wednesday will be important to see if recent strength in the housing market continues as consumers are reminded daily of the fiscal cliff. Consumer sentiment has taken a hit lately with preliminary data last week showing a drop to 74.5 in December from 82.7 in November.              Read more on December consumer sentiment.    That report, released by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters, will get an update on Friday, along with the release of personal income and consumer spending data for November by the Labor Department. On the corporate confidence side of things, the December Empire state index will be released on Monday, and the Philadelphia Fed report on December business activity comes out on Thursday.ReutersConsumer sentiment will get close scrutiny.So while theres been a huge divergence lately between consumer confidence and chief executive confidence, the coming week will give investors a better indication if consumers are growing as pessimistic as CEOs, or if CEOs are becoming more optimistic. Either way, one will catch up with the other, Luschini said.One thing investors should not expect is a quick resolution to the fiscal cliff, said Cot. The strategist is pessimistic that anything constructive will be accomplished in the coming week, and said he prefers the certainty of going over the fiscal cliff to the uncertainty created by the stalemate.I think they should go over the cliff, Cot said. I can understand it. I can discount it. I dont like the tax increases, but I like the spending cuts.Quarterly earnings just before ChristmasThe coming week also sees a return to some big-name quarterly earnings reports.On Tuesday, Oracle Corp.                     (NASDAQ:ORCL) reports quarterly results, followed by Accenture PLC                     (NYSE:ACN), Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.                     (NASDAQ:BBBY), FedEx Corp.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) on Wednesday.On Thursday, CarMax Inc.                     (NYSE:KMX), Carnival Corp.                     (NYSE:CCL), ConAgra Foods Inc.
