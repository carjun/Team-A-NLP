It's a shitty, underpaid and unappreciated job on the best of days. Take my advice and do something else  get an IT degree or become a teacher or something. You'll be happier.If you do decide to go on with your degree, then harden up. You'll be asked to do a lot of things you don't want to do, that seem cruel or classless, but remember that your job is to be completely dispassionate and harden up. Your job in a situation like this is to tell the stories of the dead and the survivors, to capture the fear and anger, to get the facts out there, to find a way to give the story meaning, to ensure that people are still talking about it a week from now, and, if possible, to leverage the work you do to create some sort of positive change in the world. As a reporter, you hold up the mirror to society, which won't always like what it sees reflected back. If you hold the mirror right, people won't even notice who's doing the holding, all they'll care about is fixing what's wrong with that picture.permalinksaveparent[+]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]Newshole 30 points31 points32 points 23 hours agoJournalist here as well. There's nothing inherently wrong with interviewing people if they want to be interviewed.But your personal ethics do come into play with what to ask. Many other reporters that I see and work with just have no off switch. Personally, I don't think I'd be approaching kids for an interview. I can't source them anyway. Parents though, are fair.  permalinksaveparent[+]Reformed_Asshole 15 points16 points17 points 23 hours ago (2 children)[]Reformed_Asshole 15 points16 points17 points 23 hours agoPlease stop telling people who have no passion for IT to get into the field.

Not that you must be either a reporter, or work in the IT field.permalinksaveparent[+]MilesColtrane 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]MilesColtrane 3 points4 points5 points 23 hours agoIt's underpaid and under appreciated, but it's still a fun job that presents something new everyday. I wouldn't suggest someone avoid journalism, as long as they know what to expect.The rest of what you said is excellent. I agree 100% on that.permalinksaveparent[+]clamhurt_legbeards 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours ago (3 children)[]clamhurt_legbeards 6 points7 points8 points 23 hours agoDo you include this as justifying asking seven year olds what it was like hearing gunshots?  Is this something journalists always did?  It's not the impression I've ever had of historical journalism but I may just be underexposed to it.permalinksaveparent[+]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes agoHow about a seven-year old running down a road in Vietnam, covered with burns from Napalm? This is a story about terrified children being gunned down by a sociopath  if a child is willing to talk to you, you talk to them. I personally don't like it when people talk down to kids, they're tougher and more honest than anybody. And if the reporter was talking to that child, chances are it was okay with their parents or whoever was looking after them, and with the child.It's not how I would cover the story, but it's valid.permalinksaveparent[+]pretentiousRatt 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago (1 child)[]pretentiousRatt 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoThere have always been slimy journalists with no shame or tact but since the emergence of the 24 hour news cycle on cable networks, shitty "journalists" are more widespread and get way more airtime.They have to fill 24 hours of the day with "BREAKING NEWS" so they need to ask insensitive questions and tend to speculate and repeat the same thing over and over ad nauseam. permalinksaveparent[+]clamhurt_legbeards 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]clamhurt_legbeards 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoI can see the financial incentive (and arguably necessity), but it seemed like hobbitlover was arguing his ethical justification for it, and I'm not clear on whether that was in fact what he intended.permalinksaveparent[+]Melbot3000 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago (0 children)[]Melbot3000 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours agoI was a journalism major 15 years ago and saw the direction the media was going.

It's thankless and low paying. When I say low paying, I'm talking about your manager going in and fixing your timecard to show that you didn't put in any over time, when in reality, you worked a 60 hour week. This happened many times at the station I used to work at. You will add credit card debt on top of your student loan debt, because you HAVE to have a credit card to survive. Seriously...unless you're positive that you absolutely love it and can deal with the unending stress....it's not worth it. permalinksaveparent[+]President_Camacho 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (0 children)[]President_Camacho 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoWell said. permalinksaveparent[+]mongoos3 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago (1 child)[]mongoos3 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoThank you for saying what I have been thinking and in a very eloquent way. But as much as these stories are painful to cover, there are so many that are beautiful and inspiring. The bad news just tends to overshadow the good news in times like these, and for good reason.permalinksaveparent[+]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 10 minutes agoI think it's usually a case of "too soon" that upsets people. Unfortunately that's how the 24 hour news cycle works these days  it's become competitive rather than contemplative.permalinksaveparent[+]IDriveAVan 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]IDriveAVan 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoReporters to me are a lot like defense attorneys. It's a pretty thankless job but one that this country (or any civilized country) couldn't exist without. That said, there is an invisible line of morality and decency in both professions that the good ones can recognize instinctively and the bad ones blow right past.permalinksaveparent[+]Cloakedboltz 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago (0 children)[]Cloakedboltz 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoIt's a shitty, underpaid and unappreciated job on the best of days.

I would expect nothing but those two attributes coming from a reporter.permalinksaveparent[+]pretentiousRatt -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours ago (2 children)[]pretentiousRatt -1 points0 points1 point 22 hours agoOne question. Why are you a reporter still?It sound like one of the worst jobs imaginable and you seem to realize how it has made you into a worse person (or at least made you do "cruel" and "classless" things). I know your job requires you to "harden up" and just not think about it but that is pathetic. I know it is said all the time on Reddit but your industry is probably the main thing wrong with the country. permalinksaveparent[+]FalconHunter 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago (0 children)[]FalconHunter 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago...you seem to realize how it has made you into a worse person (or at least made you do "cruel" and "classless" things).As you're educated in the various areas that lead to a career in journalism, you discover that everyone has an opinion. As a journalist, your job is to find and report only facts. This also includes things that you may find personally distasteful. Ex: If you're an Atheist and you're assigned a religion story that requires that you interview persons of faith. The story has nothing to do with challenging their religious convictions, and so you really have no business asking such questions, even though they conflict with your own personal views. You just report the story and ask the important questions that help flesh it out. The same goes in this case - some portion of the world will want to know "I can't imagine what it must have been like for those poor kids. I wonder what they were going through?" As a journalist, you're job is to ask that question if it's relevant to the story. In some cases, people like yourself will respond exactly as you have: angrily and condescendingly. But not everyone has your opinion, and you have to allow for that as a journalist - it's your job. To be fair, I got out because I couldn't take it anymore. It's absolutely miserable walking up to the mother of a homicide victim with a camera on your shoulder and having to grasp for the words to ask her to open up. As a viewer, we want to know what she's going through and empathize with her. As a reporter, we have to at least offer her a venue to express that if possible. I know it is said all the time on Reddit but your industry is probably the main thing wrong with the country. As a journalist, I would challenge you to provide supporting evidence to back up such a biased and outrageous claim...permalinksaveparent[+]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]hobbitlover 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoImagine how worse things would be without us. You can give the media shit for a lot of the bad things, but it's not fair if you don't credit the media for all the good things as well. Without media and running Romney's 47 percent speech, he'd probably be president right now. Without media, you wouldn't know about drug companies covering up side effects or the reasons for the economic meltdown. There are a lot of bad apples, but there are some good ones as well  would you throw out the entire basket?permalinksaveparent[+]AmishAvenger 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago (0 children)[]AmishAvenger 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoWell said. I think what a lot of people don't understand is that "What are you thinking" or "What are you feeling" aren't heartless or stupid questions to ask. In a way, what's being asked is "What's it like to be you right now?"With many news stories, that's the goal: to get to viewers to understand what it's like to be someone else.  It's difficult to get a point across without that, and as you said, it's important to hold up a mirror and get people to comprehend and think about events and the lives of others. permalinksaveparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
