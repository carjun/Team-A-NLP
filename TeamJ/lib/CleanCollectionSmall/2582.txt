LR & OWB were my favorite, DM was hard, but definitely an 'experience' more than anything. I actually can't wait to go back and do that one.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAt friends house, pulled on soap dish in bathroom and this is what happened.  by  Grayswandlrin  WTF[+]Fishooked 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Fishooked 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI thought this was a litter box at first glancepermalinksavecontextfull commentsDo we want factions in the next Fallout game?  by  diaryofalwaysin  Fallout[+]Fishooked -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]Fishooked -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day agoYes, but I would like to be able to do ALL of the quests in one playthrough.

Why can't they just use dollars? To confuse people on the exchange rate is my guess. Also I don't know why people just don't check ebay more often. There are always deals to be had, especially on older games. Sell your old one, and roll that PayPal into the new one.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHow Fallout helped me on a test  by  TheDMiesterin  Fallout[+]Fishooked 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Fishooked 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoThis is great.

Advice to make it easier/funner?  by  jeffm227in  Fallout[+]Fishooked 8 points9 points10 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Fishooked 8 points9 points10 points 2 days agoActually compared to Fallout:New Vegas, FO3 runs like a dream on the PS3. I dont know about anyone else, but I always set my games to 'Easy' by default. This may seem retarded to some, but my gaming hours are limited and precious so I don't want to spend those hours getting pissed of and challenged. Life is a challenge enough. permalinksavecontextfull commentsStreaker gets owned by mascot  by  homerpalooza101in  gifs[+]Fishooked 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]Fishooked 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoIS that Bumblebee Guy from the Simpsons? permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Jets May Sign WR Braylon Edwards  by  OvertimeDanin  nyjets[+]Fishooked 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]Fishooked 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoBraylon had nowhere near the amt of drops he did here, no way.
