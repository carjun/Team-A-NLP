But I definitely wouldn't call Montero close to a bust. He's 22, and he put up an wRC+ of 90, which, while not great, isn't all that terrible for a 22-year-old. If you mean bust in terms of him not being a very good catcher, then that's true, but everyone knew he wasn't a great catcher. Plus y'all have Zunino coming up anyway.permalinksavecontextfull commentsCan anyone remember the last time the (arguably) top prospect in baseball was traded?  by  awsternin  baseball[+]EinsteinDisguised 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]EinsteinDisguised 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoI wouldn't say a huge stretch.

You could get by missing "The Next Doctor" and "Planet of the Dead", but "The Waters of Mars" is amazing, and "The End Of Time" is great as well.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday, 32 years ago John Lennon was murdered  by  dojjankmanin  Music[+]EinsteinDisguised -1 points0 points1 point 7 days ago (0 children)[]EinsteinDisguised -1 points0 points1 point 7 days agoI wasn't alive at the time, and wouldn't be for another 12 years.

Reddit, what irational fear did you have as a kid?  by  whatmeno1in  AskReddit[+]EinsteinDisguised 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago*(0 children)[]EinsteinDisguised 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago*The X-Files intro song still gives me the creeps, and I'm 20. Edit: To expand on this, I didn't ever get into the show, but I watched one episode when  I was a kid where there were these green insects that like, devoured people. I always remembered that. Flash forward ~14 years, and I have Netflix, and lo and behold, I find that episode ("Darkness Falls"). I watched it recently, and it's still creepy as fuck. Also, the theme is creepy. Add in the weird images of the intro, and it's still pretty scary.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat Hall Of Fame players do you think are least deserving to be in the Hall of Fame?
