These acts are not committed by sane, well-adjusted people, they are committed by people with unrecognized and untreated mental illnesses who have fallen through the cracks because they can't afford basic bloody treatment or worse are deterred from seeking it due to rampant discrimination against the mentally ill. I don't know what exactly has happened to make this environment where we have a few mass shootings per year, but you can be damned sure the rate would reduce if we just fucking cared about these people when they need it most.permalinksavecontextfull commentsPat Chapin addresses hate speech and Magic (WARNING: Triggers and adult language)  by  ChampBlankmanin  magicTCG[+]BrofistMeatbear 11 points12 points13 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]BrofistMeatbear 11 points12 points13 points 4 days agoSaying that rape is about sex is like saying that murder is about stabbing.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your favorite video game soundtrack?  by  GDT38in  Games[+]BrofistMeatbear 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)[]BrofistMeatbear 1 point2 points3 points 4 days agoBastion hands down.

This is a long one.  by  NewQuisitorin  FanTheories[+]BrofistMeatbear 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)[]BrofistMeatbear 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoI very much agree. I love 40K fluff, but it's been so damn stagnant and plagued by Space Marine-centric BS. I've been kicking around a theory/timeline of what I think should happen for a while:It all starts with the Necrons. They start awakening en masse, and it turns out there are more hidden Necron tomb worlds than anyone ever dreamed of. They pop up in force in all across the galaxy, but mainly in the western quadrant. All of the races take horrific losses. The Eldar are forced back to the Craftworlds, the Imperium flees to defend the inner worlds and Terra and the forces of Chaos are scattered pretty much everywhere. This leads to the second major shifting event: the uniting of the Orks. The Necrons chose to mostly skirt Ork-controlled worlds in favor of hitting more organized Imperium and Eldar planets that could actually pose a threat to them. The Orks smell a big fight, and under the leadership of good old Warboss Gazghkull, they launch the biggest Waaaaaaagh! of all time against the Necrons from the southern quadrant. Nearly every Ork tribe in existence participates in some way, and the Necrons are beaten back to a stalemate.By the time the Necrons and Orks have fought themselves to this stalemate, the third shifting event happens: the arrival of the main Tyranid host from the north. They make previous Hive Fleets looks like the scouting forces they were and spread out across the galaxy like the locusts they are. Smelling food, they go right for the bulk of the Necron and Ork forces, inflicting horrific losses and eventually reaching a stalemate themselves. So the Necrons, Orks and Tyranids are fighting to an unimaginably viscous three-way stalemate in the west, south and north respectively. The Eldar, Imperium and forces of Chaos are driven into hiding, and even the Chaos gods are basically powerless to do much against such numbers (also three of the four dont really care/choose not to act). The Core Worlds of the Imperium are constantly hammered by elements of one or all of the Big Three, but theyre ultimately mostly focused on killing each other. Still, Terra is not going to hold long against such an onslaught. Just as things looks the most dire for humanity, the Golden Throne fails and the Emperor diesonly to be immediately reborn as an actual, real life GOD! No hunt for the Star Child, no Illuminati BS, just pure, instant divine reincarnation. Bolstered by the return-and-then-some of their God-Emperor, the Imperium stabilizes and even retakes some key planets in the Core. The Emperor quickly realizes the futility of the fight and makes the drastic decision of forging the first ever lasting alliance with the fledgling Tau empire. Though they have not really been touched yet, the Tau also realize just how fucked they ultimately are without help and accept, whereas the majority of the Imperium population accepts because the motherfucking reborn God-Emperor told them so. Such is his authority that he is able to do away with centuries of xenophobic tendencies with a single decree (after all, if there is one thing the Imperium values above xenophobia, its devotion to the Emperor). Given upgraded warp technology by the Imperium, the Tau are able to greatly expand their sphere of influence and actually provide material aid to the beleaguered Imperium. Given vastly improved technology and battle tactics by the Tau, the Imperium is able to upgrade the already formidable weaponry of the Space Marines and finally bring the Imperial Guard up to speed as the modern era fighting force it so desperately wants to be. Theyre still horrendously outnumbered and outgunned even with the IG, but Tau technology, Space Marine experience, and the leadership of the Reborn Emperor mean they wont fold immediately.   Around the same time as these events, Khorne is getting a bit restless. Galvanized by the unprecedented level of war in the galaxy and angered by the reluctance of his fellow Chaos gods to take the fight to the enemy, Khorne loses his shit and launches a full-scale assault against Slaneesh and its followers. After a long and bloody struggle, Khorne is victorious and kills Slaneesh dead. Tzeentch, seeing an opportunity, launches his own assault against the weakened Khorne, but underestimates his bloodlust and is killed himself. Nurgle is all like whatever, dude and backs off to play with his poisons, so Khorne is now sole leader of pretty much all the fighting forces of Chaos. And fight they do. With Khorne leading all of them, the forces of Chaos are able to make up for their diminished numbers with pure ferocity and brutality. Eventually, they actually retake much of the northern quadrant and force the Tyranids more towards the northeast. Meanwhile, the Eldar have gone from dying race to basically dead race. Untold scores of Eldar have died in the renewed conflict, and the Eldar really didnt have the numbers to support the war even before it flared. Their brand of hope lies in the Harlequins. Masters of travel and staying alive, the Harlequins take control of moving the Craftworlds to avoid consumption or destruction. They grow to excel at this role, constantly keeping the beleaguered dregs of the Eldar race just ahead of the front lines. The death of Slaneesh represents an opportunity for them, as it allows them to take the vast swaths of Eldar souls lost in the war that they have been keeping in the Craftworlds Infinity Circuits and use them to spur the creation of a new Eldar god: Ynnead, the God of Death. Turns out the prophecy that he would arise only when the Eldar had been all but wiped out was true. Ynnead does two important things. First, he implants as many of the fallen Eldar souls as possible into as many Wraithguards and Wraithlords as possible and bestows them a link to his own sight, eliminating the cumbersome issues of Warpsight that plagued such machines and turning them into true reborn Eldar more akin to Imperium Dreadnoughts. Second, he immediately makes contact with the reborn God-Emperor and proposes Eldar entry into the Imperium-Tau alliance. The Emperor eagerly accepts, both for the manpower boost and for the use of the Eldars extensive webway network that would make such a far-stretching alliance possible (and again, hes God so nobody questions it). And so the Tau, the Imperium and the Eldar form a three-way alliance against forces that individually would slaughter them all. Tau technology, Eldar Super-Wraithlords/guards and Imperium numbers combine to make the alliance roughly equivalent to one of the other newly ubercharged factions.  Sothe galaxy is in a five-way melee between the awakened Necrons, the united Orks, the Tyranid super-Hive Fleet, Khornes forces of Chaos and the Imperium-Eldar-Tau alliance. Tell me thats not an improvement on what we have now.  permalinksavecontextfull comments13234ELI5: The Fair Tax (self.explainlikeimfive)submitted 1 month ago by BrofistMeatbear to explainlikeimfive5 commentssharecancelloading...14123What are your Fantasy Pro Tour RtR rosters?

The timelines don't match up, but everything that far back is shrouded in mystery anyway, so it seems plausible. "This in itself may be evidence of what happened to the original Men of Iron. As sentient beings, they could have been corrupted by Chaos and then turned on their creators."The friendly Reapers were eventually corrupted by the touch of Chaos once humanity expanded far enough to encounter it. I love it. permalinksavecontextfull comments18678Aliens have made contact and request one piece of art that best summarizes our species. What do we give them?

A conflict of both questionable legitimacy and sufficient scale to actually warrant a draft. In that case, I'd be in Canada so fast I'd leave one of those cartoon style dust outlines. A government that is willing to send vast swaths of their young population to their deaths when there is considerable doubt about the legitimacy of the war is not a government I want any part of. I would consider breaking the law, leaving the country, and speaking out against the horror of the draft to be a civic duty more powerful and meaningful than marching off to die "for my country". My generation has the benefit of hindsight, of knowing how despicable Vietnam was. I would hope this would push the number of objectors in my generation to critical mass earlier rather than later so we would not have to wait for years to pass and American boys to die to mount an effective resistance to the war.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Fallacy of the Terminator Theory  by  BrofistMeatbearin  Futurology[+]BrofistMeatbear[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]BrofistMeatbear[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months agoNo worries, it's possible I could have phrased that a bit better.permalinksavecontextfull commentsThe Fallacy of the Terminator Theory  by  BrofistMeatbearin  Futurology[+]BrofistMeatbear[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago (0 children)[]BrofistMeatbear[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago...that's exactly what I'm saying.permalinksavecontextfull commentsProbably my favorite comic.

I never said AI safety should not be a top concern, and I never said that "unshackled" AI could never be dangerous. It's the hair trigger unwarranted extrapolation that potentially dangerous AI=AI that will immediately kill us all that I'm speaking out against. That's what will make this subreddit useless, when we alienate possible mainstream supporters by assuming the absolute worst.Am I saying some posters should stop wishing for the apocalypse because it makes us look bad? Yes, I absolutely am. It's a shortsighted failure of imagination emblematic of everything that is preventing Futurology from entering the mainstream.  permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
