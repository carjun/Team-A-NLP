However, that law does not say that employer can not pay employees for work past 40 hours, just that they are not required to pay them time and a half for it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsToday I quit my job of 6 years, effectively canceling my boss' vacation plans.

Working some amount of overtime for a salaried position is one thing. Working unpaid overtime as an hourly employee is a violation of workers rights and weakens the position of workers in all similar jobs.permalinksavecontextfull commentsAm I an asshole for thinking that a bigger girl who broke my couch should help me replace it?  by  mrwatkins83in  AskReddit[+]pilotbread 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago (0 children)[]pilotbread 0 points1 point2 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onHowever, this situation is more analagous to going to a friend's house with two strangers, and badgering the host into letting you cook in their kitchen because your friends are hungry, and then one of them breaks a pot in the process.If you're already being shitty to someone, and as a result something is broken, I expect someone to understand that they've added injury to insult and make ammends, EVEN IF it wasn't their direct fault for breaking it. Maybe the couch-breaking person can't afford a new couch. They can probably afford a six pack or a meal somewhere to make up for it.permalinksavecontextfull commentsComcast has run out of patience with the avalanche of BitTorrent lawsuits in the United States. The ISP is now refusing to comply with court-ordered subpoenas, arguing that they are intended to shake down subscribers by coercing them to pay settlements.

From my understanding, they go to the ISP and say "here's a list of violators. Who are they and where do they live" and the ISP gives it to them (or doesn't, or can't in a few cases due to anonymity)I wasn't implying that Comcast is keeping tabs on it and actively pursuing this legal fracas, just that they weren't previously making it hard on the content owners when they wanted to find out who a pirate was.If my knowledge of this stuff is incorrect, please let me know.permalinksavecontextfull commentsComcast has run out of patience with the avalanche of BitTorrent lawsuits in the United States.

I have Comcast internet, and if there was an option for "Won't rat you out for torrenting" that cost another 10 or 15 bucks a month, I'd go for it. I'm absolutely in favor of monetizing the protection of the customer, because that will ensure faster than anything else that all ISPs will provide the same service.EDIT: Yes, folks, I'm aware that there are safe(r) ways to pirate things. That's not entirely my point (see my post below). I want ISPs to stop cow-towing to record/tv/movie companies more than I want to be able to download Game of Thrones without HBO yelling at me.permalinksavecontextfull comments[Prometheus] Engineers may have disagreed on the fate of earth (spoilers)  by  Evil_Morgin  FanTheories[+]pilotbread 1 point2 points3 points 6 months ago (0 children)[]pilotbread 1 point2 points3 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThis is pretty much entirely unfounded, but I've been wondering what David actually said to the Engineer. Given his obsession with Shaw's faith, I think he completely ignored what Shaw and Weyland were saying and asked if the Engineer's believed in a soul or an afterlife. I interpreted the touch from the Engineer before he ripped David's head off as one of pity, as a "how petty and small minded you are"permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis is why I love the Robot Mafia  by  down_vote_magnetin  funny[+]pilotbread 10 points11 points12 points 6 months ago (0 children)[]pilotbread 10 points11 points12 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on"But what if management remains intragnisant""By the context, it is clear what you mean"permalinksavecontextfull commentsThrowaway time: what is the one illegal, immoral, criminal, or disgusting thing you've always wanted to do or try?  by  AmericanDerpin  AskReddit[+]pilotbread 3 points4 points5 points 7 months ago (0 children)[]pilotbread 3 points4 points5 points 7 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI'm your captain, I'm your captain.
