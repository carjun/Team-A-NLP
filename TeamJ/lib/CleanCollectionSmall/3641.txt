Fahrenthold Medical examiner says victims suffered multiple gunshot wounds and appeared to have died quickly.  Gun-control advocates say massacre may be tipping point for stronger laws Philip Rucker In a debate once pushed to back burner, Dems pressure Obama to call for stricter limits on weapons.Shooters weapon has a deadly history Sari Horwitz Bushmaster can quickly fire multiple high-velocity rounds.Mother of shooter, Nancy Lanza, collected guns, prepared for the worst Peter Hermann and Michael S. Rosenwald First victim of rampage collected guns, told landscaper she took son to firing range to practice his aim.Mass shootings across the U.S. in 2012 The Washington Post GRAPHIC | Two of the deadliest massacres happened this year, but 11 others also claimed lives.A really rambunctious kid, as one former neighbor in Newtown, Conn., recalled him, adding that he was on medication. He was the son of an accountant. A family member told investigators that he had a form of autism, a law enforcement official said.And he will long be remembered.On Friday morning, police say, he shot and killed his mother in their home. And then, carrying firearms and an abundance of ammunition, he drove to Newtowns Sandy Hook Elementary School and started shooting. By the time he turned one of the guns on himself, police say, he had killed 20 children, many of them kindergartners, and six more adults.Adam Peter Lanza  a new addition to a dreadful list, the roster of killers who targeted students: Seung Hui Cho at Virginia Tech (32 dead); Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold at Columbine High in Colorado (13 dead), Charles C. Roberts IV at a little Amish schoolhouse in Pennsylvania (five dead). The litany of massacres goes on.As scores of investigators worked Friday to piece together what happened at the school and why, the barest details of Lanzas life began to emerge.His parents, Nancy and Peter Lanza, separated about a decade ago, and his mother remained in the familys home with her sons, Adam and Ryan Lanza, according to Ryan Kraft, 25, who was a neighbor.The separation hit the children hard, Kraft recalled.When Nancy Lanza would go out to dinner with friends, she sometimes relied on Kraft to watch Adam Lanza, who was too boisterous for Ryan Lanza to manage. He would have tantrums, Kraft said. They were much more than the average kid [had]. Yet he was not prone to violence, Kraft said.The kids seemed really depressed by the breakup, Kraft said of the Lanza brothers.  Ryan Lanza, 24, now lives in Hoboken, N.J. Police questioned him Friday, but law enforcement officials said he was cooperating and is not suspected of having anything to do with the shootings.For several hours Friday, authorities and the news media misidentified the shooter as Ryan Lanza, who, like his father, is an accountant, a law enforcement official said.The Wall Street Journal quoted a friend of Ryan Lanzas as saying that Lanza works for Ernst & Young. He [is] a little shy, but very nice and sweet, the friend, Katie Colaneri, 24, of Hoboken, told the Journal.Nancy Lanza put the best face possible on her domestic troubles, the former neighbor said. Nancy was really pleasant, Kraft said. She would come by the house and have a glass of wine with my mom. The couples divorce was finalized in 2009, according to court records.Beth Israel, who lived for a time on the same street as the Lanzas, recalled Adam Lanza as withdrawn but not threatening in any way.Overall, I would just call him a socially awkward kid, I dont know, shy and quiet. Didnt really look you in the eye, Israel said in a telephone interview Friday night. Just kind of a weird kid, maybe. I cant tell you any specific incidents why [I thought so], she said.At a vigil in Newtown, a man of about Adam Lanzas age was visibly distraught. I knew Adam in high school, he said, declining to give his name. He always seemed like a quiet type. He was never really sociable. When you try to communicate with him, he would just kind of like have one- or two-word responses. He was a wicked smart kid, he excelled in everything, the man said. He graduated high school three years early.The man defended Adams mother and objected to some reports about her. I know her. My family knew her. She was a respectable collector [of guns]. She used them responsibly. Its not her fault that any of this happened.At the vigil, Catherine Urso said her son went to high school with Adam Lanza, who was very remote, reclusive. Lanza and his friends, she said, always gathered alone in a corner in the school. A law enforcement official  who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is far from finished  said Adam Lanza fatally shot his mother in her home, then drove in her car to Sandy Hook Elementary.He had two semiautomatic pistols and a .223-caliber rifle, law enforcement officials said. He apparently used only the handguns, which were later found in the school. The rifle was found in the vehicle.Peter Lanza, a vice president and tax specialist at GE Energy Financial Services, is remarried and lives in Stamford, Conn., according to the Stamford Advocate. When he arrived home Friday and was approached by a reporter, the paper reported, he appeared surprised and horrified and declined to comment on the massacre.A woman who is a close friend of Peter Lanzas became highly emotional in a brief telephone interview Friday. His son was doing wonderfully, she said of Adam Lanza. This is inconceivable. Peter adores his children. His son was doing so well.Lynch reported from Newtown, Conn.
