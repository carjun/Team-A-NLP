If all those children had been armed this would have turned out MUCH better.EDIT:  /sarcasmpermalinksaveparent[+]xXAmericanJediXx 3 points4 points5 points 34 minutes ago (2 children)[]xXAmericanJediXx 3 points4 points5 points 34 minutes agoNo one is advocating giving guns to kids, but if a few of the teachers had been armed they might have been able to stop this.permalinksaveparent[+]SmashingTool 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]SmashingTool 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoAs if parents would be comfortable with that ideapermalinksaveparent[+]BrosephDudeson 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago (0 children)[]BrosephDudeson 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoMost if not all schools in my state have police officers that live there in a trailer. There is always an armed officer on site. I'm all about concealed carry, but I can't say I think it would be okay for teachers to be armed.permalinksaveparent[+]Burninator01 -3 points-2 points-1 points 46 minutes ago (4 children)[]Burninator01 -3 points-2 points-1 points 46 minutes agoProblem is all the recent mass shooting tend to be in gun free zones. Aurora, yesterdays Oregon mall shooting, Virginia tech.  If a teacher was able to conceal carry he could have been stopped.permalinksaveparent[+]mr99 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes ago (3 children)[]mr99 1 point2 points3 points 30 minutes ago...or he could be dead now too...or he could have killed even more in the crossfire and panic.permalinksaveparent[+]Burninator01 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes ago (1 child)[]Burninator01 1 point2 points3 points 26 minutes agoMy guess is this guy was killing everyone he saw.  Are you really going to not shoot someone because there may have been someone in the crossfire?permalinksaveparent[+]mr99 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (0 children)[]mr99 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes agoMy point is the false logic that a teacher would have just stopped this easily with another gun. This isn't a movie or TV the hypothetical teacher with the other gun could have ended up among the body count or have added to it...not everyone with a gun is a marksman and trained to responded right away in a rational way in a surprise attack...guns plus more guns does not equal better...permalinksaveparent[+]Boston_Jason 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)[]Boston_Jason 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes agoYou are correct. There should only be victims.
