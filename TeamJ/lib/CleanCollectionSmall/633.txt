Fahrenthold, Dec 16, 2012 07:28 PM ESTThe Washington Post NEWTOWN, Conn.  President Obama will arrive here Sunday to meet family members of those killed in Fridays shooting rampage, carrying out the awful rituals of mass death and national grief for his fourth time in just four years as president.Now, however, Obama will face a new and higher level of pressure from advocates of gun control, saying that this time, he must do more than simply grieve.

Fahrenthold Medical examiner says victims suffered multiple gunshot wounds and appeared to have died quickly.  Gun-control advocates say massacre may be tipping point for stronger laws Philip Rucker In a debate once pushed to back burner, Dems pressure Obama to call for stricter limits on weapons.Shooters weapon has a deadly history Sari Horwitz Bushmaster can quickly fire multiple high-velocity rounds.Mother of shooter, Nancy Lanza, collected guns, prepared for the worst Peter Hermann and Michael S. Rosenwald First victim of rampage collected guns, told landscaper she took son to firing range to practice his aim.Mass shootings across the U.S. in 2012 The Washington Post GRAPHIC | Two of the deadliest massacres happened this year, but 11 others also claimed lives.They want him to make a strong push for new laws to restrict weapons like the semiautomatic rifle used in Fridays massacre. On Sunday afternoon, the Connecticut state medical examiner released new details about the two deaths that began and ended Fridays massacre. A spokeswoman said that Nancy Lanza, the suspected gunmans mother, was shot multiple times in the head at the home she shared with her son. Adam Lanza, 20, then apparently left their home with three guns from his mothers collection, and killed 26 more peopleincluding 20 small childrenat Sandy Hook Elementary. Adam Lanza then killed himself, with a single gunshot wound to the head, according to the medical examiners office. Police said Lanza was already dead when the first officers arrived.During his visit here, Obama is expected to meet with the families of the victims of Fridays shooting. He  will then speak at an interfaith vigil in the evening in Newtown.Obama made similar visits to Fort Hood, Tex., in 2009, Tucson in 2011 and Aurora, Colo., this July  each time, in the aftermath of a gunmans spree. Obama has tended to focus on emotion and healing in these moments, touching only lightly on the subject of guns and gun control.This time, already, some politicians are urging Obama to take a different tone, and cast this fourth tragedy as evidence of a broader problem with U.S. gun laws. On Sunday morning, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) said this was the moment to bring back an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I)  perhaps the countrys best-known advocate for gun control  said Obama should act while the countrys attention is focused on the damage that an assault weapon can do. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) vowed Sunday to introduce legislation to ban assault weapons at the start of the next Congress. And Connecticuts own governor, Dan Malloy (D), told CBS Newss Bob Schieffer that this rampage seemed to prove that his states tough gun laws were not tough enough.When someone can use an assault weapon to enter a building, actually shoot out that which was preventing him getting in the building, have clips of up to 30 rounds on a weapon that can almost instantaneously fire those, you have to start to question whether assault weapons should be allowed to be distributed the way they are in the United States. Youre right, Connecticut has pretty tough regulations, Malloy said on Face the Nation.But obviously they didnt prevent this woman from acquiring that weapon and obviously allowed the son to come into possession of those and use them in a most disastrous way, Malloy said.Continued1234Next PageEmailTumblrRedditStumbleuponDiggDeliciousDiscussion Policy | FAQ | About DiscussionsLoading...CommentsAdd your commentRead what others are sayingAbout BadgesSuperFan BadgeSuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.More about badges | Request a badgeCulture Connoisseur BadgeCulture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.More about badges | Request a badgeFact Checker BadgeFact Checkers contribute questions, information and facts to The Fact Checker.More about badges | Request a badgeWashingtologist BadgeWashingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.More about badges | Request a badgePost Writer BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.Post Forum BadgePost Forum members consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on politics, national and international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgeWeather Watcher BadgeWeather Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on climates and forecasts.More about badges | Request a badgeWorld Watcher BadgeWorld Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on international affairs.More about badges | Request a badgePost Contributor BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post contributor.
