Families will not be able to see their loved ones at least until tomorrow because the crime scene is so extensive, she said. Birge said most of the families seemed to have children who were 5 or 6 years old.President Obama ordered flags to be flown at half-staff."We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years, and each time I hear the news, I react not as a president but as everybody else would, as a parent," Obama said in an emotional televised address during which he dabbed his eyes. "And that is especially true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do."AlsoPhotos:Massacre at elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Who they were: Connecticut school shooting victimsFull coverage: Connecticut school shootingTranscript and video: Obama's speechTimeline: Deadliest U.S. mass shootingsObama added, "The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own."Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, wouldn't say whether the shooting would make gun control a higher priority on the president's agenda, but he said there would be a day for discussion on that subject."But I don't think today is that day," he said.Others did not delay in calling for gun legislation. "This touches us all so deeply, and it is long past time that we enacted sensible gun laws and school safety legislation," Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said in a statement.Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter attends the school and took shelter in a corner during the shooting. She was unhurt. "It's alarming, especially in Newtown, Conn., which we always thought was the safest place in America," he said in a TV interview.Late Friday, somber-faced residents streamed into St. Rose of Lima Church on a hill near central Newtown for a memorial. Wreaths were unloaded from the back of a van.Brian Wallace, spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport, said the parish may have lost seven to 10 members in the shooting."Many people in there have been profoundly affected by this," Wallace said. "Their world has been turned upside down."As the service began, Malloy said, "May God bless our children today, and those who were taken away."The night before the shootings, Georgeann Manfredonia said, she spent a couple of hours wrapping presents for the school principal and teachers."It's a wonderful school run by an amazing principal," she said."She's just the most positive, energetic person you've ever met."Manfredonia said her upscale neighborhood  home to lawyers, doctors and executives  had always felt safe, with little crime she could recall. She said she volunteers at the school library and in her daughter's classroom.The principal, Dawn Hochsprung, was presumed to be among the dead."I took it so for granted that these people would always be there," Manfredonia said. "It breaks my heart that the principal may not be there anymore."She added, "I just want to go back on Monday and have it all be the same happy place it's always been."richard.serrano@latimes.comalana.semuels@latimes.comtina.susman@latimes.comSerrano reported from Washington and Susman and Semuels from Newtown.Times staff writers Robin Abcarian, Marisa Gerber, Andrew Khouri, Michael Muskal and Sam Quinones in Los Angeles, Kim Murphy in Seattle and Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this report.Copyright  2012, Los Angeles Timesprevious12|  single pageComments49Comments (49)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQPink-Views at 11:39 AM December 15, 2012                2 mass killings within 2 weeks:Oregon mall shooterConn schooterSome people can't cope with this bad economy. Pres. Obama need to hurry to propose more economic stimulus programs. Too many Americans are stressing out.jopsjennings at 9:53 AM December 15, 2012                Gun control might be a good thing, but it has little to do with how or whether this massacre took place. At heart, ours is a bloodthirsty society full of a-holes, which is given to glorifying violence in entertainment and in the individuals who are chosen to receive the most respect and honor.Was this murderer even capable of making a full distinction between his planned massacre and the video games he probably played regularly?It will be easy to pass a couple of laws against guns, and might even help. But what will we do in terms of confronting the thirst for blood in our American hearts that truly drives these kinds of mass-slayings? Are we willing to dial the violence of our movies and video games down a notch? Are we willing to discontinue the death penalty? What about cage fighting? We are so full of frustration and hatred, that some of these most violent activities have become cathartic and sacred to us. And when hatred is that pervasive, destructive weapons will be made available one way or another.LouieOfWaikiki at 9:50 AM December 15, 2012                "Evil visited this community today," Gov.Dannel P. Malloysaid Friday evening. The real evil that visited is the blood money that is so cherished in our society, and the cowardice of the poiticians who ignore these heinous outcomes. The second amendment says that we have the right to a well regulated militia, and to keep and bear arms. That's it. It does specify that we can have semi-automatics and no one can argue that semi automatics belong in a private citizens hands for any constructive purpose. If you have a driver's license, it does not give license to drive a Formula 1 race cars on public roadways, and for good reason. Background checks are all well and good, and should be in place for the purchase of "useful" firearms (e.g. hunting rifles), but a nation-wide ban on weapons of mass killing with no grandfather clause is what's needed now, before it's too late again.Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
