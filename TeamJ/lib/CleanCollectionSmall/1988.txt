In other words, mental illness may afflict a great proportion of "sick" people, but mentally ill people are not generally "sick" in the way I defined the term. Most mental illness is internalized suffering.permalinksavecontextfull commentsShooting at Connecticut elementary school.

A "cover up" was attempted by the prepetrators. There are likely many dozens, if not hundreds, of cases as severe that were covered up. However, in this case the primary perpetrator received the strictest sentence he would have in any other western court (life without parole). Granted, this crime certainly warranted the strictest punishment under US law (death), and in accordance with consistency and justice that should have been the sentence applied. That is what prosecutors sought, but I think there was a holdout juror. The other participants also received far too lenient sentences.Oversight in warzones is a serious problem that needs to be addressed and dealt with far more honorably. That being said, the actual subject at hand is state-sanctioned torture in an environment like a prison, and indefinite incarceration without due process.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen the hell is it supposed to start showing?  by  Ihazaflavorin  loseit[+]pissoutofmyass 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pissoutofmyass 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoYes indeed, I use clothes as my primary indicator of progress.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhen the hell is it supposed to start showing?  by  Ihazaflavorin  loseit[+]pissoutofmyass 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago (0 children)[]pissoutofmyass 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoThere is probably some difference, but you see yourself everyday in the mirror so its less noticeable.
