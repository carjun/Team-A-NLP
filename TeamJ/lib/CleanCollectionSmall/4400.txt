A gunman opened fire inside a Connecticut elementary school Friday, killing 26 people, including 18 children, and forcing students to cower in classrooms and then flee with the help of teachers and police.The death toll was given to The Associated Press by an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way.The shooting appeared to be the nation's second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007.Parents flooded to Sandy Hook Elementary School, about 60 miles northeast of New York City, looking for their children in the wake of the shooting. Students were told to close their eyes by police as they were led from the building.A photo taken by The Newtown Bee newspaper showed a group of young students  some crying, others looking visibly frightened  being escorted by adults through a parking lot in a line, hands on each other's shoulders.Students and staff were among the victims, state police Lt. Paul Vance said a brief news conference. He also said the gunman was dead inside the school, but he refused to say how people were killed.Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way, said the gunman apparently had two guns.A law enforcement official in Washington said the attacker was a 20-year-old man with ties to the school and that one of the guns was a .223-caliber rifle. The official also said that police were searching a location in New Jersey in connection with the shootings. That official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the source was not authorized to speak on the record about the developing criminal investigation.Robert Licata said his 6-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher."That's when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door," he said. "He was very brave. He waited for his friends."He said the shooter didn't say a word.Stephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was fine."It's alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America," he said.A dispatcher at the Newtown Volunteer Ambulance Corps said a teacher had been shot in the foot and taken to Danbury Hospital. Andrea Rynn, a spokeswoman at the hospital, said it had three patients from the school but she did not have information on the extent or nature of their injuries.Mergim Bajraliu, 17, heard the gunshots echo from his home and raced to check on his 9-year-old sister at the school. He said his sister, who was fine, heard a scream come over the intercom at one point. He said teachers were shaking and crying as they came out of the building."Everyone was just traumatized," he said.Richard Wilford's 7-year-old son, Richie, is in the second grade at the school. His son told him that he heard a noise that "sounded like what he described as cans falling."The boy told him a teacher went out to check on the noise, came back in, locked the door and had the kids huddle up in the corner until police arrived."There's no words," Wilford said. "It's sheer terror, a sense of imminent danger, to get to your child and be there to protect him."Melissa Makris, 43, said her 10-year-old son, Philip, was in the school gym."He said he heard a lot of loud noises and then screaming. Then the gym teachers immediately gathered the children in a corner and kept them safe in a corner," Makris said.The fourth-grader told his mother that the students stayed huddled until police came in the gym. He also told her that he saw what looked like a body under a blanket as he fled the school."He said the policeman came in and helped them get out of the building and told them to run," Makris said. "And they ran to the firehouse."The White House said Barack Obama was notified of the shooting and his spokesman Jay Carney said the president had "enormous sympathy for families that are affected."___Associated Press writers Jim Fitzgerald in Newtown, Pete Yost in Washington, D.C., and Michael Melia in Hartford contributed to this report.Copyright 2012 by The Associated Press.

I've been saying the same thing for years. Instead of protecting the rest of the world...PROTECT US!saywhat37December 14, 2012 3:13 p.m.ALL YOU GUN LOVERS JUST DON'T CARE!  How many times does this have to happen before you decide you have enough weapons?  You rather see your mother kicked out of the nursing home due to "budget cuts" than to have a ban on ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS!  How much money is being spent on the judicial system because some gun nut is having a bad day? These weapons need to be banned now.  You ban the private sales of this things then that is less of these falling into the wrong hands.  You say that there will always a way for someone to obtain one illegally but that is NO EXCUSE keep allowing these things to be massed produced! I don't care if it not technically an "assault weapon" because of whatever specs it has.  It does not matter!  Get these things off the streets now!  Melt them down.  They do nothing good!  WHEN IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH?  ENOUGH IS NOW!ALL HAIL MEDecember 14, 2012 2:59 p.m.I am so sick and tired of shootings at schools. We send troops all over the world to play policeman and yet we can't protect our kids from the spineless monsters here in our own country. Get serious authorities, do whatever it takes to stop these horrific events. Bring troops home and place them in and around all schools. I don't care what you have to do....just do something to stop this from ever happening again. And Obama, don't you dare go on TV and say you're sorry unless you also plan to say what you're going to do to make sure this never happens again.  Schools are places of learning, not killing fields for lunatics. Fence in schools, place armed guards at all entrances......I don't care, BUT it has to stop now. Nobody should be able to get near a school with a firearm especially a rifle, NOBODY.gr8dadDecember 14, 2012 1:49 p.m.The wheels of justice grind slowly, but they grind exceeding fine.nonemeantDecember 14, 2012 1:41 p.m. 4 COMMENTSMultimedia SpotlightMass shootings in 2012Timeline: Gun control debateGay marriage laws across the USHoliday Guide: Events, gifts, recipes,Holiday lights 2012Temperature TrackmoreNational & WorldTwenty-six people, including 20 children, were killed in a shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school Friday.
