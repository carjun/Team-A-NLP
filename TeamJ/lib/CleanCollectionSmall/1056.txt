In a television address, President Obama said that as a nation, we have been through this too many times. He broke off and took a long breath to suppress a sob. He wiped his eyes and pushed ahead. These children are our children.Along with many other politicians, he pledged meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, but did not offer specifics. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday was a day to feel enormous sympathy for families that are affected and to do everything we can to support state and local law enforcement. ... Im sure [there] will be a day for discussion of the usual Washington policy debates, but I dont think today is that day.The death toll in Newtown is second only to that of the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007, in which 32 were killed. The massacre at Sandy Hook occurred five months after a gunman in Colorado killed 12 people in a movie theater where the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises was opening, and two years after a shooter in Tucson killed six people and injured 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).Newtown, a town of 28,000 eight miles outside Danbury and an hours drive northeast of New York City, is an affluent community with good schools and a population dominated by college graduates. Sandy Hook is a well-regarded school; year after year, its students score far higher than the state average on standardized tests.Sandy Hooks principal, Dawn Hochsprung, had recently installed a new security system in which the school doors were kept locked all day starting at 9:30 a.m.Some parents said the shooter probably was able to walk in unquestioned because school employees knew he was a teachers son. Adam Lanza arrived at Sandy Hook in his mothers car, law enforcement sources said.Hochsprung, known for her infectious laugh, dressed up last month as the Book Fairy  replete with light-up dress and crown  to inspire children to read. Hochsprung, who was married and had two daughters and three stepdaughters, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that her students were enjoying the rehearsal for our 4th grade winter concert.Police found three firearms: two handguns inside the school, a Sig Sauer and a Glock, and a .223 Bushmaster brand rifle in a car outside the building. A law enforcement official said the weapons were obtained legally and were registered to a family member.After police determined that the shooter was not at large, the students were taken to a nearby firehouse, where they sat with classmates as teachers wrote up a list of everyone who was there. Parents, many of them sobbing, arrived to reunite with their children.It was elbow-to-elbow people crying, Wasik said. No one could tell you where to go. People were screaming, Please say its not mine, please say its not mine.The parents who could not find their childrens names on the list gathered in another room, where Gov. Dan Malloy (D) visited them, bringing bits of news, none of it good.Wasik ran into a friend, Steve, the father of a first-grader.Steve, Wasik recalled saying, you find your kid?No, I havent found my son, the distraught man replied. Nobody knows where he is. Where is he? Where is he?Wasik moved on, the dread and primal panic mounting until finally, 20 minutes after he ditched his car, he caught sight of his daughter.The relief was disorienting. He tried to comfort his child, call his wife and text his parents. His wife arrived and the three of them huddled with Alexis.His daughter was a wreck, Wasik said. She saw some things.The family plans to get out of town while they figure out how to explain the unexplainable to a third-grader.I dont see her ever going back to that school, Wasik said.When the Wasiks were allowed to leave the firehouse, they saw their friend Steve again. He was with his wife and a police officer.We found out later, Wasik said. They lost their child. He was in the first grade.After dark, much of Newtown gathered at St. Rose of Lima Church for a memorial mass. Hundreds who could not fit in the church stood outside; several dozen formed a circle, holding hands, and sang Silent Night.Tim Cervera, 13, a student at Newtown Middle School, went to the church because his neighbor, a young girl, was killed. I was scared that they would come get us at our middle school, Tim said.Ray Horvath, a bear of a man, leaned against a tree in tears. A teacher at Sandy Hook, he recalled one of the children who had been killed. He was a total pain in the ass, but we loved him, he said. Horvath said he left school on Friday morning five minutes before the shooting began, and then he stopped: I cant say any more.   Fisher and Hendrix reported from Washington. Brady Dennis, Sari Horwitz, Greg Jaffe and Paul Schwartzman in Washington and Colum Lynch and special correspondent Alison Griswold in Newtown contributed to this report.Continued12Personal PostEmailTumblrRedditStumbleuponDiggDeliciousFEATURED ARTICLES2013 Honda Accord: A napping giant awakensHeat is on South Korean rapper Psy for anti-American rapSince 1979, Brian Murtagh has fought to keep convicted murderer Jeffrey MacDonald in prisonMore:Does it pay to know your type?2013 Green Car Buyers Guide: Hybrids, Diesels, Plug-InsOur man in Cairo2013 Family SUVs And Crossovers: Buyers GuideSince 1979, Brian Murtagh has fought to keep convicted murderer Jeffrey MacDonald in prisonNuts & Bolts: 2013 Honda Accord SportLoading...CommentsWe RecommendRuth W.
