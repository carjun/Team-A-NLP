Lanza, 20, had started the killing spree that morning by killing his own mother.RELATED: NANCY LANZA FEARED SON WAS 'GETTING WORSE,' TOLD FRIEND 'HE WAS BURNING HIMSELF WITH A LIGHTER'OBAMA ATTENDS NEWTOWN VIGIL, OFFERS 'LOVE AND PRAYERS OF A NATION' TO FAMILIES OF VICTIMSIN TRAGEDY, HEROISM AND SACRIFICE: PHOTOS OF SANDY HOOK VICTIMS"Nothing went through my head," Ryan Kraft told KABC in Los Angeles. "I just got really sick to my stomach and I just couldn't think for a while. I was shaking."Kraft, who now lives in Hermosa Beach, Calif., was a neighbor of the Lanzas a decade ago. As a teenager he was asked to watch over Adam Lanza when the boy was nine or 10, according to reports."His mom, Nancy, had always instructed me to keep an eye on him at all times and never turn my back or even go to the bathroom or anything like that, which I found odd, but I really didn't ask," Kraft told KABC. "It wasn't any of my business, but looking back at it now, I guess maybe there was something else going on."Lanza was quiet, Kraft said, but occasionally acted up."When I had put him to bed early or stopped doing something, he would be really unhappy about it and throw a tantrum in a way that a younger kid I would normally expect to behave," Kraft told KABC.Even though he lives in California, a large part of Kraft's heart remains in Connecticut. He launched a website to raise money for the victim's families. And Kraft, who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School 15 years ago, is still trying to wrap his head around what happened."Adam always struck me as a really introverted kid. He was really really quiet," he told KCAL in Los Angeles. "And whenever we were doing something whether he was building leggos or playing video games he was really focused on it, like he was in his own world."USING MOBILE?
