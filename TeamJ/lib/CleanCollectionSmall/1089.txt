A time has come to treat all gunmen, shooters, unidentified killers in the same category as mass murderers and Terrorists. There should not be two types of killers when such heartless, barbarians and ruthless human beings used fire arms and kill as many as innocents including babies and small school kids only to take revenge of their own failures. Obama should wake-up and rather than sending patriotic missiles and funding more than 200 billion dollars to fight war on terrorism and billions of dollars to support wars else where, he should use that fund to pinpoint home grown gunmen, shooters, and unidentified killers in our own schools, hospitals, offices and homes. Instead of wasting our manpower and money on phony terrorism culprits, our FBI and security forces should find out our own cold blooded killers hiding around us. To start with he should start fight for ban on assault weapons, guns and rifles to any one other than authorized persons of the police and security forces to eliminate millions of weak minded killers and gunmen and shooters.
