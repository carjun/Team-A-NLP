The shooter, who has been identified in news reports as 20-year-old Adam Lanza, forced his way into the school, according to Lt. Paul Vance of the Connecticut State Police, who spoke to reporters Saturday morning.Police officials have declined to release the names of the 27 people killed at the school or reveal the nature of the evidence suggesting the killers motivation.Lanzas mother, the 28th victim, was found dead at a residence in Newton. Early reports said she worked at the school.Vance, the state police spokesman, denied reports that a fourth gun had been found outside the school and said no other person had been arrested in connection with the shooting, an indication it was carried out by Lanza alone.The weaponry that was recovered by investigators was recovered in close proximity of the deceased, he said. Were investigating the history of each and every weapon.The guns were registered to Lanzas mother, according to media reports.Vance said investigators at the school and at the house where the 28th victims body was found collected some very good evidence that may explain how and, more importantly, why this occurred.He said investigators have established that the gunman forced his way into the school, but did not reveal his point of entry.Shooting teams who were part of the rescue response broke several windows to get into the school, he explained.Connecticut law enforcement officials plan to release a list of the victims names and birthdates when the states medical examiner's office completes its work.The police reiterated a request to the media to respect the privacy of the victims families and have assigned troopers to help maintain that solitude.A crisis intervention team from Yale-New Haven hospital will counsel families who lost loved ones and other residents of Newtown.President Obama during his weekly address Saturday called on the nation to extend support to the families of the victims and pray for them.Because while nothing can take the place of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need  to remind them that we are there for them; and that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their own memories, but also in their community, and their country, he said.TweetView CommentsSource: http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/273101-connecticut-police-say-they-have-evidence-pointing-to-school-shooters-motiveThe contents of this site are  2012 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.The Hill Archives:Senate | House | Administration | Campaign | Business & Lobbying | Capital Living | OpinionView News by Subject:Defense & Homeland Security | Energy & Environment | Healthcare | Finance & Economy | Technology | Foreign Policy | Labor | Transportation & Infrastructure GO TO THE HILL HOME  More Videos Blog Briefing Room Headlines Hillary Clinton faints, suffers concussionConn. police: Evidence points to school gunman's motiveMcCarthy: 'Where is this going to stop?'20 children among victims in Conn. elementary school shooting Gun control petition to White House gets large and immediate support onlineMichelle Obama takes Bo to visit children's hospitalObama cancels Maine trip in deference to shooting victimsGiffords's husband: Gun control can no longer waitRep.
