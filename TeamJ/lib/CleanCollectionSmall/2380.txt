What's missing from this list?  by  faust32in  Music[+]RustyPeach 38 points39 points40 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]RustyPeach 38 points39 points40 points 1 day agoThis list does not suck, this list just doesnt match up with your taste. This is rolling stone's opinion on the 100 best songs of the 2000s, your free to make your own, just realize that just because you dont like it doesnt mean it sucks as a whole.Personally, i feel like they need a top 250 or 500 list for a decade, because country isnt really included and while i do not like country, it should be included along with more rock and other styles, especially with the amount of SKA music popping up. permalinksavecontextfull comments5123Where are the best burgers.

The shock from the break brings out a euphoric state in the person to stop the pain and can cause a low high. I broke my foot not last thursday, but the thursday before that. Snapped the third metatarsal and my third toe was numb and a lot lower then it should be (the bone slipped down) and i didnt really hurt, and I was starting to get loopy especially at the hospital I felt like I was a little high.permalinksavecontextfull commentsHotshot thought he was safe...  by  LittleUberGiantin  leagueoflegends[+]RustyPeach -4 points-3 points-2 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]RustyPeach -4 points-3 points-2 points 3 days ago2 mistakes I saw.

And that to reduce the influence of government on regulation would be something that would decrease the size of government. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey Reddit, what are some college dorm essentials that really helped you out?  by  Troyster94in  AskReddit[+]RustyPeach 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]RustyPeach 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoI'd take a picture of my dorm room right now but RA's get their own rooms and i dont have any of when i had a roommate. Uhm, okay so the dormroom i had I had 3 small drawers that were in a dresser with 6 drawers that i shared with my roommate. A closet with room on top big enough for a plastic container so i had the storage spot up there and the closet had two big drawers. The desk had three side drawers and one middle drawer. Thats how much storage space I had from the furniture they provided. I didnt really pack much so the only additional storage I needed was in one plastic container. My second year that got moved to needing to use more plastic containers underneath my bed. I didnt want to recommend and of those or anything under your bed until you knew your room set up and how much room you'd have underneath  said bed. This is because that had an issue with my first roommate where he had to have the higher bed because of the stuff he brought and he didnt have room without the higher bed and he lived 5 hours away so it was hard to say sorry take it home. Christmas lights shouldnt be restricted but if your school says they are, you can get colored led bulbs for desk lamps if you want the color, electric light up candles or other light makers from thinkgeek, thats my favorite place for interesting dorm storm. Also, go to home depot for the rug, i got a 5'x7' for $20 thats really soft from them. The only downside to you going in the spring semester is a lot of the dorm room sales only happen a month before the fall semester. permalinksavecontextfull commentsHey Reddit, what are some college dorm essentials that really helped you out?  by  Troyster94in  AskReddit[+]RustyPeach 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]RustyPeach 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoAs an RA and looking over what you've said in the comments about restricted and not restricted, im assuming your rules are similar to ours. If you want air fresheners, go for those cone ones or the plug in ones. And trust me, you want air fresheners, dorm rooms dont get a lot of air besides a small window, and two people living in the same room with laundry and garbage, trust me.Lights, get christmas lights when they go on sale after christmas and command hooks to hang them up, they look awesome, are inviting when you have your door open and can add a nice flair and color to your room. Mattress topper, not always necessary but your mattress will most likely be twin xl so keep that in mind.Mini fridge yes, toaster and microwave might be restricted but your dorm might offer a mini fridge microwave combination device. Toilet paper, dont know your bathroom situation so they might have a cleaning staff on hand so you might not have to worry about anything besides you wanting nice toilet paper. Towels are also a must, have at least three big ones, 3 hand towels, 2 face towels. 2 bottles of shampoo 1 of conditioner will probably last you a semester. Laundry detergent, fabric softener, laundry basket.Candles are probably restricted as well but electric ones still work if you want candle light. Extension cords are also probably fire restricted but power strips work as long as they have the flip switch. Duct tape is normally banned in dorm rooms but the blue painters tape still works nicely. Command strips for posters though, so much better.A rug if your dorm isnt carpeted and get some egg crates for storage. Pack enough for 2 weeks, and everything you need for 2 weeks, then you can get the rest of your stuff from home. You are sharing a room with someone, you dont want to bring everything then not have it fit so make sure you have room for what you want to bring. Any questions just reply ill try to answer the best i can.EDIT:Screw drivers and other simple tools, batteries, a desk light, and a shower caddy so its easier to bring your stuff to the bathrooms.permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat's your sexual bucket list reddit?  by  RandomBananasin  AskReddit[+]RustyPeach 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]RustyPeach 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoNo but im going to go look it up nowpermalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
