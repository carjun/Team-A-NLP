I also had a subscription to the CT review, I don't know what state your from, but most states publish one which you should look into. What are you more into, poetry or fiction?permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is your favorite literary magazine?  by  theruinsin  literature[+]torgo_phylum 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)[]torgo_phylum 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoTin house is good, but really, you could support three of the smaller journals for the same price of subscription. They all have good stuff, you'll get exposed to a wider variety of authors, and you'll do more in terms of supporting literature. permalinksavecontextfull comments"You're obviously a very intelligent man, why does religion still hold resonance in your life?" - Ken Jennings (from Jeopardy!) answers  by  bureXin  TrueAtheism[+]torgo_phylum 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]torgo_phylum 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoIt's silly, but both sides of this debate try to claim the "smart people", as though the argument "Well, smart people agree with me," actually counted as an argument. Smart people are generally more nuanced than a talking point. That's part of what makes them smart. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat is a MUST SEE movie that is highly overlooked?  by  day-makerin  AskReddit[+]torgo_phylum 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago (0 children)[]torgo_phylum 1 point2 points3 points 5 days agoLord yes, best of Miyazaki's work, though Disney had to release it through Mirimax to avoid association with the violence.

Knopfler, probably as a result of not being flashy, like Hendrix or Clapton, is simply one of the best and overlooked guitarists ever.

Warren Farrell" and calling attendees "scum"  by  MittRomneysCampaignin  politics[+]torgo_phylum -2 points-1 points0 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]torgo_phylum -2 points-1 points0 points 9 days agoAs I said, pretty much everyone who believes in equal rights for women do so because of the women who have fought for those rights, feminists throughout history. That makes them a group worth respecting, not damning. In that sense, everyone "normal" is aligns with a traditional feminist viewpoint. I don't think I can help you see that; you are clearly angry and upset with the radicals, and are unwilling to believe non-radicals don't share their views. Clearly we are going to disagree here, and it may not be worth wasting my energy to fight what I consider a radical point of view. Feminists are the same way about rad-feminists, their long term goals are different but immediate goals are the same. Why waste time infighting when for now you are allies? Men such as you will attribute radfem ideology to all feminists regardless of what their actual viewpoints are, so if you are a feminist who seems a more likely group to align yourself with? My point is that it isn't radfeminism that pushes feminists away from the center, it's people like you who arbitrarily put them their regardless of their viewpoints.If you believe every group should be represented by it's most radical and vocal elements, then you pretty much sign off every group in history as crazy, ever. And no, a single protest from women you don't know which demonstrates their misunderstanding does not mean all feminists are idiots or don't want equal rights. Also, a whole university? A million+ bestselling authors? Please, that's barely worth noting as a clear exaggeration. I've seen you plugging r/mensrights here, so I went and visited, and it's about as vile and misrepresentive of reality as SRS is. I've seriously never seen such bellyaching over almost nothing. As a male in this country, I'm not saying I don't have problems, but I am doing goddamn fine and my gender has NEVER gotten in the way of how people treated me or getting what I wanted, something that for all their trying, many women I know still can't report. And if I see you plugging that Men's center story for the 100th time, honestly, it's like you're Fox news finding the one story where athiests get a christmas tree taken down in Shitsville, Oregon, and suddenly there's a nationwide war on xmas. Believe me, if there is a war on men being waged by radfems as you seem to fear, we're fucking winning it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9swKKZy0CCMpermalinksavecontextfull commentsStudents at University of Toronto protest Warren Farrell against what they believe is "hate speech", yelling "f@&! Warren Farrell" and calling attendees "scum"  by  MittRomneysCampaignin  politics[+]torgo_phylum 3 points4 points5 points 9 days ago (0 children)[]torgo_phylum 3 points4 points5 points 9 days agoThat isn't true. Feminism has been characterized unfairly by it's most radical elements, but as far as it's core tenets, that people shouldn't have defined roles based on their gender and that rape is a disgusting thing, well, even as a male I'd say most everyone agrees with that, most everyone is philosophically a feminist. And the reason that's a common idea is because of the feminist movement. You saw some girl in a video who has clearly misunderstood the man she is attacking, that doesn't mean she is a representative of feminism. permalinksavecontextfull commentsStudents at University of Toronto protest Warren Farrell against what they believe is "hate speech", yelling "f@&!
