He is the last U.S. captain to have won on European soil, triumphing at The Belfry course in England in 1993."I was waiting for about 20 years to get the call," the 63-year-old said at his unveiling on Thursday. "I loved it the first time. It's just a great honor to be able to do it again."The United States Professional Golf Association (USPGA) turned to the five-time British Open champion in a bid to overturn recent poor form in the Ryder Cup, with Team Europe having won five of the last six matches -- including at Medinah last September.Read: U.S. stunned as Europe wins Ryder CupEurope's Medinah miracleGerman Martin Kaymer milks the moment as his putt on the 18th green ensures Europe will retain the Ryder Cup. His defeat of Steve Stricker capped an improbable comeback, as the Europeans triumphed 14-13 despite trailing 10-4 at one stage on Saturday.Justin Rose punches the air as he caps an unlikely comeback of his own, defeating Phil Mickelson on the 18th green after being one down with two to play. The American described his loss as one of the turning points of the 2012 Ryder Cup. Europe's victory echoed the 1999 Ryder Cup, where the U.S. also came from 10-6 down to win 14 - 13. The 'Battle of Brookline' was bathed in controversy as U.S. players stormed the 17th green in celebration at s crucial Justin Leonard putt. Golfing etiquette had been broken as Leonard's opponent, Jose Maria Olazabal, could still have squared their match. Jean Van de Velde (middle) looks bewildered as he reflects on his defeat in the 1999 British Open. The Frenchman blew a three-shot lead on the final hole, so forcing a play-off with Justin Leonard (right) and Scotland's Paul Lawrie (left) which the latter won to seal his first major, despite trailing Van de Velde by an enormous 10 strokes before the final round took place. Liverpool players celebrate with goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek (in black) after the English side completed their remarkable comeback against Italians AC Milan in the 2005 European Champions League final. Trailing 3-0 at half time, Liverpool scored three goals in six second half minutes in Istanbul to force extra time and a penalty shoot-out, which they won 3-2. Players and fans of Manchester City celebrate after winning their first English title since 1968. City trailed Queens Park Rangers 2-1 but scored two stoppage time goals to win 3-2 - and so deny city rivals Manchester United the title. The success echoed United's 1999 Champions League triumph in Barcelona, where they beat Bayern Munich 2-1 despite trailing after 90 minutes. Having won the last four gold medals, the Soviet Union were hot favourites to win ice hockey gold at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Few expected Team USA - made up of amateur and college players - to stop them but they defied the odds to beat the Soviets 4-3 in a semifinal which became known as 'The Miracle on Ice.' They went on to win gold against Finland in the final.Despite being two sets and 5-1 down in his semifinal, Frenchman Henri Cochet managed to win the 1927 Wimbledon title. He stunned the world No. 1, American Bill TiIden, in the semis before repeating his escapology act in the final, trailing by two sets once more and surviving six match points before rallying to win in five sets for a third successive game.It is the one-day cricket international that may never be equalled. Set a world record score of 435 to win in their allotted 50 overs, Graeme Smith's South Africa beat Australia in Johannesburg after racking up 438 runs, with just one wicket and one ball to spare.It is baseball's greatest fairytale comeback. In August 2001, the Seattle Mariners were on their way to equalling the major league record of 116 victories in a season. They led the lowly Cleveland Indians 14-2 at the halfway stage and though the Indians rallied they still needed five full runs with only one out remaining - and got them to win 15-14 in the 11th innings, with Kenny Lofton grabbing the crucial score.Mission ImprobableRose in bloomBattle of BrooklineLawrie load of gloryTurkish delightBlue MoonThe Icemen comethComeback King'The 438'Mariners run adriftHIDE CAPTION<<<12345678910>>>The greatest sporting comebacksLiving Golf: Best of 2012Having turned professional in 1971, Watson is a seasoned veteran of the golfing world whose experience and respect are expected to aid the struggling U.S. team in two years' time.The U.S. has picked a new captain for recent Ryder Cups, which are held every two years, but the USPGA said it wanted to try something different after losing seven of the last nine tournaments."The pressure of playing in the Ryder Cup is greater or as great as in any event," said Watson, who will replace Davis Love III. "My job is to help them deal with that pressure. I've lived for that pressure and lived underneath that pressure all my career."One of the most popular figures on the golfing stage, the revered Watson tried to play down the gulf in age between his players and himself at the New York press conference.The previous oldest U.S. captain was the legendary Sam Snead, who was 57 when he oversaw his nation's retention of the trophy in 1969 -- made famous by Jack Nicklaus' concession of a match-equaling putt to Tony Jacklin."I deflect that very simply by saying, 'We play the same game,' " Watson said."I hope I can set the table for these players. I'm the stage manager. I set the stage for them to go out and do what they do. In two years, I hope they can get it done."Watson's relationship with Tiger Woods will come under intense scrutiny, having criticized the 14-time major winner's behavior on and off the course following his fall from grace in 2009.Nonetheless, Woods was one of the first to offer both his support for Watson and availability for the tournament."I would like to congratulate Tom Watson on his selection as Ryder Cup captain," Woods said in a statement.Peter Hanson, center, and Francesco Molinari of Europe celebrate their team winning the 39th Ryder Cup on Sunday, September 30, in Medinah, Illinois.

Tom knows what it takes to win and that's our ultimate goal. I hope I have the privilege of joining him on the 2014 United States team."Watson swiftly dampened the sparks of any potential controversy about Woods by stating that he would pick the former world number one in his squad whether or not he qualifies for one of the eight automatic places on offer. The captain also has four discretionary choices."I want him on my team," Watson said. "Tiger is maybe the best player in history. If he's not on the team, he's going to be number one in my picks."Watson, the first U.S. captain to return to the helm since Jack Nicklaus lost on home soil in 1987, also received the backing of Brandt Snedeker -- like Woods, a member of this year's unsuccessful side in Illinois."Obviously they were looking outside the box, given our recent failures," Snedeker told the PGA Tour website."They wanted to get a guy who has had success and commands respect. I think that's why they went this way: to get the U.S. to rally around him as a way to rejuvenate the American side."Tom is one of the best competitors of all time. He's going to bring that fire and unwillingness to lose and mental strength that has defined his career."At the 2009 British Open, Watson missed a par putt on the 72nd hole at Turnberry that would have made him the oldest major champion in the history of the sport.The American has a warm relationship with Scotland, the country where he won his first major title at Carnoustie in 1975 and where he would eventually win half his major crowns.His appointment was announced by the USPGA on nationwide television, with predecessor Love having relinquished his post after what was dubbed the "Meltdown in Medinah" in the U.S. but the "Miracle of Medinah" in Europe."We've got the right guy," rallied USPGA president Ted Bishop.0Comments PrintEmailMore sharingWe recommendFrom around the webPart of complete coverage on Living GolfCan sports rivals really be friends?updated 9:03 AM EST, Thu December 6, 2012Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso -- some big rivalries have evolved in 2012.Top golfers' expectations for 2013updated 11:20 AM EST, Fri December 7, 2012Living Golf speaks with the world's top golf players about their hopes for next year.Golf course architect ready for Rio?updated 1:37 PM EST, Thu December 6, 2012CNN's Don Riddell speaks with Gil Hanse, the architect behind the golf course for the 2016 Rio Games.Living Golf: Best of 2012updated 1:07 PM EST, Thu December 6, 2012The Living Golf team has chosen some of their favorite moments from the past 12 months.2012: A game changer for McIlroy?updated 1:01 PM EST, Thu December 6, 2012Living Golf looks back at Rory McIlroy's big year in golf, including winning the Race to Dubai and two money titles.Europe's Medinah miracleupdated 1:02 PM EST, Thu December 6, 2012Living Golf looks back at Europe's big win at the Ryder Cup, a historic win against the United States.McIlroy targets 2013 assaultupdated 6:05 PM EST, Mon November 26, 2012Rory McIlroy is to trim his schedule to focus on 2013's four major titles after a fairytale year.Jimenez becomes oldest winnerupdated 11:00 AM EST, Sun November 18, 2012A busy Sunday saw four tournaments across three continents settled to underline the truly global nature of modern golf.Golfer's Cinderella taleupdated 9:33 AM EST, Mon November 12, 2012It was a Cinderella story taken straight from the script of a Disney classic.Tiger: I can beat Nicklaus' major recordupdated 7:58 AM EST, Thu November 8, 2012It has been four years since Tiger Woods won a major title, but the former world No. 1 insists he still has time to beat the record held by his hero.Tiger and Rory's 'bromance'updated 6:32 AM EST, Thu November 8, 2012Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy talk to Living Golf about how their relationship has evolved.McIlroy and Woods' $1.4M battleupdated 10:08 AM EST, Wed November 28, 2012Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy went head to head at a golf tournament that featured the world's top eight golf players.Ochoa: Motherhood has changed meupdated 7:32 AM EST, Thu November 8, 2012Former world number one Lorena Ochoa talks about balancing golfing with being a new mother.How to heal major heartbreakupdated 10:29 AM EDT, Tue October 30, 2012"Nice guys finish last" is a mantra often preached in sport and business.
