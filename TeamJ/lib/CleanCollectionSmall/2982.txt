During his first term in office, PresidentObama was widely understood to be in favor of tighter federal gunownership laws but made no real moves toward that end.AsCraig R. Whitney, the author of Living with Guns: A Liberal's Case for the SecondAmendment, told me in a recent interview (the video willrun next week), the two actions that Obama took actually expandedgun rights: The president allowed for individuals to carry loadedguns into national parks and to check guns as luggage on Amtraktrains. These actions - along with Obama's failure to push for arenewal of the ban on "assault weapons" - caused the Brady Centerto Prevent Gun Violence to give Obama an F for his first year in office.RELATED ARTICLESGun Rights Find a New HomeSteve Chapman| 12.13.12Gun Control, Ad InfinitumA. Barton Hinkle| 12.12.12An Ideological Test for Gun OwnershipJacob Sullum| 10.29.12Sandy Hook School ShootingGun ControlGunsGun RightsSecond AmendmentBarack ObamaAt the start of a second term and facing a terrible economicsituation (much of it due to his own policies) and an equally awfulforeign-policy situation, it's plausible that Obama will turn togun control as a way reconnecting with his liberal base and as anattempt to soothe the nation. At a press conference about theshooting, the president said,"We're going to have to come togetherand take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this,regardless of the politics."And his spokesman Jay Carney has also said that the presidentwill fight to reinstate the ban on so-called assault weapons(animprecise category of guns that typically targetssemi-automatic weapons festooned with military-styledetailing).None of that will be easy, for a number ofreasons. Over the past several decades, virtually every state inthe country has liberalized its gun control laws. In 2008 (in theHeller decision) and 2010 (McDonald),the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an individual right to bear arms.Despite a number of high-profile gun-violence cases - includingthis year's mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater and2011's shooting of Arizona Rep.Gabrielle Giffords - the past 20 years has seen a sharp andcontinuing decrease in violent crime.In 1992, for instance, the violent crime rate per 100,000residents was 758. In 2012, it was 386. Between 2000and 2009 (the latest year for which I could easily find data)use of firearms in violent crime had decreased from a rate of 2.4per 1,000 to 1.4 per 1,000.So gun violence overall is down significantlyfrom where it was about 20 or more. At the same time, comfort withguns, which are present in about 45 percent of households, has beenincreasing. Gallup reports that in January of this year, only 25 percent ofAmericans wanted to see gun laws be made more strict. Two-thirdseither wanted laws to stay the same or be less strict, while 8percent had no opinion. It's likely that those percentages willshift somewhat over the coming weeks or even months, but thelong-term trend lines - that include the years of Columbine,Virginia Tech, and other gun-related massacres - will make itdifficult for gun control proponents to gain large majorities.Beyond all questions of politics is a more basic question ofefficacy. What exactly might be done to prevent mass shootings,especially at locations such as schools? In the wake of theGiffords shooting by Jared Lee Loughner, therewere many calls for institutionalizing more people who seemedmentally unhinged and potentially violent. The same thing ishappening now, for obvious reasons (by various accounts, none ofwhich has been fully substantiated yet, presumed gunman Adam Lanzawas unhinged). As Reason's Jacob Sullum wrote regardingLoughner, even the most vociferous propopents of locking uppotential killers grant that maybe 10 percent of schizophrenicsbecome violent. Academic studies of presumptive detention of thementally ill suggest that mental health professionals do about aswell, and sometimes worse, than regular people in figuring out whoexactly is going to go postal. Such results should temper any andall calls to start rounding up more people in the name ofprotecting innocents.The general decline in gun-related violence and the inabilityeven of mental health professionals to identify future mass killersshould be the essential starting points of any serious policydiscussion generated by the absolutely horrific slaughter at theSandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. We shouldalso add a third starting point: Few good policies come from rapidresponses to deeply felt injuries. Many of the same people who arenow calling for immediate action with regard to gun controlrecognize that The Patriot Act, rushed through Congress in theimmediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, was a terrible piece oflegislation that ultimately did nothing to protect Americans evenas it vastly expanded the state's ability to surveil law-abidingcitizens. There's no reason to think that federal, state, or localgun control laws promulgated now would result in anythingdifferent.If hard cases make bad laws, it's even more true that rarecrimes make terrible public policy. In a piece for Quartz,journalist Lenore Skenazy recalls that the deadliest school massacre inU.S. history took place in Michigan in 1927, when a disgruntledschool-board official blew up 38 people, including himself. Shewrites that the real difference between now and then is theimmediacy of the media, which shrinks the distance between victimsand the rest of us. Even as that allows us to have more empathy forthe grieving, it creates the conditions for an overreaction thatwill ultimately be little more than symbolic:I expect we will now demand precautions on top of precautions.More guards. More security cameras. More supervision. We will fearmore for our kids and let go of them even more reluctantly. Everytime we wonder if they can be safe beyond our arms, these shootingswill swim into focus.Will this new layer of fear and security make our children anysafer? Probably not, but for a reassuring reason: A tragedy likethis is so rare, our kids are already safe. Not perfectly safe. Noone ever is. But safe.Thats a truth the folks in 1928 America understood. We justdont feel that way now.Acknowledging the horror of what happened and mourning forinnocent lives snuffed out and families destroyed by theincomprehensible act of a madman is precisely what the countryshould be doing right now. If it seems as if that is a passivenon-reaction, that's because too many people understand whatmourning entails. After that can come a policy battle that can befought with passion but not with emotionalism and ignorance ofrelevant, basic facts standing in for rational analysis and honestdebate.

This smacks of the Trayvon narrative framing.Also,I've been repeatedly "scolded" by several people forsuggesting responsibility lies with the killer rather than our lackof mental health funding and too strict civil commitmentprocedures. I can't recall seeing so much sympathy for a profoundlymalevolent individual before. Acknowledging the existence of evilis now somewhere between politically incorrect and sociallyirresponsible. reply to thislog in or register to replyA Serious Man|12.15.12 @ 1:34PM|#I must note that directly ties into the left-wing conciet thatpeople can be programmed, with the proper amount of coercion, to be'better' and that thus there must always be something theall-knowing Leviathan could have done to stop this.
