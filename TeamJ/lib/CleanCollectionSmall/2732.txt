Even the most uninformed person knows you don't snort it. This is as stupid as that "omg I just injected 4 marijuanas" shit that the idients over in r/trees think is so hilarious.

Students wounded - story developing  by  tblarsonin  news[+]trampus1 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]trampus1 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour agoSo the dad has a disagreement with someone in the school and he goes and gets someone else to help him shoot up a kindergarten? What in the hell. I consider myself to be a pretty twisted person in some ways, but this is mind boggling even for someone as depraved as me. Too bad the other shooter is dead already, I'm sure he would have gotten it real good if he made it to even county jail. Here's hoping the one they caught gets found with his throat slit and a plunger in his ass. Personally though, if I were a cop, I'd have just executed them on the spot. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI ordered a powder blue ukulele for a 3 year old for Christmas...I don't think they got my order right.  by  clgriff5in  funny[+]trampus1 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)[]trampus1 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour agoOr anyone other than Tiny Tim.

How can you know about Rick Rolling but not know how to download a torrent? I guess if you inisist on going the legal route there's GIMP, which is as close as you're gonna get for free. There's also paint.net, which is like a beefed up MSPaint, I've never used it though. I don't think either will run on an iphone. permalinksavecontextfull commentsWell Worth The Wait  by  cheetahbayin  funny[+]trampus1 -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours agoFoamposites are some of the ugliest fucking shoes, I don't know why they're popular other than their high price.

(It's dead, if you can't tell)  by  ali-gator_in  WTF[+]trampus1 -1 points0 points1 point 12 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 -1 points0 points1 point 12 hours agoCynical, heartless bastard alert:To a 14 year old girl, having a baby is just a novelty. I imagine OP's cousin is one of the ghetto acting "ho" types, I see this a lot on those types of girls pages. They have a miscarriage, most likely caused my not following instructions and/or continuing to do drugs while pregnant thinking they'll be fine., and they put up these pictures of their little angels. It's sickening. In all honesty, this little bitch got a lucky break and she had better realize that and not get knocked up again. It's the best thing that could happen for her, sucks for little Jase, but shit happens, you gotta think about the people that are still alive. Here's hoping she'll beat the odds and reform. permalinksavecontextfull commentsGotcha  by  conor741in  gifs[+]trampus1 -2 points-1 points0 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 -2 points-1 points0 points 13 hours agoCowardice aside, would this be a legal tactic?permalinksavecontextfull commentsI'll see your "12-12-12" tattoo and raise you this beauty...  by  lopadoopin  WTF[+]trampus1 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoWhat button do you press to do an ocular pat down?permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlpha as fuck  by  the_daymanin  4chan[+]trampus1 4 points5 points6 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 4 points5 points6 points 13 hours agoBlack socks at that, means he was out to get some. permalinksavecontextfull commentsAlpha as fuck  by  the_daymanin  4chan[+]trampus1 46 points47 points48 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 46 points47 points48 points 13 hours agoThat looks like a sad, clean shaven scrubbing bubble. permalinksavecontextfull commentsI will be right back  by  Mariog98in  funny[+]trampus1 6 points7 points8 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 6 points7 points8 points 13 hours agoDon't go too fast, or else...permalinksavecontextfull commentsI will be right back  by  Mariog98in  funny[+]trampus1 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours agoI'm sure they would recognize it if he called it White Out. permalinksavecontextfull comments"Google Fiber is set to cure cancer by 2014"-Gaben  by  Paper_Luigiin  circlejerk[+]trampus1 18 points19 points20 points 14 hours ago (0 children)[]trampus1 18 points19 points20 points 14 hours agoIt'll probably happen before Half Life 3 comes out!
