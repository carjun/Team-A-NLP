This is why I'm going to let this stay in 'good' light; One step at a time. Yes, it may be full blown legal now in a couple states, but I think the whole movement regarding incarceration is a BIG deal. It's still a step forward. We'll (authority) be focusing on actual CRIME on the streets, less tax money will be wasted holding marijuana users, courthouses less clogged over petty recreational use which means again - less money needing to be handed out judicially. I personally think he's going the play-it-safe mode and taking it slow. The "drug war" is such a touchy subject that hopefully a slow turnover will even convince those in opposition to be like, "Wow, look at all the time and money saved" - and hopefully reconsider. permalinksavecontextfull commentsTIL in 1809, a woman diagnosed with an ovarian tumor rode horseback 60 miles to try to have the tumor removed, an operation that had never been performed, knowing that most Doctors thought the procedure would kill her.

For some weird reason I'm extremely prone to kidney stones at the not so ripe age of 23 and they've yet to find out what's causing it, despite the countless tests and diets I've tried. And of course my stones are the jagged death type. I'm allergic to morphine so I'm given dilaudid every time it happens.One of those times though, I had an on call doctor while in the ER....who refused to give me dilaudid because she thought I was a drug seeker since I begged for it specifically. (Mind you I'm also puking my brains out from 4 stones) and said it was, "really busy" and couldnt look further into my file to find the OK. Kidney stone induced Hulk rage ensued. Lets just say I got that dilaudid.permalinksavecontextfull commentsTaking adderall to help study for finals..  by  TheRhymenocerousin  AdviceAnimals[+]bonjourdan 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago (0 children)[]bonjourdan 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoNothing feels shittier than the next-day wake up after missing a days dose.

I also remember running back up the hill to my house to notice a portion of the willow tree in my backyard to be doing the same thing. The gusts of wind didnt match this one region of barely blowing leaves. But the surrounding matter still continued, and the 'edges' were even cut off because of the looping area. It was fucked. My friend who I explained it to didnt understand how eerie the actual concept of that is. permalinksavecontextfull commentsMy friend recently adopted a dog that had been beaten, starved then tied by his paws to a tree for days.

A good majority of the stress is from my appearance. I am constantly overdoing myself to have the best teeth, hair, skin, and body. I am a health nut. But I also can't go a day without stimulants. My withdrawals are literally like the flu. And when I hit lows rapid cycling, it literally makes me go out and buy more makeup and coffee and eyelashes and clothes.I've been living like this for 8 years and I dont really know life any different because Im only 23. Perfection is my addiction, and I believe it is a demon of its own. I would call it a disease. permalinksavecontextfull commentsThis is me in 9th grade.  by  Tickle_Shitzin  WTF[+]bonjourdan 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]bonjourdan 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoOh wait, I think I've come across a few posts of yours in makeupaddiction!...or Im just creepypermalinksavecontextfull commentsThis is me in 9th grade.  by  Tickle_Shitzin  WTF[+]bonjourdan 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago (0 children)[]bonjourdan 1 point2 points3 points 7 days agoThis is probably one of the best combos Ive ever come across.permalinksavecontextfull commentsview more: next aboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisehelphelpFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy.  2012 reddit inc.
