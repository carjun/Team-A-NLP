The situation is ongoing," Redknapp said after Tottenham beat Charlton 3-0 in the FA Cup. "I was led to believe that insurance was a problem, but apparently that's not the case."Beckham's announcement in December that he was seeking another loan to Europe took the Galaxy by surprise.The team issued a statement through the AP within hours of Beckham's comments emerging in December saying that it expected him back in training more than a month before the March 15 season opener at the Seattle Sounders.On Sunday, Redknapp reflected that by saying: "They wanted him back in early February so that made it difficult to do a playing deal on the basis of three weeks."Even if Beckham doesn't play, Redknapp said the midfielder can still help his squad as it prepares for a Champions League knockout matchup with Beckham's former club AC Milan and continues its push for a second straight top-four finish in the Premier League."He will be a great influence around the place and I am sure we will all benefit from his winning mentality," Redknapp said. "I think everyone will enjoy having him here. We'd love to have him here for longer but respect his commitments to LA Galaxy."In a statement, Beckham thanked the Galaxy for allowing him to train with Spurs."It's important that I maintain a high level of fitness during the MLS offseason," said Beckham, who also trained with Arsenal three years ago. "I look forward to getting to work as soon as possible."The former Manchester United and Real Madrid player is still hopeful of being recalled to the England team by manager Fabio Capello, having made 115 appearances - the most by any non-goalie.Beckham also announced Sunday that his wife, Victoria, is expecting their fourth child later this year.Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.
