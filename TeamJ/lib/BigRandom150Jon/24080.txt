Id kept his secret for years, ashamed of myself, ashamed of my stupidity, ashamed of how desperate a child could be for attention. Today, Im breaking my silence.Like many victims I was a pretty girl on the cusp of puberty, with the misfortune of having a bi-polar father who didnt want kids. On good days the abuse was verbal, or implied. If I walked into the house, he involuntarily scowled. There was little doubt that I was an unwelcome visitor in my own home.On bad days I didnt want to be in the same zip code as my father.I spent a lot of time hiding in my room. I quickly learned that I rarely got into trouble if Dad didnt know I was in the house. I played quietly, read quietly, and drew as little attention to myself as possible.My mother was wonderful, but she too was a victim. Dad treated her like a queen, me like something he stepped in. And she was powerless to do anything about it other than protest, which did no good. She has since told me over and over that she would have left him if shed had the means to do it.Things were different for women back then.Mom said I was a great kid; almost Stepford-like in my willingness to please, to produce stellar grades, and excel in music. What no one knew was that I did most of it for Dads attention, and he didnt give a shit.Enter Jeff.He was a 42 year old married volunteer youth counselor at my church. We met at the once monthly Family Night Dinner.Dad always tried to behave like the model father when we were at church; helpful, sweet, caring. But until we stepped over the threshold, all bets were off.That particular evening Dad said something nasty to me just as we were entering the Fellowship Hall.For the first time I was too pissed off to play along with his Ward Cleaver act.After a few minutes, Jeff came up and introduced himself. I glowered at him and in church-girl-speak made it clear that he and the rest of his kind could go straight to hellHe grinned and walked off. After dinner I apologized for my rudeness. He laughed; we shook hands and became friends.Jeff was incredibly nice. His eyes were robins egg blue and they crinkled in the corners when he was amused. His was a natural smile too; not forced or hateful like Dads. He showered me with attention, kindness, and joked with me. He did and said the things that normal dads did and said to their kids. I was always excited when his car pulled into the parking lot.At least for a few hours I could pretend that my life didnt stink.Once I was on the hook, he began to reel me in. He used flattery, hand touching, gazed into my eyes and told me I was a beautiful girl.I sucked it up like a sponge.When he thought I was ready and wouldnt rat him out, he kissed me. A week later he kissed me again. His tongue taught mine a sensuality that twelve year olds rarely experience. He murmured between kisses that he had fallen in love with me. Id seldom heard anyone say those words. I clung to him and I told him I loved him too.And I did. I didnt know it was wrong. Id never had a normal father/daughter relationship so I had nothing to compare the situation to. Jeffs arms were strong and warm. I felt safe with him.Our relationship went undetected for nearly two years, until the minister caught us together in the Fellowship Hall. Jeff had my left breast in his mouth and his hand was deep inside my panties.It wasnt long afterward that church elders ran him off, and threatened him with legal action if he didnt leave town. He packed up the family and sped out of Dodge faster than you could say prison stripes.Before his departure he fed me a fairy tale about why he was leaving. With tear filled eyes he assured me that hed come back for me someday; when I was old enough to be his wife, and after he divorced the one he already had.Child that I was, I clung to that.  After he left I barely ate, barely slept. I rode my bike past his old house; remembering, craving the sound of his voice. I sat on the front steps of the church crying my eyes out; lonely, despairing, and wishing I had the courage to kill myself.If things werent dismal enough, I had 557 pairs of eyes boring holes in me every time I entered the sanctuary.Jeff and I thought wed kept our relationship on the QT, but nowhere does scandal travel faster than in a church. My painfully thin frame and woeful eyes spoke volumes.Some probably thought I was a teenage tramp. Some probably felt sorry for me. Some probably didnt know what to think. But one thing was certain. From the time Jeff left for parts unknown, I was tainted goods. The old folks who used to think I was the sweetest kid at church rarely spoke to me anymore. The kids in the youth group looked at me with disgust, like how could you let him do that to you? I could hear the whispering, and see the looks.The few church girlfriends I had left staged an intervention, no doubt hoping to keep me from drowning in a pool of self pity and delusion.They informed me that hed tried to molest six girls in our youth group. All of his would-be victims had absentee or deceased fathers. The crap he tried to pull on them was pretty much the crap he pulled on me in the early days. The difference was that they all pushed him away.I was the only one whod willingly let him past first base. If what they said was true then I was as unloved as I was before he came into my life. And if he molested me and tried to molest my friends, then he was off doing it to someone else while I wasted away; missing him, loving him, and waiting for him.I couldnt bear it.As they spoke, their piercing words were drowned out by a roaring, whooshing sound inside my head, like a subway hurtling past an underground station; vacuuming the information into a safe dark place where bad things were stored until I was able to accept them.I hung onto a lie for years, until the day I finally allowed myself to admit the truth. It happened when Dad got help for his bi-polar disorder and reached out to me in love for the first time in my life.I finally had the father I wanted all along. I didnt need Jeff anymore. But I did need counseling to help me see him for what he really was, why Id wanted him so badly, and to cut him loose from my heart forever.The adult Lynette no longer lives in a warm fuzzy place surrounded by lies. Every word my church friends said was true, and I believe them. They said it wasnt my fault. That he was a sick man. I believe that too. Yet its still agonizingly painful to think back on those days because little girl Lynette still wants to scream every time she lets herself remember him, and the shame he brought to her life.I was fortunate.Sometimes there isnt enough counseling in the world to fix the damage that men like Jeff inflict on their young victims. It can be like a persistent infected wound that bubbles and festers; always there, always hurtful.Its no secret that molesters still prowl among us. Many are past offenders who shouldnt be out mingling in society. Our children are still falling prey to the bastards, just as I did long ago with Jeff.You cant hold up a picture in front of a child and tell them, This is what a sexual predator looks like.Most of them look average. Theyre neighbors, teachers, crossing guards, small business owners, bartenders, Sunday school teachers, uncles, cousins and from all walks of life.  Some predators study their victims for a period of time, lusting, plotting and savoring the moment when they can make their move.  Sometimes all it takes is a trigger to set them off; blonde hair, Care Bear sneakers, the way the child carries his or her lunch box, how well a pre-teen girl fills out her training bra.I dont pretend to know how they think.But Im all too familiar with how they behave.They dont wear signs, and they dont do anything to let us know they walk among us.But they do. We have two courses of action to protect our children.First of all we need to train ALL kids to know the difference between inappropriate touching and a friendly pat on the head. They need to know that molestation can happen at the hands of family members, friends or people theyve never met.We also tell kids dont talk to strangers.But exactly what IS a stranger? Many kids dont know. If they did, they wouldnt climb into a truck to help a man look for his lost puppy, or accept a candy bar from someone they didnt know.Most importantly we need to be sure that they comprehend what we tell them. Children are eager to please adults, and will often say they understand when they dont.Its imperative that they do.Lawyers argue that if a predator is out walking the streets after a stint in prison its because hes paid his debt to society. We should leave them alone and let them get on with their lives.  Id be inclined to agree if the felon were a bank robber or white collar criminal. But we know sexual predators dont stop. They surf, cruise and feed frenetically on young flesh like piranhas. Sometimes sex isnt enough, and the crime escalates into something far more unspeakable. No matter how rural the community, how urban the city; the bastards are everywhere.The legal system can only do so much until the rules change. Until we campaign for harsher penalties without possibility of parole, those who exploit and destroy the lives of children will continue to do so with our blessing.My grandfather once said after watching a story on the evening news There ought to be a law against that.Thats for damned sure.Lynette Clay Teen Hotline if you need a friend.http://www.pamf.org/teen/hotlines.html___________________________________________________________________________________________________The opinions of contributors are wholly the authors, and are not endorsed by worldwidehippies.Want to write your own article?
