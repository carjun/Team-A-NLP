Observed on a human scale, the very basic rhythm of every day is sunset and sunrise, we go in to bed and out of bed. A rhythm, so elementary and universal and at the same time so intimate.This is an impression of Sync' by Max Hattler and 'Bedrooms' bij Nelleke Koop with music by Dennis van Tilburg. These were part of the 'Time, what makes us tick?' installation in the Open Mind series of Pavlov E-Lab, presented on the Noorderzon Performing Arts festival 2010. In this edition Max and Nelleke collaborated with chronobiologist Martha Merrow and physicist Eric Bergshoeff in their mutual exploration of the theme of Time.Category:Film & AnimationTags:OpenMindTimewhatmakesustick?art&sciencepavlovelabNellekeKoopMaxHattlerchronobiologyphysicsEricBergshoeffMarthaMerrowDennisvanTilburgNathalieBeekmanLink to this comment:Share to:Highest Rated Commentslisten carefully at 7:29, someone farted!!!hairynose6561 month ago      97hairynose6561 month ago      97I just stared at the spining thing in the center... xHANNAHxKicksASS1 month ago      26xHANNAHxKicksASS1 month ago      26see allAll Comments (173)Respond to this video...Sign In or Sign Up now to post a comment!i pooped my pants an didnt reazile untill i came out of this transinsane9317 hours agoinsane9317 hours ago@38Victor38 lol i was thinking the exact same thingxiaobaovideo2 days agoxiaobaovideo2 days agoGreat piece of work. We are made of ATOM'S and we age because even if you sit on the COUCH you have traveled around 1.25 Million Miles against absolute force. The Proton's are the only part of us that never ages. When we die they are the basis of new Molecular structures. This is a really good piece of ART. Well formulated.
