One listed a few things, one.. Let us look at that listThe Banking system.>>>>>>>>>. FDRThe World's finest military.  Actually ranked #3 in the world for quality.NASA>>>>>> KennedyWall Street>>>>>> limited stock companies were a liberal response to the mercantilist systemWelfare Reform>>>>>> ClintonVictory in WWII and the Cold War >>>> The first; FDR, the second; The Soviet system collapsed due to its internal contradictions. America had little to do with it. Using the term rightwingwhacko should not surprise those who have used any number of perjoratives to describe Liberals here, usually copied from RushHannity. Lincoln as a bolshevik, here is a quote from a conservative commentator Quote:   "Lincoln signed no less than 10 tariff-raising bills during his administration. Heavy 'sin' taxes were levied on alcohol and tobacco, the income tax was levied for the first time in American history, huge land grants and monetary subsidies were handed out to transcontinental railroads (accompanied by a vast amount of attendant corruption), and the government went off the gold standard and virtually nationalized the banking system to establish a machine for printing new money and to provide cheap credit for the business elite. ... A huge army was conscripted, dissenters and advocates of a negotiated peace with the South were jailed, and the precious Anglo-Saxon right of habeas corpus  was abolished for the duration." Slavery? "In every other part of the New World, slavery was peacefully bought out by agreement with the slaveholders," Rothbard asserted in the 1994 talk on which this essay is based. (Actually, Haiti was the other violent exception.) "But in these other countries ... there were no Puritan millennialists to do their bloody work, armed with a gun in one hand and a hymn book in the other. ... The Yankee fanatics were the Bolsheviks of their era." Lincoln's "character"? Rothbard notes that Lincoln was the perfect model of the modern " 'reform liberal' ... whose heart bleeds for and yearns to 'uplift' remote mankind, while he lies to and treats abominably actual people whom he knew.02-19-2007, 04:13 PM          Amaznjohn  Senior Member            Join Date: Feb 2007 2,875 posts, read 1,719,180 times Reputation: 438          As I said, nothing I or anyone else could provide would satisfy your criterion, considering your ideology.                    02-19-2007, 04:28 PM          greatbasinguide  Not a member            Join Date: Sep 2006 Location: CA Coast 1,900 posts Reputation: 350          My ideology?

Here is some more on Lincoln  Quote:   Jeffrey Rogers Hummel's "Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men" ($14.95 from Laissez Faire Books at 800-326-0996.) In the book, Hummel notes: "The Lincoln Administration imprisoned at least 14,000 civilians throughout the course of the war. ... The federal government simultaneously monitored and censored both the mails and telegraphs. ... It also suppressed newspapers. Over three hundred, including the Chicago Times, the New York World, and the Philadelphia Evening Journal, had to cease publication for varying periods."02-19-2007, 04:35 PM          Lincolnian  Senior Member            Join Date: Feb 2007 Location: Granby, CT sometimes NH. 1,381 posts, read 987,879 times Reputation: 676           Quote:    Originally Posted by YapCity   ..and this is why I "lean" left, but would never call myself a "liberal". Almost every argument is filled with "you don't know what you're talking about" or "you need to educate yourself", all under the assumption that if you don't agree with them you must be stupid. The fact is that without conservatives keeping the extreme left in check, we'd be living in a third world country by now. Do you have any idea what a "Bolshevik" is? Everyone has been called everything by just about anyone with a mouth. Lincoln was no communist. -TT    I agree with YapCity. Lincoln was famous for appointing some of his strongest critics to his cabinet.  He let the left and right fight it out for the good of the country and maintaining the Union. Communist, I think not!  He has been voted overwhelmingly the greatest president of all time by Americans from all ideologies.  Thus, the inspiration for my philosophical party, the Lincolnian Party (lincolnians.org).  Teddy Roosevelt is not far behind in my mind.  James Madison, father of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, another great Amerian.  His movement led to the development of the Republican Party.  I'm hoping for the next great president to emerge.  I don't care what party they belong to as long as they are about preserving our unity and keeping this country the land of opportunity and liberty!                    02-19-2007, 04:36 PM          Amaznjohn  Senior Member            Join Date: Feb 2007 2,875 posts, read 1,719,180 times Reputation: 438          Maybe you want to check your facts on these. Clinton signed the Welfare Reform Bill under duress, passed by the conservative Congress to reform the FDR New Deal and the Johnson Great Society fiascos.Pressure provided by the U.S. military build up during the 80s provided the trigger to bring down the Soviet Union.The Banking system was in place much before FDR, but I was mistaken, the National Bank Act was passed by Congress in 1864.NASA was initiated by the National Aeronautics Space Act of 1958 under Eisenhower.The U.S. military is ranked 3rd? By who's standards. Thanks to Conservatives or it would be ranked much further down.                    02-19-2007, 04:38 PM          Amaznjohn  Senior Member            Join Date: Feb 2007 2,875 posts, read 1,719,180 times Reputation: 438           Quote:    Originally Posted by greatbasinguide   My ideology?

Reagans conservative policys won the cold war and created the largest economic expansion in years. Newt's contract with America was a start at chipping away at the forty plus years of liberal big government democrat control ! conservative policys of President Bush 43's 6 years along with republican control of both houses of congress resulted in TAXES AT A 20 YEAR LOW, TAX REVENUES ALL TIME HIGH, THE DEFICIT CUT IN 1/2, UNEMPLOYMENT RECORD LOWS, STOCK MARKET RECORD HIGHS, CONTROLLED INFLATION, NO TERRORIST ATTACK SINCE 911, HOME OWNERSHIP ALL TIME HIGH, CHARITBLE GIVING ALL TIME HIGH. In a nutshell conservatives have slowly been chipping away at the social utopia created by FDR and LBJ!                    02-19-2007, 04:43 PM          Lincolnian  Senior Member            Join Date: Feb 2007 Location: Granby, CT sometimes NH. 1,381 posts, read 987,879 times Reputation: 676           Quote:    Originally Posted by greatbasinguide   My ideology?

He ignored the Constitution by forcibly eliminating many of the rights the States were given.             Please register to post and access all features of our very popular forum.
