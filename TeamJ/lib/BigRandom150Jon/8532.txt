Cast opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in   the romantic comedy One Fine Day, Clooney showed his sexy, sensitive and silly side. Then Clooney heated up the screen   with Jennifer Lopez in the thriller Out of Sight and starred in the oceanic epic The Perfect Storm. He won a   Golden Globe for his role in the Coen Brothers' film O Brother, Where Art Thou?, not only solidifying his stature as a   respectable leading man but also revealing his sharp wit and award-worthy comic timing. And the hits just keep on coming,   including his accomplished directorial debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and the sexy romantic comedy   Intolerable Cruelty (with Catherine Zeta-Jones, and another Coen Brothers' work). His roles in Ocean's Eleven   and Ocean's Twelve further locked his title as Hollywood's Smoothest Man. What's up next for this talent? The stars   may have an idea!Birth Details:May 6, 1961Lexington, KentuckyBorn under a Taurus Sun, it's no   wonder Clooney is so steamily sensual and sexy -- and determined to reach his goals. Taurus is the sign of the bull, and   possesses a great, stubborn patience that lends itself to success. Taurus is also the most sensuous sign of the zodiac, in   love with all physical pleasures from sex to cuddling to eating rich, sweet, creamy desserts. Taurus folks appreciate the   finer things in life -- art, fine food, expensive cars, well-made clothes ... And yet they wear their class and extravagance   in a decidedly down-to-earth way, a quality Clooney has definitely mastered (after all, he's the top man on so many of   Hollywood's best-dressed lists). He may be a ladies' man, but he's also a man with a plan -- and he'll stick to it, no matter   how long it takes or how difficult it becomes. Trying to change his mind would be fruitless, since Taurus natives are   notoriously difficult to budge.With his Mercury also in Taurus (and in conjunction with his Sun), Clooney is a   straight shooter who says what he thinks. The actor's words are well thought out and to the point, and he'll only tell you   what you need to hear. Since his Sun and Mercury both square Uranus, the planet of rebellion, Clooney is quick with a verbal   comeback and may occasionally shock listeners with his candor. The rebel in this Sexiest Man Alive is simmering beneath the   surface, waiting for the right moment to pounce.His Venus, planet of love, in fiery Aries makes Clooney a bit   impetuous and possibly selfish in the game of love. He may have a 'me first!' attitude in romance that can be hard on his   lover. Furthermore, with his Venus making no aspect to any other planet in his chart, Clooney may be similarly disconnected   in affairs of the heart.Thanks to potent Mars in dramatic Leo, the spotlight is square on Clooney. Devilishly yet   regally charming, Clooney likes being in charge, the better to get the attention he deserves (or so he'd say). While the   Taurus in his chart may tone things down a bit, you can bet that Clooney wants big-time success. And with the stars on his   side, he's getting his way!Birth data source: www.imdb.com Do you dream of being rich and famous like your   favorite celebrity?
