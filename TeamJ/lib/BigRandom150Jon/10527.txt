At least SIX nasty viruses set up their foul abode in my computer and sang, NAH NA NAH NA BOO BOO every time I tried to do anything more complicated than logging on. Even that was a frustrating task. At time requiring me to turn the power off and then back on after a few minutes.Now, I have to preface this little tale by telling you that my family and friends thought that I would be the last person they knew that would fall in love with a computer. But, from the first hand me down. A large bulky ,off white elephant of a machine that a friend rescued from his companys trash heap and gave to me. I was smitten. The old dial up noise had me twitching with anticipation of the joys at hand. I am awful with anything technical. My 6 year old granddaughter can work my television remote better and faster than I can. I break things just by walking past them. I had little desire to save up money to buy a computer but when offered a free one by my buddy, Marty AND he being a systems engineer and promising it was easy . That if I broke anything he could fix it. I was actually excited a little. I figured I could look up recipes and learn about e-mail. Just a little recreational use. Nothing heavy. Oh but even the best of intentions fall away when you become addicted to electronic lust.I was not a faithful lover, no. I soon wanted bigger and better. True, they were still cast offs. The dregs of the windows family. Black sheep all. I welcomed each and every new one with the hormonal joy of a 16 year old in the back seat of a drive in movie. I upgraded my service. My fingers became more nimble and my patience grew short with waiting and waiting for my sweet companion to show me something new. Finally, a few years back the ONE I had been longing for came via UPS.I found a world of wonder without having to leave my house. I traveled the globe with  other poets from a group based in the U.K. whose members lived in many countries. I worked at my craft and better still, I learned so much more about world views from regular folk, not political talking heads.  With the help of my son-in- law, Eric I started a poetry blog 5 years ago. That  blog has grown into me and I have grown into it. Now it serves to not only connect with poets and writers, but far more, it lets me immediately express my political views and reactions to events. Then, ah, THEN, face book. The promised land. Hand on my darlings keyboard we ventured in. I met people I knew and people that I would come to know. I found people of like mind and some that were polar opposites. I found much needed support and a few people that must have crawled from the ooze only a decade or so ago. I found Joe and the rest of the WORLD WIDE HIPPIES family-well, they found me and I am loving that.so- to get back round to the gremlins and the lessons-Ive learned that computers are faithless and make bad lovers . Just as I was to the first few that came into my life. No amount of pleading or promising could soften its humming little heart and coax it to evict those gremlins that obviously meant more to it than I did.Ive learned that sadly, neither my daily newspaper or the endless cable news programs can give me as much truth as I can find via my computer. I can check what are lies or spin on my computer. I can take the time to go from fact check to fact check while the pundits on cable have tap danced through 6 or 7 different items expecting me to take their word for the truth of them.Ive learned that computers can be temperamental and unreliable and that concerns me in regard to the electronic voting machines that are being forced upon us. They have then here and I still am not at ease with the question of reliability or security. Gremlins can strike at anytime. There are some humans out there that might just sneak a few into a polling place or two orMost of all, Ive learned that friends are REAL, even if Ive never met them or heard their voices. That people are pretty much the same world over in their wants and needs. Their goals and mine, their hope and fears, are mine as well. Ive also had to face the fact that there really ARE some very bad people in this world and in this country. I cant ignore that or try to explain it away or go on about my very ordinary life without trying to make things better or to at least use what talents I have to point these people out. To at least try to have a rational and civil dialogue with some that cant or wont admit that we have been lied to and set against each other for the benefit of the very few when compared to the rest of us.Thankfully, my sweet but feisty Mr. Computer is on the mend and back with me once more. Both of us are older and a little worse for the wear but I promise it, I will be faithful and loving. Unless, well, old habits ARE hard to break.Read More Pittsburgh in the 60s by Sherry Pasquarello.
