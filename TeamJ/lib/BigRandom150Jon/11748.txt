If you leave an obviously bogus email address, dont expect to see your comment posted.Stay focused, respectful, truthful. We will delete comments that are abusive, off-topic, use excessive foul language, include personal attacks or include intentionally misleading or false  information.

Continued abuse will result in blacklisting. Its a given, that any racist or sexist comments will automatically be deleted.Spam is absolutely not tolerated. We use Akismet spam filters and while they are generally excellent, occasionally they do catch legitimate comments as spam, especially if they contain multiple links. If you left a comment that has not appeared after more than a day it may have gone into the spam folder. Our apologies but we simply do not always have time to look through the hundreds of spam comments we may get each day.There are real live people behind the scenes here. We have lives, children, families and hot meals waiting for us, so we may not be right here, on the spot, all the time. If you left a comment and it has not been posted please be patient. Well get to it, there is no need to repost your comment again and again. The subsequent comments will only go into moderation also.Simple enough!

I love the its our sandbox!ReplyEric PearsonDecember 15, 2010 at 11:01 amFrank,  I am a born and raised PL/OB resident who pays taxes and I am perplexed by the situation regarding the homeless in OB.  I spent every day at the wall skating, surfing and gettng into youthful innocent trouble in OB and I completely understand its cultureBUT.  I went down to enjoy the beach by the Lifeguard Station with my wife and 2 year old daughter to spend the day and my wife was basically scared off by the homeless.  Its totally out of control and I would like to get your feedback on the situation.ReplyCancel reply Leave a CommentName *E-mail *WebsiteWant to be notified of follow-up comments by email?
