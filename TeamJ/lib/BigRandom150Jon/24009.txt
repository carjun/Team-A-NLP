Diane Black New GOP House member: Sick kids shouldnt get health insurance..Its too expensive for Insurance companies to cover.January 5, 2011jamesb1011 commentThats because if they do..It will put the Healthcare Insurance companies out of the business.Okay.What business are they in?Insurance.Or.robbing people of their premium money?Do you believe this shit?By Jed Lewison @ Dailykos..Meet Diane Black, the new GOP congresswoman from Tennessees sixth congressional district. Like most all of her GOP colleagues, shes eager to repeal health care reform. Why? Because she thinks its a really bad idea to require insurance companies to provide coverage for sick children.There is a mandate there that insurance companies must insure children up to the age of 24, and what we have found is that there are a lot of insurance companies that are just saying were not going to be in this business any longer, because we know that we cant survive if thats what were going to do.And the second piece of that was to insure children regardless of their health care history, and as a result of that, I know several health care insurance agents in my district who have said were just dropping any insurance for children whatsoever.First of all, the law allows parents to keep children on their insurance policy until age 26  not 24. But setting aside her ignorance of the most basic details about the bill, the bigger problem with Blacks argument is that shes saying insurance companies shouldnt be required to cover sick children because it might put them out of business.Basically, what Black wants is a world in which insurance companies can drop coverage for anybody who isnt completely healthy. Thats obviously a great business model  sell insurance to people who arent likely to need it, then drop coverage as soon as they get sick. But if insurance companies can cherry pick and only offer coverage to healthy people, then whats the point of insurance in the first place?One of the very best things in the new law is that insurance companies are required to offer insurance to everybody. That means they cant deny coverage to kids just because the kids happen to be sick. Diane Black and her GOP colleagues want to do away with that. They want insurance companies to be able to deny coverage to children who arent healthy. In other words, they want real life death panels. The only good thing you can say here is that at least Black had the courage to admit it.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Media, Politics, The Economy, Updates, WomenHealthcare Inurance for sick kids, Rep.
