It will now go to a runoff between incumbent Delwin Jones and candidate Charles Perry."Feels good. Feels exactly where we thought we were going to be. We new we'd be in a runoff when we started, and that's good," Perry said.Jones says with three candidates in the race, and after doing some polling of their own, a runoff was very likely. "Well, I was not surprised.With two candidates working so hard like the others did - it's difficult to overcome."Jones has held the District 83 seat for nearly three decades, but Perry believes it's time for a fresh face in Austin. "I think it's time for a new energy level. That's whatwe're going to need to get us over some of the big hurdles that we've got facing the state. We've got budgeting issues. We've got priority issues, and we just need to get back to basics. Truthfully, I think we need a fresh perspective to do that."But Jones disagrees. He says hisexperience is what the districtneeds, "I'm going to express more strongly my record of achievement compared to a record the other candidate would have of promises what to do. Because I think the public of West Texas will take a look at what has been done and compare it to what is promised to do."The runoff election is Tuesday, April 13th. And because there is no democratic candidate - the winner in the runoff will essentially win the District 83 seat.2010 KCBD NewsChannel 11. All rights reserved.
