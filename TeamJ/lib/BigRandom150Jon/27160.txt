Resistance exercise produced greater increases in blood flow to the limbs, while aerobic exercise reduced arterial stiffness, but without an increase in blood flow.Resistance exercise also led to a longer-lasting decrease in blood pressure after exercise, compared to aerobic exercise."Resistance exercise may offer greater benefits from the increases in blood flow to active muscles and could be implemented as a companion to an aerobic training program," wrote study leader Scott R. Collier, of Appalachian State University, and colleagues in a press release.They said their findings support previous research showing that resistance exercise has unique effects on blood pressure and limb blood flow."The present study indicates that an acute bout of resistance exercise shows many favorable cardiovascular benefits and should therefore be considered as part of a daily exercise training program," the researchers concluded.The study appears in the November issue of Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.More informationThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about physical activity.Copyright  2010 HealthDay.
