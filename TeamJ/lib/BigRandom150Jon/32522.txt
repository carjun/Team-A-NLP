Then they became one. A few of the originals remain friends of mine and, half a century later, our phone conversations are still listened-in-to by the FBI. This is understandable given the Yippies successful invasion of Disneyland, their rabble-rousing activities at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, their unsuccessful attempt to levitate the Pentagon and their threat to put LSD into the water supplies of major cities. An attempt to gridlock Washington DC on May Day 1971 by crowding roads and bridges led to the largest mass arrest in US history. Oh, I almost forgot. They tried to run a pig for the Presidency.MoreShare/Bookmarkfrom  NewsOne Responseleave one Tommy Stokes permalink             November 20, 2010          Well, consider it SHARED! LOL! Yeah, I agree with the writer, we need MORE YIPPIES in the World of Capitalism Maybe, to even form a REAL, and serious party that promotes Contributism over Capitalism as a serious approach to dealing with the escapades of the greedy, and powerful. If enough people shame the Capitalist approach, and praise the Contributists (like these folks~ http://www.fiscalstrength.com) maybe there could be hope that concern for the ecology of Earth, and the well being of each other, could take precedence over he who dies with the most toys, wins philosophy of modern Capitalism.Click here to cancel reply.Leave a ReplyName: (required):Email:  (required):Website:Comment:Note: You can use basic XHTML in your comments.
