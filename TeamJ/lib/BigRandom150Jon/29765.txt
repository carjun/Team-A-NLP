He has denied the rape charges, claiming he was a victim of a political witch hunt and suggesting he was targeted because he comes from Israel's Sephardic community.Katsav, who is a father of five, was ordered to surrender his passport while awaiting sentencing. His lawyers said they would appeal.The conviction capped a long saga that stunned Israelis since it broke in 2006. The then-president initially complained that a female employee was blackmailing him but the woman went to police with her side of the story, and that prompted other women to come forward.According to the indictment, Katsav forced one woman to the floor of his office at the Tourism Ministry in 1998 and raped her. A second time that year, he summoned her to a Jerusalem hotel to go over paperwork and raped her on the bed in his room. The indictment alleged that Katsav tried to calm his victim by saying: "Relax, you'll enjoy it." The indictment also alleged that he harassed two women during his term as president, embracing them against their will and making unwanted sexual comments.On Katsav's 60th birthday in 2005, an assistant offered congratulations. He then hugged her at length, sniffing her neck, according to the indictment. She complained to police, and the indictment said Katsav later tried to persuade her to change her testimony, earning him an additional charge of obstruction of justice.The conviction by a three-judge panel was widely praised as a victory for Israel's legal system and for women's rights.Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, said: "The court sent two clear and sharp messages: that everyone is equal and every woman has the full right to her body." He called the verdict a sad day for Israel and its citizens.Katsav resigned in 2007, under a plea bargain that would have required him to admit to lesser charges of sexual misconduct. But in April 2009, he rejected the deal and vowed to clear his name in court.Around that time, he held a bizarre news conference in which he lashed out at prosecutors and the media and denied any wrongdoing. He shook in anger, waved a computer disk that he said proved his innocence and screamed at reporters in the room.The president of Israel is head of state but holds a largely ceremonial post. It is currently held by Shimon Peres.LINK: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8231865/Former-Israe... groups:News, Women tags:Israel,Justice,Jewish,Judaism,Jews,Sexism,Israeli,Sexist 4 more|1 comment// Former Israeli president guilty of rapehide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.
