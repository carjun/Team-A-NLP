Langenbrunner was drafted by Dallas and began his career there. He was part of the Stars' only Stanley Cup championship in 1999, then was traded to New Jersey in 2002 and part of the Devils' championship in 2003.        New Jersey gets a conditional third-round 2011 draft pick in the trade announced Friday.

He was a healthy scratch for New Jersey on Thursday night amid rumors of a trade.        "He hits the mold of the type of players we want on this roster - strong work ethic, tough, passionate, and hard to play against," said Stars GM Joe Nieuwendyk, who was Langenbrunner's teammate in Dallas and New Jersey. "We are thrilled to be able to bring him back to Dallas."        The Stars traded Langenbrunner and Nieuwendyk to New Jersey in March 2002 for Jason Arnott, Randy McKay and a draft pick.        Drafted by Dallas in the second round of the 1993 draft, Langenbrunner has 232 goals and 388 assists in 996 career NHL games since 1995. He set a career high with 42 assists last season.        Langenbrunner has been to the playoffs in 13 consecutive NHL seasons, five with the Stars and eight with the Devils. His four playoff overtime goals are tied with Chris Drury for the most among active players.        Last winter, Langenbrunner served as captain for Team USA in the Vancouver Olympics. It was his second time in the Olympics.   ---  FOR MORE NEW YORK SPORTS CLICK HERE TO VISIT ESPN NEW YORK    (Copyright 2011 by The Associated Press.
