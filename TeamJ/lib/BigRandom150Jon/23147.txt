Hes had five back surgeries and is scheduling a sixth, but a more positive person youll probably never meet.He pauses on the stairs to look at a large portrait of himself in his trademark clown outfit. David Crosby purchased this at an anti-war rally in Santa Fe, Wavy said. He called me up one time and said, I cant stand you looking at me all the time, and he mailed it to me.He introduces Jahanara, his wife of 45 years, then shows a reporter into his office  more like a crash pad, complete with a Jimi Hendrix CD playing in the background.The occasion is a new documentary on Wavy, Saint Misbehavin: The Wavy Gravy Movie, directed by Michelle Esrick. The film looks at Wavys life, from his early years as a Greenwich Village poet, comic and performance artist  still known by his real name, Hugh Romney  through Woodstock and his years as one of Americas most visible hippies, as well as his extensive charity work.MoreShare/Bookmarkfrom  NewsNo comments yetClick here to cancel reply.Leave a ReplyName: (required):Email:  (required):Website:Comment:Note: You can use basic XHTML in your comments.
