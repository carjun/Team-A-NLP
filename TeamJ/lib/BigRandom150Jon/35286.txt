I had nevermet Mr. Kolb prior to that time; but I was fortunate enough to meet and talkwith him some months later. I found him to be intelligent and extremely wellinformed on the subject; having lived and worked in Oak Ridge both during and afterthe Manhattan Project. In those years, Kolb played an important roll in theevolution of the Manhattan Engineering District into the nuclear weaponsfacility that is the economic lifes-blood of this small East Tennesseecommunity.Hisletter took issue with my critical narrative of the use, by allied bombers, ofincendiary devices against civilian populations in Germany and later overJapan. Mr. Kolb was particularly concerned that I had misunderstood or perhapseven misrepresented what he called the fundamental, underlying rationale forthe use of these weapons against civilian targets; the fact that the firebombings of Dresden and Tokyo by the U.S were retaliatory in nature andtherefore justifiable. In his view, it was as though that detail somehowvindicated the act of industrial scale murder being committed by one civilizedsociety upon the innocent war ravaged civilian population of another. He alsoopined that the U.S. was not the first nation to use weapons of massdestruction, pointing to the use of V-2 rockets by Germany against GreatBrittan during the closing months of the war in Europe.Ispent some time listening to him and deeply regarding his courage and hispassion. Like many in this tight-knit community, he is unapologetic about his involvementin and support of the development of nuclear weapons and the use of theseweapons in the final assault on Japan. But his passion belies a tragicallyflawed logic; V-2 rockets werent nuclear bombs.That act of war by Germany, whileappalling, hardly constituted the same degree of technological over-kill onewould assign to the introduction by the U.S. of nuclear arms against an enemythat had been largely ground down to a near indefensible state. The whine of anincoming V-2 was spine chilling, no question. It was in fact, the introductionof a tactic that would come to be known decades later as an act ofstate-sponsored Terrorism. However, a V-2 couldnt take out a city block muchless a city. AGerman V-2 rocket carried a 1.1-ton warhead of TNT and ammonium nitrate. Thetotal deaths caused by the 3,000 or so V-2s launched by Germany against GreatBritain amounted to 7,250. Thats 2.4 casualties per rocket on average; hardlya weapon of mass destruction. By contrast, it is estimated that some 20,000German technicians, civilians and prisoners of war who were conscripted asslave labor by German scientists in the V-2 program, were killed in accidentsinvolving its development and construction. Clearly the V weapons were farmore deadly to those who built them than they were to any of those who weretargeted by them. You stood a much greater chance of surviving while listeningto the in-coming whine of its rocket motor than you did of bolting the beasttogether.Bycomparison, the total explosive power of the two atomic bombs placed on Japanexceeded 40 kilotons and killed close to a quarter of a million people.WhileJim Kolbs opinion on the subject may be at variance with the facts, his viewis not unique. Many in this community and the country as a whole, feellikewise. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find more than a handful ofpeople each August 6th, the anniversary date of the bombing ofHiroshima, gathered outside the main gate of the National Security Complex inOak Ridgeprotesting the use of nuclear weapons by the U.S againstJapan. Over the years those numbers have steadily declined. In a post-9/11world there is a deep abiding sense in this country and in others, that intimes of war, a determined and capable enemy must be confronted and overwhelmedwith swift and devastating dispatch; using any and every weapon available.Iwould point out that Saudi Sheikh Hamid Al Fahad used a similar rationaleagainst the West in 2003. Al Fahad, one of the Royal Saudi kingdoms mostprominent clerics and close associate of Al Quida, provided to his followersand the world at large, a very comprehensive religious opinion called a Fatwa.In it he justified the use of nuclear weapons against the United States. Underthe pretext that the U.S. is responsible for the deaths of up to 10 millionMuslims, the Fatwa calls on pious Muslims around the world to strive for themeans to use nuclear weapons against the United States; an attack in which asimilar number of U.S. casualties could be expected.Inthis respect at least, Mr. Kolb has much more in common with Mr. Al Fahad thaneither might care to acknowledge.Theirpoints are understandable and valid. Which American, having learned of thesurprise attack and subsequent deaths of 2,403 civilian and military personnelat Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, did not cheer the hundreds of thousandskilled at Nagasaki and Hiroshima 42 long months later? Likewise, hundreds ofthousands of Palestinian and ethnic Arab deaths at the hands of Westernoccupiers and the puppet governments they have supported for centuries, canscarcely have gone unnoticed by Sheik Al Fahad who no doubt cheered in thestreets along with millions of other Muslims, at the news of the 2,833 killedby Al Quieda on September 11, 2001.The Bush Administration, early in 2008,announced that it was reducing U.S nuclear arsenals in compliance with armsreduction policy. The government would not release any information as to theexact number of nuclear weapons currently held by the U.S, but it is believedthat there are some 6,000 warheads either deployed or held in reserve. Thenations, which make up the former Soviet Union, are believed to have a similarnumber under their control. These totals are far and away lower than the levelsheld at the close of the cold war when many believe both countries possessedmore than 70,000 such weapons. (According to Pulitzer Prize winning authorRichard Rhodes, the nuclear and thermonuclear arsenals held by the two Cold Warcombatants reached an astounding 22,500 million tons explosive equivalent or1.5 million Hiroshimas).Yeteven given those reduced numbers, with nations such as The United Kingdom,France, Germany, China, Israel, Pakistan, India and ominously North Korea andIran, holding or potentially gaining membership in the exclusive nuclear club,the world is still awash in weapons of mass destruction. But these nucleararsenals are dwarfed by the known stockpiles of chemical and biologicalweapons. There are thousands of tons of ricin, VX nerve gas, and anthraxscattered throughout the globe. Lethality in some cases is attained by grams oreven trace amounts of these substances; some as small as a grain of salt. Theycan kill entire cities; and render uninhabitable, hundreds of millions of squaremiles. And they can do so in a few brief seconds on any tranquil summerafternoon.Itsall but inevitable that some of these weapons could someday fall into the handsof terrorists. In fact, it may have already occurred. But that is not theextent of the threat. Bellicosity is not the exclusive attribute of third worldtyrants or cave-dwelling extremists. It is entirely possible that nations suchas India or Pakistan could find their hatred and distrust of each otherbecoming more virulent and stronger even than the bonds of caution that hold incheck their willingness to destroy each other. The same could be said of eachand every country now in possession of nuclear arms.In such a maelstrom of passion anddistrust, hatred and violence, the stakes are too high for this hand to ever beplayed.In the harrowing event that those who share the view of Mr.sKolb and Al Fahad, ever acquire the authority to initiate the thermonuclearjudgment day, which cooler heads have held in check for more than half a century,where does the rest of the world go to escape? When nation states or rogueelements unleash the full measure of their retaliatory appetites, whochallenges the steeply fronted, luminous shock wave that would emanate fromeach nuclear explosion with a central core temperature estimated at 200 milliondegrees? How do we explain to the children who werent incinerated in the firstwave, or the first hour, or the first week, that the world we once knew is goneand if any of them survive to adulthood, along the way they may well come towish that they too were enveloped in the first fires of mankinds self-immolation?Howcan anyone who has ever seen the highly contrasted images of the verticalexpanse of fire and smoke rising above the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,destroyed by devices darkly, amusingly dubbed Fat Man and Little Boy, evercontemplate setting in motion the utter destruction that would surely follow?The all out exchange of the sum of all the nuclear and thermonuclear weapons heldin the arsenals of each of the nuclear powers on this planet would rival thecataclysm which brought on the end of the Jurassic 65 million years ago. Onlyroaches and rats would be left to clean up the mess.Theresponsibility for managing the containment of the passions and ferociouspotential of the human hearts and the weapons they have created istransitioning now to a new generation. We have provided them with great skillsbut also a great potential for apathy. Frankly, at times we have given them leadershipthat has been suspect, though to our credit we have also set them the exampleof a people who mostly tried not to follow their impulsive, reptilian brainstems into the dark. Little wonder that at times they seem so immersed inself-indulgence and accepting of raw authority.But,sharing ownership in our common humanity and holding an investment in a commonfate, they are just like us. Should they fail to realize the soberingimperative of their cautionary potential, there will be nowhere to hide fromthe resultant consequences. Still, they are capable, fully capable ofmaneuvering the hazardous shoals that surround us in this world and of avoidingthe roaring falls that would forever extinguish the lights of the progeny ofAdam and Eve.Forall his mercy, God has not circumscribed our survival against our willingnessto destroy his world along with ourselves. The tree of the knowledge of goodand evil he placed in the Garden of Eden was not walled off. There were noarmed guards. There was only a warning.Therest, he left up to us.Thermo-nuclear Terrorism The use of nuclear weapons by terrorist will dwarf the destruction wrought on Sept. 11vote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...?
