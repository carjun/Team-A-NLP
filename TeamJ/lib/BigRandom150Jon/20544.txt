Another reason never to leave Ocean Beach.  2 Dollar Thrill is a tiny little store making a big bang on Newport.When I first wander in I admit Im a bit confused.  I ask the friendly sales clerk So, not everything is two dollars, is it?Yes it is.  she answers and adds; Everything is 2 dollars, thats all.

Cordelia is quick to let me know that the choice to close the shop is a very positive move for the pair as they are eager to focus on their online business without being tied down to the demands of the store. They are looking forward to their new found freedom to travel and do select antique shows And, Bob throws in with a smile, some golf.2 commentsRead the full article OB Voter Registration  Right to Vote for Ex-Convicts and the HomelessJuly 1, 2010By Brenda McFarlane / July 1, 2010Have you seen the tent set up on the grass at Newport and Abbott with a bunch of scrawled signs along with one official sign reading: Republicans Register Here?
