I mean this is rough. For starters he took like 5 min. to do anything. The rule of thumb is no one clip should be longer than 10 seconds in length. I just started clicking ahead. Secondly Why in the world would he frame his shot like 20 yrds away with a huge freakin bush in frame? Thirdly it was over exposed and the white balance was WAAAY to warm. This guy has no business using a camera or living in America. dcgud7 minutes agodcgud7 minutes ago@tekv2 you're not wrong at all, Columbine was already a wake up call over ten years ago, Its just no one did jack shit about the gun laws in America and this still goes on ten years later with loner trash nutjobs like this jared guy taking his anger out on people thinking shooting people dead is the answer. All I hear about in America is Mall shootings, Church shootings, whole families shot dead in their homes, drive by shootings, this shit never stops.terry27087 minutes agoterry27087 minutes agoFUCK YOU TEA PARTYBERMEZZO9 minutes agoBERMEZZO9 minutes ago@myastroflight Ill bet he had a hard time in school for being such a weird fuck, but he killed someone so, i think your alone.paintballmoreyo10 minutes agopaintballmoreyo10 minutes agoDo you guys know who Marx and the manifesto even is? Damn dingbats. Get informed before you speak. Reading about Hitler doesn't mean shit. I like the God Delusion and liked it. Does that make me a Hitler loving Atheist militant? No. Stop generalizing. This guy is product of the society he lives in, not much to it. Should be a wake up call, not that Columbine or all the other crazy motherfuckers shouldn't.Morons.tekv222 minutes agotekv222 minutes agoThis individual is nothing but a sad and sick young man with a bitter and twisted opinion about life. So he decided to shoot and kill people. The sick Fuckhead even shot dead a 9 year old young girl which i find most upsetting. The best punishment you can give to this piece of shit is to lock him up in a cell with no food or water, let him starve and suffer a slow and painful death. Wake up America, change your stupid fucking gun laws, fucking idiots rights to bear arms, real smart that is!!terry270825 minutes agoterry270825 minutes ago@cryptsub HE IS A LIBERAL! he burned an american flag,,,,,,,,, hated god and the bible and advocated gay marriage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AND DESPITE! what your liberal run public school taught you LIBERALS love HITLER AND KARL MARX! and every other sick fuck ever! so start thinking for yourself ass wipe!sjdss38 minutes agosjdss38 minutes agoAm I the only person who feels sorry for this kid?myastroflight52 minutes agomyastroflight52 minutes agothis guy was a wack, leave the political blame shit out of this he killed a democratcongress women and a conservative judgergdingo54 minutes agorgdingo54 minutes agoView all Comments 1      2      3      4      5      6      7          Next   Reply  ShareRemoveFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserLoading...Suggestions 4:26 Add to Added to queue    Jarabedepalo - "AGUA"by JarabedepaloTVFeatured Video578,028 views 0:59 Add to Added to queue    EUROPE - Superstitious SOLO - Tiago "TMUSICIAN"by TMUSICIAN12,987 views 4:14 Add to Added to queue    yLLi BaKa -me cigare NiKoTiNe""'-- www.albanian...by maraki92nik408,570 views 4:09 Add to Added to queue    KILLER BEE: MFI-17 Saab Supporter "Super Mushshak"by dynmicpara14,602 views 4:21 Add to Added to queue    Starcraft 2 CGI Announcement Trailer "Hell, it'...by Tieno3,768,073 views 3:57 Add to Added to queue    Dimarzio "PAF pro"  Vs.
