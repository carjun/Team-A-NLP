Rush Limbaugh: "I tell people don't kill all the liberals. Leave enough so we can have two on every campus  living fossils  so we will never forget what these people stood for."2. Senator Phil Gramm: "We're going to keep building the party until we're hunting Democrats with dogs."3. Rep. James Hansen on Bill Clinton: Get rid of the guy. Impreach him, censure him, assassinate him."4. John Derbyshire intimated in the National Review that because Chelsea Clinton had "the taint," she should "be killed."5. Ann Coulter: "We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed, too."6. Ann Coulter: "My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times building."7. Bill O'Reilly: "ll those clowns over at the liberal radio network, we could incarcerate them immediately. Will you have that done, please? Send over the FBI and just put them in chains."8. Clear Channel radio host Glenn Beck said he was "thinking about killing Michael Moore" and pondered whether "I could kill him myself, or if I would need to hire somebody to do it," before concluding: "No, I think I could. I think he could be looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking the life out -- is this wrong?"Refresh|+194 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDupnik was over-the-top.Jackpine RadicalJan-09-11 01:45 PM#0Who said he was over the top?
