MLB - In ranking baseball's Top 10 rotations, there is one very notable absence - ESPNEDITIONS:USADEPORTESMoreAsiaAustraliaBrazilUnited KingdomCITIES:BOSTONCHICAGODALLASLOS ANGELESNEW YORKESPNMLBShopBuster Olney BlogBaseball's Top 10 rotationsDecember, 22, 201012/22/107:59AM ETEmailPrintCommentsBy Buster OlneyThe Phillies' signing of Cliff Lee has created the best barstool debate of the winter, the kind of question that has no right answer but is awful fun to talk about:Who has the best rotation in the majors?Here's one humble ranking of the Top 10 rotations in the majors (and I'm going to cheat and list 11). Keep in mind: this reflects that a pair of guys who could at least alter this list -- Carl Pavano and Andy Pettitte -- remain uncommitted for 2011 as of this writing.1. Philadelphia PhilliesCombine the 2010 results for Roy Halladay, Cole Hamels, Roy Oswalt and Cliff Lee, and this is what you get:Games: 126Innings: 883.1Hits: 773Earned runs: 279Walks (and this is the most incredible number): 164Strikeouts: 808Earned run average: 2.84Average innings per start: About 7Those statistics are very, very special.2. San Francisco Giants For Buster Olney's take on the rest of the top rotations, a great idea for Baltimore, plus more possible free-agency moves and a ton of rumors, notes and buzz from all angles, you need to be an ESPN Insider.Already an Insider?

He began covering baseball in 1989, as the Nashville Banner's beat reporter assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Later, he covered the San Diego Padres (1993-94), the Baltimore Orioles ('95-96), the New York Mets ('97) and the Yankees ('98-2001). Olney joined ESPN The Magazine in 2003, after six years at The New York Times, and he's the author of the Times' best-seller "The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty," a book about the Paul O'Neill-Tino Martinez Yankees dynasty of 1996-01.He grew up in central Vermont collecting baseball cards and listening to Red Sox, Expos, Phillies and Pirates radio broadcasts, and was a rabid fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He graduated from Vanderbilt University the same year as hoops legend Will Perdue, and ranks among the all-time leading scorers in pickup basketball at Memorial Gym. He claims to have witnessed the Commodores' winning football season in 1982 (although anthropologists have not yet confirmed this).Olney also contributes to ESPN.com, ESPN Radio, ESPNEWS, "SportsCenter" and "Baseball Tonight."Follow Buster on Twitter: @Buster_ESPNSend questions and comments SUBSCRIBE:Subscribe to this blog's RSSFollow this blog on TwitterBLOG ARCHIVE:Select OneJanuary 2011 (7)December 2010 (21)November 2010 (21)October 2010 (26)September 2010 (25)August 2010 (25)July 2010 (25)June 2010 (23)May 2010 (25)April 2010 (20)March 2010 (26)February 2010 (22)January 2010 (21)December 2009 (27)November 2009 (20)October 2009 (26)September 2009 (25)August 2009 (20)July 2009 (28)June 2009 (26)May 2009 (26)April 2009 (25)March 2009 (27)February 2009 (24)January 2009 (28)December 2008 (46)November 2008 (20)October 2008 (27)September 2008 (25)August 2008 (25)July 2008 (55)June 2008 (25)May 2008 (24)April 2008 (4)April 2006 (1)RECENT UPDATESThe baseball side of Tucson tragedy(1/9/2011 8:41 AM ET)Analyzing the Matt Garza deal(1/8/2011 9:06 AM ET)The most controversial vote(1/6/2011 8:07 AM ET)Searching for Aubrey Huff(1/5/2011 7:52 AM ET)Michael Young's options market(1/4/2011 7:54 AM ET)LINKSUSSportspagesNew York TimesNew York PostNewsdayNew York Daily NewsBoston GlobeBoston HeraldBaltimore SunMyESPNNFLMLBNBANHLNCAA FBNCAA BBNASCARSOCCERGOLFTENNISBOXINGMMAMORE SPORTSRADIO& MOREPAGE 2& COMMENTARYFANTASY& GAMESWATCHMLB HomeScheduleStandingsStatsTeamsAL EastBaltimore OriolesBoston Red SoxNew York YankeesTampa Bay RaysToronto Blue JaysAL CentralChicago White SoxCleveland IndiansDetroit TigersKansas City RoyalsMinnesota TwinsAL WestLos Angeles AngelsOakland AthleticsSeattle MarinersTexas RangersNL EastAtlanta BravesFlorida MarlinsNew York MetsPhiladelphia PhilliesWashington NationalsNL CentralChicago CubsCincinnati RedsHouston AstrosMilwaukee BrewersPittsburgh PiratesSt. Louis CardinalsNL WestArizona DiamondbacksColorado RockiesLos Angeles DodgersSan Diego PadresSan Francisco GiantsPlayersFantasyTransactionsLocalBBTN Hot StoveWinter LeaguesResources2010 SeasonAttendanceBeane CountCareer AssessmentsCloser ReportCy Young PredictorDaily LeadersDebutsFree AgentsGame Projections Hitting StreaksHome Run TrackerHunt for OctoberInjuriesKey DatesLifersLocalManagersNews WirePark FactorsPick Center Pitching ProbablesPlayer RatingsPodcast: Baseball TodayRadio scheduleRookie StatsRoster AnalysisStadium GuidesTop PerformancesTV scheduleTopicsTommy John SurgeryGeorge SteinbrennerSteroid EraMcCourt Divorce TrialEvents2010 MLB Postseason2010 Hall of Fame2010 All-Star Game2010 First-Year Player Draft2010 Season Preview2010 Spring TrainingHistoryAll-Star Game HistoryAwardsCommissionersDraft HistoryFranchise HistoriesHall of FamersHistorical LeadersHistory home pageNo-HittersSeason-By-Season HistoryTriple CrownsWorld Series HistoryRumorsESPN.com: Help | PR Media Kit | Advertise On ESPN.com | Sales Media Kit | Interest-Based Ads | Corrections | Contact Us | Site Map | Shop | Jobs at ESPN | Supplier Information2010 ESPN Internet Ventures.
