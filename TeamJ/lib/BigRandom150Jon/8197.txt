I hope she's ok as well as the boy.58529947Flag this commentvaosun said on January 7, 2011 at 10:37 PMThis is very sad I Hope he recovers and will be in my prayers. I live in this neighborhood and have to cross 39th ave and southern every day to take my child to school and it is very dangerous. There are no side walks or  lights and city bus blocks traffics view its horrible! I have seen several accidents and been about to have them myself, and this shouldnt happen so something could be done. Phoenix or Maricopa should take responsibility  and take action isnt that why we pay taxes?!58513424Flag this commentitsmev said on January 7, 2011 at 10:05 PMYes, londreezy is correct... there are no crosswalks at that intersection, and no street lights to speak of... only 2 stop signs.  39th Ave and Southern is a border corner of Phoenix proper, and main entry to two old neighborhoods... Perry Estates to the North, and Southern Meadows to the South.  Many many many people have been hurt and/or killed at that intersection.  I cannot understand why no signals or lights have been installed there... my only guess: because City of Phoenix and Maricopa County cannot agree as to who would pay for them.58512572Flag this commentdustytoothpicker said on January 7, 2011 at 9:45 PMIt's called NOT GIVING THE RIGHT OF WAY TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.58511929Flag this commentlondreezy said on January 7, 2011 at 8:03 PM@azguyam : i live in this neighborhood & believe me there is NO crosswalk  on 39th & it was extremly dark outside,this boy is my bestfriend, hes really hurt. so i would really appreciate it if you dont put smart comments here... @lovethesuns : yes this is a horrible way to start a day. but hes doing better 58508538Flag this commentazguyam said on January 7, 2011 at 2:53 PMever heard of a crosswalk?58495801Flag this commentlovethesuns said on January 7, 2011 at 12:42 PMI hope the teen will be ok.
