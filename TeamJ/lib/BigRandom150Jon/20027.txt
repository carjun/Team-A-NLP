(KGUN9-TV) - Two men are found in a remote part of pinal county shot to death. The Pinal County Sheriff believes the men were shot by fellow smugglers. Paul Babeu tellsKGUN9 Newsthis is just another example of drug violence spilling deep into Arizona.It was just five weeks ago that deputy Louie Puroll was shot in a drug corridor in west Pinal County. On Sunday, more violence in the same area.Around 7:30 p.m. that nightman calls 911 speaking Spanish. He says, "somebody shot me.While we were running."Sheriff Paul Babeu believes the caller was smuggling drugs with the second victim."A competing cartel or other people stole their product from them and also killed them," Babeu said.An autopsy on the bodies found marks on one of the men's shoulders consistent with carrying a large pack. Babeu tells us it could have been from carrying a drug load. Investigators are also looking into whether or not these men were involved in the shooting of deputy Purrol. That's because they asked dispatchers to send someone to the spot where purrol was shot."So they're familiar with the area. It's just not people watching it on TV. The desert looks similar in all kinds of remote areas in Arizona. He actually knew where the deputy was shot," Babeu said.The sheriff admits the cartels are operating in his county and without the federal government's help they can't get control. KGUN 9 News asked Babeu flat out if cartels control parts of Arizona."Absolutely, they have in terms of the remote areas in the drug corridors in the desert here in west Pinal County. Our government has even erected signs warning citizens to beware this is a known drug corridor," Babeu said.When the 911 call came in deputies immediately started a search but found the two bodies shot to death after four hours of looking. In lieu of this violence Babeu is asking president Barack Obama to send 3000 National Guard troops to the border to help stop it."We can't patrol not only these remote areas, we have a hard enough time just responding to our emergencies,"Deputies found an automatic rifle near one of the men who was killed. The pair has yet to be identified but Babeu believes one of the men has been caught illegally in the United States at least seven times.CommentsTerms of Use: We welcome your participation in our community.
