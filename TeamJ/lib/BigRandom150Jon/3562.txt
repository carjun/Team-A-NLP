We use their range rule book for our shooting matches.We hold scheduled matches every third Sunday of the month on the small-bore range at Ben Avery Shooting Facility located at I-17 just west on the Carefree Highway.We normally shoot paper target matches at 25, 50, and 100 yards and alternate with silhouette matches every other month. We shoot patched round balls and allow shooters to use any metallic sights on their rifles. All shooters are welcome to participate. Juniors ( under 18 yrs )  shoot for free but must be supervised by an adult.The range opens at 7 am. We normally set up by 8 am and start shooting shortly after. Our schedule varies with the season. We  start earlier in the summer and later in the winter.We shoot bench, off-hand, and cross-stick targets. Our match fee is $10 for members and $ 12 for non-members. If you just want to sight in or plink it's $5. You do not have to be a member of  our club to shoot with us.Our members are from all backgrounds and walks of life. The main thing we have in common is an enjoyment of muzzle loading. We have members who shoot, repair, build, and hunt with muzzleloaders.
