That's why not scrapping the issue immediately is really really stupid.No matter what, this is bad for the Democrats going into Novembers midterm elections, when they were already expected to suffer big losses. If the Republicans do win a majority in Congress, they will have subpoena power and that is when things will really get bad for all involved. That is why it is so strange that the White House has not put this fire out yet. Those in power never seem to learn the lesson that it is not the incident but the cover-up that can be devastating. And this is certainly starting to feel like a cover-up.You would have to believe that the White House and Sestak are trying to come up with a story that gives each some wiggle room. It was all just a big misunderstanding, is what we can expect to hear.That answer does save the White House, but will undoubtedly cost Sestak. He then comes off as a political opportunist and, even worse, the insider he fought so hard not to be.http://blogs.phillymag.com/the_philly_post/2010/05/27/o... /Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadDoesn't there have to be something illegal before there's a cover up?

Edited on Thu May-27-10 12:40 PM by PADEMJES12we know nothing until we get facts from the Admiral.its the lying that gets you, while the stonewalling makes it ten times worse.No one wants to see a bunch off GOP hacks sitting around claiming thehigh road after all of their years of treachery w Bush.  Ending the matterabruptly disables them from wasting taxpayer dollars and playing "gotcha"to score political points.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBitwit1234      (1000+ posts)Thu May-27-10 12:19 PMResponse to Original message2.Why in the heck is this badBush and Rover the turd blossom went thru about five to six job offers to keep people from running for office. Just one was Phewlenty who was asked to drop his senate bid for Norm Coleman to run. So the republicans have nothing to say, except trying to stir up conterversary...and the Dems should tell them to shut the hell up.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPADEMJES12      (446 posts)Thu May-27-10 12:28 PMResponse to Reply #25.two wrongs dont make a right.
