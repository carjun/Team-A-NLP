Well no. Because the Sun had secured a victory for the Tories five years prior to this too. Running as they did with the now infamous headline "It's the Sun wot won it."So here we go again, the inevitable swing away from government has happened and The Sun has ditched the underdogs and will presumably come out gunning for the favourites. What a gamble!Cynics might say Murdoch's rag have had this headline in the bag for months now and have just been waiting for the most opportune moment to pull it out. Could they not have waited until AFTER Cameron announced Conservative policies at their party conference to suggest logic swung them away from Labour?The government are playing down the seriousness of The Sun's withdrawal of support of course, but the News International paper has a history of actually mattering in general elections. In fact call it off now, there's no point. Or is there?groups:News, Webmash, World News, Odd News tags:Politics,Gordon Brown,Labour,David Cameron,Rupert Murdoch,The Sun 2 more|5 comments// The Sun ends its love affair with New Labourhide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

Murdoch! Leave our votes alone! 1 year agoflag  reply0orgonomixAren't the media supposed to critique the government?With Murdoch being where he is, I gave up hope of any representation of reason long ago, but if The Sun readers determine government we are truly fucked. 1 year agoflag  reply0FreshPlasticThe Sun's lost all hope, gone all pope, signals end of support for a dope.  Money for old rope?Why has the newspaper been supporting a party they believe has been messing up for so long?  Seems odd.  Perhaps they thought the Tories would've been worse?And why can't newspapers stick to just reporting the news?  I'd like at least one (nomatter who it's owned by) to free of opinion.  Just the facts, thanks. 1 year agoflag  reply0AnnieMoleHave you seen Google ads battle though as The Sun has been buying up adverts announcing that they have switched their support to the Conservatives, and the Labour Party have been buying up counter adverts for the same keywords 1 year agoflag  reply0jonbrooksThat's boring.. but I have to say I like Browns face its like something from an old kids tv show.
