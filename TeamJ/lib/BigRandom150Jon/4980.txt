John McCain says he would support congressional work toward an overhaul of the immigration system once "the borders have been secured."The Arizona Republican who has been elected to a fifth term also tells NBC's "Today" show he will reintroduce legislation aimed at giving president's line-item veto authority in the budget-making process.McCain says GOP lawmakers celebrating their newfound power on Capitol Hill should remember that last fall's elections were not so much an embrace of their policies as it was "a vote of disapproval with how we've been doing business."Asked what advice he would give to new House and Senate members starting service in Washington for the first time, the veteran Republican said, "Work hard. Go home as much as you can."Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
