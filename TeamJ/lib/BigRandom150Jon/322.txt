Now husband-and-wife cavers have documented perhaps the world's largest: Hang Son Doong, big enough in places to accommodate a New York City block of skyscrapers.The cave in the Annamite Mountains contains a river and jungle (its name translates to "mountain river cave") and even its own thin clouds, and its end remains out of sight. It's part of a network of about 150 caves in central Vietnam near the Laotian border.much much more - - -Link- 1http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20110103/ts_yblog_thelookout/explorers-...Link- 2http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/01/largest-cave/largest-cave-interactive groups:News, News and Politics, Green, Science, Indigenous, Water Is Life, AAA News, Actual News 4 moretags:News,Travel,Nature,Asia,Vietnam,National Geographic,earth science,caves 4 morerecommended by:Vierotchka |11 comments// Explorers discover spectacular caves in Vietnamhide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.
