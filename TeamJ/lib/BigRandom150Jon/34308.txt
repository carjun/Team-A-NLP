My video of the event...look at the guys he has shooting vids of the crowd with blackberries and cameras. The only color that mattered that day was red, white and blue........Of that, I am sure.  If there were slurs, they would have been caught on at least one of the cameras he surrounded himself with. Debunked.Category:News & PoliticsTags:CongressionalBlackCaucusteapartymarch20LewisClyburnCleaverracistracismracistsslurswashingtondcwalk2010Link to this comment:Share to:Uploader Comments          (klooger13)          You edited out some of this video because in others we see more.  Like the spitting incident.O'keefe comes to mind.ginger745i9 months agoginger745i9 months agoNo editing...it's raw footage. I'm obviously not a camera man. But thanks for the snarky comment, anyway. Obviously you have yet to find what you're so deperately looking for....(chuckle).klooger139 months agoklooger139 months agoThat wasn't James Clyburn.davebezesky9 months agodavebezesky9 months agoYou might be correct....it's probably Scott. We'll call it the Black Caucus and leave it at that.klooger139 months agoklooger139 months agosee allAll Comments (44)Respond to this video...Sign In or Sign Up now to post a comment!sometimes when people yell spittle comes out! it isn't the same as spitting on someone with intent! maybe he was hit with spittle but not spat upon as they deem it! the so called "racist" tea party elected black and hispanic members of the movement because they have the same belief in America and it's Constitution that us "white" folks have! we are like minded people! that is what we want in office! people that think like us no matter the color or background! yetitracker1 week agoyetitracker1 week agoBlack Caucus needs to shut the fuck up and hit the streets to help nice poor moms with food and other things the way the southern whites do for the BLACKS!!!TheDigitalMistress2 weeks agoTheDigitalMistress2 weeks ago@ginger745iCorrection: Spat not spittedchewbaca19891 month agochewbaca19891 month ago@ginger745iThere was no spitting, I challenge you to post it.ROFL, they would have used any spit to get DNA and arrest the person who "spitted".What a joke.chewbaca19891 month agochewbaca19891 month agoThere is a Congressional black caucus because half of them are not smart enough to get a real committeeship. Rangle is corrupt, but at least he has some smarts. mrjiveyjr2 months agomrjiveyjr2 months agowhy is there a congressional black caucus and a hispanic caucus anyway why not just congressminoritys want equal treatment but they keep on singleing themselves out by their race....why?damoparman4 months agodamoparman4 months agoFunny that from this video Cleaver doesn't wipe the "phantom spit" from his face until after the 15 second confrontation with the suspected spitter shown on from other angles. Who would wait longer than half a millisecond to wipe someones spit from your face? I also like how these men decided, on this day, to walk through a crowd of "racists" when they had been ducking through back doors up until this day!  None of it adds up.hatfisc4 months ago      2hatfisc4 months ago      2@Soulthinker2007 The film you're talking about was from a different perspective. A different camera. And even then, when you look at it it's obvious that the old man didn't spit on him. He was shouting "Kill the bill" along with the rest of them. It was a silly mistake.AshesoftheRoseKAC4 months agoAshesoftheRoseKAC4 months ago@Soulthinker2007 Maybe because there was no spitter, despite what the Black Supremacist Caucus tells you.StoogeWatcher5 months agoStoogeWatcher5 months ago@njohnston198 The only retards are those who make excuses for the Black Supremacist Caucus. By the way, how's that Charlie Rangel thing working out?StoogeWatcher5 months agoStoogeWatcher5 months agoView all Comments 1      2      3      4      5          Next   Reply  ShareRemoveFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock UserLoading...Suggestions 5:40 Add to Added to queue    Why I'm NOT a Tea Party Racistby AmericanExtremist12,153 views 0:24 Add to Added to queue    Tea Party protester yelling racial epithet - v2.0by mAssBackwards5,768 views 5:58 Add to Added to queue    Peacock Elites Label Tea  Party Protesters as R...by ConservativeTimes350 views 5:28 Add to Added to queue    TEA PARTY RACISM: What The Media Won't Show You...by ronaldjacksonX287,247 views 9:58 Add to Added to queue    CNN: Discussing Racism In the Right-Wing Tea Pa...by davidsirota10,747 views 1:47 Add to Added to queue    Racist Tea Party HATES Black People?!
