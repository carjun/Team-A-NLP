I can post more and higher resolution pictures if that would assist in any identification.Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadYou should ask an Asian woodcarver.LucianJan-09-11 01:26 PM#1The piece in question is made from ivory, not woodtaterguyJan-09-11 01:39 PM#2Never mind...FumesuckerJan-09-11 01:41 PM#3Heh!

I have a friend who collects Japanese art prints- she is very knowledgeable in general - I can ask her if you like. It's beautiful - I wonder if an Asian Arts website might be the way to go. Good luck. Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopFumesucker      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 03:07 PMResponse to Reply #49.PM sent..

If you want to send photos to someone who can helptry Ming's Asian Gallery in either Seattle or Bellevue WA (there's one in each).  The owner Noreen does appraisals, is an expert, and could give you a good idea.  I doubt it'd be free but one never knows.  They also buy so that's a possible.  Good luck.  It's quite a piece.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopFumesucker      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 08:57 PMResponse to Reply #1011.Bookmarked and emailed the link, that's what I was looking for, who to ask..Thanks..Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 10:45 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss The DU LoungePowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
