These two students were in London, peacefully taking part in the protests.Here they describe what they saw, and share their video footage of events:A-level student Jonathan, from HampshireThe royals need to increase their intelligence and information - they should have known that there was a large body of agitated protesters in the area and they should not have tried to drive the car down the street. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.Jonathan: "Regent Street was completely clogged" I can't understand why they drove down there - Regent Street was completely clogged. I'd seen people throwing bins and knocking things over. At one point a traffic cone came out of nowhere and was thrown with such force that it knocked over a policeman. He went down like a sack of bricks - he was really dazed. My aunt and I stood in between the crowds and the policeman on the floor trying to help him up. Then a bar owner came out and helped the policeman inside. Earlier in Parliament Square I had seen groups of people coming back from the front covered in blood.Graphic design student Joshua Coombs, from KentI was standing on a wall that protects the building in Parliament Square, from where I was filming.

This video shows one person attacking a window.Some others were using the breeze blocks that hold up the fences in the area - they were using anything.Then the police came along and cleared the students away from the area around the building.I thought it was utterly pointless and gives students a bad name. I think the protests were irrelevant - the bill was always going to go through anyway.More on This StoryRelated storiesStudent protesters: 'We will continue to fight'10 DECEMBER 2010,                         UKStudent protests: Your pictures09 DECEMBER 2010,                         EDUCATION & FAMILYShare this pageDeliciousDiggFacebookredditStumbleUponTwitterEmailPrintMore UK storiesRSSPM to talk jobs with big businessDavid Cameron will meet UK business leaders later to discuss plans for job creation, as Labour warns about the impact of cuts on young people.Virgin 'won't pay' fees over snowUndercover officer switches sidesTop StoriesArizona shooting suspect chargedScores killed in Iran plane crashBrazil warns of global trade warChavez criticises 'interference'China and UK to push trade linksFeatures & Analysis'Never worse'Despair in Haiti after year of earthquake, cholera and riots Tackling taboosFury over doctor's book on sex education for Muslims Sceptical publicWhy many Croatians are in doubt about joining the EU Battle of the bikinisBrazilians wary of Chinese competition as trade soars   From our own correspondentMost PopularShared1: Beckhams expecting fourth child2: South Sudan votes on independence3: Iran plane crashes 'killing 70'4: Bullets sent to Celtic manager5: Mixed-sex handshakes banned  Read1: Arizona shooting suspect charged2: How Giffords survived the shot3: Brazil warns of global trade war4: Virgin 'won't pay' fees over snow5: Fury over doctor's book on sex education for Muslims 6: Chavez criticises 'interference'7: Rihanna makes history in UK chart8: Scores killed in Iran plane crash9: Arizona shooting: What we know10: Undercover officer switches sidesWatched/Listened1: Loughner tackled by wounded woman Watch2: Examining the political fallout from Arizona shooting Watch3: 'I played dead to escape gunman' Watch4: Turning body heat into energy Watch5: 'Grab my hand to tell me you're okay' Watch6: 911 tape of Arizona shooting released Watch7: Will this ship revolutionise the skies?
