It will help, not only with redness, but also with dry eyes. I find that it helps with the feeling of eye strain as well. Makes my eyes feel great and last a long time- even longer than the Advanced Relief (I have been happy with the Advanced Relief- no complaints about it- but I do like this better).  more                                Comment                                ComplimentFollowShareEdit TopicPhotosadd a photoDetailsAdd DetailsRelated TopicsVisine Visine-A Eye Allergy Re ...Health AidsWrite a ReviewAquify Multi-Purpose SolutionA contact lense solution.Write a ReviewCIBA Vision Torisoft Contact L ...Personal CareWrite a ReviewOPTX 20/20 Stick-On BifocalsA product by OPTX 20/20Write a Review                rate more like 'Visine Maximum Redness...'First to ReviewMzJen_2_review"This product made me switch"MoviesBooksMusicFoodTv ShowsTechnologyPoliticsVideo GamesParentingFashionGreen LivingAll TagsAbout LunchPressFAQsContact UsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySitemapReport Abuse 2011 Lunch.com, LLC All Rights ReservedLunch.com - The Best Consumer Reviews Online()Follow MeThis is you!
