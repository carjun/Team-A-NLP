I was here for just about all of these over the years (and caused a couple of them myself).But I never fully and completely had an appreciation for what the Mods and Admins have/have had to deal with before I read the length, breadth and depth of the thread above.Holy. Fucking. Baldheaded. Jesus.Wow.I am on bended knee to Skinner, Elad and EarlG...and to every Mod that is or ever was.Feel free to make this post live, or not.  I'm not waving a flag here.  This is personal.This note's for you.Thank you for putting up with this volcanic tsunami of shit for ten years. I, and every one of us who loves this place, is and will ever remain in your debt.  You have done yeoman's work.  I got merely a taste via that single thread, and my whole face melted off and puddled at my kicking, spasming feet.Thank you.
