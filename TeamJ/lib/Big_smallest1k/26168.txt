Since I have major eyesight problems, I keep the fonts large. Suddenly, the page that lists all the forums, and the forum listing on each forum is much smaller than it used to be, although the font size of all the threads is what it was. Did I do something wrong, and can I fix it? Expanding fonts on discussion page to what it was makes the forum pages VERY large, so that wasn't it. Or, did you change this? Thanks in advance for your answer.Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadTry hitting shift-refresh andEladJan-05-11 06:57 PM#1Thank you, Elad.
