WallaceAs a Tucsonan, I first attended Emily Gray Junior High School and then graduated from Sabino High School. After graduation, I turned Sun Devil and earned a Broadcasting degree from Arizona State University.My first job as a television reporter was at KIMO-TV, followed by KTUU-TV, both in Anchorage. During my time reporting in Alaska, I visited the Top of the World in Barrow, Alaska, slept under a treeasIfollowed the Iditarod Trail, interviewed Ben Affleck in Hawaii at the opening of the movie Pearl Harbor, and climbed on a rickety catwalk above growling fur seals on Saint Paul Island in the middle of the Bering Sea.I then took my biggest risk of all, and spent my last six months in Alaska as a press secretary for the House Majority of the Alaska State Legislature. Nevertheless,I realized reporting was the life for me, and, as always, that Tucson was my home.I returned to Tucson at the end of July of 2003. My favorite things to do in Arizona is spend time with friends in downtown, get sun by the pool, run through my neighborhood, hunt in the desert, and take road trips.KOLD News 13 Interactive  Speaker       Request  ManagementStation HistoryStation InfoIntern ProgramKOLD JobsStation HotlineStation Tour InfoAir Your PSA'sSales & AdvertisingKOLD News 13 StorePublic FilesComplete list of websites mentioned on KOLD News 13 More >>View our list of recent online video stories from number 1 rated KOLD News 13  More >>KOLD News 13's Som Lisaius reports on southern Arizona's most wanted criminals   and fugitivesMore >>Delicious recipes as seen on KOLD News Live at Noon.More >>Rescue a pet from the Humane Society here.
