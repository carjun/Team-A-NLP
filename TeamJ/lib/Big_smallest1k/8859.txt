The song was written by the Bee Gees - Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb - and produced by the Bee Gees, Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson. It was released on December 13, 1977, as the second single from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. It is their signature song.  Upon release, Stayin' Alive climbed the charts, hitting the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of February 4, 1978, and staying there for four weeks. In the process, it became the band's most recognizable tune, in part because of its place at the beginning of Saturday Night Fever.            view wiki  TagsMusic, Songs, 1970s, Disco, Movie Songssee all  DetailsAdd DetailsListsFavorite Songs From The Moviessee all lists (1)PollsFavorite Songs From The Moviesby drifter51Vote NowThe Best Disco Songs Of All Timeby drifter51Vote NowRelated TopicsGloria GaynorAn actorWrite a ReviewKC and The Sunshine BandDisco group from Hialeah, Florida.
