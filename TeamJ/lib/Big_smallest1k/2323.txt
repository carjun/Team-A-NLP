"I can't promise there won't be more cuts, because there will be," said Governor-elect Jerry Brown, speaking recently to a group of educators and union officials. These cuts will be made to try to close a $28 billion state budget deficit, and do not include an additional $2 billion that schools will lose due to declining prop 98 revenues.We oppose further cuts, said Mike Myslinski, a spokesperson for the California Teachers Association, the states largest teachers union, representing 325,000 members. CTA has opposed all sorts of terrible policies, budgets and legislation in the past, including NCLB, Common Core Standards and Race to the Top (RTTT). They oppose with their words, occasionally with advertisements, and sometimes through newsletters and phone calls to their members, and very rarely through a mass protest in Sacramento, all the while collaborating with law makers to implement these same policies and budgets, albeit, in a form they think will do the least harm.This is not opposition. It is spectacle. . .For the rest of the article, please visit http://modeducation.blogspot.com/2010/12/cta-supports-e...
