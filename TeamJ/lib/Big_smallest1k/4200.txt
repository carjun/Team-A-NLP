Development was started in 1989 and officially ended on February 27, 1998. Some electronic engineering and the manufacture of Apple's Newton devices was done in Japan by the Sharp Corporation. Most Newton devices were based on the ARM 610 RISC processor and all featured handwriting recognition software. Most Newton devices were developed and marketed by Apple (this includes the whole MessagePad line and the eMate 300), but other companies, notably Sharp, Motorola, and Digital Ocean, also released devices that ran the Newton OS. None were as successful as Apple's devices.edit this info  TagsTechnology, Electronics, Apple, Computers, Apple Products, Pda, Newton     Details       Select a category and then fill in some basic details that someone might want to know about this topic.
