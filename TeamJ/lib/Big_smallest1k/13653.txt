Sarah Palin, Sunday, August 1st, 2010."Ninety-four percent of small businesses will face higher taxes under the Democrats' plan." Randy Neugebauer, Thursday, July 29th, 2010. In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin answered questions about extending the Bush tax cuts. She said Democrats are  "poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history. It's a tax increase of $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, and it will have an effect on every single American who pays an income tax."The problem is, she's distorting the Democrats' proposals. They plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest tax payers, and it would not result in the largest tax increase in U.S. history. We rated Palin's statement Pants on Fire; read our complete report for details.That $3.8 trillion -- the number she wrote on her hand -- is the cost over 10 years if all the Bush tax cuts expired. Democrats say they want to keep the tax cuts for individuals who make less than $200,000 and couples who make less than $250,000.Palin isn't the only one distorting the Democratic proposals, though.<....>http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/aug/04... /Refresh|+1 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss Topic ForumsDemocratsPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
