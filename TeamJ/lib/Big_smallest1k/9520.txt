It broke off from the Petermann Glacier on Thursday, and was spotted by a NASA satellite sensor.The freshwater stored in this ice island could keep the Delaware or Hudson rivers flowing for more than two years, University of Delaware researcher Andreas Muenchow said in a statement on the schools website.
