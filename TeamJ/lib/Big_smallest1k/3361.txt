Demand that the vote be cancelled!!!A congresswoman may have been killed because of violent, incendiary rhetoric that goes all the way back to when health care reform was first being debated.

I hope they think long and hard about what they will actually accomplish.  They will confirm their view that there is something unconstitutional about HCR and further anger people.  If they can do that after watching the funeral of a little girl, they are truly evil.
