Reply 22 on the thread mentions, as to Pres. Carter, the embarrassment of the hostages.I replied, You mean the embarrassment of getting them back without starting a war?  Sinverguenza!Meaning:IMO, Carter had less than zero reason to be embarrassed about, or ashamed of, how he handled the hostage situation.My post seems to have been deleted.  I have no idea why.So, question is, Why?Never thought I would be posting in this forum. I am stumped.Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadYour post was an "innocent bystander" in a removed sub-thread.SkinnerJan-03-11 10:58 AM#1Thank you.
