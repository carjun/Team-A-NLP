Deasy has a sleazy history of associating with felons. He has a bogus doctorate degree. He flees from low income districts when the going gets tough. And best of all, gets cushy jobs working for greasy billionaire philanderers, er philanthropists, which help him rise quickly to become boss of the nations second largest school district.  Mike Klonsky says this about John Deasy: A look at my 2008 post on Deasy's jumping ship in Prince Georges County, Md., will show you what to expect from him in the way of leadership. He was touted as a superstar and the great white hope of the power philanthropists, when he came into this predominantly poor, African-American district from Santa Monica. He bailed out when the district went broke and criticism in the black community began to mount.EdNotesOnline compared him to Cathy Black, but with a phony degree.Susan Ohanian had this to say:   Critics said Deasy got out of Prince George's County just ahead of the trainwreck, for the rest, please visit http://modeducation.blogspot.com/2011/01/gates-boy-deas...
