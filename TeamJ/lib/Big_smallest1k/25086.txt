You guys need to see it.  Philosophy freaks---plenty of craziness abound.  I did not know that the radical right had some of these views.  I mean I've heard them, but the actual roots are a overwhelming and disconcerting.   Again, I think this is really the most important interview I've seen on the extreme right--since this guy is sort of connected to more unknown actors in the entire foundation of what we know to be the extreme right.Refresh|+9 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadThanks to your earlier heads up, I got to see the interview earlier tonightmtnsnakeJan-08-11 11:32 PM#1k&reShirlJan-09-11 05:23 AM#2mtnsnake      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 11:32 PMResponse to Original message1.Thanks to your earlier heads up, I got to see the interview earlier tonightHe was really fascinating to listen to.
