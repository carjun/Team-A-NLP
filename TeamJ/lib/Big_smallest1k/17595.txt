It contains pages that are not articles, or groups articles by status rather than content. Do not include this category in content categories. For further information, see WP:PROJCATS.This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the appropriate user preference is set.Administrators: Please do not delete this category even if it is empty!Categories with this message may be empty occasionally or even most of the time.This category contains pages which have been fully protected to prevent vandalism and other unconstructive editing. This is usually done in cases where a page is particularly visible, such as Main Page, or has been subject to a very large amount of vandalism. Full protection prevents a page being edited except by administrators. In most cases, semi-protection (which prevents a page being edited by anonymous and newly registered users) is sufficient to deal with vandalism; see Category:Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism for pages which have been semi-protected for this reason.Use {{pp-vandalism}} to add a page to this category. This should only be done if the page is in fact protected  adding the template does not in itself protect the page.Pages in category "Wikipedia pages protected against vandalism"The following 6 pages are in this category, out of 6 total.
