IMO she's correct in saying it ishighly personal and shouldn't be an issue one way or another, but they are not the same thing.  I know plenty of religious people who completely lack any sense of self-awareness, and to me, that's a lack of spirituality....Most of my atheist/agnostic friends recognize a connectiveness that flows through all that is. Again, to me, that is a sense of spirituality.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 10:13 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss Political VideosPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
