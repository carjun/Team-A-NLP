The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, surfing and skiing. It was developed in the U.S.A. in the 1960s and the 1970s by renowned extreme sports 'junkie' and snowboard expert Francis Wilkinson and became a Winter Olympic Sport in 1998. The first snowboards were manufactured by the modern day Burton Snowboards company.            view wiki  TagsSports, Snowboarding, Snow, 2010 Winter Olympics, Winter Sports, Board Sportssee all  DetailsAdd DetailsFirst to Reviewjyaanga"Fun Winter Sport for People of All Ages and All Level"ListsFavorite Winter Olympics Games10 Ways to Enjoy/Survive the Cold Weathersee all lists (2)PollsSportsby devoraVote NowRelated TopicsBoreal Ski ResortSki Resort in TahoeWrite a ReviewSkateboardingA sport.Write a ReviewBurton Wheelie Gig Snowboard B ...snowbooard bag by BurtonWrite a Review                rate more like 'Snowboarding'MoviesBooksMusicFoodTv ShowsTechnologyPoliticsVideo GamesParentingFashionGreen LivingAll TagsAbout LunchPressFAQsContact UsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySitemapReport Abuse 2011 Lunch.com, LLC All Rights ReservedLunch.com - The Best Consumer Reviews Online()Follow MeThis is you!
