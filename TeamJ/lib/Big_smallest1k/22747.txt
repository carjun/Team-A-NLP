She had an ongoing vomiting/acid tummy spit-up problem that completely ruined the carpets in my home. The vet was helpful in some respects (indicating that it was probably an allergy to the food she was eating, even though it was very high-quality food); but it was a neighbor who had been through the same thing with her now-older Border Collie when he was young that really got me on the right path.  more                                Comment                                Compliments (32)FollowShareEdit TopicPhotosadd a photoDetailsAdd DetailsFirst to ReviewSheri_in_Reho"THANK YOU, Natural Balance, for giving my dog more options!"MoviesBooksMusicFoodTv ShowsTechnologyPoliticsVideo GamesParentingFashionGreen LivingAll TagsAbout LunchPressFAQsContact UsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySitemapReport Abuse 2011 Lunch.com, LLC All Rights ReservedLunch.com - The Best Consumer Reviews Online()Follow MeThis is you!
