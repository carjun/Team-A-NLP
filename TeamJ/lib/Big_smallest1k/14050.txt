While it is not a policy or guideline itself, it is intended to supplement or clarify other Wikipedia practices and policies. Please defer to the relevant policy or guideline in case of inconsistency between that page and this one.This page is not a sandbox and must not be used for test editing. To experiment, use a sandbox.The Wikipedia SandboxThe Wikipedia Sandbox is a page designed for testing and experimenting with wiki syntax.The Sandbox was created as a place with fewer rules and policies than other pages on Wikipedia. For example, you don't have to follow the Manual of Style or reach community consensus before making a major change. However, it must not be used for malicious purposes, and policies such as no personal attacks, civility, and copyrights still apply.If you have a username, you can create your own sandbox in your userspace. You can find your user sandbox here. (And if it doesn't exist yet, feel free to create it!)[edit] Specialized sandboxesWikipedia talk:Sandbox exists for testing talk page techniques.{{X1}} to {{X9}} exist for testing Template-space techniques.Category:X1 exists for testing category techniques.User talk:Sandbox for user warnings, for testing semi-automatic user warning tools.Sandboxes in other languages can be found in a list on the lower left of the English Wikipedia Sandbox. Although using sandboxes in other languages may be useful on certain occasions, it is important to keep in mind that, unless interwiki links are used, each Sandbox can only access the links, images, and templates on the Wikipedia in which it is located.[edit] See alsoWikipedia:VandalismRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About_the_Sandbox"Categories: Wikipedia information pages | Edit window help | Wikipedia editor help Personal toolsLog in / create accountNamespacesProject pageDiscussionVariantsViewsReadEditView historyActionsSearchNavigationMain pageContentsFeatured contentCurrent eventsRandom articleDonate to WikipediaInteractionHelpAbout WikipediaCommunity portalRecent changesContact WikipediaToolboxWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPrint/exportCreate a bookDownload as PDFPrintable version LanguagesCatalItaliano/Tatara This page was last modified on 9 January 2011 at 03:47.Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;additional terms may apply.See Terms of Use for details.Wikipedia is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization.Contact usPrivacy policyAbout WikipediaDisclaimers
