Oligarchies. "The oligarchy is a form of POWER SYSTEM in which the power effectively rests with a small number of people. These people could be distinguished by royalty, wealth, family ties, corporate, or military control. Such states are often controlled by a few prominent families who pass their influence from one generation to the next."http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy#Examples_of_olig... I am thinking of turning a past history where examples of rulers and peasants are made into fat cats on wall street, corporate executives etc. The people losing their jobs and homes are the peasants.  One of both of the groups can be dressed in an America flag but also in dress of their time.  Or a symbol of America is obvious.I don't think people understand the situation in this country but they all have seen videos of the big horrible war games played in a Colosseum with the peasant playing the dangerous or deadly game and stuffed in the cheap seats and the royalists in beautiful boxes.But I am not a political cartoonist.  This is just an idea that I would love to see take off so maybe some who think corporations are their friends.Refresh|+2 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss Topic ForumsActivist HQPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
