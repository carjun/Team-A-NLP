The tulips are sprouting, daffodils are ready to bloom. The Cleveland Botanical Garden has just wrapped up its famous orchid show. We are pruning and fertilizing, raking and mulching. We will have an explosion of roses, peonies, hydrangeas, lilac. Brilliant colors through to the fall. The magnolia trees are ready to blossom already. Beauty in my back yard.
