When you get to that point you are paying more for an upper handguard than most people pay for entire rifles. You're traveling 2 days out of your way to visit a shop in a town that you heard might have the magazine pouch you need to hold the mags for that rifle.    When you reach this point you look to just one person to build your AK, Ted MarshallWe built and now maintain the Marshall Arms website Member Statistics: 5 Images Submitted2 Articles                  Submitted                                    Top                  of PageWould you like to support our website?
