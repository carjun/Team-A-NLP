Chris Chibnall, whose credits include Torchwood, has written the series.More on This StoryRelated storiesNew drama for old Doctor Who10 OCTOBER 2010,                         UK POLITICSDavid Tennant on life after Dr Who10 OCTOBER 2010,                         ENTERTAINMENT & ARTSFrom other news sitesObserver  John Giles on the Damned Utd, Leeds's reputation and Brian Clough 22 hrs agoMail Online UK  David Tennant to star as Jimmy Murphy in BBC film about Munich air disaster 23 hrs agoAbout these resultsShare this pageDeliciousDiggFacebookredditStumbleUponTwitterEmailPrintMore Entertainment & Arts storiesRSSRihanna makes history in UK chartRihanna becomes the first female solo artist in UK chart history to achieve number one singles in five consecutive years.Social Network wins Critics awardBeckhams expecting fourth childTop StoriesArizona shooting suspect chargedScores killed in Iran plane crashBrazil warns of global trade warChavez criticises 'interference'China and UK to push trade linksFeatures & Analysis'Never worse'Despair in Haiti after year of earthquake, cholera and riots Tackling taboosFury over doctor's book on sex education for Muslims Sceptical publicWhy many Croatians are in doubt about joining the EU Battle of the bikinisBrazilians wary of Chinese competition as trade soars   From our own correspondentMost PopularShared1: Beckhams expecting fourth child2: South Sudan votes on independence3: Iran plane crashes 'killing 70'4: Bullets sent to Celtic manager5: Mixed-sex handshakes banned  Read1: Arizona shooting suspect charged2: How Giffords survived the shot3: Brazil warns of global trade war4: Virgin 'won't pay' fees over snow5: Fury over doctor's book on sex education for Muslims 6: Chavez criticises 'interference'7: Rihanna makes history in UK chart8: Scores killed in Iran plane crash9: Arizona shooting: What we know10: Undercover officer switches sidesWatched/Listened1: Loughner tackled by wounded woman Watch2: Examining the political fallout from Arizona shooting Watch3: 'I played dead to escape gunman' Watch4: Turning body heat into energy Watch5: 'Grab my hand to tell me you're okay' Watch6: 911 tape of Arizona shooting released Watch7: Will this ship revolutionise the skies?
