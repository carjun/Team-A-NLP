Looked at in the grand scheme of things, says Ferriter, it was totally impossible and should never have been attempted. There were a million obstacles, but we kept figuring it out. In the end, it took six months before lawyers could negotiate the final terms.He and Morgan celebrated with a bottle of Chateau Latour 61 at Cut restaurant in Los Angeles. We looked at each other and burst out laughing, recalls Morgan, speaking on the phone from New York, where he will be hosting his show. It was fun, like a caper. John kept saying, This will get done. He didnt have a moments doubt. There is a long pause on the line. I did. But he didnt.The story also mentions Ferriters longtime friendship withLarryKing, who Morgan replaces next month.RELATED:CNN's Fareed Zakaria & George Clooney Talk Sudan Anderson Cooper Interviews Pee-Wee HermanIs Piers Morgan's 'News with Views' Approach CNN's Future?GLAAD Files Petition Against CNNTags: John Ferriter, LarryKing, Piers Morgan CommentsShare<< PREVIOUSNancy Grace Viewer Helps Find Missing 12-Year-old Brittany Smith NEXT >>CNNs John King Tapped to Host NBA TV Newsmagazine, True NBA Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.MEDIABISTRO EVENTSDont fear online privacy, understand itTake advantage of the opportunities digital privacy concerns present for business.
