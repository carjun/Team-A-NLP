Judge John Roll (63)Judge John Roll had received deaths threats in 2009, although they are not thought not linked to the Tucson shootings in which he was killedFather-of-three Judge John Roll, was appointed to the US District Court for Arizona by President George Bush Sr in 1991 and was a respected jurist and leader who friends described as a devoted, talented and gentle man. The authorities do not believe he was a target of Saturday's attack but had rather gone after church to see Ms Giffords at her constituency event, having recently worked with her on court issues.He had reportedly received many death threats in 2009 when he allowed a $32m (21m) lawsuit filed by illegal immigrants against an Arizona rancher to proceed. More than 200 threatening phone calls were made to his office on one day. Officials at the time said many of the threats were stirred up by right-wing talk-back radio. He received police protection for a month as a result.Chief US Justice John Roberts issued a statement after the shootings, praising Roll for his service and describing his killing as a "terrible loss". Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said of Judge Roll: "I have never met a more sincere ... fair minded, brilliant federal judge or any judge for that matter in my whole life."Dorwin Stoddard (76)Retiree Mr Stoddard, a church volunteer, was shot in the head and killed as he tried to protect his wife Mavy, who was injured but is expected to survive, the Christian Chronicle reported. Friends described the couple as "the lifeblood" of the 120-member Mountain Avenue Church of Christ in Tucson, Arizona.It is unclear whether they went to the Safeway supermarket near their home in order to buy groceries, or to see Mrs Giffords. But witnesses reported that Mr and Mrs Stoddard had been standing in line to meet the congresswoman when the gunman began shooting.The couple were said to be high-school sweethearts who married later in life. Witnesses to the killings said one of Mr Stoddard's final acts was to shield his wife from the gunman's fire, putting his body on top of hers.  While he was fatally wounded, his wife suffered three gunshot wounds to her legs and was in stable condition.Christina Taylor Green (9)Christina Taylor Green's mother described her as a "very bright, amazing girl"Christina Taylor Green, the youngest victim of the Tucson shootings, had just been elected to the student council at the nearby Mesa Verde Elementary School. She had been taken to Ms Giffords' public event because her family thought it would help her learn more about government.She was born on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda terror attacks against the US, and is featured in the book Faces of Hope: Babies Born on 9/11. She was also related to Dallas Green, a former pitcher, manager, and executive in Major League Baseball. Her mother Roxanna described her as a "very bright, amazing girl" who had just celebrated her first Holy Communion. "She was very patriotic, she wore red white blue, and it had a special meaning to her," she told Fox News.She was the only girl on her little league baseball team, "a very, very good baseball player," her mother said, adding that Christina was a passionate dancer who "loved animals" and one day hope to be a vet.Gabe Zimmerman (30)Gabe Zimmerman was a former social worker who served as Ms Giffords' director of community outreach - helping her handle thousands of constituency matters - and was one of a core of loyal staffers who had been with the congresswoman since before her election in 2006.Local media report that Mr Zimmerman, who was engaged to be married, had organised the constituency event where the shootings took place and was passionate about helping ordinary people, and representing Ms Giffords. Michael McNulty, chairman of Ms Giffords' campaigns, was quoted by azcentral.com as saying, that Mr Zimmerman was "as close to a purely good human being as I've ever known. He worked tirelessly to solve people's problems".Dorothy Morris (76) and Phyllis Schneck (79)Dorothy Morris and Phyllis Schneck were both retirees who were also among those killed by Jared Loughner. It is unclear whether the women had gone to the supermarket to attend Ms Giffords' event, but descriptions of the shootings suggest they may have been close by when the gunman began firing. Doctor Steven Rayle, who was at the scene, said it was "close quarters and people were pretty crammed in there, with no place to go, and he was able to target people pretty easily".Share this pageDeliciousDiggFacebookredditStumbleUponTwitterEmailPrintMore US & Canada storiesRSSArizona shooting suspect chargedUS prosecutors charge 22-year-old Jared Loughner with trying to assassinate a congresswoman and killing two other government officials.US wants Wikileaks Twitter dataParcel sparks alert in US capitalTop StoriesArizona shooting suspect chargedScores killed in Iran plane crashBrazil warns of global trade warChavez criticises 'interference'East Jerusalem hotel demolishedFeatures & AnalysisTackling taboosFury over doctor's book on sex education for Muslims Sceptical publicWhy many Croatians are in doubt about joining the EU Voodoo artistsAudio slideshow: The art inspired by Haiti's earthquake Battle of the bikinisBrazilians wary of Chinese competition as trade soars   From our own correspondentMost PopularShared1: Beckhams expecting fourth child2: South Sudan votes on independence3: Iran plane crashes 'killing 70'4: Bullets sent to Celtic manager5: Mixed-sex handshakes banned  Read1: Arizona shooting suspect charged2: How Giffords survived the shot3: Scores killed in Iran plane crash4: Undercover officer switches sides5: Ginger 'irresistible to beetles'6: Virgin 'won't pay' fees over snow7: Profile: Jared Loughner8: Rihanna makes history in UK chart9: Fury over doctor's book on sex education for Muslims 10: Brazil warns of global trade warWatched/Listened1: Loughner tackled by wounded woman Watch2: Examining the political fallout from Arizona shooting Watch3: 911 tape of Arizona shooting released Watch4: 'Grab my hand to tell me you're okay' Watch5: Surgeon 'cautiously optimistic' Watch6: 'I played dead to escape gunman' Watch7: One-minute World News Watch8: Tablet for developing nations Watch9: Obama: 'Tragedy for entire country' Watch10: Inside a Sudanese polling station WatchElsewhere on the BBCTop 10 spots in Central AmericaBBC Travel discovers ancient ruins and tropical wildlifeProgrammesClick WatchThe monitoring device to help elderly people social network and stay safe and healthyServicesNews feedsMobilePodcastsAlertsE-mail newsAbout BBC NewsEditors' blogBBC College of JournalismNews sourcesWorld Service Trust   Mobile      Search term:     bbc.co.uk navigation  News Sport Weather  Travel  TV Radio More       CBBC CBeebies Comedy Food Health   History Learning Music Science Nature   Local Northern Ireland Scotland Wales Full A-Z of BBC sites       BBC links   About the BBC   BBC Help   Contact Us   Accessibility Help   Terms of Use   Jobs   Privacy & Cookies   Advertise With Us     BBC  MMXI The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
