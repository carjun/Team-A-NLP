And, despite their proven record of failure to protect America -- from Indochina to Iran to Iraq -- do you believe they should be permitted to clandestinely expand their war-making without informed public debate? If so, you are betraying the principles upon which America was founded, endangering your nation, and displaying a distinctly "unamerican" subservience to unaccountable authority. But if you oppose autocratic power, you are called to support Wikileaks and others trying to limit U.S. Executive Branch mass murder abroad and failure to protect Americans at home.These two issues became officially linked for the first time when former U.S. Afghan commander General Stanley McChrystal explicitly stated that the murder of civilians increases rather than decreases the numbers of those committed to killing Americans, and actually implemented policies -- since reversed by General Petraeus -- to reduce U.S. murder of civilians. McChrystal said that for every innocent person you kill, you create 10 new enemies." By so doing he made it clear that killing civilians is not only a moral and war crimes issue, but -- in today's interdependent world -- also threatens U.S. national security.As important as is the issue of free speech, it is the question of whether the U.S. Executive is in fact protecting the American people through its mass murder abroad that really lies at the heart of the Wikileaks controversy. Executive Branch officials justify persecuting and threatening to murder Assange on the grounds that he has damaged U.S. "national security." If McChrystal is right, however, it is the past decade of U.S. Executive mass murder in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, now revealed beyond any doubt by Wikileaks, that is the real threat to U.S. national security.The chilling fact is this: whether you believe that September 11, 2001 was due to incomprehensible fanaticism or genuine grievances, it seems likely that U.S. leaders murder of countless Muslims since 2001 will cause the next 9/11 should, God forbid, it occur, The recent suicide-bomber in Sweden who came perilously close to succeeding taped a message saying "so will your children, daughters, brothers, and sisters die, like our brothers, sisters, and children die." Similar sentiments were voiced by the Times Square bomber, and it is likely that those responsible for future American deaths will also be motivated by revenge for the hundreds of thousands of Muslims for whose deaths U.S. leaders are responsible since 2001.This is not, of course, to justify such attacks. Any attacks on civilians, whether by the Taliban or General Petraeus, are totally unjustified and crimes of war. But if the issue is how best to enhance U.S. national security, it is critical to rationally discuss the most prudent and sensible means of preventing further attacks -- which in this case is to stop creating huge numbers of people who want to kill Americans. If General McChrystal is correct, every American should tremble at the long-term danger to America caused by the last decade of U.S. war-making in the Muslim world. If only 1/100th of 1% of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims are moved to want to attack America because of America's post-9/11 killing of Muslim civilians, for example, the U.S. Executive will have created a pool of 160,000 Muslims devoted to murdering Americans.View Next Page:http://www.alternet.org/story/149393/wikileaks_most_terrifying_revelation:_just_... groups:News, News and Politics, US Politics, Collective Journalism, Law and Justice, Actual News, Broadcasting 3 moretags:Corruption,Homeland Security,Freedom,War on Terror,Democracy,War Crimes,Wikileaks,Police State,Big Brother,Free Speech,Fascism,Freedom of Speech,Blackwater,Julian Assange,Big Oil,Patriot Act,corrupt government,First Amendment,FEMA,Military Industrial Complex,War in Iraq,Government Corruption,Freedom of the Press,Joe Lieberman,1st Amendment,War in Afghanistan,judicial corruption,PNAC,Corrupt Politics,corrupt governments,Totalitarianism,corrupt corporations,Haliburton,dianne feinstein,Project For A New American Century,corrupt politicians,Disabled Veterans 33 more|45 comments// WikiLeaks' Most Terrifying Revelation: Just How Much Our Government Lies to Ushide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

This is like a movie with a  dramatic " Grand Finally" in time the truth "will" come out...  We will make sure of that. Give it the time it's due... The movie is being shown right now... 4 days agoflag  reply0maasanova  gerardange:Anyone who has researched the official 9/11 government narrative and viewed the news reports and evidence that the 9/11 Commission ignored, knows full well the the official story is complete bullshit.The reason why I bring this up is because of Julian Assange's very questionable comments on 9/11:Im constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud.Julian Assange - Belfast Telegraph, July 19, 2010Don't get sucked into more false hope is all I'm saying. 4 days agoflag  reply+4gerardange  maasanova:~An Interesting and valid comment...    Looking at the big picture here... I suspect that Julian didn't want to get painted into that conspiracy wacko conner.    He must be very  careful not to take the bait and fall into a trap...  Which, is a clear goal of people who would like to discredit him and remove any and all validity to the substance of what he is saying.     By not falling into that trap...  he can continue to move forward and continue to present even more reveling documents.   In the Media business that is how it works... You and be Front Page News today and No Page News tomorrow...  Strategy is everything in this business !  Knowing that there are many who want to torpedo him and set even more traps...   Considering the enormous pressure of being in the spotlight,  Julian is doing an excellent job in that area.    A great article to check out is....             "Julian Assange's Deal With the Devil"  >>>  http://ow.ly/3z8j4  Maasanove, back to your question...  I think we can conclude that his statement was like playing a chess match...  Not showing all your cards and planning your moves far ahead... That is the sign of a master strategist.    As  the great boxer Mohamed Ail would say... "He is doing a rope-a-dope" and waiting until, everything is in place and is  just right.   These a very historic times we are living in...   The Truth shall set us all free! One thing I do know is... the truth... is always the truth...  No matter what the official BS PR line  is...   or what anyone says it is.Be well,G 4 days agoflag  reply0Itsbatman_Durr  maasanova:no it was terrorists that happened to claim to be muslims 4 days agoflag  reply-4Itsbatman_Durr  maasanova:maybe because even a publicity whore like assange has issues with being thought of as a nutter 4 days agoflag  reply-1maasanova  Itsbatman_Durr:Funny thing is that 9/11 was a massive financial, insurance and health care scandal and criminal cover-up, whether you believe it was Muslim terrorists who bombed the WTC and a  American real estate mogul with deep ties to the Israeli government, who just happeneed to collect billions in insurance payouts, or whether it was some other outside group who helped enrich Larry Silverstein, owner of the WTC complex. You figure that one out.Yet Assange says there was no conspiracy with 9/11. 4 days agoflag  reply0Itsbatman_Durr  maasanova:yes yes its all ok.. take deep breaths and go to your happy place nowi tease, but cmon already there is nothing to back any of that up but the wish to align every random event one can into a conspiracy to explain lifes random chaos 4 days agoflag  reply+2EvilDoer  gerardange:well said.   my appreciation for what PFC Manning and Julian Assange did continues to grow. 4 days agoflag  reply0maasanova  gerardange:Wikileaks has "leaked" information that has suggested that we found WMD in Iraq and Osama bin Laden is still alive, when all of the tapes since November 2001 have been declared faked, and several different authoritative sources has reported that he died in December 2001.Wikileaks just "leaked" another cable that said that Iranian rockets can reach Israel in just 12 minutes.Wikileaks is peddling THE SAME DISINFORMATION ABOUT WEAPONS THAT CAN ALLEGEDLY STRIKE ISAREL, that the mainstream media claimed in 2003 about Iraq firing missles that can hit Israel.Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA)WikiLeaks: Iran can reach Israel in 12 minutesJanuary 2, 2011 http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/01/02/2742380/wikileaks-iran-can-reach-isra...Iran has missiles that can reach Israel in 12 minutes, according to cables released by WikiLeaks.The Times of LondonRocket that could strike at the heart of IsraelFebruary 26, 2003http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1112989.eceTHE missile at the centre of the looming showdown between Iraq and the United Nations may be part of an ambitious secret project to develop a much longer-range missile that could hit Tehran or Tel Aviv, UN and independent missile experts believe. So, either Assange is an idiot, or playing for the other side or someone is leaking bogus information to Wikileaks. My guess is that it is a combination of all three.Either way, the mainstream media is using Wikileaks to promote a pro-war agenda, which means more killing in Iran based on the same information that was claimed about Iraq: fake weapons of mass destruction that will allegedly strike Israel. 3 days agoflag  reply+1treewolf39  maasanova:Wikileaks is just passing on the cables. Obviously they are full of misinformation because that is the nature of manufacturing world consensus. Showing the existents of this misinformation is the point of releasing the cables. The real truth still needs to be sorted out. 3 days agoflag  reply0Tyr  maasanova:So unless he draws the same conclusion as you about 9/11 he is part of the conspiracy? Wow...You have so much more more knowledge than so many of us...please 3 days agoflag  reply+4KSirysThe Great US of A lying to us??  noooooo.....  that can't be! 4 days agoflag  reply+1gerardange  KSirys:Oh,,,  I needed a  good laugh... Ha hah !!     ( okay, thank you) 4 days agoflag  reply+2JohnAThe government lies to us.  This is news? 4 days agoflag  reply+2gerardange  JohnA:IT SHOULD BE EXACTLY THAT!  "NEWS" 4 days agoflag  reply0TyrI like his style 4 days agoflag  reply-2TyrLike jack Nicholson said.." The truth?! You cant handle the truth!" I'm inclined to believe there is validity in that line from the movie. 4 days agoflag  reply+4treewolf39  Tyr:Bullshit. Some may not WANT to handle the truth, but most of the human race despises being lied to and make better choices with correct information instead of half truths and bald face lying. 4 days agoflag  reply+2KSirys  treewolf39:voted up! 4 days agoflag  reply+2gerardange  Tyr:it's not the issue ~ if you can handle the truth or, not...  But, the real issue here is... "Secrecy"... Secrecy that also hides deep corruption and also very ugly things... As is the case today.   If you want to know why so many people hate americans out there?  Then maybe maybe we all should have a good LOOK what is being hidden!  See what  corruption and what evil things are being done in our names.   The funny thng is.... most of the world already sees and knows what  is going on...The funny thng is.. the "Secrecy is directed at its own citizens.  That is NOT a Democracy,  that is Fascism.The TRUTH is not good for Business...~ 4 days agoflag  reply0Tyr  treewolf39:ok here is some truth for you. the people in the pentagon and the policy makers in Washington don't really give a damn about what a bunch of jerk offs in a website have to say to begin with, next is the fact that this game is played out at a level internationally that you can't begin to grasp...in other words you, I and all the rest are absolutely powerless in these matters...yes there can be times of embarrassments such as the wikileaks but do you actually believe that it makes a bit of difference in the implementation of any policy or decisions being made? If so let me know the next time you see the tooth fairy. 4 days agoflag  reply0Tyr  gerardange:Secrecy is what makes the world go around..when you go in to buy a new car do you reveal exactly the top dollar you are willing to pay or do you keep that to yourself? In a game of poker do you let everyone at the table know what your hand is? Think about it no successful individual or business is transparent. Should we reveal to the taliban the flight plan of the drones? Should the Marines post in all the nations newspapers their battle plans and strategies? You know after all the American public has a right to know every detail of everything that is done on the battle field, right?.... Give me a fucking break. 4 days agoflag  reply0treewolf39  Tyr:I AM a tooth fairy! I am sorry you feel so inadequate. If you believe small then you are small. I, on the other hand, Am TNT:] 4 days agoflag  reply+2gerardange  Tyr:You have are missing the point here..  Your comparison to buying a car  and not saying what you paid for it... and you also mentioned  Battlefield logistics?   iThat is NOT what we are talking about here?  We are talking about crimes and about corruption of the few with the privilege of Security .... It is not about  the troops or about logistics or the Taliban.   It is NOT about .... THEM  vs.  US  or....  US   vs, THEM !IT IS 100% All ABOUT...   US  vs.  US.      About  and how fraud and crimes are being committed under the cloak of national security and Secrecy...   How that secrecy is being abused!!!!   How some people are personally using secrecy to defraud  and rip- off Billions from our country in secret back rooms deals getting rich  as, Marines are risking their lives....  That's what the heart of the topic is here.    Not... what you are saying.Thank you for your comment.GA 4 days agoflag  reply0Tyr  treewolf39:Since you have arrived at conclusions about me that have no basis in any knowledge of me I must conclude that you opinion of yourself is equally ill informed. 3 days agoflag  reply0Tyr  gerardange:Ok perhaps I am missing the point, get back to me when there are any changes in human nature as a result of some individual "discovering" and then revealing that bribes are paid, that we do business with corrupt regimes, and that George Washington did indeed tell lies as well as every secretary of state and president since then. 3 days agoflag  reply0gerardange  Tyr:Your welcome... 3 days agoflag  reply0treewolf39  Tyr:I was thinking of you last night at dinner. I was talking to a man who will be part of the new Governor of Oregon's economic team.       I have no opinion of you and my comment was not meant as an insult. Just trying to point out that anyone can choose to have their voice heard. The powerful are only human. 2 days agoflag  reply+1dudefromtherockand this is a surprise to some people?! The American Gov. has been a purveyor of lies and evil since the death of JFK.

(Reuters) 5 days agoflag  reply0ParatusDid we really need Wikileaks to tell us this?  After years of listening to government b.s. I just assume they are lying whenever they open their mouth.  It's a credibility thing. 5 days agoflag  reply+2treewolf39  Paratus:So we should do nothing and pretend it does not matter? YES we fucking need Wikileaks and we need too change our government so that they get exposed MUCH sooner for being broken tools. 4 days agoflag  reply+3gerardange  Paratus:WE NEED TO DEMAND THE TRUTH...  Remember, They work for US. 4 days agoflag  reply+4gerardange  treewolf39:Wikileaks has done nothing more than what our real Press & Media should have been doing if they were really doing their most important constitutional roll  of exposing government corruption...  OUR MEDIA TODAY...have stopped doing the investigative work because, the large media organizations have been bought-out  and controlled by big Corporate Giants and Defense Contractors.   All the the Major Media & Press are TOLD WHAT NOT TO DO!     Mainstream news Print & TV in our country is a disaster!  It they were  Reporting the Real News  as they should of been doing and not the NON-NEWS like they are doing so well today... Then Wikileaks would have had nothing to leak.      Wikileaks is the Cannary in the coal mine waring all of us that we have a huge problem. Wikileaks is nothing more that that.  A WAKE-UP CALL:WE all need to realize the tipping point here...  That  our lives as we have know them today... will get  much, much worse if the Corrupt Corporate US Government = Representing Halliburton, Bank Of America Project for a New American Century and other Corrupt Corporate business entities...moves  forward with their plan to prosecute Julian Assange...   THAT IS THE TIPPING POINT!    If that come to pass as it is looking that it is....  I for one will be out in the streets..." I will not continue to allow the corruption of my government  to destroy the freedoms granted to us under our constitution and, for them to continue to do evil things in My Name!I have drawn my line in the sand...    How about you too drawing you line too. That time is very, very close at hand ~ maybe even weeks away.  If you blink your eyes it not going to go away... it is going to get worse. It is not business as usual any more.~ 4 days agoflag  reply0gerardange  Paratus:that is not the point... 4 days agoflag  reply+1treewolf39  gerardange:I am not sure where my line is but it is getting close. I have a young daughter (6) and she needs be to be present not locked up for peaceful protest. Her mother is one of the sheep. She misrepresented herself to me and I listened. Now I am sure that teaching our children with love and purpose IS more important then one more head or month yelling the truth to deaf rich want-to-bees. My feelings on this subject are in constant flux and the ass-wipes running the show could tip the scales for direct action at anytime. I hear congress is working up a shield law to use to prosecute Julian.
