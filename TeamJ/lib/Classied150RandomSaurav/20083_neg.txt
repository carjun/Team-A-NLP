Her lawyer fears she will now be executed imminently, probably hung by the neck until she is dead.Many human rights groups have criticised the Iranian authorities for their brutal treatment of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, including Amnesty International and the International Committee Against Stoning. The mother of two has already received 99 lashes for committing adultery and according to her lawyer, who has fled the country after a warrant was issued for his arrest, she has been beaten and tortured in jail. Yet the response of feminists in the West has been strangely muted.Hillary Clinton lost no opportunity to brandish her feminist credentials during her campaign to become the Democratic Partys Presidential nominee in 2008 and even went so far as to blame her failure to beat Barack Obama on the glass ceiling. Unfortunately, the concrete ceiling of Ashtianis jail cell hasnt inspired any comparable rhetoric. All she has said is that shes troubled by Ashtianis case.MoreShare/Bookmarkfrom  News2 Responsesleave one             Michelle Close Mills permalink             August 14, 2010          I think theres two reasons why Western women havent commented much about this.First of all, it would do no good. Iran wont even release American hikers who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time in spite of intervention by numerous attempts by bigger fish than us.  Theyre not going to listen to a single word we have to say about this womans fate.  Most Muslim men in the Middle East have absolutely zero respect for women.  Their countries are run by men of the same beliefs. Therefore in spite of our protests, shes a goner either way.  Sad, and incredibly WRONG but very true.  Women have no value there.Secondly, Western women are just trying to figure out how to pay their bills, and put food on the table in a crappy economy. Theyre probably feeling as I do that you cant save everyone.            Andrea Clingaman permalink             August 14, 2010          I think theres a certain amount of turning our heads away because were horrified,also this elephant is REALLY big ; I mean this is not isolated incidents of human rights abuses but a huge,violent, hateful,system of religious,political,cutural oppression. They will not change their ways because we think they are wrong and we dont like what theyre doing. They feel so strongly that they will literally blow themselves,(or wives or kids) up to take out an infidel.. thats all of us folksthey know we dont agree hence the blowing up part. maybe we could write an open letter of support to the women, just to say we are not ignoring you, we care what happens to you, the things that are happening to you are wrong, and you dont deserve this abuse. In this way maybe we can help to impower the women in some way.
