These rumors are justified now, with news that Wikileaks spokesman Daniel Schmitt has quit.German newspaper Der Spiegel reports that Schmitt quit amid tensions with Assange. Schmitt told Der Spiegel that Assange had started focusing too much on large projectslike the massive 77,000-document Afghanistan leakinstead of the many smaller leaks that used to be Wikileaks trade. Anytime Schmitt criticized Assanges plans, Assange shot back that I was disobedient to him and unloyal to the project.Schmitt also sheds light on an apparent morale problem within Wikileaks, which has been battered by harsh criticism both over Assanges sleazy dismissal of the rape and sexual molestation charges against him as a Pentagon smear campaign, and over allegations that Wikileaks didnt do enough to protect Afghan informants identities in their Afghanistan leak.MoreShare/Bookmarkfrom  NewsNo comments yetClick here to cancel reply.Leave a ReplyName: (required):Email:  (required):Website:Comment:Note: You can use basic XHTML in your comments.
