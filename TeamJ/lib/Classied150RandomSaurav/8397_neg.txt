Todd Dearing. "We would have made more if the last one who showed up was not a juvenile."Dearing said the sting led them to a 15-year-old runaway from Grand Prairie."I think if we had continued that night we could have gone all night and made arrests on every single phone call we made," he said.Arlington police are not only setting up stings, they're calling adult services and leaving reminders that preventing prostitution will be a priority during Super Bowl week.And if that's not enough, they hope the threat of public humiliation will put a lid on demand.E-mail jdouglas@wfaa.com Share this article:39 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Judge dismisses conviction of Howard K.

These men ARE rapists and child molesters as most of these girls are underaged CHILDREN who have been trafficked -against their will- from other states. The average age of a human trafficking victim (prostitute) in the US is 13. Rape? Check. Molestation? Check.58583789Flag this comment100princess said on January 8, 2011 at 9:53 PMIt would make a bigger impact if we saw child molesters, murders, & rapists on a billboard. Prostitution should not be at the top of the list, in my opinion. I understand it's illegal but really...who cares??58552768Flag this commentbruthr said on January 8, 2011 at 9:21 AMWRONG! Maybe a lawsuit would get the billboards down.  How very awful!58525118Flag this commentstaci said on January 8, 2011 at 1:40 AMGood point from a few of you, it does make the city look bad to have a big ol' billboard on prostitution right off the highway for everyone to see.  Not what I want visitors to remember about the town from which I was born.58515534Flag this commentcleofungbassist said on January 7, 2011 at 2:19 PMtypical pig cop grandstanding. How else are the petty establishment strongarm thugs supposed to act? There is major corruption in every police department, everyone knows this, but they're such heroes here to protect us! Another reason I'm glad I moved out of that trashdump city. Keep licking the boots of the police state everyone, at least you still have beer and football!58490107Flag this commentmichaelj1978 said on January 7, 2011 at 9:45 AMGearge Carlin said it best....."Why is it illegal to sell something, thats completely legal to give away for free."58471302Flag this commentfatboyslimreturn said on January 7, 2011 at 9:16 AMJust to be fair, I suppose we'll be seeing the pics of men who solicited male prostitutes?  Talk about being embarrased ... imagine your male boss' pic on a billboard for being convicted of soliciting a male prostitute.58469212Flag this commentfatboyslimreturn said on January 7, 2011 at 9:12 AMWhy don't the prostitues get similar treatment on billboards?  Our justice system attempts to shame the customer but does virtually nothing to the vendor besides a $56 fine and a free meal.58468898Flag this commentdanta said on January 7, 2011 at 8:16 AMTrashy, and what does someone from San Bernadino Ca or Middleton Vt. care about appearing on a billboard in a flyover state? It will not deter and only highlights a negative side of life in any major urban area hosting a major sporting event.  We'll see if this posts since the more sarcastic version was banned by goody two shoes.58464906Flag this commenttxladybug said on January 7, 2011 at 7:40 AMThinking this billboard makes gives the city a really "trashy" look.   Will leave a lasting impression with visiters.

Why is WFAA keeping me from posting the truth here?!?!?!?!?!?!58437127Flag this commentlucmar said on January 6, 2011 at 5:23 PMIf you have to pay for it, just goes to show how awful you are in bed.58436929Flag this commentkkaggie said on January 6, 2011 at 4:36 PM@theeducationalge, I never said I thought it shouldn't be legal.  However, anyone remember the guy that gave all those women he slept with HIV?  I believe he is in jail for that. Fact is, right now, it is illegal, and I'm all for full disclosure.  The spouses, partners, etc, of these johns are most definitely potential VICTIMS of a "victimless" crime.58434612Flag this commentdrpep65331 said on January 6, 2011 at 4:01 PMSeems a little odd that the Police Dept is allowed to contact others asking for services and then arrest them when they show up. I'm not saying prostitution is a good thing...but I think entrapment is far worse.58432713Flag this commentstaci said on January 6, 2011 at 1:53 PMWhy don't they put up billboards of the scumbags who do dirty things to little kids or people who have killed people by drunk driving or the countless other crimes besides prostitution.  I don't understand the sudden public stand against prostitution.58424494Flag this commenttheeducationalge said on January 6, 2011 at 11:58 AM@kkaggie if you were the wife of one of those guys, you already have problems....Prostitution has been around a very long time...no reason it shouldn't be legal.58416549Flag this commentnascar said on January 6, 2011 at 11:36 AMi think this is because of the super bowl and jerry jones can't find a way to make money on it !!! leave them alone !!! what other than disease , what makes bad ????58415208Flag this commentwhatsmyname said on January 6, 2011 at 11:27 AMOh, this is good.  Next, we'll have pictures of gold-digging wives and husbands-since most marriages are based upon the basic rules of prostitution anyway.  Seems like Arlington has a lot more to worry about than sexual pay for play.  I'm more afraid of all the gun-toting criminals who are commiting crimes than a broke down, teeth missing drug addicted prostitute.58414608Flag this commentcliffordgate said on January 6, 2011 at 11:12 AM@snowflake220 , you are the smart one, huh?  Sex with a 15 year-old in this state is rape, so the police are doing exactly what you ask them to do?58413514Flag this commentinoticed said on January 6, 2011 at 10:40 AM"Victimless" crime, huh?  Apparently, many of you are unaware of the statistics of females, both adult and underage, who are forced into this lifestyle or tricked into it and then don't know how to get out of it.  Check out traffick911 (dot) com for insight into this trade and how detrimental it truly is to women.Whatever it takes to protect women from being trafficked is worth it.  Good job, Arlington PD.58411483Flag this commentbboop13 said on January 6, 2011 at 10:05 AMWoo Hoo!  Way to go Arlington!  There are some other criminals I'd like to post on every highway so the public is warned and the criminals are no longer hidden.  This is a GOOD start!58409298Flag this commentbeatrite said on January 6, 2011 at 10:03 AMAh, shame and punishment for a victimless crime.  Good job local government.58409149Flag this commentkkaggie said on January 6, 2011 at 9:35 AM@bikergranny - that's exactly the point.  It's a message to men that if they want to pay for a prostitute they risk exposing themselves to public embarassment.  Also, if I was a wife of one of these men, I would want to know. Who knows what kind of STDs they have been exposed to? Maybe a more ACLU approach would be for authorities to automatically notify a spouse if their significant other has been getting it elsewhere.58407459Flag this commentpacotheus said on January 6, 2011 at 9:20 AMOh, I am feeling so much safer knowing that the authorities are stopping other people from having sex.  Especially with the upcoming festivities over paying millions of dollars to a bunch of muscle-bound guys to go beat each other up over a "ball" that is not even a ball.58406601Flag this commentenlightenedrogue said on January 6, 2011 at 8:40 AMTo think that in this point in history of a supposed civilized society there are still laws against paid sex between consenting adults- geesh!And these thuggish cops try to make themselves out as some kind of heroes when they're nothing more than tyrannical perverts.58404211Flag this commentjed_c said on January 6, 2011 at 8:07 AMWhy are there no billboards showing the cops fired for using prostitues ?.Or the Cops fired for having sex on duty ?.58402014Flag this commentkrautboy said on January 6, 2011 at 8:05 AMbillybear3:  The guy on the far left looks like a whitey to me.

If a 15 year old wants to ruin her life...let her. She ran away from home she was not pushed out onto the streets. Why dont the Arlington police worry about other crimes like murder, drugs, rape, incest, and illegal immigrants? At least the women are trying to make a living in this rotten world.58397026Flag this commentchrissyrae93081 said on January 6, 2011 at 4:38 AMThe point is to make it so men won't go looking for some paid strange hello! I think its a brilliant idea to deter prospective "clients"58395064Flag this commentbikergranny said on January 6, 2011 at 2:38 AMThis is just too far.  If these guys have wives or children, why would you humiliate or embarrass the entire family?  Isnt arresting them enough humiliation?  Seriously?58393724Flag this commentkernsfamily said on January 6, 2011 at 1:09 AMand, after the super bowl...when the game is over....they'll go back to "business as usual", and will go back to ignoring it...and not caring less...58392338Flag this commenttim_denton said on January 5, 2011 at 10:34 PMI've never been in the market, but I don't consider prostitution done discretely to really be a crime.  It's more like a win-win for both parties.  A lotta marriages are nothing but prostitution anyway.58388883Flag this commentzenfulnaito said on January 5, 2011 at 10:30 PMLol.
