Our earnings, our earning power has dropped 11%! And the top 2% want a tax break? Give me a break!Hey but dont take my word for it. There are some really smart guys out there that I trust and so share their words, concepts and ideas with you. (Scarier yet Obama is talking fixing the tax system! The smart guys say when that happens run for the hills---a lopsided economy is going to get even more so!)groups:Politics tags:Tax Cuts,Negotiations,top 2%,28 million unemployed |0 comments// Elections Tax Cuts, negotiations, deficit, top 2%, 28 million unemployed, underemployed, DREAM ACThide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.
