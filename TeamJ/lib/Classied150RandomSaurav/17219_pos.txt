"This video is my introduction to you! My favorite activity is conscience dreaming; the greatest inspiration for my political business information. Some of you don't dream - sadly.""The majority of citizens in the united states of America have never read the united states of America's constitution. You don't have to accept the federalist laws," the video's titles say. "In conclusion, reading the second United States constitution, I can't trust the current government because of the ratifications: the government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar. No! I won't pay debt with a currency that's not backed by gold and silver! No! I won't trust in god!"Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was among the people critically wounded in the shooting at a public event in Tucson, and several people were killed, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl.Officials have said little publicly about the suspect in custody, but law enforcement sources who asked to remain anonymous identify him as Loughner.In a comment posted on MySpace three months ago in connection with a video about Pima Community College, Loughner wrote: "Hello, I know you're illiterate! This is the greatest protest for exposure into a wrongful act. The school is breaking the constitution. If you watch the video then you'll understand. The teachers are taking advantage of you in the first and Fifth Amendment. The United States Constitution, which is the law, can be broken at this school. Thank you and goodnight! Jared"His last writing on his MySpace page was "Goodbye friends."Arizona Gunman Jared Lee Loughner Video Police videos police officers police corruption never talk to a police officer or a Federal Agent know your rights http://policecrimes.com/police.html Police spying spy american terrorist attacks domestic intelligence police search collect information FBI Americans Department of Homeland Security military criminal investigators collects stores analyzes information U.S. citizens residents United States governmental scrutiny secretive organizations interviews documents law enforcement agencies America personal information employment history acting suspiciously Islam U.S. Government free food free guns free waterCategory:News & PoliticsTags:videosJaredLeeLoughnerpostedinhisyoutubeaccountArizonaGunmanRampageViewsGovernmentgoldsilvermoneyspyamericanterroristattacksdomesticintelligencepolicesearchcollectinformationFBIAmericansDepartmentHomelandSecuritymilitaryNectarphonic - The Little EaseDownload This Song:            AmazonMP3iTunesLink to this comment:Share to:see allAll Comments      (17)Respond to this video...Sign In or Sign Up now to post a comment!this guy was obviously under some form of brainwashing/druggingLeviBakersfield41 minutes agoLeviBakersfield41 minutes agoi see its already being used on the news to demonize anyone who beleives in the constitution or free money. i expect to see a lot more of this from mainstream media in 2011.ajmprovidence1 hour agoajmprovidence1 hour agowell this guys not crazier then the us goverment. they kill people to but they have the license to do it ... there poisoning youre food , they put floride in youre water and they violate the constitution ....also look at the warsss how many innocent have they killed there ...soon the us will be the most hated country in the world and then,,,,,,,they gon blow up the worlddr3ws3 hours agodr3ws3 hours ago@jazzzgrlI whole wholeheartedly agree with Jazzzgrl, but must add I believe politicians and editors of media outlets should be subject to the same mental health testing because words can be bullets too. 1Bizerk3 hours ago1Bizerk3 hours agoHe can't be a Tea Party Member.

Killing him will never bring back those who were shot. It will not deter future psychotic killers from doing bad things as they have lost touch with reality. Who does the death penalty help? It only helps promote a society that believes killing is the way to handle our problems. People should get cleared by mental health before getting a gun. Kids should learn empathy and communication skills in schooljazzzgrl4 hours agojazzzgrl4 hours agoThe Death Penalty is an ABSOLUTE MUST for Loughner. Even if he was a CIA Patsy!
