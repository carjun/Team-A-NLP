That opening riff played by Ray Manazrek is so classic. And Mr. Morrison really could sing the heck out of that one.Share        (0)        (0)              (0)              (0)      Was this helpful?0Post a Commentshow text editorPostMore Light My Fire reviews                Quick Tip by MNeulander.August 14, 2010posted in Music MattersA Quick Tip by MNeulanderI can't say enogh good things about the Doors. I loved them on the soundtrack of Apocalypse Now. I still listen to them at least once a week. The best right behind the Beatles.

Still do. To me it just drags on and on and on. Loved the single though!

It spent three weeks at #1 on the Billboard's Hot 100, and one week on the Cashbox Top 100. It was re-released in 1968, peaking at #87. The song was largely written by Robby Krieger, and credited to the entire band. A live version was released in 1983 on their album Alive, She Cried, the first of several live or compilation albums released in subsequent decades to include the song.  "Light My Fire" also achieved modest success in Australia, where it peaked at #22 on the ARIA chart. The single originally reached #49 in the UK in 1967, but experienced belated success in that country in 1991 when a re-issue peaked at #7. The re-issue occurred on the back of revived interest in the band following Oliver Stone's film biopic "The Doors". The single has been certified in 1967 a gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.[1]  The song is #35 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[2] It was also included in the Songs of the Century list and was ranked number 7 in VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of All Time list.  Jos Feliciano's cover version won a 1969 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, the same year he won another Grammy for Best New Artist.            view wiki  TagsMusic, Songs, 1960s, Oldiessee all  DetailsAdd DetailsPolls40 #1 Hits From The Heyday of Top 40 Radioby drifter51Vote NowMoviesBooksMusicFoodTv ShowsTechnologyPoliticsVideo GamesParentingFashionGreen LivingAll TagsAbout LunchPressFAQsContact UsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySitemapReport Abuse 2011 Lunch.com, LLC All Rights ReservedLunch.com - The Best Consumer Reviews Online()Follow MeThis is you!
