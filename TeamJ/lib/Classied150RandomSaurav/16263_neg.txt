Not YetBy Alex Weprin on December 21, 2010 4:21 PMYesterday, we linked to a story from Bloomberg which reported (using some slippery language) that CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric and CBS have begun preliminary talks about a new contract.That report may have been a bit off-base.It is premature someone familiar with the situation tells TVNewser. It is way too early in the process.Indeed, the New York Post reports today that Couric and CBS will likelybegintalks next month, which makes sense, given the May expiration of her current deal.While it is still too soon to tell what CBS would offer the anchor, it is a safe bet that even if Couric accepts a lower base salary, there would likely be other sources of income that could offset any losses. Possibilities include a production deal, or an enhanced digital presence, or more primetime appearances.And of course, Couric could leave CBS altogether if she gets a more compelling offer from someplace else.There has been interest from a wide range of outlets, across the spectrum our source says.RELATED:Yet Another Futile Attempt to Save 'The Early Show' Original Cast: T-ShirtsMorley Safer Reflects on 41 Years at '60 Minutes'Ted Williams Reunites with Mom, Talks to Network Morning ShowsBooking Wars: Morning Shows Fight Over Ted Williams and his 90-year-old MotherTags: Katie Couric CommentsShare<< PREVIOUSIts PoliticsAs UsualOn Cable News Channels After Census Results Revealed NEXT >>HLN Morning Express Host Robin Meade to Co-Host Oprah Winfrey Network Specials Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.MEDIABISTRO EVENTSDont fear online privacy, understand itTake advantage of the opportunities digital privacy concerns present for business.
