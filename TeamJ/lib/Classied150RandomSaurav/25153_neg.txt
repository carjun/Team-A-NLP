A new technology is available that allows for laser treatment for toenail fungus and the adoption rate amongst podiatrists and dermatologists is expected to grow quickly.  The medical procedure uses the  Pinpointe Footlaser, an infrared laser beam made by Patholase, to kill toenail fungus and the manufacturer says it has a 88% success rate.  Nomir Medical Technologies' Noveon Laser uses a similar system and like the Pinpointe is already being used in the field of dentistry, as well as for eye surgery and hair removal surgery.The good news is that the laser treatment is a lot less scary thanit sounds. The Pinpointe laser is hand held and looks much like anormal laser pointer. It is applied by the physician or techniciandirectly to the nail to get rid of any fungal growth behind the exposednail and goes through the skin to the nail matrix from where the nailgrows. While some may think of lasers with a small amount oftrepidation, the laser treatment is painless for most people. The laserdoes generate heat but patients report a tingling sensation.Thelaser penetrates the nail plate and not only kills fungus but alsowipes out bacteria and viruses.  A grid pattern is etched over eachnail to make sure every millimeter of the nail is covered.  The doctorwill treat every one of your nails, even the ones that don't look bad,just in case there is microscopic fungus present that is unseen by thenaked eye.  This may sound like a slow and tedious process but it'simportant to hit all areas of the nail, just to be safe.  The processtakes about  thirty minutes, a small amount of time to wait for atoenail fungus cure.Benefits of  Toenail Fungus Laser TreatmentThe best part about getting laser treatment for your toenail fungusis that it's just one single treatment and the results are immediate.Although the look of your nails does not change right away, itcompletely eradicates the fungus right then and there. You can get yournails painted right after the treatment and go back to playing sportsand being active again. Normally it will take six months or so for yournails to grow back completely clear and normal. This the time it takesnail growth to go from the proximal nail fold (the cuticle area) to theend of the toe. The ideal candidate for fungus toenails, issomeone who has exhausted all other methods of eliminating theirinfections. With such a high initial success rate, the PinpointFootlaser System easily outpaces oral drug treatments and home remediesand can even cure the most extreme cases of toenail fungus. *Photo courtesy of flickr.FDA Approval of Pinpointe and Noveon As of this writing, the Pinpointe and Noveon laser systems have not been FDA approved for treatment of toenail fungus.  Here's where it gets a little complicated.  Although the devices have been deemed 'FDA cleared' that only means they have been approved for other types of laser surgery although not for treating toenail fungus in particular.  Since the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine, physicians are indeed allowed to use FDA approved devices for other procedures if they feel it will be beneficial.  Alternatives To Pinpointe Laser TreatmentIf laser treatment is not in your budget, you may want to try one of several natural cures for toenail fungus.  People have gotten results from apple cider vinegar, epsom salt, and tea tree oil.  These are healthy alternatives to prescription anti-fungal pharmaceuticals, which can pose a risk to the health of your kidneys.   How Much Does Pinpointe Laser Treatment Cost?Once you find a podiatrist who does laser surgery on toenails, you can expect to pay anywhere between $900 to $1200 to have it done.  The treatment cost isn't covered by medical insurance because, as mentioned above, the treatment is not been officially approved by the Federal Drug Administration.  As always, please consult your physician so you can talk about the benefits of having laser surgery.Summing It All Up: Should You Get This Treatment?In summary, the benefits of laser toenail fungus treatment are plentiful.  There is minimal pain, the procedure is said to be safe and effective, there are no medications to take, and it's just a one time doctor's visit.  You'll be in and out in no time and can even get your nails polished as soon as your done. However, although many doctors believe the procedure is safe, the use of Pinpointe and Noveon lasers has not yet been approved for use on eradicating toenail fungus.  This may be a red light to some of you but for others who have a very severe or advanced case of toenail fungus, you might feel the benefits far outweigh the apparent risks.  I cannot recommend this treatment one way or another so please talk to your primary physician or podiatrist and ask them about laser treatment for your toenail fungus before deciding.Pinpointe Footlaser on ABC Newsvote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...?
