Please see the sockpuppet policy for detailed definitions and descriptions of what sockpuppetry is and is not. This is the place to seek help when a user is likely to have violated that policy, breached restrictions (eg blocks or bans) using multiple accounts, for any requests where multiple accounts or underlying IP needs checking, or for any requests via the CheckUser tool. Skip to: Submitting an SPI case  open cases  cases awaiting CheckUserIf the evidence is sensitive, privacy is needed, or if it involves sock puppetry by an administrator, seek advice by email from a Checkuser or the Arbitration Committee first.

This technical information can help determine if a single person is using more than one account. Use of the checkuser tool is governed by policies on the English Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation levels. For more information, see the Foundation policy, the local policy and the Foundation privacy policy.When not to request CheckUserThere must be credible evidence supporting the suspicion of sockpuppetry, and good cause why CheckUser is required. Requests for checkuser without evidence will be declined, because CheckUser is not for fishing. CheckUser is also not  magic pixie dust, and should not be requested to investigate canvassing or meatpuppetry,  Stale account(s) that have not edited for many months, or cases where behavioral evidence is sufficient to decide the matter (see also the  duck test). Finally, CheckUser will not be used to confirm that a user is editing from a specific IP address; quick requests may be made for the purpose of getting an underlying IP address or range blocked, however a CheckUser will not disclose what that IP address is.Making Quick CheckUser requestsSee #Quick Checkuser requests. This page may also be used for other CheckUser requests unrelated to sock abuse, such as:Blatant attack or vandalism accounts, and an IP block is neededCollateral damage checks for proposed IP range blocksPurported suicide notes and threats of harm (try IRC first in an emergency, either at #wikipedia-en-spi connect, or via your browser)Evidence and SPI case guidelinesYou need to provide evidence showing the accounts or IPs are likely to be sock-puppets and acting in a disruptive or forbidden manner, which other users will then assess. If there is no evidence showing forbidden sock-puppetry, then nothing will happen and the case is likely to be speedily closed by the SPI clerks. Most SPI cases are decided based upon behavioral evidence, that is, the behavior of the accounts or IPs concerned. This evidence needs to be explicit; that is, use verifiable evidence in the form of diffs, links to the pages in which the sock puppetry is occurring, and reasonable deductions and impressions drawn from said evidence. Evidence solely consisting of vague beliefs or assumptions will be rejected.Some general guidelines when making your SPI case:Remember to always assume good faith when possible.After submitting a case, consider notifying the suspected accounts by adding {{subst:socksuspectnotice|PUPPETMASTER}} ~~~~ to the bottom of their talk pages. Notification is not mandatory, and may, in some instances, lead to further disruption or provide a sockpuppeteer with guidance on how to avoid detection.Do not use any section headers ("===") on case pages as this will break the report templates and mess up the formatting.Keep it simple. Simple, concisely presented evidence leads to a quickly resolved case.After administrators and/or checkusers have reviewed the case, it will be closed and archived by an SPI clerk. (Administrators may mark a case closed using {{SPIclose}}.)Submitting an SPI caseCreate the case by replacing "SOCKMASTER" in the white box below with the user name of the oldest account, or the previous case name, and then clicking the button under the box. Note that these buttons may be used either for creating a new case or reopening an old one. For example, if the case name is about User:John Doe or a prior case is at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/John Doe, then you should enter Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/John Doe in the white box, and then click the button under the box. You will be taken to the next page, where there is a form to fill out giving the details of your report.Start an SPI case hereReplace "SOCKMASTER" with the account name of the sockmaster (the person behind the sock puppets) without the "User:" prefix. If CheckUser might be needed, change |checkuser=no to |checkuser=yes in the edit box.Instructions for requesting checkuser on open casesAnyone can request CheckUser at any time on an open case if it is necessary. (This is done automatically if you use the "Request CheckUser" box to create your new request.) If you wish to request CheckUser to any existing open case, then do the following:Add {{SPI case status|CUrequest}} to the very top of the case page.A clerk or CheckUser will review the case and make a determination as to whether CheckUser is needed. A clerk will either endorse the case for CheckUser attention or decline the case.If the case is declined, then the case will be included back on the list of SPI cases that do not have CheckUser requests. If the case is endorsed, then a CheckUser will also review the case and determine whether a check is justified. If the CheckUser decides to run a check, they will check all given accounts for technical evidence; this may take a while. At the end, CheckUser may post their results under the "Clerk, patrolling admin and checkuser comments" section, stating which accounts are confirmed to be the same user, which ones are likely, possible, or unlikely that they are the same user, and which ones are unrelated or inconclusive. Sometimes, underlying IP(s) may also be blocked.The case is then placed back in the list of non-CheckUser requests pending further comments from clerks or patrolling administrators, or it may be closed by a CheckUser or clerk if all issues have been addressed.Administrators' instructionsIf you wish to help out at SPI, but are unsure how to get started, please read Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/SPI/Administrators instructions. If you need help with anything, please ask one of the active SPI clerks.See alsoSPI clerks and clerkingList of indicator icons used at SPISuspected sock puppets and Requests for checkuser  predecessors to SPI which both ceased as of January 2009The SPI bot's edits.Case status summaryCase status summaryInvestigationStatusDate filedLast user to edit casetimestampLast clerk/checkuser to edit casetimestampBold7755endorsed2011-01-05 23:22 UTC2011-01-08 21:35 UTCNativeForeigner2011-01-06 02:49 UTCPolylepsisendorsed2011-01-08 18:45 UTCElockid2011-01-09 13:24 UTCElockid2011-01-09 13:24 UTCShukiendorsed2011-01-08 22:41 UTCBulldog1232011-01-10 01:54 UTCDeltaQuad2011-01-09 04:22 UTCDr.Mukesh111endorsed2011-01-09 02:14 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 02:58 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 02:58 UTCOriJanusendorsed2011-01-09 06:20 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:09 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:09 UTCSatt 2endorsed2011-01-09 09:19 UTCEmirKaraman2011-01-09 20:50 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 17:11 UTCShrik88musicendorsed2011-01-09 12:37 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:01 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:01 UTCJacob Hnri 6endorsed2011-01-09 15:10 UTCElockid2011-01-09 16:10 UTCElockid2011-01-09 16:10 UTCLoosmarkchecked2010-12-30 13:13 UTCVolunteer Marek2011-01-07 20:39 UTCMuZemike2011-01-05 02:02 UTCNukehopen2010-12-29 04:55 UTCCrowsnest2011-01-09 17:11 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:10 UTCMrmaheriopen2011-01-05 06:53 UTCKarafs2011-01-05 23:28 UTCNeverNeverEscapeeyesopen2011-01-10 04:01 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-10 02:42 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-10 02:42 UTCRjecinadeclined2011-01-07 23:58 UTCChase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry2011-01-09 13:48 UTCChase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry2011-01-09 13:48 UTCKristkarloffdeclined2011-01-08 22:05 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 00:52 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 00:52 UTCMeowyclose2011-01-03 19:10 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 23:19 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 23:19 UTCWyandanchclose2011-01-04 15:18 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:12 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:12 UTCInterrobangclose2011-01-04 20:27 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:26 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:26 UTCSampsonite5close2011-01-05 19:10 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:16 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:16 UTCNewspaperwriter10021close2011-01-07 04:14 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 23:17 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 23:17 UTCLmb1962close2011-01-07 18:11 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:22 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-09 16:22 UTCKnowledge Matters 121close2011-01-09 15:53 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-10 02:41 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-10 02:41 UTCPatriciajbaclose2011-01-09 17:16 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-10 02:50 UTCHelloAnnyong2011-01-10 02:50 UTCOpen cases: not awaiting CheckuserCasesLoosmark  A CheckUser completed a check on relevant users in this case, and it is now awaiting administration and close.LoosmarkLoosmark (talk+  tag  contribs  deleted contribs  logs  filter log  block user  block log  SUL  checkuser)This page's archived case(s) are at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Loosmark/Archive.03 January 2011Suspected sockpuppetsRaczko (talk+  tag  contribs  deleted contribs  logs  filter log  block user  block log  SUL  checkuser)Hallersarmy (talk+  tag  contribs  deleted contribs  logs  filter log  block user  block log  SUL  checkuser)98.227.224.187 (talk+  tag  contribs  filter log  WHOIS  RBLs  block user  block log  cross-wiki contribs  checkip)User compare report Auto-generated every six hours.Please list evidence below this line.

Here he followed User:Volunteer Marek (formerly User:Radeksz), as User:Loosmark often did in the past. One of the first edits he made was to create a redirect to his userpage, rather unlikely for a newcomer. HerkusMonte (talk) 13:13, 30 December 2010 (UTC)Edit history here: [1] and for the related ip: [2].The pattern of these new accounts with blocked sockpuppets of loosmark is that they are all single-issue accounts devoted to removing historical information that involves something negative about Poland. In the case of User:Hallersarmy, it is the issue of Jzef Haller and his actions. Two of loosmark's other socks, whch I have interacted with, each followed this pattern. User:23Michal was devoted to removing referenced info from the article about the Carmelite Church, Przemyl (see his edit history here: [3]) and User:J.kunikowski was devoted to removing referenced info concerning the Massacre of Lviv professors (see his edit history here: [4]).Also, one of loosmark's already-blocked sockpuppets, User:Agoodhistorian, edited on the same topic as User:Hallersarmy:[5]. Faustian (talk) 06:21, 3 January 2011 (UTC)And note that the sockpupper's actions above are not only about the same topic but also involved doing the same thing that user:Hallersarmy did - blanking referenced information. Both Hallersarmy and confirmed sockpuppet agoodhistorian show the same pattern of deleting referenced info on the exact same subject area.Faustian (talk) 14:37, 4 January 2011 (UTC)(In response to the latest comment about the inconclusive result): in the case of User:Hallersarmy the behavioral evidence seems strong.Faustian (talk) 05:12, 5 January 2011 (UTC)Comments by other usersAccused parties may also comment/discuss in this section below. See Defending yourself against claims.I have no idea if Hallersarmy or any of the other accounts are related to Loosmark. Both Raczko and Hallersarmy have not made enough edits for me to be able to see any similarities with Loosmark. One thing though, the personalities are slightly different; Loosmark was somewhat abrasive whereas at least Hallersarmy seems merely inexperienced in Wikipedia etiquette (hence revert warring) and more polite in his comments.

MuZemike 06:30, 3 January 2011 (UTC)Since this is about a different user account I had assumed it would be a different investigation.

Or they both are.Faustian (talk) 14:32, 4 January 2011 (UTC) Clerk note: It's more practical to do the checks simultaneously as if they were the same case; if there's one related account and one unrelated account, or two groups of socks that are unrelated to each other, then that information will present itself. --Shirik (Questions or Comments?) 18:38, 4 January 2011 (UTC)After checking with a couple other CUs on this, I am going to say this is  Inconclusive.

I must warn that at no point have I been contributing to Wikipedia using two accounts simultaneously.

I do not have permission to log on to mrmaheri's account and so do not know this editor's password.

Remember to sign at the end of your section with 4 tilde characters "~~~~" Escapeeyes had a long-running history of disruptive editing and sock abuse on Ronald Ryan (last man to be hanged in Australia), which included a long-standing grudge against Purrum. After no less than eight sockpuppet accounts were blocked, he switched to using an IP anonymising service/open proxies; article is under long-term semi-protection and talk page was also semi'ed for a while. As can be seen in the investigation archive, every time he was banned he'd disappear for a little while and then reappear under a new sock account (or several), claiming to be unconnected with the previous editors who just happened to have the same agenda and posting style - this guy had a serious fixation on Ronald Ryan and was very persistent in trying to get around bans.Dmol recently raised concerns that Bepopalula was engaged in sockpuppetry, noting that he'd been making similar edits to 93.185.104.30 (since blocked as an open proxy) - compare e.g. [11] with [12]. Bepopalula requested that administrators look at the allegations against him, and since his edit patterns look awfully familiar, this seemed like an appropriate forum.Edit histories have several suspicious points:First edit by Bepopalula appeared two weeks after the last investigation/ban on another of Escapeeyes' IP socks.As with previous socks, Bepopalula seems to have an extreme dislike of Purrum in particular - compare e.g. [13][14] with [15][16][17].As with previous socks, every single edit by Bepopalula has been concerned solely with Ronald Ryan - popular articles include HM Prison Pentridge where Ryan was hanged, Wrongful execution, Miscarriage of justice, Capital punishment in Australia, and accusations against Purrum re. his edits regarding Ryan.These edits go over the exact same ground as previous socks. It's not just that both Bepopalula and Escapeeyes believe Ryan was innocent and didn't get a fair trial; it's that they keep making the same points in the same fashion. Compare e.g. [18] with [19] or [20], both from previously-identified socks of EE. As an example, all three make a big deal about the point that Ryan's rifle was never forensically examined - even though it's not clear what light this could have shed on the case. (The bullet was never found, so nothing to match against, and Ryan was on the run with the rifle for 19 days, more than enough time to have cleaned it had it been fired.)Curiously, despite this fixation with Ryan, Bepopalula has made no edits to Ronald Ryan itself or its talk page from that account. This would be very peculiar for a new editor who had an interest in the subject; OTOH, it would make a lot of sense for a sockmaster who'd realised that he was too well-known at that page and wanted to avoid getting banned again. (It would not be the first time Escapeeyes has been a little too clever in trying to cover his tracks - see the IP masking incident in his sock investigation archive.)

Remember to sign at the end of your section with 4 tilde characters "~~~~"The user Satt 2 was indefinitely banned on 8 January 2010. I found this user in the talk page archives of Talk:Georgia (country). This user appeared to have a determined agenda to place Georgia in Europe and purge it from any relation with Asia. Satt 2's edits are in Georgian related articles and boxes on his user page state that he enjoys Classical music including Bach and Handel [30]. Satt 2 was banned for uploading non-free (Georgian related) images.The user Polgraf appeared on 16 January 2010 (eight days after Satt 2 was banned). Polgraf's edits are in Georgian related articles and his user page has the same boxes stating that he enjoys Classical music including Bach and Handel [31], and Polgraf has the same agenda as Satt 2 regarding Georgia and Europe. Polgraf also uploads non-free (Georgian related) images.The IP 69.142.134.249 appeared recently with the same POV mission regarding Georgia and Europe. Polgraf added a 'warning' to the IP's talk page but they are both working for a common goal on Talk:Georgia (country) and especially Talk:Western Asia. EmirKaraman (talk) 09:19, 9 January 2011 (UTC)UpdateIn what looks like evasive maneuvering after spotting this report, Polgraf is repeating some of the IP's edits [32] and left this message on the IP's talk page [33], following which the IP claims to have registered Hendrikestonian (talk  contribs  deleted contribs  logs  edit filter log  block user  block log). Polgraf jumped in at Talk:Western Asia to carry on the IP's line of argument, just as he had done at Talk:Georgia (country). EmirKaraman (talk) 15:52, 9 January 2011 (UTC)Ahh now the quacking is deafening. Polgraf has posted an Estonian comment on User talk:Hendrikestonian [34] which Google translates as "Good work chum!: -) This website is full of idiots like EmirKaraman."When I made this report I was certain that Polgraf was Satt 2 but only 90% that Polgraf was the IP, I am now certain of both. EmirKaraman (talk) 17:07, 9 January 2011 (UTC)User compare reportI've just checked the User compare report and it really is unequivocal. Polgraf and the IP both edited Georgian mythology (a very rarely edited article [35]), and just 3 minutes apart from each other [36] [37]. At the bottom of the list, Polgraf and Satt 2 both edited Zakaria Paliashvili, a considerably obscure article, and in actual fact, Polgraf and Satt 2 both moved Zakaria Paliashvili to Zachary Paliashvili [38] [39]. Polgraf and the IP both edited Georgians, and only 2 minutes apart from each other [40] [41]. Compare the IP's edit summary style here ("ethnic grou" --> "ethnic group") and Polgraf's edit summary style on the same article a week later here ("that" -> "the"). The whole report is absolutely incriminating. EmirKaraman (talk) 19:21, 9 January 2011 (UTC)It gets even better, a proxy IP has just appeared at Georgia (country) repeating Polgraf's/69.142's edits, and has been speedily banned [42]. I hope his use of proxys doesn't evade CheckUser. It's fair to say there is overwhelming behavioral evidence here in any case.
