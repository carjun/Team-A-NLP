Mutilation of Young GirlsFemale genital mutilation (FGM) is the alteration or injuryof female genital parts for non-medical reasons, and are of no healthbenefit. It is typically carried out incultures that believe that FGM will help females resist illicit sexualbehavior. According to the World HealthOrganization, 100 million to 140 million women and girls have undergone FGMworldwide. FGM is usually performed ongirls between infancy and 15 years old. Female genital mutilation was denounced by the World HealthOrganization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPF), and the UnitedNations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) in 1997.FGM is internationally considered a human rights violation against females.Child TraffickingAccording to UNICEF, globally 2.5 million children,primarily girls, are subject to sexual exploitation for profit. The U.S. Department of State reported that300,000 to 400,000 children each year are victims of sexual trafficking across internationalborders. Most of these are females. The Department of Justice estimates between14K and 18K foreign citizens are subject to sex trafficking each year in theU.S., but the number of U.S. citizens trafficked within the U.S. is evenhigher. They estimate 200,000 childrenare at risk. NBC reported U.S. traffickerscan make in excess of $200K per child in one year.
