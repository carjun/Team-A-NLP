Ive polled thousands of high school history teachers and spoken about the war to audiences across the country, and there is little agreement even on why the South seceded. Was it over slavery? States rights? Tariffs and taxes?As the nation begins to commemorate the anniversaries of the wars various battles  from Fort Sumter to Appomattox  lets first dispense with some of the more prevalent myths about why it all began.1. The South seceded over states rights.Confederate states did claim the right to secede, but no state claimed to be seceding for that right. In fact, Confederates opposed states rights  that is, the right of Northern states not to support slavery.On Dec. 24, 1860, delegates at South Carolinas secession convention adopted a Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union. It noted an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery and protested that Northern states had failed to fulfill their constitutional obligations by interfering with the return of fugitive slaves to bondage. Slavery, not states rights, birthed the Civil War.South Carolina was further upset that New York no longer allowed slavery transit. In the past, if Charleston gentry wanted to spend August in the Hamptons, they could bring their cook along. No longer  and South Carolinas delegates were outraged. In addition, they objected that New England states let black men vote and tolerated abolitionist societies. According to South Carolina, states should not have the right to let their citizens assemble and speak freely when what they said threatened slavery.Other seceding states echoed South Carolina. Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery  the greatest material interest of the world, proclaimed Mississippi in its own secession declaration, passed Jan. 9, 1861. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of the commerce of the earth. . . . A blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.The Souths opposition to states rights is not surprising. Until the Civil War, Southern presidents and lawmakers had dominated the federal government. The people in power in Washington always oppose states rights. Doing so preserves their own..More from the James Loewen piece.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesDSD @PoliticalDog101, Five Myths of the Civil War, James Loewen, Lincoln, Slavery, The Civil War, To Free the Slaves, To keep the Union, Lies My Teacher Told Me"Read moreAustralian Rain and Floods Updates.DSDJanuary 5, 2011jamesb1015 comments[Floodwaters have peaked in Rockhampton but more rain is already filling the Fitzroy river...]From ABC, the Australian Broadcasting CorporationMore rain on the way as flood crisis continuesMore rain is falling on flooded areas of central and southern Queensland this morning, sparking fears that the flood crisis will be prolonged and adding to the worries of locals whose homes and businesses are already under water.The rains could put pressure on the Fitzroy River in the central Queensland city of Rockhampton, where 500 homes have been evacuated and the Fitzroy has peaked at 9.2 metres.The bureau says an upper level low could dump as much as 50 millimetres of rain a day, producing totals of around 200mm in some regions by the end of the weekend.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/06/3107208.htmMore from the BBC.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Military, Other Things, UpdatesDSD @PoliticalDog101, Floods in Australia, WeatherRead moreThe 33 Senators who are up for a vote in 2012DSDDecember 31, 2010jamesb1011 commentI dont have time to rearrange and reformat this now, but heres the Congressional Directorys list of Class I Senators whose terms expire in January, 2013 (up for re-election in 2012).Congressional Directory for the 111th Congress (2009-2010), December 2009.[Pages 319-335][From the U.S. Government Printing Office,http://www.gpo.govhttp://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDIR-2009-12-01/html/CDIR-2009-12-01-TERMSOFSERVICE.htmIncompletely modifiedTERMS OF SERVICEEXPIRATION OF THE TERMS OF SENATORSClass I.SENATORS WHOSE TERMS OF SERVICE EXPIRE IN 201333 Senators in this group: Democrats, 22Republicans, 9Independent 1Independent Democrat, 1Name Party ResidenceAkaka, Daniel K.\1\ D.

In two years, in the face of a uniformly cynical and hostile opposition, he has managed time and again to win political battles, any one of which can be called major: universal health care, banking regulation, fair pay for women, draw-down in Iraq and ramp-up in Afghanistan, the rescue of Detroit, the prevention of global economic collapse, the end of discrimination against immigrants with AIDS, same-sex benefits for government workers, two massive middle-class tax cuts, and, yes, the repeal of DADT. If, as suddenly seems distinctly possible, the new START treaty is passed this week, his place will be cemented as the shrewdest ex-senator in the White House since LBJ. And his record will be far more kindly viewed by history.For his part, Harry Reid has quietly become one of the great Majority Leaders in the nations history: Obamas victories are his, too, and in fact most of the heavy lifting is Reids alone. And what Reid has done in the current lame-duck session will soon be legendary. The extension of the Bush tax cuts was a piece of brilliant political judo, at once extending tax breaks for the middle class, kneecapping the national GOP on one of its main talking points  Obamas pro-tax liberalism  and yanking the Senate GOP from beneath Minority Leader Mitch McConnells feet. The tax-cut repeal lit a spark of revolt in the Tea Party wing of the caucus, and though Jim DeMint managed to keep it from catching fire, its still smoldering. McConnell knows he has to deal with the devil on both sides of the aisle now  a fact only underlined by the defection of eight Republicans in support of DADT repeal on Saturday. He is considerably weaker than he could have guessed on the night of November 2.And Reid is considerably stronger.More @ http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/dadt-senators-4435494#ixzz18y40TMIEShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Men, Politics, Updates'the long game', Dont Tell, DSD @PoliticalDog101, Lieberman, McCain, Obama, process piece, Reid, Dont AskRead moreSTART Senate numbers by region from our DSDDecember 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsNew START passes the Senate 71-26 (all R) with 3 retiring Republicans not voting (Bunning, Ky; Bond, Mo; & Brownback, Ks).13 Republicans voted yes, so Mitch McConnells iron caucus broke 1-2 (13-26), with 3 walking.Changes from yesterdays vote on cloture (67-28-5; R 11-28-3):All 56 Democrats and both independents voted aye.On cloture, Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), recovering from prostate surgery, and Evan Bayh (D-Ind. retiring) did not vote, making the Dem vote 54-0-(2).Judd Gregg (R-NH, retiring) had not voted on cloture, but did vote to ratify.Jim Bunning (R-Ky, retiring) had voted against cloture, but did not vote on ratification.(Net +1 Republican vote for ratification; -1 against).Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) had voted against cloture, but voted for ratification.13 Republican Senators voting to ratify:4 New England:Maine: Olympia Snowe & Susan CollinsN.H.: Judd Gregg, retiring  had not voted on clotureMass.: Scott Brown3 Middle West:Ohio: George Voinovich, retiringInd.: Richard LugarNeb.: Mike Johanns  had voted against cloture4 South:Tenn: Bob Corker & Lamar AlexanderGa: Johnny IsaksonMiss: Thad Cochran2 West:Utah: Bob Bennett (defeated in 2010 GOP primary; did not run in general election)Alas.: Lisa Murkowski (defeated in 2010 GOP primary; won re-election as a write-in)***Republican vote by region:4  _0  (0) Northeast (all New England)3  _4  (1) Middle West [nays: Kirk, Ill; Grassley, Iowa; Roberts, Ks; & Thune, SD]4  14  (2) South & Border (inc.

[This would probably differ had this been the next Congress, where Republicans will replace Byron Dorgan of N.D. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Evan Bayh of Ind. and Arlen Spector of Pa.] To look at it another way, compare the anti-repeal Senators with the 26 Senators and 3 Territorial Delegates in the Second Confederate Congress (1864-65), including Kentucky, Missouri, the Indian tribes of Oklahoma and the Confederate Arizona Territory (southern Ariz. & N.M.) but not West Virginia (except through the Senators from Virginia), Maryland or Delaware. The same area is now represented (in whole or in part not counting W.Va) by 32 U.S. Senators.From these take away both Senators from Virginia (2D), North Carolina (D & R), Arkansas (2D) and New Mexico (2D), plus one Senator each from Missouri (Claire McCaskill, D), Florida (Bill Nelson, D), and Louisiana (Mary Landrieu, D), as well as one non-voting Senator from Kentucky (Jim Bunning, R, retiring). That leaves 20.Add one Senator from Utah (the retiring Bob Bennett, R; Orrin Hatch didnt vote), both Senators from Idaho (2R), Wyoming (2R) & Kansas (2R) and one Republican Senator each from South Dakota (John Thune), Nebraska (Mike Johanns), Iowa (Grassley) & Indiana (Lugar). Thats 31.Those are the only votes against repealing Dont Ask/Dont Tell. With the exception of Richard Lugar, theyre all from the Confederacy or the inland states of the Great Plains and Mormon Belt of the Rockies.
