Here is how this true story began in Houston, Texas. Horseback riding lessons were being given to my niece ( my Mother's grand-daughter ) and while my Mother was sitting at the stables one day waiting for the lesson to end, this big eyed little cat approached her and walked right up to my Mother with pleading eyes. Other young adults were there visiting and awaiting the time for the horseback riding lessons to end so that they could take their children and return home. This  cat  did not approach them!   It seemingly knew which person might be willing to help. Its belly seemed bloated and yet the young cat seemed thin in other areas. It was obviously pregnant and in need of help.   See all 19 photosAngie and her 5 kittens * Photo by Peggy WPleading eyes My Mother was haunted by those pleading eyes and could not sleep well that night. She made up her mind that if the cat was there the next day, she would do something about it.Upon returning to the stables she was told that many kittens and cats are indeed dumped there and that this was just one of the latest arrivals. The pregnant cat presented herself to my Mother again that day and the furry waif's life was about to take a dramatic change for the better within the next few hours.

When my niece's lesson was finished, they put the pregnant cat in the case and stopped at the veternarian's office on the way home. Upon examination, they were informed that the cat was only about seven months old and that birth was probably imminent. Oh yes! That latter diagnosis was indeed correct!   In the car...on the way home...the first births began taking place!  I was summoned to come and help ( after all...I WAS a Registered Nurse!    ) and although my field of expertise never included deliveries...I did know enough to help with the births of that young and inexperienced cat's five new little kittens.  Photo by Peggy WAngie's kittens * Photo by Peggy WInstant Motherhood  While no one was quite prepared for this instant motherhood and all that it entailed, everyone did their best. This included thehalf-grown kitten...nowa new mother cat...and my Mother's household which included another cat ( Taffy ), a dog ( Missy ), and my niece who was the recipient of the horseback riding lessons. An empty boxwasquickly outfitted with some newspapers and extra padding of an old rug and our large dog crate was transported over to my Mother's home and set upto contain and protect the new lives that had come upon the scene so unexpectedly.   Photo by Peggy WAngie's nameThis little half grown blonde and white kitten that so valiantly tried to seek shelter and help and then upon finding herself to be a new mother completed her tasks so well that she deserved a good name.Angel came to mind and the compromise chosen by my Mother was the name of Angie.Taffy, the older cat that was already a part of the household seemed totally unimpressed by all of this action. She pretty much ignored all of the hubbub and commotion and went about her usual activities of eating, sleeping and expecting to be petted and brushed.Missy, the dog, was more interested! She was sweet and once she sniffed the new furry critters, she assumed a watchful and protective mode. Taffy thinking to herself...What is all this nonsense?  * Photo by Peggy WMissy examining one of the new arrivals * Photo by Peggy WOh what fun! * Photo by Peggy WKittens  A kitten ideally needs the nourishment from its mother's milk for a minimum of 6 weeks or longer to get all the health benefits associated before being given away to other homes. Imprinting of other cat-like behavior takes place in these first few weeks to months of kitten's lives that will carry on through the rest of their lives and possibly into other generations. Thus my Mother knew that she had accepted being the host to much added commotion to the normal routines of operating her home. It was also fun!  Kittens and all of their playful antics provide much entertainment and many smiles throughout the day. Babies of all kinds, for that matter, are cute. It is amazing to watch kittens as their natural curiosity leads them to exploring further afield from their mother's warm and comforting embrace.  Can't I get a little privacy?  * Photo by Peggy WAngie Angie, while she might look big in these pictures compared to her 5 kittens, was not only very young, but was a diminuative sized cat and remained so throughout her life.My Mother was hoping to find good homes for not only the kittens but Angie as well.This was not to be.While all of the kittens were eventually adopted into good homes...our vet actually adopting 2 of them...no one wanted the half grown cat.By the time all of this had transpired, my Mother could not think of abandoning Angie to a shelter in hopes that she would be adopted. So Angie became a permanent part of the family!  Litter?

Moccasins and everything else that was on the floor became something to explore and became a possible toy or obstacle course. Keep in mind...Angie while not nursing or otherwise attending her kittens...was also exploring the house. Everything in it...including the people...were all new to her as well.   2 empty moccasins...perfect for 2 exploring kittens!  * Photo by Peggy WToysIn order to keep the growing kittens amused my Mother provided all kinds of toys. Of course almost anything becomes a toy to a curious kitten.Knowing that they like to climb and exercise their claws, a cat tower ( kitten sized ) was built by a friendly neighbor man who had the tools necessary with which to construct it.This became a less expensive option than purchasing one at a pet store and the kittens made good use of it while they lived at that address.Angie and Taffy ( my Mother's other cat, who by-the-way, had also been a stray ) did not seem enamored with the carpeted tower. So after it was no longer in daily use, the cat toy was donated so that other cats or kittens could enjoy using it.

What this ultimately means is that they endure starvation and suffering on the streets with most often untimely deaths.Those that make it into the many animal shelters are at least cared for while there. They are examined by vets, tended to as necessary and are provided food and water along with a safe environment. While this is much better than trying to survive on the streets, and many find loving homes, way too many others are humanely euthanized. Each and every one of us can do our part to prevent this outcome. Become informed! Help to spread the word that spaying and neutering one's  pets  not only makes for a healthier pet, but can prevent the needless suffering and killing of so many other animals. What would have happened to Angie and her kittens had my Mother not come along to rescue her? She could have been trampled underfoot by one of the many horses at the stables. She was starving and could hardly have provided enough good nourishment for her kittens that were about to be born. Fleas and other insects not to mention other predators would have made their lives miserable if not ending them in a short and probable painful manner.If you are a pet owner, do the responsible thing and have your pets spayed and / or neutered. For people with little money, there are charitable organizations who offer such services at little or no expense. Check it out!

My MotherThis hub is not only about how Angie came to live with my Mother gracing her home for many years with her loving ways, but it is also a tribute to my sweet and kind Mother who cared for many animals throughout her life.Some of them were her own pets and others were simply animals that she found injured or lost.In many instances she paid for veterinary bills for those other animals. Some were so injured or ill that they had to be euthanized. I accompanied her on several of those visits and shed tears for those hapless creatures whose names were unknown to us and had no forms of identification on them. If there was indeed an owner out there...their dog or cat had some people who truly cared for them as best they could at the end of that animal's life. And if they had been abandoned, at least they got some loving if ever so briefly before they died.In other cases, my Mother sheltered animals that were found until the real owners could be found or until alternate homes could be located.Pet owners...PLEASE put identification on your animals so that IF they get lost, there is some means to be able to return them into your loving arms. Hopefully you found this hub, "My Mother rescued Angie the Cat" to your liking. Any and all animals that made their way into my parent's homes were fortunate indeed!Are you a responsible pet owner? I have my pets spayed and neutered I keep ID on my pets I have regular check-ups performed by vets I shelter them from excessive heat or cold They are fed and offered plenty of fresh water They are appropriately exercised They are groomed regularly All of the above plus they get lots of love and affection!See results without votingSampling of other hubs by Peggy W...Dog - Rescue - Role of - My Mother - Pomeranian - SkippyThis is the story of the role of the part my mother played in a dog rescue story pertaining to a cute little pomeranian named Skippy.

My Mother had such a soft spot in her heart for this little waif of a pregnant kitten who made it into her home as a permanent resident.  Thanks for the swift response to this newly minted hub.valeriebelew7 months ago Hello Peggy W.  I very much enjoyed this hub.  My mother fed a ferral cat in our neighborhood until Mama passed away a few years back, and I fed the cat after she was gone.  I live with four dogs and three cats, the subject matter of many of my hubs.  When you responded to the Fluffy, the cat, hub, I knew your posts would be worth reading.  The kittens were gorgeous.  At one time I bred Himalyan Persian cats, but Ms. Frances is now spayed along with her son, Michael.  Fluffy was an adopted mixed breed, who has been my cat for almost seven years now.  (: vHello, hello,7 months ago Thank youPeggy, for sharing your and your mother's home life with us.  I love cats.agusfanani7 months ago Very beautiful cat and kittens, especially the kittens are so adorable.Micky Dee7 months ago I love kittens! Thanks Peggy! Great pictures and a happy tale!epigramman7 months ago greatest story ever told (and pictures too) so says my two furried children: Little Miss Tiffy and Mister Gabriel.dahoglund7 months ago Hi Peggy WIt's good that you were able to help the cats.These are hard times even for pets. Many people are unable to afford their pets anymore, or have to move and cannot take the pets with them. I've experienced that myself in the past. Since we are looking for a dog now (sorry, I'm not a cat person)we  have been visiting animal shelters. Many animals have simple been abandoned somewhere. In Adams, Wisconsin (about 25 miles south of Rapids)we were told that they had to rescue many animals from what they call "hoarders". The people, with kids, were living in a trailer with several kids and had dogs, cats, horses and what all in and out of the trailer. All were underfed, including the children.My wife was interested in a Husky which was very shy of people, because it looks so much like the Husky crossbred we had to put down. As we are getting oldeer and less active I want to get a smaller dog that doesn't shed so much, but it is a beautiful dog.reddog10277 months ago God bless your mother, Peggy.  If everyone was this kind, the world would surely be a better place.billyaustindillon7 months ago Peggy another great hub - what a great tale of your mother and cat-  the pictures tell a thousand words also.Enelle Lamb7 months ago What a great hub Peggy! I will be including a link to this hub on my Cat Tails blog :DPeggy W7 months ago Hello valeriebelew,Like your mother, we also took care of a ferel cat for all the years of her life after she delivered kittens in the shrubbery in front of our house.  Ah...but that could be another hub!  Thank you for doing your part in spaying and neutering your beloved pets.  Sounds as though you really enjoy them.  Thanks for the comment.Peggy W7 months ago Hi Hello, hello,Like you, we also like cats and we also like dogs.  My parents usually had both as I was growing up and we presently have my mother's dog, Skippy, and our two cats to keep us company.  Enjoy your furry creatures!Peggy W7 months ago Hello agusfanani,Yes, I would agree that Angie's kittens were really cute.  We saw pictures of the two that the vet took when they were older...the blonde and calico kittens...and they turned out to be beautiful full grown cats as well.  Thanks for the visit.Peggy W7 months ago Hi Micky D,Glad to hear that you liked this story about my Mother rescuing Angie the Cat and her almost immediately delivered kittens as well.  It was a busy episode in her life for several months...and then, since she kept Angie, she had another beloved pet for many years.  Angie was always shy around people unlike my Mother's other cat who begged to be brushed and petted.Peggy W7 months ago Hello epigramman,Give Little Miss Tiffy and Mister Gabriel a pat for me.  Glad to hear that you liked the story of my mother rescuing Angie and that you also enjoyed the pictures.  Thanks!Peggy W7 months ago Hi dahoglund,Hopefully you will find just the right companion for you and your wife in one of those animal shelters.  If not this week...keep checking.  The right one will appear one of these days!  Those "hoarders" obviously have a mental condition.  Even the children were underfed as well as the animals.  Very, very sad!Peggy W7 months ago Hello reddog1027,My mother was really a special person and I agree with you that if we had more people like her in this world, it would DEFINITELY become a better place.  Thanks for the sweet comment.Peggy W7 months ago Hi billyaustindillon,Glad you appreciated the pictures as well as hearing the story of just how my mother was instrumental in helping to save Angie and her kittens.

My sister and her husband often take in stray cats and provide a loving home for them.  They currently have six cats who are very happy to be safe and loved.Your photos were terrific.

Really you have given new picture about true love. Thank u for sharing lovely kittens and the cat.Peggy W7 months ago Hi sarovai,Thanks for the visit and comment about My Mother rescuing Angie the Cat.  Appreciated your comment about "true love."Garlic Angel7 months ago Oh Peggy I am so sad after reading that yet so happy also. Credit to your Mother for taking all those aniamals in. She is a very kind soul..The reason I say I am sad is that my cat, Lady, only 8 days ago went missing. Now to make a long story short, Lady, WAS, my cat for the first 3 years of her life. Due to circumstances behond my control, my older sister was very kind and gave Lady a Great home for the next 14years.. Up untill 8 days ago when she just disappeared. She was very old and never left the house but 8 days ago for some reason she did !! Now we have read up on this a lot since she went missing and we now believe that she went off herself to 'go in peace' We donn't know. We have lots of people looking out for her but it is not looking hopeful.. I just hope that wherever she may be she is happy...Thank you for a beautiful article and God Bless Garlic Angel :-)Peggy W7 months ago Hello Garlic Angel,Happy to hear that you liked this true story about my Mother rescuing Angie...and ultimately her kittens.  At the same time I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your Lady.  Many times cats (if they are able) go off to die.  If that is what happened, think of her in animal heaven and cling to those happy memories you had with her.  Bless you!MaryRenee7 months ago Peggy, this is such a beautiful hub! God Bless your mother, if only everyone would do things like this :)Peggy W7 months ago Hello MaryRenee,I agree with you and I KNOW just how special my Mother was.  I miss her!  Thanks for the thoughtful comment.katyzzz7 months ago Peggy show me a cat and I'm undone, but two cats and five kittens, I'm completely undone, but show me your mum and my heart goes to Heaven to say hello to my mum.I, too, take on the lost and lonely, and all too often hungry.I don't drink but how about a nice hot cup of tea to you and your mum, and those delghtful animals, dog included.Well donePeggy W7 months ago Hi katyzzz,What a sweet comment about my mother, Angie, her kittens and my mother's other cat and dog.  My mother is now in heaven along with your mum.So happy to hear that you are also one of those kind hearted souls that rescues animals.  We do also.  In fact most all of our animals have always (in most cases) been rescued ones.Marijana Reynders6 months ago What a lovely tribute Peggy to your darling mom and Angie.   Your mom left you a wonderful legacy of love and care, her love of animals a gift to mankind.  What happened to Angie?  I could identify so well with this hub as I am a devote almost obsessive cat lover and we not only had kittens born in our house (mom 'fixed' afterwards, she was a stray), and we adopted her and all her children.  Watching them in training and the strict discipline enforced by the mom taught us more about parenting than any self-help book on the subject.  And the photographs are beautiful, the most adorable little faced ever.  We do not have problem pets, we have problem owners - responsible pet ownership is vital, in all respects.  Thanks Peggy ...Peggy W6 months ago Hi Marijana,Yes, my mother loved animals all her life and saved many of them.  Angie continued to live out her natural life in my mother's home.My husband and I just took a stray puppy in to our local animal shelter today...discovered it on our walk.  Have plastered the neighborhood with signs.  Hopefully an owner will contact us soon and the little guy was not just dumped.  Even if the latter, being a black lab mix puppy, he would have an excellent chance at being adopted.If ONLY people would put ID on their animals!  As you say, responsible pet ownership is vital.  Thanks for doing your part.Sally's Trove6 months ago Peggy, I had such a smile on my face as I read this Hub, and this smile is not leaving me now. This is one of the most wonderful Hubs I have ever read on HP for so many reasons. Three are that it's beautifully written, tells a compelling story, and engages the reader in a powerful emotional way.Beyond those words of mine to you, I'm kind of speechless. Thank you for putting all of this into words and pictures that make for an experience I will never forget.Peggy W6 months ago Hi Sally,And now you have provided me with smiles with this nice comment.  So glad that you liked this true story about how my dear mother rescued Angie the Cat.  Thanks!Angelllite6 months ago Love the pictures, especially the one where the kittens are all looking at the camera at the same time, in shoes, drinking milk and mom is holding.  Oh! all of them. (member of Plumsted township's Trap-Neuter-Return for feral cats)Peggy W6 months ago Greetings Angelllite,Very happy to hear that you are helping feral cats in the way that you are doing it.  We had a feral cat deliver kittens in our shrubbery and we had her spayed after finding homes for all of the kittens.  She then lived in our garage and yard the rest of her life.  May write a hub about her someday.  She remained wild but counted on us for food and shelter, heat in the winter, etc.  Glad you enjoyed this hub about my mother rescuing Angie and her kittens.  Thanks for the comment.explorer93606 months ago Love this article. I also picked up an unwanted dog, poor thing was starving and no one seemed to like her cause she's not a pure breed, so she was being passed from owner to owner. Took her months to get over her fear of being sent away (she would pee with fear every time the friend I got her from would come over, obviously thinking she's going to be taken away - she was only with him a few hours and he didn't hit her, so there is no other reason I can think of). Now she's normal and loving. Plus, she's turned out to be a very intelligent dog (almost a year old now).Peggy W6 months ago Hello explorer9360,Thanks for being so kind hearted to that dog who is now blessing you with her love and affection.  We need more good souls in the world who take in strays or do their part to help them like my mother did with Angie the cat.  My husband and I recently took a black lab puppy to a good animal shelter and then put up many signs in the neighborhood.  Alas...no calls...so he was probably purposely dumped.  So sad to think that people do that!  At least that puppy will now be fed and kept in a cool environment and have a good chance at being adopted.Baileybear6 months ago what beautiful kittens - cats are my favourite animals. We adopted our cat and dog from an animal shelter.Peggy W6 months ago Hello Baileybear,So very nice that you got your cat and dog from an animal shelter.  No better place to look for animals!  Angie's kittens were darling and my mother was wonderful for how she helped this little family which probably would not have survived without her intervention and help.  She was such a kind hearted soul for both animals and people!  Thanks for reading and leaving your comment.Monika Rumin6 weeks ago Beautiful hub, lovely pictures, I always loved kittens :)Peggy W6 weeks ago Hello Monika Rumin,Happy to hear that you liked this hub about my mother and Angie the Cat.
