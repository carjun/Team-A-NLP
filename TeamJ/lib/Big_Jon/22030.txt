Examination of detailed statistics for US waters, where, also very small spills were included, produced the diagrams presented in Fig. 1. According to these data, 85% (in volume) of the spills in US waters from shipping were oil spills. The remainder of the spills were evenly distributed among the categories chemical spills, nonliquid chemical spills and other spills. Hence, it is argued that the oil spills are the dominating spills into the sea from shipping activities, at least in terms of volume. When also other sources of anthropogenic spill are considered (e.g. from land-based and offshore activities, pipelines, aircrafts, etc.), oil spills represent about 25% of the total amount of spills into US waters" Archive copy http://202.114.89.60/resource/pdf/1151.pdfGoogle timelineHistory of Major Oil Spills NYT, establish contextHistory of the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry in Southern Louisiana good summary & great refs to track downGreat source: Congressional Research Service Reports at National Library for the EnvironmentRL33705 - Oil Spills in U.S. Coastal Waters: Background, Governance, and Issues for CongressRS22928 - Oil Development of Federal Lands and the Outer Continental ShelfToday: 2010-06-17 - work into different article Udall, Shaheen introduce companion oil spill prevention, cleanup billsUdalls Safer Oil and Gas Production Research and Development Act ... would fund the development of cements that are more flexible, set quicker and can withstand higher pressures than cement currently used in deepwater drilling.

"A blowout on an oil rig occurs when some combination of pressurized natural gas, oil, mud, and water escapes from a well, shoots up the drill pipe to the surface, expands and ignites.

Though crude oil is predominantly composed of various hydrocarbons, certain nitrogen heterocylic compounds, such as pyridine, picoline, and quinoline are reported as contaminants associated with crude oil, as well as facilities processing oil shale or coal, and have also been found at legacy wood treatment sites. These compounds have a very high water solubility, and thus tend to dissolve and move with water. Certain naturally occurring bacteria, such as Micrococcus, Arthrobacter, and Rhodococcus and have been shown to degrade these contaminants. [9]...2.

For instance, a study of 600 major equipment failures in offshore drilling structures done by Robert Bea, an engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley, found that 80 percent were due to human and organizational factors, and 50 percent of those due to flaws in the engineering design of equipment or processes."[12]Numbers don't add up, but great expert -- what does he mean?

Legend: Underway Mode: Master is in charge. Drilling mode: Offshore installation manager (OIM) is in ChargeIn hearings before the Joint Investigation[2] of the Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Coast Guard investigating the causes of the explosion, chief surveyor John David Forsyth of the American Bureau of Shipping testified that his agency last inspected the rig's failed blowout preventer in 2005.[3] The chief mechanic on the rig, Doug Brown, testified that the BP "company man" (the top decision-maker on a rig) overruled Transocean employees and insisted on displacing protective drilling mud with seawater, just hours before the explosion, stating, "the company man said, 'Well, this is how it's gonna be,' and the tool-pusher, driller and OIM (offshore installation manager) reluctantly agreed."[4]"The driller was outlining what would be taking place, whereupon the company man stood up and said, 'No, we'll be having some changes to that.' It had to do with displacing the riser for later on. The OIM, tool-pusher and driller disagreed with that, but the company man said, 'Well, this is how it's gonna be,' and the tool-pusher, driller and OIM reluctantly agreed."Doug Brown, [5]One of the BP company men on board responsible for making the final decisons, Robert Kaluza, refused to testify on the Fifth Amendment grounds that he might incriminate himself; Donald Vidrine, another BP company man, cited medical reasons for his inability to testify, as did James Mansfield, Transocean's assistant marine engineer on board.

The plan stated that it was "unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities".[13] In the event an accident did take place the plan stated that due to the well being 48miles (77 km) from shore and the response capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse impacts would be expected.[13] The Department of the Interior exempted BP's Gulf of Mexico drilling operation from a detailed environmental impact study after concluding that a massive oil spill was unlikely.[14][15]February 15, 2010 - Deepwater Horizon begins drilling in water depth of approximately 5,000feet (1,500 m) in the Mississippi Canyon Block 252, referred to as the Macondo Prospect, in the United States sector of the Gulf of Mexico, about 41miles (66 km) off the Louisiana coast.[16][17][18] The platform commenced drilling in February 2010 at a water depth of approximately 5,000feet (1,500 m).[19] The planned well was to be drilled to 18,000feet (5,500 m) below sea level, and was to be plugged and suspended for subsequent completion as a subsea producer.[19][19] The planned well was to be drilled to 18,000feet (5,500 m) below sea level, and was to be plugged and suspended for subsequent completion as a subsea producer.[19]March - An accident damages a gasket on the blow out preventer on the rig[20]April 20 - BP official gather on the platform to celebrate seven years without an injury on the rig[21]April 20 9:45 p.m. CDT - Deepwater Horizon] catches fire.

Booms set up to keep oil from washing ashore.April 27 - Slick grows to 100 miles across and 20 miles from Louisiana coast.April 28, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated that the leak was likely 5,000barrels (210,000US gallons; 790,000 litres) a day, five times larger than initially estimated by BP.[24][25]BP announces contolled test to burn oil off the surface was successful. Oil is 20 miles east of the mouth of the Mississippi River.April 29 - Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declares a state of emergency. 100,000feet (30 km) of containment booms were deployed along the coast.[26] By the next day, this nearly doubled to 180,000feet (55 km) of deployed booms, with an additional 300,000feet (91 km) staged or being deployed.[27] On May 2, high winds and rough waves rendered oil-catching booms largely ineffective.[28]April 30 - Oil washes ashore at Venice, Louisiana. President Barack Obama halts new offshore drilling unless safeguards are in place.May 2 - Obama meets with fishermen and Coast Guard in Venice. Oil discovered in the South Pass.May 3 - BP says it will pay clean up costs. Fishing areas remain closed.May 4 - BP proposes a containment dome.May 5 - BP announced that the smallest of three known leaks had been capped. This did not reduce the amount of oil flowing out, but it did allow the repair group to focus their efforts on the two remaining leaks.[29]May 6 - Oil sheen discovered in south end of Chandeleur ChainMay 7 - A 125-tonne (280,000 lb) container dome is lowered over the largest of the well leaks and pipe the oil to a storage vessel on the surface.[30].

It is initially dislodged when a underwater robot collides with the pipe.May 16 - A new tube is inserted into the pipe and some oil is pumped to another surface ship. Collection rates varied daily between 1,000 and 5,000 barrels (42,000 and 210,000 US gallons; 160,000 and 790,000 litres), the average being 2,000barrels (84,000US gallons; 320,000 litres) a day, as of May 21.[34][35] Work starts on second relief well.May 17 - BP begins burning off gas with the Discoverer Enterprise.

In a regulatory filing, BP claims to have spent a total of $930 million.[38]May 29 - BP declares Top Kill is a failure. May 29 BP moved on to their next contingency option, the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) Cap Containment System. The operational plan first involves cutting and then removing the damaged riser from the top of the failed Blow-Out Preventer (BOP) to leave a cleanly-cut pipe at the top of the BOPs LMRP. The cap is designed to be connected to a riser from the Discoverer Enterprise drillship and placed over the LMRP with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well. During the cutting of the pipe, the diamond blade saw became stuck but was eventually freed later. BP had to use shears instead and the cut is "ragged",[39][40][41] [42] meaning the cap will be harder to fit.[43]May 31 - BP announces plan to slice the leaking pipe, placing a cap on it and channelling the oil to surface shipsJune 2 - Oil spotted nine miles from Pensacola, Florida beachesJune 3 -[edit] References^ "The Ongoing Administration-Wide Response to the Deepwater BP Oil Spill" (press release).
