The census was the basis of a voter registration process, which was also used for the national elections in 2010, which in turn set the stage for the referendum. The census was delayed three times. Problems included disagreements between the north and south over what they are obliged to do by the Naivasha Agreement, funding difficulties and an enormous logistical challenge. In the south, unmapped minefields from the war continue to make movement difficult, while up to five million Sudanese are nomadic. Up to two million internally displaced persons from the south remain in camps around Khartoum, in the center of the country, while refugees remain in Uganda and Kenya. A further complication results from the conflict in Darfur to the west, where civilians who have fled attacks refuse to take part in census out of fear that the government would use the results against them. Darfuri rebel groups are unanimous in their denunciation of the planned census, while the Justice and Equality Movement group has threatened to attack any census-taker.[5]There were disagreements between the National Congress Party (NCP) and the SPLA/M about what proportion of voters will have to be in favour of independence (the NCP wanted at least 75% support required), whether Southern Sudanese living in the north should be allowed to vote, and the post-referendum separation process (including the division of the national debt).[6] Modest progress was made in early September 2010, but disagreements on fundamental points remain.[7]It is envisaged that "popular consultations" in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, without a clear reference to referenda and/or independence, would raise concerns about the future of these regions.[8][9]In October 2009, the central government of Sudan and the South Sudanese government agreed that turnout would have to be at least 60% of 3.8 million voters would be necessary to validate the referendum. In this case, a simple majority vote in favour of independence will result in secession for South Sudan.[10][11] This was also the terms of the CPA.[12]The proposed date for the referendum is 9 January 2011; should the turnout be insufficient in the first referendum, a second one will be held within sixty days.[13]CampaignThe flag of the Government of Southern SudanSudan's President Omar al-Bashir said that the south part had a right to choose to secede and that the referendum was helpful because unity "could not be forced by power." He also said he would respect the outcome of the vote and support the south.[14] However, he also said that though secession was a right it may not resolve issues for the south: "The stability of the south is very important to us because any instability in the south will have an impact on the north. If there is a war in your neighbour's house, you will not be at peace. The south suffers from many problems. It's been at war since 1959. The south does not have the ability to provide for its citizens or create a state or authority."On 8 January, the mood in Juba, the southern capital, and the wider region was said to be jubilant with final pro-secession rallies celebrating independence in advance.[12]IssuesMany of those who fled the south during the civil war started to return, with some southern politicians trying to have them play a role in swinging the vote towards Southern Sudanese independence.[15] The steadying stream south continued in the days and weeks leading up to the election.[16] Many of those returning were too late to register for the election.[17]OilObservers and key players fear violence ahead of the South Sudan referendum because of a variety of reasons. Firstly a fight for limited resources, primarily oil, exists. The North will likely resist the South splitting away, for fear that it will lose territory and oil, most of which will lie  as far as the North is concerned  on the wrong side of any new border that's created.[18] The majority of armed fighters are not the ones whose pockets are lined by oil revenue. For these individuals, boosting the nations economy is no motivation to stop the violence. According to a December 3rd article published by the London-based magazine Al-Majalla, Warring groups might respond to the urging of their political leader. In support of the economic rationale for peace, a report co-launched by the Institute for International Security explains that if both sides attain and sustain peace, it will bring in more profits for the country and encourage investors.[19] But if Sudan falls into further civil warring, it could cost $100 billion, a price Sudan cannot afford and the international community doesnt want to pay.[19]Given the oil disputes, groups advocating for pro-unity between North and South fear that a split between the two regions will ignite a civil war. A staggering 80% of the identified oil reserves are located in the South of the country. Oil has been behind the country's strong recent growth. According to the International Monetary Fund, Sudan's gross domestic product has nearly tripled since Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir took power in 1989. Oil exports over the past decade have propelled the nation's "longest and strongest growth episode since independence" in 1956, a World Bank report said. The north has grown dependent on the oil from the south and if the south secedes, the north stands to lose billions of dollars yearly.[20] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described tensions in Sudan between the North and the South as a "ticking time bomb of enormous consequence."[21]Sudanese industry minister Awad Al-Jaz and a member of the Northern Sudanese government said that North-South separation "cannot be allowed under any circumstances. He indicated that "The peace agreement gave the South 50% of the oil revenue for development, salaries and progress and what the government of national unity (GoNU) done in the South in development in areas of roads, bridges, dams, electricity to help Southerners in development to support the attractive unity.[22]Those advocating for an independent South are confident that the oil distribution will not pose as a cause for future conflict. In a December 9 2010 issue of Global Crisis news, it was noted that in an effort to calm the Norths fears, the President in the South Salva Kiir, declared at the commemoration of the 5th anniversary of the signing of the CPA:Before appropriate oil infrastructure is developed in southern Sudan, the oil produced in Southern Sudan will continue to flow from the south to north for processing and export.[23]Additionally, Southern Sudan's Minister of Internal Affairs, Maj. Gen. Gier Chuang Aluong, said that the oil facilities will be guarded by a joint north-south military unit by southern police and security agent, avoiding any clashes that may occur.[24] As the report authors at Frontier Economics acknowledge, measuring the cost of future conflict isn't actually a science and the southerners are probably counting on this - they are so optimistic about a positive outcome that leaders have already planned for three new oil refineries in the new country.[25]The Sudanese government said in December 2010 that it was ready to give up its share of the oil wealth if the South votes against independence.[26]Tribal differencesThe fear of violence post-separation also stems from the historical make-up of the tribal demographics of the Southern Sudan region. The post-independence period  when the common denominator of self-determination is gone  could be marked by significant infighting and increased conflict on tribal lines, Zachary Vertin from the International Crisis Group think-tank said.[27]Sudan watchers fear that without the unifying goal of an independent south to fight for, discontent may grow over the governments poor provision of basic services, corruption and bad behavior by the souths ill-trained army.[28]Tribal differences account for some, an enormous factor for violence if the January vote results in an independent South. South Sudan is ..crisscrossed by a web of competing ethnicities and clans whose hostility toward one another manifests itself in tribal clashes and deadly cattle raids.[29] Thousands of South Sudanese have died over the past two years in bloody internal conflicts. Additionally Southern Sudans Vice President and the ruling head of the Southern government (SPLM) Silva Kiir faces the issue of internal clashes after April 2010s election for VP. One former general who lost his bid to run a powerful governorship launched his own miniature rebellion against the state. He has since been joined by two other disgruntled dissidents, each skirmishing with South Sudan's army, which has yet to successfully squelch the uprisings. The fear is that, in a place where war has become a way of life and guns seem as plentiful as people, still more violence could follow.[29]In an 30 August interview, Sudans Minister of petroleum Lual Achuil Deng, a Southerner, was interviewed by Arabic newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat and stated that during a visit to the U.S., it seemed that the Americans would prefer the continuation of a united Sudan. I believe that is the case because, according to their interpretation of American national security and strategic interests, a separate South would not be a viable state. It would face many internal problems; and would endanger the unity and stability of neighboring countries; in the overall region of the Horn of Africa, to the east of Sudan, and the region of Equatorial Africa, to the south of Sudan.[30]The pro-South Sudan independence newsletter South Sudan Nation notes that the tribal differences are no cause for alarm and not unique within the African continent. In reality, all the imperfections that South Sudan hastribalism, nepotism, cronyism, mismanagement of the national resources, cattle rustling, tribal wars, civil wars, visionary-less leaders to mention but just a feware all the trademarks of each and every country on Africa continenteven in the event that future South Sudan were to collapse into tribal anarchy akin to Somalia or DRC Congo or that the tribal wars degenerate into genocide, it would still be no sufficient ground to regret secession from the North.[31]Southern Muslims said that they were seeking independence along with their fellow southerners because of "racism and tribalism" as an inability to build unity.[32] Some were opposed to "Arabisation,"[33][34][35] while others were motivated by their alleged mistreatment as "slaves" by Arabs.[34][35][36]ReligionReligion was expected to significantly influence the referendum.[37] Christian commentators have noted that there is a "climate of chronic discrimination against Sudanese Christians and other minorities."[38] For some, religion was not the issue,[32] while other southerners objected to alleged "Islamisation."[35][33][34]SecurityThe Sudan People's Liberation Army will likely become Southern Sudan's official military if independence is gained, in which case it will have to transform itself from a guerilla force to a regular army capable of defending the country. In the week before the referendum, the SPLA and a rebel faction led by General George Athor agreed to a ceasefire agreementnearly a year of fighting. The terms would mean an halt to military operations, troop movement and recruitment by either side. The agreement was seen as important for a "peaceful voting environment."[39]DemarcationThe redrawing of the borders, or demarcation poses a significant issue and catalyst for conflict if the South secedes the North. Those living on the demarcation border and internally displaced (IDP) fear that the South split from the North will harden the border, threatening their livelihood and security. "Undecided borders could cause conflicts between nations," Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir said.[27]Demarcation, a significant topic of discussion in light of the South Sudan vote for independence, may lead to further conflict if not addressed appropriately. In a high-level meeting at the United Nations, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi stated that if the demarcation problems are not dealt with, "we will have a breakdown of peace."[40] The 1,200-mile border region between north and south is among the most resource-rich and ethnically diverse areas of Sudan. Predominantly Arab pastoralists from north of the border who journey southward each year to graze their livestock fear that demarcation will prevent their seasonal movement.[41] This issue is rampant in agricultural areas where a failure to successfully address the demarcation issue will create internal conflict among farmers and herders. One of the contested areas encompasses the Heglig oil fields outside the border town of Abyei, where tensions between resident southern Ngok Dinka farmers and northern Misserya pastoralists are particularly high. An Ngok Dinka and former administrator of the Abyei area stated, Heglig belongs to the south. It is in Unity State. However, a general in the Misserya region claimed, "Heglig belongs to Kordofan, to the north. Full stop."[41] The Misseriya, a tribe that migrates each year to the Abyei region looking for pastures for their cattle, have threatened to carry out acts of violence in the region if they are not allowed to vote.Those advocating for a united Sudan, like President Bashirs northern government, agreed of the significance of the demarcation issue. Officials in Northern Sudan have repeatedly said that the work must be done before the vote. The British government says it will help with drawing the border in what may soon be a divided Sudan.[citation needed]AbyeiTalks on resolving the status and of the eligibility criteria for voters in the disputed Abyei region broke down in October 2010, although both the central ruling NCP and southern SPLM said their respective teams "will meet again in Ethiopia toward the end of October to continue their discussions. The parties continue to commit themselves to their mutual goal of avoiding a return to conflict."[42]Didiri Mohammad Ahmad, an NCP official, said it was "not possible" to hold the referendum on the future of Abyei on time, and it could be delayed for months or be settled without a vote. He added that "We agreed that in the next talks we will try to look for other alternatives."[43]Sudans Defense Minister, Abdel-Rahim Mohamed Hussein, suggested the vote may have to be postponed. "According to the reality on the ground...border issues and Abyei must be resolved within the framework of one nation because doing so in the framework of two countries open[s] the door for foreign interference. The referendum is not a goal but a tool to consolidate and promote security and stability. This [UDI] is illegal and will not be recognised by the African Union or the other [organisations] because it would contradict the peace agreement and its procedures."[44] Sudan's UN ambassador Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman told the Security Council that "It is evident that any attempt to conduct the plebiscite before achieving an acceptable settlement between the two parties [in Abyei] will mean only a return to war."[45] The United States said it was working to avoid the "danger" that would follow the failure to hold the referendum.[46]The government Sudan asked the UN for the printing of ballots for the referendum as diplomats and the electoral commission warned of any further delay would miss the deadline to hold the election.[47]Abyei was not finalised for the vote.[48]Bishtina Mohammed El Salam of the Misseriya, who dominate the region along with the Dinka tribe, said he would not accept Abyei's seceding and joining the south even though the latter favoured secession. "If the Dinka take this decision - to annex Abyei to the south - there will be an immediate war without any excuse. We think they should be reasonable and think about it. They should know that those who are pushing them to take that decision will not give them any back-up."[49]Efforts to address issuesEarlier during the referendum process, an Egyptian proposal was made to have a confederation between the north and south of the country. However, President Omar al-Bashir said it was not being considered because the issue of the referendum was about "unity or separation. Our brothers in the south are refusing at the moment the proposal of confederation. If the separation was the result of the referendum, the two sides are going to negotiate over the future of relations between them."[50]Sudanese officials have said throughout their campaigns, regardless of their pro-unity or pro-separatist stance, that the ultimate aim is a peaceful transition for the fragile nation. Vice President Kiir acknowledged his administration had failed to deliver "the dividends of peace, and noted that a campaign to confiscate arms was a solution to maintaining stability.[29]Negotiations continue between the ruling parties in the north and south on potential post-referendum arrangements - looking at future issues such as citizenship, security, finance and wealth sharing. Minister of Petroleum Mr. Deng said he fears that an immediate budget cut for the north would ignite a war. "In order to avoid conflict, we could look to a phase-out arrangement whereby you provide the north some [oil] until they get an alternative.[41] The pipeline to export southern oil currently cuts through the north, and the south has not begun construction on a pipeline that would avoid that route. In an article published by the Washington Post on 21 September 2010, Deng noted that an interim agreement could help both north and south and result in a win-win.National campaigns are being held by both parties to address issues of potential clashes ahead of the referendum. President Al- Bashir wanted to reassure and assuage tension surrounding the issue of citizenship rights in the case of south Sudan secession. He said that even if southerners opted for secession, "the sentimental unity and social relations between north and south Sudan will remain standing." Al-Bashir vowed that the rights of southern citizens staying in the north after secession would be safeguarded, saying that his party would not allow anyone to infringe on the rights of southerners in the north, their properties, freedoms and residence regardless of citizenship.[51]Possible consequencesIn addition to warnings of civil war, it was also read that a possible civil war could involve the Lord's Resistance Army and bring Uganda into the conflict.[52]Polls97 per cent answered in a poll that they are going to vote for independence.[53]ControversyAuthorities in both the north and south of Sudan have been accused of harassment and intimidation against the media in order to avoid dissenting coverage. Rights groups warned the media could be slapped with further restrictions.[54]The Youth and Sports Minister, Haj Majid Suwar, of the National Congress Party (NCP) suggested the government "may not recognise the results" and would "talk to ... the USA and the UN and the AU and say that the Sudan People's Liberation Movement didn't fulfill the CPA Comprehensive Peace Agreement" by allowing open campaigning and the withdrawal of their soldiers from southern areas.[55] He also said that the potential borders between them would have to be drawn up pending redeployment of the SPLM's forces to the 1956 border.[56]Salva Kiir, the president of the southern region and the first vice president of Sudan, said that the referendum's timing was important as there was "a risk of a return to war in case of delay or denial of this exercise, and it would be on a very massive scale."[57] Kuol Deim Kuol, the spokesman for the SPLM's military, accused the NCP of "just looking for a pretext of starting war" and called Suwar a "war monger."[56]Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, accused the SPLM of breaching the terms of the peace deal, and warned of a return to conflict if the disputes were not settled before the referendum. Despite that, he said he was committed to holding the referendum, but insisted on settling differences over the shared border and how to share oil, debt and Nile river water.[58]Many feared a return to civil war, should the referendum fail because of the increasingly heated rhetoric.[59] However, following rifts amongst Southern parties, more than 20 parties ironed over their differences to put a show of unity before the referendum.[60] Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal also said the referendum could "reignite violence...rather than bring peace," while he said the vote must be "fair and free."[61]The United States extended sanction against Sudan on 1 November 2010 in order to pressure the government to stick to the referendum deadline.[62] The US then offered to drop Sudan from an US list of state-sponsors of terrorism if the two referendum were held on time and the results were respected.[63] They again partook in statement before the referendum in lauding al-Bashir's statement to respect the vote.[64]There was also a media campaign to raise awareness and increase the turnout.[65]Following concerns from the UN about delays, representatives of both regions affirmed a commitment to hold the referendum on time.[66]The NCP accused the SPLM of discouraging southerners who were living in the north of the country from registering, as the SPLM threatened not to recognise the referendum if its demands were not met.[67] Southerners in the North were reluctant to vote because of fears of being uprooted from their homes.[68] Muslims in the border provinces of the South also expressed fear of a campaign of violence that could be unleashed as a consequence of the referendum.[69]Along with Chad, Sudan sought to secure the border area ahead of the referendum.[70]Minni Minnawi, the only Sudan Liberation Army faction signatory to the Darfur Peace Agreement, quit the agreement and resigned his post as Special Advisor to the President, saying the deal had failed. He consequently moved to Juba in the south saying the referendum would be successful as southerners "reject the policy of this [Khartoum] government" and the north would then be a "failed state." In return the government declared Minnawi an "enemy" and closed his Khartoum office.[71]In December 2010, the Constitutional Court agreed to carry out an investigation into a petition filed by local lawyers seeking the dissolution of the electoral body that was organising the referendum.[72]ViolenceThe day before the election at least six people were killed in clashes between south Sudan security forces and a pro-Khartoum Sudan militia in Unity state. One person was also killed in clashes between the Misseriya tribe and police in Abyei. The SPLM said the fighting started because a day earlier because of the Misseriya.[73]Conflict resolutionEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi went to Sudan to try to assuage the conflict, though both had previously called for the country to stay united. Egypt's Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the meeting sought to ensure the referendum could be held in a "climate of freedom, transparency and credibility, reflecting the will of the sons of the south" and also that both the South and North could stregnthen bonds.[74]External precedentsQuestions were asked if a positive vote on the referendum would set a precedent for other secessionist movements on the African continent. An Al Jazeera English analysis said a few reasons for seeking secession were: a lack of expertise by post-colonial political elites in governing their respective countries and managing natural resources; the impact of the Cold War where many African countries took sides, rendering sovereignty ineffective; tribal prejudices and preferential service that dominate African politic; failure of governments to provide basic freedoms such as guaranteeing full citizenship for all.Citing these examples, it asked where such a precedent for secession could lead: East Sudan and Darfur, Nigeria, South Africa. As two important members of the African Union the latter two could be reluctant to support a new independent southern Sudan as a recognition thereof could "send a very clear message to these groups in their struggle for autonomy."[75]ElectionRegistration for the vote started on 15 November with Salva Kiir's appeal for registering en masse. Almost four million citizens registered before the deadline on 5 December.[76]Southern Sudanese independence referendum, 2011Yes or noVotesPercentageResult not yet knownTotal votes0%Turnout required60.00%References^ http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=233845^ "Sudan's Referendum Commission says southern Sudan referendum on Jan. 9".
