In California, New York, Michigan and New Jersey, states where public unions wield much power and the culture historically tends to be pro-labor, even longtime liberal political leaders have demanded concessions  wage freezes, benefit cuts and tougher work rulesA white-haired retired undercover police officer, whose wrap-around shades match his black Harley-Davidson jacket, pauses outside the Washington Township municipal building to consider the many targets. He did not want to give his name.Christie has all the good intentions in the world but has he hit the right people? he says. I understand pulling in belts, but you talking about janitors and cops, or the free-loading freeholder?Basic rule: If you want to defend it, you have to be able to explain it. That goes for every side in this argument. The article points out the reality that public employees are in line with private equivalents, but that is not what the public thinks.NY Times editorial:When people say that the recovery does not feel like a recovery, they are describing reality. The economy is growing, but for many Americans life is not getting better. Unemployment remains high. Home values are depressed. And state budgets are in deep trouble, presaging more layoffs, service cuts and tax increases.Nicholas Kristof:John Steinbeck observed that a sad soul can kill you quicker, far quicker, than a germ.hat insight, now confirmed by epidemiological studies, is worth bearing in mind at a time of such polarizing inequality that the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans possess a greater collective net worth than the bottom 90 percent.Theres growing evidence that the toll of our stunning inequality is not just economic but also is a melancholy of the soul. The upshot appears to be high rates of violent crime, high narcotics use, high teenage birthrates and even high rates of heart disease.David Ignatius explains why budget tightening never applies to the Pentagon:What worries me is that even as the military looks forward, the brass is still clamoring to build the legacy systems  think aircraft-carrier battle groups  that will soon be vulnerable to the new weapons. Its as if the Pentagon were trying to be the old IBM, running big, clunky mainframes while trying to be an Apple-like innovator. We cant afford to do both.The puzzle to ponder in 2011 and beyond is how the United States can retain the legacy power benefits that come from conventional fleets and bases around the world while transitioning to the new realities of military power. We dont want to be the national equivalent of a train company at the advent of air travel, or a radio network trying to protect its old programming in the age of television.Thats the spirit. Give the Pentagon unlimited star wars money and default on union pensions.EJ Dionne:I picked up a copy of The Journal, a daily newspaper based in Martinsburg, and turned to their lead editorial headlined: Big Problem: West Virginians gain on the obesity ranking.What struck me is that there was not a hint of politics in the piece  no Michelle Obama or Sarah Palin. It was just a sensible, civic-minded plea to West Virginians to get into shape. The editorial also included some useful tips as to where they could turn for encouragement and advice. Come on, West Virginians, it concluded, its time to get healthy.Lord knows, as I have acknowledged before, I am perfectly capable of politicizing lots of things. But not everything should be politicized. Lets look at problems such as obesity not through the lenses of ideological combat but in the sensible way most Americans do, exemplified by that editorial in The Journal.And, again, warmest wishes for the new year to people across all lines of party and ideology.Happy New Year to Stanford, who beat the UConn women, and heres wishing good weather to those that cant afford the cold.Flu season is kicking up. Heres your very detailedFlu Weeklyfrom CDC. The proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 2.7%, which is above the national baseline of 2.5%. Two of the 10 regions (Regions 2 and 4) reported ILI above region-specific baseline levels; three states and New York City experienced high ILI activity, six states experienced moderate ILI activity, five states experienced low ILI activity, 35 states experienced minimal ILI activity, and data were insufficient from the District of Columbia and two states. The geographic spread of influenza in five states was reported as widespread, Puerto Rico and 13 states reported regional activity; nine states reported local activity; the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 23 states reported sporadic activity, and Guam reported no activity.Get your flu shothere.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media,

2010jamesb10118 commentsWhile driving around in my SUV with my wife yesterdayI heard a session on POTUS XM radio between Joe Mathieu and some guy who had made a good amount of trips to the Afghan war zones..The guy was very informed on what was going on in the war zone.You could tell he wasnt a media person for the cable channels.I loved the session because the guy was giving it straightHe was telling Mathieu what he saw..The truth he went on to say was that the United States was fighting the war the way we do things.BIG.He related how the command center in the war was controlled by a control center in Kabul the size of all most a football fieldWith a grand room straight out NASA or NORAD..With the giant screens and tons of operators and smaller screensHe went on to say even smaller control stations where replicas of the big one..He went on to give an example of how the locals are described as Taliban but really are ANYBODY that might join the fight against the US/NATO forcesThat anybody could be a radical muslim tru believer.A pissed off local who had a family member hurt by collateral damage from a drone strike.Or.Just a kid with nothing to do that picks up a AK-47 and lets off a clipThe reaction would be the same.The whole incident goes from the first report all the way to Kabul and as far as the Special Ops Command in Tampa.The US does things with technology and BIG.And the guy reported that the BIG includes building thingsHe explained that Americans have no concept of how much building is being done in that country for the military.The idea IS.All these things are stakes that cannot and will not be removed anytime soon.If ever.The conversation went on about the speakers visit to some of the outposts.Where he lived and spoke to the front line troops..Here he pointed out the disconnect between being home in the US and being in the fight.Out in the fight there is no concept of quittingThis whole campaign is looked at a slow, long drive to displace the Talibanor whoeverThere is no mention of winning thisAnd I agree.From the grunt in the combat post, to the generals running the war.to the PresidentThe concept of winning the war is simply not there.The goal the guy talking to Mathieus explained is to grab enough ground and disrupt the Taliban and whoever.By doing so.The US?NATO hope to give Karzai or better yet.The afghans a chance to form a strong enough governmentTo try and stand on its own.I have posted here that the general have report back to the Joint Chiefs and therefore the Commander the President that 2011 and 2014 are GOALS for the President to assuage the American people and the media..That the Afghans will ready to walk on their own by then is anyones guess..I have said here for the last few months that I do not believe the US can win.I guess I join the US government in acknowledging this as a fact.I can always get people to jump on my case by saying what this guy has said.The US/NATO arent going anyplace anytime soon.Just as in Iraq where the war HAS stopped.Normalcy is a thing that is far from coming home thereAnd US troops will be there permanentlyAnd so I poise this as the Discussion Question of the Day..Whats your feelings on this people?(Sidebar..When you sign up for the military as thousands of men and woman do EVERY month.You volunteer.You are signing withthefull knowledge that you could be going to a war zone.I do notentertainthe notion that soliders are innocent tothisfact)Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Men, Military, Other Things, Politics,

US Army Combat Studies Institute has released the 274 page report on the Afghan outpost that got overran at the cost of 9 DOAs and 2 dozen wounded.The result of the attack was a shock for commanders.The reports lays blame on the company commanders.NOT theater commanders.. As was originally reportedAnd Technology.The men fought a good fightBut lost comradesThere where oversights in the base set-up and fields of observation.Above allThe lessons learned from the incident should assure that commanders in the field..DO NOT make the same mistakes..*** The final version of theOP Topside and COP Kahler  aka Wanat  ambush report has been completed and released. The 274 page report is chock full of great information and detailed accounts of the action and fallout of the attack which killed nine and wounded more than two dozen.Weve done a lot of coverage here at Defense Tech about this battle and some of its preliminary findings.Wanat Final ReportThe reports authors say sure, there could have been more drone passes and eyes in the sky making sure Talib fighters werent snooping into the wire. But the outposts did have high rez thermal cameras, LRAS3 scopes and a robust SIGINT capability (Prophet?).

Anti-Terror Nat Security Advisor John BrennanThe incident was an embarrassment for Clapper who got quizzed on it in front of cameras by Diane Sawyer, while another National Security Advisor John Brennan The Counterterrorism Advisor ) had to try to cover for him. No one should be surprised by thisThe President has always been advised by the CIA up until a report after the 9/11 incident suggested a National Director for Intelligence.While we have one now.The position has been fraught with misques, bureaucratic infighting, and political and managerial trouble.Clapper signorance of what was going on in the world didnt make things any better for the position which is unneeded in this Dogs opinionThe staff is on loan to the officeIt has no action mission And the CIA, NSA, Military and Homeland Security actually do their thing quite well without Clapper.During the September 11, 2001 most people dont know but..President George Bush couldnt talk readily to the different arms of the US government and Defense Department.He along with the rest of American had to watch TV..Another little know fact is that the Commander-in-Chief knew about the attack minutes before the famous picture of him sitting before the classroom reading to childrenHe thought is was a small airplane..He found out from a staff member who found out from a traveling reporter.NOT from any government source.Last year during President Obamas vacation. A terror plot in Chicago by a lone Nigerian student who tried to blow up NW flight 235 caught White House senior staff out the communications loop..Several of them where themselves on vacation and couldnt be reached readily by their staffs.And the President was at a loss for secure updated information.When the United States President travelsHe is preceded by US Army personnel attached to the White House Communications Office.It is their job to install secure communication assets where ever he goes on the planetThey will work local telephone companies, military links, and State Department links to connect to the White House and Defense DepartmentThey will provide secure and encrypted telephone equipment for the President and senior staff usage ..That includes the ability to talk to the Defense Department s satellite communication links (Milstar, SATCOM)..In a motorcade the White House Communications Office provides a Road Runner SUV to maintain sateliite connections.But in this fast changing communication world that is not enoughFor Obamas trip this time.He has insisted that certain members of his senior National Security staff also have DIRECT access to information sourcesBy passing the White House Communications Office and operators who do a excellent job.In addition, AFTER 9/11..The Air Force was tasked to review and upgrade the links to Air Force One which President George Bush revealed he found lackingSince the reporters knew more that he did.FasterShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Military, UpdatesAir Force One, Communications, President and Commander-in-Chief, Secure Communications, When the President Travels, White House Communications OfficeRead moreUN Maps Show Afghan War Is Being Lost.The Oligarch Kings.December 29, 2010jamesb101No commentsThe two maps featured here are from the United Nations and show the provinces of Afghanistan and the level of threat each represents. The first map is from the earlysummer and second more recently in October. They starkly reveal that the Afghanistan War is being lost though Obama happily assured the American public earlier this month that  the strategy is on track and that troops would start coming home next July, and whilst his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was piping up telling anyone who would listen that We are being clear eyed and realistic [in assessing that the allies are on top of the problem] .There is no suggestion that matters have improved in the last three months.Several parts of Afghanistan previously considered safe and secure have now been upgraded to High Risk. These are: Baghis; Sanagan; Faryab; Laghman and Takhar. They show that the south of the country where the US is making the fiercest push remains stubbornly high risk.The documents which were classed as classified were published by The Wall Street Journal, and republished by The Daily Mail, so I am not expecting their editors to be wheeched off to the dungeons of the State to be charged with treason anytime soon, unlike Assange..More @ The Oligarch Kings.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Media, Military, Politics, UpdatesMaps on the Afghan threat analysis, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, The US/NATO Afghan War, United Nations supplied mapsRead moreRussia to buy two warships from France in major military deal..December 24, 2010jamesb1014 commentsThe Russians continue their turn to the West..While continuing to return to a one power political system ..Unfortunately their defense industries cannot keep with the west..This is a good deal for BOTH countriesFrance and Russia.No comment yet from the White House though..A file picture taken on April 11, 2010 shows the French helicopter carrier Mistral at the harbour in the northern German city of Wilhelmshaven. France and Russia have agreed to build jointly two French Mistral-class command and amphibious assault warships, with the possibility of two more, President Nicolas Sarkozys office said on December 24, 2010.(Focke Strangmann  (AFP/Getty Images)***The multimillion-dollar sale, announced jointly by the Elysee Palace and the Kremlin, marks the first time in modern history that Russia has made such a major defense acquisition abroad, illuminating a fast-evolving relationship with former Cold War enemies. The swift changes were dramatized at last months NATO summit in Lisbon, when President Dmitry Medvedev agreed to work with NATO on ways to cooperate with the U.S.-led alliance in erecting a missile defense system for Europe.The Mistral sale, whose financial terms were not disclosed, also signaled a triumph for French President Nicolas Sarkozys relentless salesmanship and a boost for Frances sagging defense industry and 10 percent unemployment rate. It will, the Elysee declaration noted, provide the equivalent of 5 million hours of work over four years for 1,000 qualified French employes at the STX shipyards at Saint Nazaire on the Atlantic Coast. And it might lead to the purchase of two more vessels.***But the Obama administration has been publicly silent on the sale so far..More..

NORAD tracks Old Saint Nick with four high-tech systems  radar, satellites, Santa Cams and fighter jets  not to mention the help of volunteers anddonations to offset the costs.The program started in 1955, when a Sears Roebuck ad in Colorado Springs, Colo.,misprinted their number in an ad for a Santa hotline. Instead of Santa, calls poured in to the Continental Air Defense Command and its director of operations, Col. Harry Shoup. Shoup answered the phone expecting to speak to someone at the Pentagon. Instead he heard someone asking, Are you really Santa Claus?Rather than say, Sorry, kid, wrong number, he used his tracking equipment to give children the location of Santa Claus.
