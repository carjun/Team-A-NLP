His is a history of those Americans whom most Americans would rather forget, or hide, like unacknowledged relatives, the whores in the family, the bums, drunks and half castes who never get an invite to Christmas or asked to the weddings.Thaddeus Russell takes the status quo of modern histories of America and gives it a damn good kicking.He has the view that those personal freedoms that are taken for granted today, the ones we like to think mark us as western and modern people, were never there from the beginning in the United States. The ruling elite, the Founding Fathers, found the common mans early colonial lifestyle a sink of depravity, venality, vice and freedoms so repulsive and sin ridden that they imposed an order of hard work and town hall democracy as a way to stop them having fun.However, the common man won through and in a series of challenging chapters he seeks to show how these were won back.Russell is one of lifes little provocateurs and a true Devils Advocate..More.

Hirst, chairwoman of the 10-member Workforce Reform Task Force appointed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. The system has been around a long time. Its stodgy. We wanted to find ways to get things moving and make it work better.Several employment experts said Mr. Bloombergs task force was recommending the biggest changes in the states civil service system since it was established in 1883, when Theodore Roosevelt, then a state assemblyman, sponsored a bill that made New York the first state to establish a civil service system. The system aimed to base government hiring on merit and fitness, not on favoritism and patronage.Labor unions were quick to denounce several of the task forces recommendations, many of which would require state legislation. Harry Nespoli, chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, the umbrella group of unions representing city workers, said the recommendations would badly weaken civil service and seniority rules and invite far more favoritism in hiring.It sounds to me that they want to handpick the people who work for the city, said Mr. Nespoli, who is also president of the United Sanitationmens Association. Thats not what civil service is about. Its about equal opportunity where you take an exam to get a civil service job.Although the municipal unions are not scheduled to receive a full briefing on the task force report until Friday, Mr. Nespoli said he was already disposed to fight any legislation needed to put many of the recommendations into effectMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesMunicipal workers contracts, NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg, NYC wants to re-write Civil Service, State Appoval legislation, workforce reform task forceRead moreMore Marines going to Afghanistan..January 6, 2011jamesb101No commentsI have been explaining to anyone that will listen that the war over there is NOT going to stop.Or even wind down for anytime in the future.The Command in country has asked forAnd will get a deployment of an additional 1,400 Marines to help hold in place  gains made by US/NATO troops in the Kanaharregion.This deployment is important in that it should help the Afghan government from having Taliban, bad guns and others from slipping in behind gains made allied troops as they move deeper into Taliban controlled areas.The strategy for the US/NATO troops is to push into those areas to force the Taliban to stop fighting and try to negotiate before they lose their sources of power and income.Look for Obama to do a dance by the end of this year on troop withdrawals.***The United States will send an additional 1,400MarinestoAfghanistan in the next few months to try to solidify progress in areas of the south before troop reductions begin in the summer, a senior military official said on Thursday.The Marines will be sent mostly to Kandahar province, the spiritual home of theTaliban and already an area of intense fighting byU.S. Army troops. American military officials say they have routed the Taliban from crucial areas of the province, but commanders remain under pressure to sustain that progress, as the White House examines whether a troop surge for the nearly decade-old war is working.The whole idea here is to capitalize on gains achieved in the south, cement them throughout the winter and seize the initiative from the enemy, the military official said. Its about leverage and advantage heading into the spring. The official requested anonymity to speak about a troop escalation that had not been officially announced.The plan to send more Marines was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The military official declined to say precisely where in Kandahar the Marines would be sent..MoreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updates1400 Marines, To be deployed to KandaharRead moreTed Williams the homeless guy with the great voice.January 6, 2011jamesb1012 commentsYou have to smile on this one.And just listen to that mans voice.You KNOW hes gonna make some money doing commercial voice oversfor some dough!What a good human interest story.From the NY Daily News.[Ted Williams hugged him mom, Julia, for the first time in 20 years on Thursday.](CBS)The Brooklyn-born panhandler with the golden radio voice embraced his mother for the first time in 20 years Thursday afternoon  after two network news shows made peace and allowed the reunion to happen.A tearful Ted Williams hugged his 90-year-old mother, Julia Williams, as NBCs The Today Show and CBS The Early Show taped the emotional moment, the Columbus Dispatch reported.My prodigal son has finally come home, the overjoyed mother said.The newspaper reported that Williams told his mom that he had straightened out his life and wouldnt mess up the second chance.The mother also chided her son about getting her age wrong on national TV.

As I grew older, I found thatmy fundamental conservative principles never wavered I am a big fan ofeffecient government.Which is why the GOP no longer represents me at all.The GOP is going to waste american tax dollars and time to take on a stillborn legislative initiative. The repeal of truly useful reforms. Why?It seems to me that ever sinceRonald Reagan, this republican party seems more interested in dog and pony shows than it does, actual legislation of conservative principles. Conservatism is the lifeblood of politics, just as liberalism is its heartbeat. The ebb and flow of governance worksproperly to be, at times  liberal  such as when we are at war. Meatless tuesdays.

Last votes are expected between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m.Election of the Speaker of the House. This election is held by manual roll call vote, with each Member called individually, in alphabetical order, by the clerk.Swearing-in of Members. After the Speaker is elected, the Oath of Office is administered to Members and Delegates.H.Res. 5  A resolution providing for the House Rules of the 112th Congress (Privileged Resolution)In the Senate, courtesy of theOffice of the Majority Leader:Convenes: 12:00 noonFollowing the presentation of the certificates of election and the swearing in of elected members, there will be a required live quorum. All senators are asked to report to the floor at that time. The Senate will then be in a period of morning business with senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.Im still trying to figure out the system Im going to use to find and report the basic House floor information for you for the next two years. My inclination is to take the info from its source, and thats the Majority Leaders office. But to this point, of course, thats been Steny Hoyer, and will now be Eric Cantor instead. And I just dont know where Cantors going to park that info yet. So for now, Im using Hoyers. As I prepare this, the night before publication, Hoyer still occupies majorityleader.gov, though hes also begun using democraticwhip.gov. Cantor hasnt taken on a new domain name that Im aware of yet, but when he does, Ill look to see how he presents floor schedule information.Theres not much to add to these schedules. The first day is usually just about swearing in new members, some light housekeeping (adopting resolutions notifying the President and the other house that theyve convened, appointing members to their committees, etc.) adopting a rules package in the House (and maybe the same, later on, in the Senate  a rarity) and electing the Speaker. The vote for Speaker is always worth watching, just for the spectacle of it. Its the only time they ever call out the roll of the entire House and ask each member to vote aloud.House rules changes will be adopted by majority vote, and more to the point, along party lines. In case you missed it,heres a littlecommentary aboutsome ofthe wackinessinvolved.On the Senate side, usually even less is done. Theres the same sort of housekeeping, but since the Senate doesnt ordinarily adopt its rules with each new Congress, they usually break things up pretty quickly and get on to the social agenda. This time around, of course, Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) plans to step in to try to change that, by formally objecting to the continuance of the old rules, as is usually the case, and to reserve the right of the Senate to debate and adopt changes instead. For more about the theory and precedents hes invoking  and why it might stretch out well beyond today  seethis post from Monday.And now, still more ICYMI materials for your reading pleasure:The First Day of a New Congress: A Guide to Proceedings on the Senate Floor (PDF)The First Day of a New Congress: A Guide to Proceedings on the House Floor (PDF)Last but not least, let me remind you that if youre planning on being at the Capitol for todays events, please wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and antibacterial soap, and cover your mouth and nose with the elbow of your sleeve if you cough or sneeze in the presence of Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD-01), as he may well be without any health care coverage despite starting a new job this very day!  and it would be a real tragedy if a guy like him had to deal with the complexities and indignities of seeking medical treatment while between coverage providers.Well, it would be if he didnt also have access to the Office of the Attending Physician, I guess.But he does!OAP provides members of Congress with physicals and routine examinations, on-site X-rays and lab work, physical therapy and referrals to medical specialists from military hospitals and private medical practices. When specialists are needed, they are brought to the Capitol, often at no charge to members of Congress.Members of Congress do not pay for the individual services they receive at the OAP, nor do they submit claims through their federal employee health insurance policies. Instead, as of 2009, members pay a flat, annual fee of $503 for all the care they receive. The rest of the cost of their care is paid for by federal funding, from the U.S. Navy budget. The annual fee has not changed significantly since 1992.Please enjoy thisprofile of the OAP by ABC news.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesToday in Congres@Politicaldog...1/5/11Read moreThere are two winners of the Mega Millions $355 Million jackpotOne in IdahoAnother in Washington StateJanuary 5, 2011jamesb101No commentsWHAT!I didnt win???Darn!Actually I wouldnt want to win that much money.Too much notoriety.Too much looking over your shoulderBut Id take a few million.No problemThe holders of a ticket sold in Idaho and another in Washington state will be sharing Mega Millions $355 million jackpot from Tuesday nights drawing, lottery officials said Wednesday.The prize is the fourth-largest in U.S. history and the second-largest in Mega Millions history, said Arizona Lottery spokeswoman Cindy Esquer.
