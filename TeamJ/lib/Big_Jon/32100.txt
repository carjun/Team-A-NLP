The rumors that have been working their way around the web have stated that he did nothing really that was important. What I have found is that he...IntroductionSome of Sarah Palin's Accomplishments will be listed and detailed here. She has been the Governor of Alaska for two years and Mayor of Wasilla Alaska for ten years. She also served as President of Alaska Conference of Mayors and was also a City Council member (1992-1996).AGIA License bill signed August 27, 2008. Energy Package signed August 25, 2008. Administrative Order 242 signed August 20, 2008.These are just a few of her more recent accomplishments since taking office as Governor of Alaska. I do not endorse McCain and Palin, nor do I endorse Obama and Biden. This hub is not about campaigning for someone, but to simply state a few facts about Palin who has been judged unjustly in my opinion by many. I may even do a hub about Obama's accomplishments. When an official is elected to office, he/she should be elected according to past history and accomplishments. Sarah Palin AGIA License bill signed August 27, 2008 House Bill 3001 for awarding a contract to TransCanada Alaska for developing and building a pipeline stretching for 1,715 miles from the Prudhoe Bay treatment plant to Alberta Canada. Natives of Alaska have dreamed of a pipeline for more than 30 years. Sarah Palin in less than two years got the bill passed and the framework is now laid for them to move forward with the project. Governor Palin said. This legislation brings us closer than weve ever been to building a gas pipeline and finally accessing our gas that has been languishing for so many decades on the North Slope. More than 36,000 miles of pipeline is now operated by TransCanada Corporation in North America.  They have built many pipelines also and are appreciative of the Governor's suport. Sarah Palin and Family Energy Package signed August 25, 2008. House Bill 4001 and Senate bill 4002 were signed into law by Governor Palin on August 25, 2008. SB 4002 pays $1,200 to each resident who qualifies. The money for these payments comes from the state's natural resource revenue. This bill also suspends the state's tax on gasoline.   Alaskans who signed up for direct deposit will see these funds on September 12, along with their dividend, said Governor Palin. In rural Alaska, particularly, many people are facing a choice between feeding their families and heating their homes, and they could use this payment from the state's energy-generated surplus to cover some of those bills. She also signed a proclamation declaring September to be energy efficiency month in Alaska. She encourages residents to use energy more efficiently during this month.Administrative Order 242 signed August 20, 2008.This order  puts together a co-op of the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Revenue to work with organizations who wish to commercialize Alaska's North Slope natural gas."This solidifies our commitment to facilitating an LNG project that is a product of market interest, Governor Palin said. By committing both project capital and natural gas resources to a pipeline that would transport North Slope natural gas to tidewater, an LNG project can remain an integral element of the states effort to deliver Alaskas gas to market"The Order encourages the departments to support any who are pursuing development of natural gas projects which are liquefiable and economic. A copy of this order is available here. WESTWIND IIThe jet was purchased on payments by the former governor as a person would buy an automobile. Payments of $62,492.79 were made quarterly. New information that was pointed out to me indicates that the jet didn't actually sell on Ebay. I apologize for the misinformation. It was sold to a businessman from Valdez named Larry Reynolds, who paid $2.1 million for the jet, shy of the original $2.7 million purchase price, according to contemporaneous news reports, including a story in the New York Times. Resource of information <opens in new window.The ChefUpon entering office as Governor, the first thing Palin did was fire the chef. She said she is able to make meals for her children and the chef is no longer necessary. It seems to me that one thing she is against, is wasteful spending of taxpayers dollars. I think she has integrity, if nothing else to bring to the position of Vice president of the USA. Her campaign for Governor centered around corrupt politics. All comments are welcome here. Currently the last comments will show first. All links will open in new windows. Please vote in the poll below also if you wish. Special Needs EducationInternet rumors have been going around claiming Palin cut funding for Special Needs Education by 62%. The rumor has been found to be false and the funding in fact tripled for these special needs children education. Book Ban InterviewMore Internet RumorsRumors have been going all over the Internet charging Palin with many misdeeds. She supposedly demanded that certain books be banned by the library at Wasilla. This is a false rumor. Many of the books that were mentioned in the rumor weren't even published yet. The librarian said that Palin asked a what if question. The original rumor also stated that the librarian was fired, but she in fact worked at the same library through most of Palins first term.She was charged with being a member of the Alaskan Independence Party which has pushed for succession from the United States. Fact is that she was never a member of that party. She never endorsed Pat Buchanan. She merely wore a Buchanan pin during his visit to Wasilla. She has not pushed for teaching creationism in Alaska's schools. She has said that students should be allowed to "debate both sides" of the evolution question, but she also said creationism "doesn't have to be part of the curriculum"Much of the above in this capsule can be found here. Fairy Tales This is really funny but so true at the same time. How many times have we heard the beginning of this fairy tale?Bridge to NowhereOriginally the report told was that Sarah Palin was against the bridge to Nowhere. After doing some digging around I found out the truth of the bridge. Sarah Palin originally was for the bridge and even made a statement to that affect which has been recorded. Palin, Sept. 2006: The money that's been appropriated for the project, it should remain available for a link, an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done. This link is a commitment to help Ketchikan expand its access, to help this community prosper.When the proposal came before the senate, the bill was passed with a vote of 91 for and 4 against it, with 5 senators not voting. John McCain was one of the 4 who voted against it. Barak Obama and Joe Biden both voted for it.The Bridge to Nowhere became a symbol of Pork Barrel spending and earmarks, which is something John McCain is against.

Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) had been shot at a congressional event in her district, observers began noting that she had, during the campaign, literally been Sarah Palin's target.

Useful Funny Awesome Beautiful Internet Items: Global  WarmingInternet Items: A list of President Obama's AccomplishmentsCommentsSirDent3 months ago CherylPet, nice way to start a convo with a stranger.  I represented all the facts I was able to find on Sarah Palin before the election of Barack Obama.Just so you know, I gave Obama equal time also.  If you come back here, be nice.  I don't mind anyuone disagreeing with me or what I wrote.  I don't like people who try to cast insults and call names.CherylPet3 months ago Palin was the WORST Governor! The librarian ONLY KEPT her JOB because there was a public OUTCRY! So, that "little" omission changed the ENTIRE complexion of the story! You aren't in favor of Palin? HA! You leave out IMPORTANT FACTS that CHANGE a good thing into a BAD one! What a loyal little SPINNER you are! (aka LIAR!) Palin got money from BP, to give to the Alaskan residents to BUY their VOTES! Her HUSBAND TODD WORKED FOR BP! Todd and Sarah KNEW there was a 22 acre oil spill in the Alaskan wilderness and said NOTHING! She is BEHOLDEN TO BP! She takes money and freebies every opportunity she gets, even if she isn't supposed to have it! Se was paid travel expenses when really, she was at HOME! ($60,000!)She was gone from office as Gov. that the other legislatures wore, "Where's Palin?" hats! She had the Wasilla police charge $1,200-1,500 for rape kits, so women would not lie about getting raped! (who cares if an actual rape victim cannot afford the kit?) Palin took her entire family on a trip to New York and stayed at a 5 star hotel, and charged the state $25,000 for a trip that was supposed to be for her ALONE! She always said she didn't care if she was told NO about anything, because she will do it anyway! Upon hearing that Obama was the Dem candidate for President, she called him the N word in disgust! There is much more...including that she think there are too many Japanese in Hawaii, even her own mother-in-law said she wouldn't vote for Sarah, and many of her friends said they wouldn't either..wonder why? Because she is AWFUL!!Madame X10 months ago The left is scared to death of Palin, hence, all the rumors. And then the rest of them repeat the lies like parrots. Thanks for a clear listing of the facts.Excellent hub :)SirDent14 months ago Thanks for the link Ralph. I don't have time right now to look at it but I will asap.Ralph Deeds14 months ago Here's a link to the secret diary of the ghost writer of Palin's book that's scheduled to be published in November.http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2009/10/25/secretKeaka Pearson17 months ago Very interesting, looking at this in August of 2009.Bistro is the best example of rank propaganda I've seen in a long time. Every allegation has been absolutely proven false or baseless.Reminds me of the "Bush lied" whackjobs. I asked that a quote be produced of a lie. All I ever got back was "Cheney said" or "the Bush administration said" or "I heard that". Not One Quote by Bush. Not even a false quote by Bush.And when I asked the ultimate question "what did Bush say that wasn't also said by the prominent Dems?" suddenly there was silence all 'round.Same with Palin. My friend here said "Palin is a dunce". I asked why she thought so. The cogent, perspicacious, well thought-out answer: "she just is".Remember, Liberalism is a mental disease.SirDent17 months ago bountyhunter_ga just for the record, this hub was written before the election in 2008. It was written to try and set the record straight on a few things. I also wrote a hub on Obama for the same reason.bountyhunter_ga17 months ago Boy oh boy it sounds like every wacko in America is trying to he noticed on the back of Mrs Palin. Wake up America every time someone comes along that cares about conditions or problems here at home we try to kill the messenger along with the message. Lets embrace some new blood and give these people a chance,enough of the old crap.johnwindbell18 months ago If she was old and ugly I doubt you'd even bother with this HUB. Or McCain would have even bothered. Funny, and he might have one. One day we'll have the Dems out of our pocket, and the Repubs. out of our bedrooms, our church, and our garden.frogyfish18 months ago Now Gov. Palin is going to resign and the 'remarks' are flying wild.  Thank you, Sir Dent for your level-headed truths here.Sarah 22 months ago you guys dont have lives! why are you guys fighting when your obviously not going to change each others minds!?bistro23 months ago got it thanks......SirDent23 months ago What I meant by propaganda is the rumors that were all over the Internet. Rumors are easy to come by, but they are still rumors. It took me a long time to figure out what was true and what was rumor when I wrote this hub. Same with the Obama hub. Many times I edited to fix errors in what I thought was right, but ended up just being a rumor.In the time we live these days it is hard to get straight facts, but it is not impossible.bistro23 months ago i'm not sure who is attacking? you asked for proof...... he has a white mother and a black father, there pictures are on the web, i don't know how i can attach pictures for you here.the jet was sold to save peoples tax dollars.....i'm not sure how to get a copy of that, she said it live on most chanels.she fired the chef to save peoples tax dollars....she again said it live on most channels.she passed a bill with oil company to create massive amounts of jobs......this was said live on most channels.obama just let out very bad people from jail......where will he move them....i'm sure we will not know, but when he says i will postillinois is the most corrupt in jail big dogs than all 50 states.....the most in debt and highest murder rate.....please google itemails are sometimes read rude, it depends on ones mood i believe, i'm always pretty happy, but i may not be a great writer, so please excuse me for not understanding what you mean by facts and propaganda. i thought these would be facts that you could understand.  maybe i need to rephrase, not sure how else i can tell youSirDent23 months ago bistro I asked for proof. You give me more propoganda and an attacking comment.SirDent23 months ago How about some proof Bistro. Rumors were flying left and right about Palin and Obama both. Lets see some actual evidence for a change.bistro23 months ago  poor poor joe doe, the only thing you say is sold a jet......that creates a lot of money dope joe, take away a chef,,,,,,that saves a lot of tax payers money blow joe, passed a bill within 2 years with the OIL (ie corrupt field) that they have been trying for 30 years joe joeprivate email.........ohhh dear oohhh........it's free joe doe, slap her on the handobama won't show his birth certificate, harvard thesis, admit he's a milado not an african american only, corruption with ACORN, coruption with the chicago machine, coruption with his only head campaign man REZCO (convicted crook) ayers sponsered his funding, biz deals with rezco with land, obama is part of the most corrupt state of all, the most jailed top heads, the biggest in debt, the most murder and the bigest mafia still out there.......that's what your little girldfriend did joey doey....palins husband just said no thanks.i believe you are a severely odd for not mentioning she has been in the black her whole carrer,,,,,,,,yep she knows how to save money, and run a biz....she passed  many bills in her 10 years of EXPERIENCE.....your little friend has none. He did mark present on 150 votes........he just needs time to make a decision right joey boey.......wake up fool, he just let out 2 terroists from guantamo....as the first thing he has accomplished.......let out 9/11 dudes LOL ..have fun pretending your whole life2 years of office the only thing you could mention about her accomplishments was that she sold a jet, fired a chef, and helped with the oil pipeline which has been in the works for years before she became governor. This is supposed to be impressive?How about the fact that she used private email accounts for official government business... despite there being rules to the contrary.How about her (and her husbands) refusal to answer to subpeonas regarding corruption charges.How about that she apposed sex education in public schools even though these teachings have led to teenage pregnancy reaching a 30 year LOW.How about her being despised by environmentalists for allowing arial hunting of wolves and wanting polar bears off the endangered species lists despite scientific proof of their dwindling numbers.How about her removal of Wasilla museum staff that her personal friends were enemies with.The list of Sarah Paulin corruption and cronyism goes on and on yet you choose to focus on the sale of an airplane and firing of a chef. Yes we can see that you are unbiased.SirDent23 months ago bgamal, words are easy to come by. Proof is usually much harder. Bush has been accused of stealing oil for years now. He was accused of stealing the election in 2000, yet was reelected in 2004. The war in Iraq started before he was reelected.So I ask once again, where is the proof of your allegations?bgamall23 months ago Sarah Palin is a dominionist. She believes in using religion to conquer the world, even though Christ said his kingdom was not of this world. The dangerous thing is that she has befriended Bill Kristol, Fox news commentator and founder of PNAC and Karl Rove, another neocon who had plans to invade Iraq prior to 9/11.Palin says our war to steal oil was holy. I call it theft. That makes Palin an accessory to all the evil the neocons have bestowed upon this nation, including liar loans and the housing crisis. Alt a loans are killing this country, and they are not subprime and they are not originated by Fannie Mae, or at least were not until a few months ago. If it were just subprime we would not be facing a possible depression.This is the botto line, you will never get the truth listening to Fox news because the neocons control fox news. Kristol is moer than a commentator, He called for a 9/11 type event a year before it happened and that is a matter of public record. I have hubs explaining more about the evils of the neocons. And Palin is with them.   sonofeinar2 years ago Journalist Max Blumenthal wrongfully accused Gov. Palin in one of his articles published in The Daily Beast.  He gleefully stated that Palin personally pressured the Wasilla librarian to remove a book titled "Pastor, I'm Gay" which she then removed from the shelves.  The pastor who wrote the book was contacted recently and was shocked by the article, claiming that Blumenthal misquoted him.  In fact, the pastor admitted that the librarian had never accused Palin of pressuring her.  Also, the Wasilla library has stated that "Pastor, I'm Gay" had never been challenged by anyone.
