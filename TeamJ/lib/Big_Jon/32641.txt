One's eye would normally be drawn to that "purple mountain" majesty and what sits near its base.Not only is the Garden of the Gods a sizeable city park, but it is stunningly beautiful with striking red sandstone formations that were seemingly thrust up from the earth in distinctive and unusual patterns considering the topography of the surrounding area. See all 15 photosGarden of the Gods photo by Peggy WMy mother waving from our rental car * Photo by Peggy WColorado vacation My mother and I got to spend eleven wonderful sightseeing days exploring what we could of Colorado in that length of time in July of 1999. We started our vacation in Colorado Springs after flying there from Houston and we could see the Garden of the Gods from the air.Naturally we wanted to see and experience Garden of the Gods up close. After leaving the airport with our rental car we drove through this magnificent area and were later to return to see more of the park on a guided tour.Neither of us enjoyed this first rental car and we returned it in exchange for a Lincoln Continental Towne Car the next day for the balance of our trip in Colorado. It was a little hard for my mother to get in and out of the SUV because of her stature and we were both used to riding in sedans.

Perkins was a Director of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and he was also a Director of Bell Telephone Company.Charles Elliott Perkins had originally purchased a portion of land in Colorado Springs consisting of what is now known as Garden of the Gods for the possible location of a summer home. Instead of building anything man-made there, he appreciated the land for what it bore...natural beauty. He had already opened it up to the public for enjoyment of this space and acquired even more of the adjacent land.His children knew his intent and after his death they generously donated this land consisting of 480 acres to the City of Colorado Springs in 1909 with the stipulation that it would always remain open and free of charge to the public.Additional surrounding lands were subsequently added making Garden of the Gods the city park that is enjoyed daily by countless residents and tourists to this fine city. These rocks invite exploration! * Photo by Peggy WGarden of the Gods video Photo in Garden of the Gods by Peggy WGarden of the Gods as seen from a Paraglider point of view...Bighorn Sheep in Garden of the GodsPlayground This Garden of the Gods City Park offers so much by way of not only stunning beauty but also entertainment depending upon one's willingness or ability to participate. It is a genuine playground of sorts! One can simply stroll the paths winding through the various formations and sit and watch the shadows dance off of the rocks, trees and vegetation native to that area. It would be a perfect spot for meditation on some of those trails in the park.Watch for chirping birds of various species resting on branches in the trees or colorful butterflies tasting the nectar of flowering plants.There is a wide diversity of plant-life as well as animal life native to this area.Fossils have been found here which indicate marine life in the past and even one type of dinosaur whose remains have been identified.Whether one is merely a walker who likes to stay on fairly level ground or one who likes mountain hiking, one's desires can be satisfied in the Garden of the Gods.Rock climbers have fun in this park. One is likely to see bikers enjoying the paths throughout the park and horseback riding is also allowed.For those with little time, just driving on the roads through the park gives one glimpses of areas where one might like to come back and explore at greater length with a little more time to spare.Few cities have parks this distinctive and beautiful in their midst that can be accessed in all sorts of ways and are also totally free of charge.

I hope lots of people read the hub!!Michael Adams19595 months ago AWESOME, what memories tis brings to me. I spent 1974 summer at he Clover Valley Motel directly across from the main entrance to The GArdens of the Gods. I worked there cleaning stables in exchange for unlimited use of a great horse named Sage. My aunt and uncle owned the motel I stayed with them and had a remarkable unforgetable summer. Thank you so much for this hub!Peggy W5 months ago Hello again msorensson,I guess time will tell.  Thanks.  Glad you liked my photos of Garden of the Gods.  Those pre-dated my owning a digital camera.Peggy W5 months ago Hello MichaelAdams1959,Sounds like you truly enjoyed that summer at your aunt and uncle's place across from Garden of the Gods.  What a delight to be able to ride Sage in that park! Thanks for your interesting comment!dahoglund5 months ago Your pictures probably show me what I missed while trying to get our old VW van up the hill.I'm not quite orientated.I remember we pulled over into a campground about two thirds the way up Pikes peak, it was coming on evening and the hills are always an overwhelming sight.Peggy W5 months ago Hi dahoglund,Garden of the Gods is down below Pikes Peak.  That drive up Pikes Peak is something else!  We took a tour so did not have to do the driving ourselves.  Did you make it to the top of Pikes Peak?dahoglund5 months ago we never did. That vehicle just did  not have the power.Michael Adams19595 months ago I made it up there took the cog rail once from Manitou Springs and back packed it once Awesome times.William F. Torpey5 months ago Thanks for the trip down memory lane, Peggy W. I enjoyed viewing the Garden of the Gods frequently -- along with Pikes Peak and the Royal Gorge (which you wrote about so well in another hub) when I was stationed in Fort Carson in 1957. It's a great vacation place (and don't miss the zoo if you go.)Mike Lickteig5 months ago Colorado Springs and the Garden of the Gods is a beautiful spot.  I haven't been there since I was a kid on vacation with my parents, but I recall a little bit of my time there.  Somewhere in my mother's photo albums is a black and white photo of the Balanced Rock.  I am a huge fan of Colorado and love to spend time there when I can.  Thanks for the wonderful photos.MikePeggy W5 months ago Hi dahoglund,Too bad your vehicle did not get you to the top of Pikes Peak.  At least you saw some of the views on the way up.  Next time (if you return to Colorado Springs) take a tour as we did and leave the driving to others.  Ha!Peggy W5 months ago Hi MichaelAdams1959,We saw people arriving by cog rail at the top of Pikes Peak.  Must have been some fantastic views overlooking Colorado Springs, Garden of the Gods, and other sites as you ascended.  But backpacking up that mountain!  Wow!  You have surely had some interesting adventures!  Thanks for the comment.Peggy W5 months ago Hello William F. Torpey,Afraid we did not have the time to visit the zoo in Colorado Springs but thanks for the "heads up" should we ever return.  Happy to hear that you enjoyed this hub and that it brought back happy memories for you of your time spent there at Fort Carson in 1957.  Thanks for your comment.Peggy W5 months ago Hi Mike,Your mother's black and white photos of the balanced rock in the Garden of the Gods must be like my parents black and white photos of the Black Hills.  Sort of puts a date on the vacation, doesn't it.  Haha!  Now...unless your mother was studying under Ansel Adams influence.....?billyaustindillon5 months ago Beautiful photos of Garden of the Gods - I have only done the ski field thing in Colorado I need to expand obviously!

The AC units are humming!Dolores Monet5 months ago Peggy - I have an old postcard from the Garden of the Gods, but never know anything about it. What a beautiful place! I loved the pictures!Peggy W5 months ago Hi Dolores,Now you know a bit more about Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs.  Did someone from your family visit there and pick up a postcard?  I have many old ones from the days when my grandparents used to travel.  It is fun looking at the old motel units, etc. from the past.  Of course Garden of the Gods would not have changed since it is a geological feature.  Thanks for the comment.katie543215 months ago You brought back some nice memories for me.  In 1994 I was an intern at the USOC in Colorado Springs and we would go to Garden of the Gods all the time just to hang out, hike, walk, or whatever.  Beautiful pictures.  You made me smile - thank you!Peggy W5 months ago Hello katie54321,So glad that these pictures of the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs brought back such happy memories for you!

My house is full of all kinds of odd stuff that I have no idea where it came from. :)Peggy W5 months ago Hi again Dolores,If that postcard was not mailed then undoubtedly someone picked it up while on vacation especially if it has been in your house for a while.  Must be nice to make discoveries like that.  Doesn't it make you curious as to how that postcard from Garden of the Gods got there?  Sounds like your house would be a treasure trove of goodies to explore.
