BO may think Micheal Vick has "paid his debt to society" and deserves a second chance------but I don't.        He's a big boy, and he is responsible for his actions.    I don't think he deserves to go back to a multi million dollar a year job.       That is complete and utter BULLSHIT!        He knew what he was doing---and he chose to do it anyway.The biggest "reason" to have sports is always given as sports teach fair play, sportsmanship, and builds moral character by providing positive role models to children.         Is this the kind of role model we should set up in front of our children?      Convicted felons paid millions upon millions of dollars and engaging in cruel and illegal activity?        And after they get caught---we'll just give them a little slap on the wrist and go back business as usual.       There are a whole lot of jobs out there that if you are a convicted felon, you will never work that job again.      School teacher is one of them.       I hold Micheal Vick responsible for his actions, and I hold the Philadelphia Eagles responsible for being so victory and $$$ hungry that they couldn't wait to get him back on the field, and I hold the entire league responsible for selling out ethics and morals in persuit of $$$.        End of rant.     I suppose I am the only person in the country who thinks this way----at least it seems that way to me.

Not that hockey hasn't had some scandals----but overall, less than football or baseball.       Basketball is not too bad either, but I've never been able to get up much interest in it. (maybe because I was never any good at it----put me on a basketball court and I'm a real stumblebum!)     I've ALWAYS  liked car racing and horses(especially RODEO!!!!).     Mostly Indy, Formula 1---and NASCAR, although NASCAR can be a bunch of real Neanderthals sometimes, I still like it.     Sometimes it is good be be a Neanderthal for a little while.

Given the crimes committed and the wealth of the convicted that dog should have its own house, and human staff to wait on him hand and foot. 6 days agoflag  reply+3Radical_Centrist  Ricky84:Works for me. :-) 6 days agoflag  reply+2remanns  Ricky84:agreed.   +^d 6 days agoflag  reply+2JanforGoreYou see so much pain and fear in that dog's eyes still.... that bastard.

And he does work with PETA. Leave him alone, why isn't there this much outrage for Ben Roethlisberger raping two women and getting away with it? 6 days agoflag  reply+5KSirys  cons_Objector:because the story is about michael vick and the dog he abused.  When you see a story about ben rothlesberger you can complain there, why we are not talking about vick. 6 days agoflag  reply+4eden49  KSirys:...you beat me to it...xo 6 days agoflag  reply+3remanns  KSirys:+^d 6 days agoflag  reply+3remanns  eden49:+^d 6 days agoflag  reply+4keithponder  KSirys:That's the issue. We don't see anymore stories in the media about Ben Roethlisberger at all.The entire story was covered up.I know this for an absolute fact. I live in Georgia, and I'm a member of the NFL Player Association Executive Committee.The evidence was destroyed by the local police and Ben is a rapist and he never did one day in jail.BTW, I'm happy for this dog and the new owner as well. Contrary to what anyone may choose to believe, I'm a dog owner and a dog lover. My pit sleeps in my bed with me, sometimes to my wife's chagrin. We're inseparable so that being said, I can understand the outrage. As an ex-athlete and an African American man, I was ashamed and embarrassed by what Michael Vick did to those dogs. I don't always agree with the law, but I try to follow the law to the best of my ability and that's where I separate from some of the people on Current. You will never hear me calling for the death of anyone especially since the courts have made a determination themselves, that an individual that committed the crime has done their time, and they're making restitution to society. Michael Vick is a millionaire again and that's what bothers some people here. The last time I recall, people that behaved liked that were called jealous.Have a good day Bro. Gotta go to work. 6 days agoflag  reply+2Wetdog  cons_Objector:Because he(BR) isn't being set up as a role model to children and society. 6 days agoflag  reply0KSirys  keithponder:I believe what you say because you know money talks and color rules in some states.  But this convo was about MV and the dog that's now living a better life.  I love all types of animals, i have two mixed labs and they both sleep in my bed as well.  They shed like there's no tomorrow, but i still love having them being with me, like kids.  I can never understand why anyone, would want to hurt a dog, cat, pig whatever... any type of living being... well except grown adults, they are last in my world.  But I believe you, just like the rich get away with things, you know the minorities are always set up to be made an example for the rest of us.  Have a great day bro! 5 days agoflag  reply+1Wetdog  keithponder:Excellent post Keith.       If I saw more of what you express, I'd have a completely different view of sports----unfortunately, it is all about $$$ and winning now.------"  I don't always agree with the law, but I try to follow the law to the best of my ability and that's where I separate from some of the people on Current."-------        For me, it isn't even so much about obeying the law-----it is far more about the moral character of the person.        Working for PETA now?     I suspect that tells me more about PETA than Micheal Vick. http://www.consumerfreedom.com/news_detail.cfm/h/2833-peta-kills-animals----and-... 5 days agoflag  reply0Nephwrack  cons_Objector:no one held a gun to his head and made him fight, drown and electrocute dogs. 5 days agoflag  reply+1keithponder  Wetdog:Thank you wetdog ! I'm here to be honest, not to make friends. Hopefully my being honest will attract others, and l understand that sometimes it won't That being said, I do humbly appreciate your sincere reply on this controversial topic. You could have coped out and called me a racist as some often will try to do, just for disagreeing with the status qou.Wetdog, I love my race but that doesn't always mean that I'm happy with or agree with everything that happens to us as a people. I'm 55 years old now. I'm world traveled, educated around the world, a college graduate, former professional athlete, homeowner, faithful husband, responsible parent, a loving grandfather, and a taxpaying citizen in this great country. I've also had my struggles, yet still, I feel blessed, because most Black that I know did not have the same up bringing that I had. I was not rich, but I grew up far from being poor. I've lived in an all Black neighborhood only once as a child and it was nice. That being said, I have not always been completely accepted by my own sometimes. It used to bother me but not anymore. The point that I'm getting to is that, Michael Vick is one of the people that had limited exposure to everything that I just described to you. His mother was poor, and his father was a drug addicted that left home when Mike was at an early age. I know his story. He started fighting digs in grade school. That's the culture that he grew up in. When Mike was at Virginia Tech, his head coach Frank Beamer knew that Mike was fighting dogs. Mike was great already so Frank, the A.D. and school president all turn a blind eye towards these activities. Falcon owner Arthur Blank and then head coach, Dan Reeves paid him a visit before the draft. Frank Beamer told them, upon arrival, that he had to send word out to the woods to find Mike that day. He told them that Mike hung out in the woods fighting dogs. The Falcon knew this before they traded up with San Diego to acquire his rights. The point that I'm making is that, Mike is one of those people that always got his way because he was way better that everyone else on the field. This is not to defend him or make excuses for him, but it is to say that Michael Vick is not a sociopath. That's the culture that he came from. It took what it took to bring him down. Rapper Jay-Z sold drugs as a teenager and young adult. He also wrote unhealthy songs about his lifestyle and degrading women early on.  He's a business man and a married man now. He recently said that he's ashamed of the lyrics that he wrote in his hit song "Big Pimpin". People change. What some people on this thread either fail to acknowledge or just flat out choose not to see is that their are millions of young African American kids that are growing up in poverty just like Vick did that now have a chance to hear him tell his story about what happen to him, and that's the message of hope that we all so desperately need. Most maybe won't heed to his message, but hopefully enough will that will have a chance to make a difference in society. Michael Vick does not belong in prison for too many reasons to mention. You cannot preach hatred against anybody and then say that you love this country. It just doesn't work that way.Sorry for taking you the long way home because Michael Vick really is just the side bar in the story posted on this thread. The real story should be about the dog and his new owner. Not too much has been said about that. What I see is a happy dog with a new happy owner. My dog is a rescue dog. He ran away from his drug dealer owner at 6 months. He stayed in a neighborhood for 3 months. We got him just 2 days before he was to be put to sleep coincidently on Christmas day. That was 4 years ago.Dogs can tell the difference. Not much has been mentioned about the joy that these 2 share now. I'm truly perplexed by that. I guess some people are just comfortable in demonizing Vick. I don't like what happened but I'll always speak out against that too. 5 days agoflag  reply0Wetdog  keithponder:Keith----the story you tell about MV confirms to me what I've always thought.     The lack of moral character extends much further than MV.     His coaches and university president knew about it and they did nothing?     They are responsible too.      The Falcons knew about it and they did nothing?     They are responsible too.        It is his culture?    No, it was his CHOICE.   Was owning and abusing slaves OK because it was the culture at the time?     No.     Moral character is doing the right thing, whether it is legal or not,    Willfully inflicting pain and abuse on others that have no defense is wrong---even animals.      Aiding and abetting  such behavior by covering up and making excuses for it in order to profit thereby is also wrong.     Forgive and forget because MV can throw a football around well and get paid millions upon millions of $$$ for it is not the right thing to do.      Richard Hunter is the only one in this whole saga who did the right thing.    Richard Hunter is not achieving fame or fortune or the adulation of millions.             But Richard Hunter is richer and a better man than any of them.        Richard Hunter is the one who deserves respect and reward in my opinion.        I have a feeling that Richard will get his respect and reward from Mel.     And I think the respect and reward that Richard gets from Mel will mean far more in the long run, than scores, titles, contracts, endorsements and salaries.                You can not buy honor or moral character. 5 days agoflag  reply+1Radical_Centrist  Wetdog:The image that WILL NOT leave my head is of MV taking a poor Dog and slamming it against the ground REPEATEDLY till it's neck and back break. What kind of sick Phuck could do that to ANY living thing? I do not care how economically deprived you were growing up that is not something a person with a Soul could do. 3 days agoflag  reply+1TasteHiI wish there was a way to garnish the checks of people that get caught doing this.I'd say 20% off their income for the rest of their lives should be applied towards rehab of abused/neglected animals. Same for sex offenders, and violent offenders in general. This guy makes a cool  2 to 3 million a year, didn't need the dough when he took advantage of  'mans best friend' so god knows why he was fine and dandy with watching them tear mouthfuls of flesh from each other and cry for mercy. This is the kind of person  that if left unchecked would easily get into human trafficking considering there's an extremely fine line between defenseless beings in general.  Maybe he was just diluted and didn't think an animal is capable of experiencing fear, pain, and panic. 6 days agoflag  reply+4PressCoreIs it just me, or do I see genuine shock on that formerly maltreatedcanine's face ? It may be a long time, if ever, that he can again learn to smile. A canine's life is 7 times shorter than a humans. And it takesa long, long, long, time, and an imense amount of love & affection forany traumatized creature to emotionaly distance himself from thatextreme psychic pain. And to unlearn all the suffering evil caused himAs the poets say: The pleasure of love lasts but a moment, but thepain love causes lasts a lifetime. I hope the canine's new companionplays some soft, soothing music for him often, and gives him a warmheated pad to sleep on.
