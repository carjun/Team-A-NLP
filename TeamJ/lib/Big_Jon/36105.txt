I call him "people" because he has the outward appearances of a "person".He, by all reports had displayed behavior that had been noted by authorities as being dangerous to society.

Unless you can afford a one time fee or monthly charge to keep the list updated.  I never in my life thought that to protect my family from sexual predators i would have to pay for that liberty. If this is the new kind of actions we are taking to ensure our goverment can sustain an annual income what will we be charged for next.  Will they charge us a fee just to issue an amber alert if my child is abducted? I thought every american family has the right to know when predators are in their neighborhoods lurking. I did not realize this was a private liberty i need to pay for.  I have been to numerous websites which offer free registered sex offender lists and every link i clicked on has tried to charge for their services. As American Citizen we should all be infuriated that they are charging us now just to see how many sex offenders live in our state our communities and even worse my very own neighborhood54155922Flag this commentbabs2010 said on September 9, 2010 at 1:20 PMI am losing hope!!!

This year I lost my job and Cobra has run out,  for 4 months I have been trying to get insurance.  Was I in for a surpise.  I have signed up for at least 5 different insurance companys;  I have been turned down by all.  This is the 4th month and I decided to get a little more pushy to find out the problem.  problem is under the "Insurance credit company" (the same as Credit companys checking your credit) this company checks Insurance for your health.  problem is someone put bad credit under my insurance.  this company says I have Anxiety, Abnormal Labs, Abnormal Cardiac testing, Osteopenia, attention deficit disorder, degenerative disc disease, ext.  Anxiety and depression I would believe, but all of the US has anxiety and depression.  The rest put me in shock, I can not get insurance unless I pay $600 to $800 a month or not at all. I need help.  I will send paper work to you. doreen Seklar49047964Flag this commentsbknox said on July 31, 2010 at 7:26 PMMy husband and I are home oweners are we are two months behind on our mortgage.  At this time, we are two months behind because of an error on my part.  I actually paid June's mortgage July 3rd only to write the amount to be paid wrong.  Therefore the written amount was less than the number amount.  Therefore, PNC Mortgage notified us of the error requesting for the unpaid balance and I sent them the unpaid balance.  Days later they returned the check and stated that our account must be paid in full which is over $3000.    When I called to inquire on exactly what was going on, I was told that the first check  was applied to late fee charges.  I told them we can not afford to pay late fees because we can barely keep up with the mortgage!  I went on to ask why didn't they returned the first check just like they did the second check? I got no real answer besides that's what their finance dept. does.  I don't think that is right and know we owe $3528.16 and we are stuck.48925614Flag this commenttnkr582 said on July 28, 2010 at 11:14 AMalso there are too many other things wrong with this car, cannot possibly include everything48650524Flag this commenttnkr582 said on July 28, 2010 at 11:10 AMSIMPLE USED CARS in Mesa are selling DEATH TRAP, BUCKET OF BOLTS  tohandicap and mentally challenged  consumers that are in dire need of a vehicle.

I have also just had an instance with SRP. I have been living with family for quite some time now. My mom is sick. I came to find that she was 3 payments behind on SRP, this when she was in the hospital. Being unemployed and waiting for congress to pass the extention, I don't have much money left but I caught the SRP up 2 months making it about 3 days late on the current bill. One week later SRP disconnects with no notice given. We at this point are 10 DAYS  late on our most current bill. When I asked a representative how this could be, he told me that their computer randomly selects people who HAVE been given notce and shuts the power off. One lottery that I don't want to win. My mom just got home from the hospital yesterday and is in need of oxygen (electricity needed) and they do this today. We have to pay a $70.00 reconnect fee on our next bill. They also charge a $20.00 fee if we wanted it back on today. Not really an option in this heat.47908409Flag this commentazpartsman said on July 16, 2010 at 2:15 PMCan anyone tell me when justice died and left SRP in charge.

If it had been tampered with why didn't they see it before and let us know. At that rate the tampering must not of been working and charged me $630.00 to put a new meter in( dont sound like much, but when you been laid off for 2 yrs and on SS and wife is ill and can;t work) and yes we are late in the summer but they get there money before they disconnect in these hard time there are a lot of people pay their bills late.

This irked me a little as we had filled out the first and sent it in the next day.  Then for the following month we recieved 2 more letters each week.  Now i know the census is important but TEN letters to the same address is a bit ridiculos. I wouldn't be writting this letter now but, a few weeks after that we got a notice on the door asking us to call a number and set up a time with a census taker to do a short interview. We immeadiately called the number and said this would not be necessary as we already filled it out and mailed it in, please return the call so you dont waste more of our taxpayers money and our time. Well no call, and guess what?

His Engine is sitting in my husbands Shop in our yard on an engine stand waiting for Chris to take it to the Machine shop along with the Pistons to have them Micked get all the seals, Valves, gaskets and such so Jeff can rebuild his engine and install it. Now Thank fully after Jeff speaking to him (Mike Dean) they have come to an agreement that Jeff will do all the work for him, Mike will pay for the parts and Machining then Pay jeff what ever is remaining from the original Agreement Minus the 600$ Deposit that Christopher still has and kept.32298246Flag this commentmaryburk said on November 18, 2009 at 10:11 AMshop waiting to be paid for and For Jeff to install. Chris Refuses to return any phone calls, Lies to the Customer telling him the engine is a remanufactured one, that it is almost finished. Customer shows up at our House wanting to know what is going on. Leaving Jeff Dumb Founded and looking like a total Idiot. After a discussion between Jeff and Jim, they both decided to just buy Jim a used engine and Jeff will install it for Jim for a fee. Jim gets his car back 3 days later AFTER Jeff and him speak. Meanwhile, Chris never bought not one part, not one quart of oil, nothing for Jim's Car. He took his money and refuses to return it.32298216Flag this commentmaryburk said on November 18, 2009 at 10:10 AMHello,  I Am not even sure where to start here. SO I'll just start from the beginning and try to get it all in there so here goes:In July/August My husband teamed up with his Boss Christopher Stanton to attempt to start their own business. The business is called "Az Engine Warehouse"( www.azenginewarehouse.com ) All went well for the first month or so. However, the Owner Chris would get customers Via his website he built, go meet with them, Require a $500.00 to $600.00 deposit from them to take their vehicle and repair the engines or replace them. From what we know of he has taken in deposits on 10 Possibly now 12 vehicles. From What I know the total amount in is like $8800.00. Here is the bad part, he drew up this contract with my husband and they brought in two other mechanics to do the work. He had rented A Shop in Glendale, AZ off of 54th avenue and Grand Ave. That didn't work out so well cause Chris old Partner Greg took over that shop and kicked Chris out for stealing funds32298124Flag this commentanapadilla92 said on November 14, 2009 at 11:55 AMthe problem is with the owner of the restaurant its a fast food place. email me with a respond please32113656Flag this commentanapadilla92 said on November 14, 2009 at 11:54 AMi have a problem at work with my boss there are many issues with him he is doing a lot of illegal things for example when we put in over time he doesnt pay it another is on holidays if you work you dont get paid more its like any other day.

When I spoke with the assit principle and mentioned that his responce was that it's ok for staff to enter that way because children aren't at the school yet. There were plenty of children at school this morning when Mr.Joyner entered the exit at around 7:45 am.  It's not just the staff though I see parents do this every day. When I have confronted them they say Oh, I didn't see the sign. Does ignorance give them an excuse to break the law and put our children at risk. I've been told that the school security would be notified and try to prevent this from happening but I've never seen them by the exit to do anything. I feel the school staff doesn't take this matter serious in order to make their own morning commute easier. I only hope this is resolved before an innocent child is hurt.31469124Flag this commentandrewl said on November 2, 2009 at 11:04 AMMy children attend school at San Tan Heights Elementry. There is a very high volume of traffic during School drop off and pick up times. Every morning I deal with cars speeding through school zones. I contacted the local police awhile back but the problem consists. There is another problem I deal with on a regular basis. Every day I see cars pulling in the exit of the school zone to prevent from waiting at the stop sign. I understand that it's frustrating when you have to wait about 2-5 minutes on average to turn. This is a result of cars speeding through the school zone and high volume of traffic. I even witnessed a school bus speeding through the zone.  I have contacted the school several times about the cars constantly entering the exit. About 2 weeks ago I spoke with the Assistant principle. Then today I spoke with Principle after seeing a teacher do this after I tried to stop him by pulling up next to him and pionting at the do not enter sign. He did it anyway.31468264Flag this commentchasemodblues said on October 11, 2009 at 4:44 PMPlease contact me by email and I will send phone numbers.
