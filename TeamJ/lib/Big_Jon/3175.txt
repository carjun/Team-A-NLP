But first let me tell you how I found those people. This is my story.There were other puppies and dogs where I grew up and they all looked a little like me. My brothers and sisters were playful and cuddly. We used to pile up together to take our naps and of course we stayed close to our mother. We all liked her warm milk and she licked us and told us how beautiful we were. I liked that feeling of being kissed and loved by my mother. Playing with my four legged family was also a lot of fun.See all 12 photosWith my new people - They call me TrudyPuppiesMelissa & Doug Puppy Pursuit Games(Doggy Detectives Game)Amazon Price: $18.99List Price: $29.99Snog: A Puppy's Guide to LoveAmazon Price: $7.67List Price: $19.99Precision Pet Puppy Pen with 1/2-Inch Mesh Floor 48 x 48 x 30", ChromeAmazon Price: $299.99Puppy-OpolyAmazon Price: $12.24List Price: $15.99How to Raise a Puppy You Can Live WithAmazon Price: $10.00List Price: $14.95Peek A-Boo PuppiesAmazon Price: $21.99Puppies For DummiesAmazon Price: $5.00List Price: $19.99Sticky Mosaics Posh PuppiesAmazon Price: $13.75List Price: $16.99Pet Stages Puppy Cool TeetherAmazon Price: $3.72List Price: $6.95Loving Family Puppy PlaytimeAmazon Price: $14.49List Price: $9.99But there were also people in the house with us and they were not so nice. The smaller people called kids would occasionally play with us and that was fun but it did not last long.When my brothers and sisters were still really small they would take all of us to a place on a busy highway and one by one my brothers and sisters were sold to people. The people that had my mother and us told the other people that we were each of us a black lab. It was hot and we were thirsty on those days and the big cars and trucks that went zooming by kind of scared us.One by one my brothers and sisters did not get to come home. The people seemed excited when they would give one of my family away and get some paper in their hands in exchange. It did not make any sense to me or my mother but when no one wanted to give some paper for me the people seemed to get angry.The man especially did not seem to like me! I was getting bigger and had some white fur mixed in with my black fur which he also did not seem to like. It wasn't my fault and I don't think it was my mother's fault either that I had some white and black fur! My mother still reassured me that I was beautiful even if he did not agree.He called me a "good for nothing dog." I thought that was my name.That man not only yelled at me but he also hit me and kicked me when he got angry. I was scared and hurt and nothing my mother could do helped.So one day I decided to run away.Only three dogs in this house! Reggie is on my left and Kerri is on my right.

He was hurting me and my mother couldn't kiss the hurts away any longer. I would be sore for days and even though I tried to hide from him, he always seemed to find me. I was not so little anymore and couldn't hide as well I guess.So one day I just left and tried to find a place where I wouldn't hurt all the time and be afraid all the time.In chatting with some other dogs on the street I found out about some people that not only had dogs living with them, but they seemed to take other puppies and dogs into their home and then find good places for them to live. The word on the street was that these were really good people.I followed the directions and decided to hide behind some shrubbery in their front yard and hope the bad man wouldn't see me and that the good people would.My doggie prayers were answered! They saw me and took me into their home. The man seemed OK but I did not want to take any chances. I would try and hide from him as much as I could.These new people put up signs saying that they had found a dog and also called all the vet offices and animal shelters letting them know that I was in their house. This made me very afraid that the evil man would find me and come to take me back home. But as time passed, I started to relax.I liked it in my new home. The other dogs were nice. One was older and her name was Kerri. She seemed to be the boss dog. The other dog's name was Reggie and he told me that he was taken into the people's home when he was a scared and abandoned puppy. They both seemed to be happy that I was there. They also assured me that the people were really nice and that they both loved them. They felt sure that I would grow to love them too.The people tried to find me another home but since I was so afraid of men it just did not seem to work out. I heard them say that if I was put into an animal shelter that I would probably not be adopted. So after a while they just decided to keep me.It was only a few days after the people found me hiding in their shrubbery that they named me Trudy. I heard them saying that they had to call me something besides Sweety or Baby. Trudy felt right and sounded good, so I liked my new name. It certainly sounded better than good for nothing dog.About one month after I came to live with them they finally took down those signs saying that they had found me. Kerri and Reggie told me that it was a good sign that I would be staying with them.Kerri had told Reggie the same thing when he had come to live there. When the signs came down...it was official that he would be joining the family. Kerri seemed to know all about these things. She was the oldest and wisest dog in the house. She was a bit bossy at times, but that was OK with me.I was one happy dog! I had a new family! Part of our backyard Part of our backyard near the spa where our people liked to soak sometimes.  Reggie and I liked to look over the fence and see what was going on in the yard behind us.The lady that lived behind us used to tell my parents that she thought it was cute when we peeked into her yard.I'm hiding under a chairI'm so relaxed!They give me good treats to chewI am beautiful just as my real mother told me I am!I am now a rescued dog and have a home of my own!Being rescued by my new parents (yes...I now thought of them as my parents just like Kerri and Reggie did) changed my life!I was still afraid of men but got to trusting my Daddy as he always seemed to love me. He gave me treats, petted me (once I was brave enough to first let him try it) and he even let me join them and sleep in their bed with the rest of the family. But when they had company I still wanted to hide away from those other people because there could have been an evil man who would want to hurt me. My new parents just let me disappear into other rooms away from the visitors, but they always kept the doors open.Eventually I was curious and would sneak out and just hide under a chair so that I could watch but still be partially hidden from view.All of those people that came to my parents home seemed nice so I got braver and braver.When my parents walked us on leashes on the sidewalk I was very afraid of people that we would meet and pull as far away from them as the leash would let me. But my parents kept telling me that it was OK and Reggie and Kerri also told me that my new parents would protect me so there was nothing to fear.Eventually I liked walking with them.As more time passed I would even look forward to parties in our home and I heard my parents say that I had turned into a regular "party girl." They seemed pleased about it. All I know is that I was happy and now liked all the people around me as well as my buddies Kerri and Reggie. Visiting Grandma Not only do I get to sleep on my parent's bed with them but my grandma in San Antonio let me sleep on her bed also when my parents would visit her.  She would move into another room so that we could all use her bigger bed.  She was a nice grandma!Animal Rescue-Jessie's Story through her eyes.This is Ethel's attempt at a brief fictionalised work.

Weather(provided by The Weather Channel) - 3 hours agoI grew older...As I grew older I would sometimes dream about my real four-legged mother and wonder how she was doing. I hope those people never hit or kicked her like they did to me. All those other people seemed to care about was that my mother would have more puppies and they could get more paper when they would give them away. I hope that her life was not too hard for her.I knew that she would be happy for me that I found such a good home.My parents had me spayed so that I could not have puppies and I was kind of glad that my only job was to love them and make them happy. I did my best especially after I had gotten to know and trust them. I loved them with all of my heart! So now you know my very own dog rescue story. Signed,TrudyMore of the pictures that I like...

What a great story. I especially like the photo of the two tinkers peeking into next door. Its strange isn't it how its usually the men who rescued dogs are scared off. I shall link this hub to Jessie's story if that's ok with you.Peggy W17 months ago Hi Ethel,Obviously a man had abused our Trudy and it took her a long time to trust men again.  She warmed up to women much faster.  Eventually she learned to trust all people and it was wonderful to see her blossom in front of our eyes.You always have my permission to link hubs you like to yours.  We animal lovers have to keep spreading the word about humane ways to treat God's creatures.  They are such a blessing!Thanks for the comment.Pete Maida17 months ago Trudy has found a wonderful home.  This is a good hub for National Dog Day.  I hope every dogs gets a good home, but I just don't want to take care of pets.Peggy W17 months ago Hi Pete,This was done in memory of Trudy as she has long since gone to the Great Beyond.  I wrote about our first dog Kelly, the Irish Setter and may do one about each of our other ones...Kerri and Reggie.  Trudy was our last dog.Trudy did end up with a good home after her bad start in life.  I had no idea that this was National Dog Day.Thanks for the comment.Eternal Evolution17 months ago Great hub, it's always good to here a rescue story. I have fostered many strays myself. Curently i have 2 boston terriers that i rescued from a breeding kennel. it's a male and femal pair, both adults. neither of them were in good shape when i got them but they are doing a lot better now.Peggy W17 months ago Hello Eternal Evolution,Welcome!  Always nice to hear of other kind hearted folks who do their best to foster strays or help animals in any way that they are able.  Hope your rescue of your boston terriors turns out well and that they find great homes if you do not decide to keep them for yourself.Thanks for the comment.Dolores Monet17 months ago Peggy, they say there are so many animals at the shelters now, it would be impossible to find homes for them all. It is so sad. This was a lovely and inspirational story.We just rescued a kitten - outside under a car in the dark on a stormy night, he was skinny and scared. I never was into cats but I am now.Peggy W17 months ago Hi Dolores,So nice of you to rescue that little kitten.  Our two cats, Dusty and Peaches were both full grown when we rescued them.  And yes...they have a way of worming their way into your heart.  What is your kitten's name?If only people would spay and neuter their pets there would not be such an over-population and so many would not have to be destroyed.This economy is (I am sure) also impacting people being able to keep their pets.  More animals than ever are ending up in the shelters, as you pointed out.Glad you liked this hub and thanks for your comment.charamia217 months ago This is a great story! Your dog is very lucky to have such a loving owner. I myself am a dog lover and can totally relate to your story. When we first got our Boston Terrier (Dozer) he had a lot of scabs and bumps on his head and im pretty sure there was some abuse going on, it is horrible that people treat animals like that. I wish you and your dog the best of luck!Peggy W17 months ago Hello charamia2,Nice to meet another animal lover and one who rescues dogs.  Did you get Dozer from a shelter or find him homeless on the streets like we did our Trudy?Thanks for your comment.kiran817 months ago Lovely, touching article Peggy...Peggy W17 months ago Hi Kiran,Glad that you enjoyed Trudy's Dog Rescue story.  She certainly was a sweetie!  Thanks for the comment.shibashake17 months ago What a lovely story. I am glad that Trudy found you and your family.There really should be laws against puppy mills and backyard breeders who just treat dogs like commodities. I always remove all their crappy Google AdSense links whenever I see them.Peggy W17 months ago Hi shibashake,We are also glad that Trudy chose us and that we were the ones who were able to rescue her from who knows what kind of life.I agree with you about the puppy mills and backyard breeders.You are smarter than I am...How do you remove Google AdSense links that you do not like?  Is there a way to delete just the ones you don't want on a specific hub?Thanks for the comment.shibashake17 months ago "Is there a way to delete just the ones you don't want on a specific hub?"You can delete ones you don't like, but it will be account wide - so they won't appear on any of your hubs, blogs, or website.You can do that by going into your AdSense account, choose the AdSense Setup tab, and then select the Competitive Ad Filter option.I have more detailed instructions here-http://hubpages.com/hub/Google-AdSense-Secret-GuidYou want to be careful though that you don't over-filter things out either. But I generally remove all the buy-a-puppy sites from my AdSense.I only found out about this recently too while poking around in my AdSense account :)Peggy W17 months ago Hello again shibashake,Thank you for this information.  Will check it out.  I appreciate it.Enelle Lamb16 months ago What a great story! I loved the pictures - thanks so much for sharing such a wonderful life changing event (for all involved) with us. I have never rescued a dog, but I have recently made my home available for a stray cat - he has adopted the food dish, and the outside step to nap, with the occasional excursion indoors for a quick pet and then gone again...but that's alright. Even if he never adopts us as family I am happy to supply him with food and a safe place to visit.Peggy W16 months ago Hello Enelle,Glad that you liked Trudy's dog rescue story.  Nice to hear that you are taking care of that stray cat.  If you determine that there is no other owner, hopefully you will consider having him neutered?Would be a kindness for him as well as helping the cat overpopulation problem.  So many never end up getting good homes.We had a feral cat spayed once.  She had delivered kittens in our shrubbery.  We helped feed the kittens...found homes for them and then had the mother cat trapped, spayed and then released.  All of her life she depended upon us for food and shelter (in our garage) but we were never able to pet her.  She was one eyed and the vet that spayed her said that humans had done that to her...removed the eye.  No WONDER she did not trust people.  She was solid black.At least she did not bring more kittens into this life.  We always called her "Momma Kitty" as she was so young when she had her batch of kittens and she never got very big herself.Thanks for your comment.maggs22416 months ago What a lovely way to write this story from the dogs perspective, I have written two hubs one about a Belgium Shepherd we called Paddy who found us and another about Scraggy who we looked after for six months both had happy outcomes. Lovely storyPeggy W16 months ago Greetings maggs224,Thanks for commenting on Trudy's dog rescue story.  Will go take a look at yours if on hubpages.  Nice to know you also had good outcomes with the ones you rescued.loveroflife16 months ago Trudy appears to have been a very special dog.  But, aren't they all?Peggy W16 months ago Hello loveroflife,Yes, after we rescued Trudy she turned into the most loving of big hearted dogs one would ever wish to have.  Obviously from your comment you are an animal lover as are we.  Thanks!DDB9915 months ago Peggy, I love your rescue story! My two dogs were rescue dogs as well! Mine came from an animal shelter. Our oldest dog, Rosie, was one of about 10 dogs, chained outside most of the time. The vet told us that it is evident by her teeth that she tried to chew through her metal chain. :(  Rosie came to us scared and skittish but she has turned out to be such a loyal and faithful dog! Trudy sounds like a wonderful  dog!Peggy W15 months ago Hello DDB99,Rosie obviously found a good home when she got you as a "mom."  I'm a big believer in adopting from animal shelters as well.  Trudy did turn out to be such a sweetie and enriched our lives as I know Rosie and your other dog is doing for you.  Thanks for the comment.Carmen Borthwick15 months ago Thank you for sharing this heartfelt story with all of us. You have a gift for pulling readers into the place of which you write. I saw the world through Trudy's eyes and shed a tear or two of sadness, but ultimately happiness.Peggy W15 months ago Hello Carmen,So happy that you liked Trudy's story.  It did end on a very happy note.  We used to call her the "Queen Bee" when she had fully emerged from her shell and became a very happy dog in our house.  Thanks for the comment.Suki C14 months ago I so enjoyed reading Trudy's story and I loved the photos - especially where they're being nosey peering over the fence :))Trudy's white face reminded me of my old dog Suki (my user name is taken from her!!) She started to go white around the muzzle at a very young age and people always thought she was much older than she was - she eventually died aged 16.This has inspired me to start writing my own hub about abandoned animals my husband and myself have taken in since moving to Spain - including several puppies found in dustbins that we bottle fed!It's an uphill battle - but we can't just stand by!!!!Peggy W14 months ago Ah Suki...you are a kind hearted soul for helping to rescue those puppies and others.  Glad that you liked this story about our dog Trudy.  Like your dog Suki, Trudy started getting white around her face early on and people also thought that she was much older.  Please do write hubs about your rescue efforts and the animals in your life.  Thanks!Suki C14 months ago I really want to write more - the trouble is - I log on here and get distracted by reading all the other wonderful hubs and comments - I seriously need to discipline myself! lolPeggy W14 months ago Hi Suki,That is half the fun of writing on hubpages...getting to know other hubbers through their writing and comments.  I try to do a little of both.  You are off to a great start with your first two hubs.  Will eagerly await seeing what else you have "up your sleeve" so-to-speak.habee8 months ago Bless you, Peggy! Hubby and I have rescued many animals, too. Give Trudy a hug for me!Peggy W8 months ago Hi habee,Can no longer hug Trudy as she is now gone, but will give Skippy, Peaches and Dusty hugs.  Nice to hear that you have also rescued animals!Claudia4 months ago Hi,I came across your page as I just named my rescue puppy Trudy and I was looking for other doggies that were named Trudy :-) My Trudy is a 5 months old Shepherd-Lab mix, she was a stray, just like your Trudy and also seems a bit more shy around men... poor babies! This is only day 3, but she is already bouncing around the house, playing with her big sister, a chocolate lab, and trying to make friends with Leo, the cat (also a shelter rescue). Leo is just a bit grumpy, but I know that he will love Trudy in a little while. Thanks for sharing your story!Peggy W4 months ago Hi Claudia,You are a kind hearted soul to rescue animals and I hope that Trudy gives you as much love and affection and happiness as our Trudy gave to us.  Thanks for your comment and come back after a while and give us an update if you think about it.Joni4 months ago This is such a wonderful dog rescue story. I had tears streaming down my face. Thank you for sharing it and I do hope it will inspire someone to consider pet rescue or foster and help the homeless pets.I have a couple of hub pages about "humane pet clip art".SELL MY ART4 months ago Wonderful story Peggy, I have a rescue dog and three other dogs that look like Trudy, dogs are a big part of my life. They enrich us beyond belief and it's a privellege to share space with them.Peggy W4 months ago Hello Joni,It would seem from your comment that you also have a soft heart when it comes to rescuing dogs like our Trudy.  Thanks for stopping by and leaving your comment.Peggy W4 months ago Hello SELL MY ART,I totally agree with you.  Dogs definitely enrich our lives!  Enjoy your Trudy look-a-likes and thanks for the comment.erthfrend3 months ago This is one of my favorite hubs! I am such a dog lover and an advocate for helping homeless pets, rescuing pets, adoption, all of it!!! I just loved the way you wrote this story and am so thankful that Trudy was fortunate enough to get to live the wonderful life she so much deserved! Thank you for this awesome hub!!!Peggy W3 months ago Hello erthfrend,We are kindred spirits!  We have rescued more dogs than I can count or remember!  Trudy was so afraid at first but turned into a confident and loving family member over time.  She was such a sweetie!  Thanks for your wonderful comment.dahoglund13 days ago Our current situation is much like this.  We got a Siberian Husky from a rescue shelter this recently. She is probably about a year and a half old. It's not clear what treatment she got before we got her but she is very shy of people. She barks at people who come in the house with some exceptions but can take her to the pet store that allows you to bring your pets in and she behaves pretty well.I think she is fearful of her own space or turf. Still trying to figure out how to socialize her.I also have to persuade her that I am not a dog sled and she has to learn to walk with me and not try to pull me.Peggy W13 days ago Hi dahoglund,Nice that you took a dog from a shelter!  Your Siberian Husky is still young.  Does that store that lets you bring pets into it also have dog training classes?  That might be the answer in teaching her how to walk by your side, etc.  With your love and time, hopefully she will know that her home is now permanent.  So sad that some people take on an animal quite like a disposible object.  It is (should be) a lifetime commitment!  What did you name her?dahoglund13 days ago Her name is Lelah which name the shelter gave to her.She is pretty settled in. We bought a crate for her before we knew what dog we would get.She spends a lot of time in it.I ttied the dog backpack thing with her but when she walk close the  it keeps bump into my leg.Huskies are unconventional dogs. she shows no interest in chasing balls and such. I probably confuse her bcausse to get her exercise I sometimes take her where she can run a bit on an extended leash, she may get confused on when it is ok to run and when not to. at times she walks along perfectl. we'll figure it out eventually.Peggy W13 days ago What a nice name...Lelah.  Is there anyplace that she can run free and get some unconstrained exercise?  We have dog parks down here and they are separated between big dogs and small dogs.  Inside the fencing the dogs get to run and play and the big dogs always seem to have the most fun.  I realize in smaller towns they probably don't have the money for such things but maybe there is another place she can burn off some steam?  That is an old saying!  Haha!  Wonder if people use that terminology in this day and age?dahoglund13 days ago I think that metaphor is still used. In Rapids dog are not even allowed in parks and playgrounds. If she wer a Lab or colli I would let her run free or throw a ball for her. Huskies are not to be trusted off a leash. Our last dog was half Husky and would be off like a shot if she noticed she was not attached to anything. They also leap fences or dig under them. This dog has not been quite as fast as our former one was but it seems to be part of their DNA.Thye are called the Houdinis of the dog world.Thanks for commenting.Peggy W13 days ago Hi dahoglund,I did not realize that about Huskies.
