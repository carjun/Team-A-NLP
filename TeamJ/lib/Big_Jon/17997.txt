Gabrielle Giffords is in critical condition on a ventilator after being shot through the back of the left side of her head, yet doctors are cautiously optimistic about her survival. That she is alive at all is surprising to many people, but people survive these types of injuries more often than you may think.While every patient and injury is different, on average  around 2/3 of patients with a gunshot wound (GSW) to the head dont live long enough to make it to the hospital. Of the third that do make it, only 50% of those patients survive longer than 30 days. And of course, those numbers say nothing of long-term neurological function in the survivors.So far, according to her doctors, Giffords is likely to be in the small minority of patients who will beat the odds. So, what placed those odds in her favor?First off, she received very quick care, and was in the operating room within 38 minutes after arriving at the hospital. Her overall health and youth also provide some benefit. The injury was a through and through injury, meaning there was both an entry and exit wound. Thats significant because some of the energy of the bullet was dissipated into space, as opposed to all within her cranial cavity.Neurosurgeons will want to know if the bullet passed across the midline of the brain. If it does, there is a much poorer likelihood of survival. In Giffords' case, it did not. Other positive factors: Her blood pressure didn't drop as a result of the bleeding, and the oxygen supply in her body was maintained, according to her doctors that I interviewed.Finally, the fact Giffords was following commands even before she had an operation was a very positive sign.To follow commands signifies a higher level of brain function than simple reflexive movement. It indicates that she was able to hear the command. She was able to process the meaning of that command, and finally, she was able to execute the command. I spoke to Dr. Randall Friese, the trauma surgeon who examined Giffords when she arrived at the hospital. He told me she was clearly able to understand him, and squeezed his hand when asked to do so. And, after the operation, Giffords was still able to follow commands.During an operation like this, doctors want to control bleeding, remove fragments of bone that have penetrated the brain, and remove any dead brain tissue along the trajectory of the bullet.Also, her neurosurgeon, Dr. Michael Lemole, removed additional bone on the left side of her head, as I explain in the video above. That is called a craniectomy, and is done to prevent the catastrophic consequences of brain swelling, which is a big and real concern over the next several days. Think of it like this: Unlike organs in others parts of your body, if the brain swells, it has no place to expand - as it is confined by the rigid skull. Because Lemole removed portions of the skull, he provided extra room for the brain to swell. Incidentally, the bone thats removed is saved, and put back in the head during a future operation.In medicine and surgery, doctors are reluctant to quote statistics, because every patient is a true individual that includes Gabrielle Giffords. And, no doubt, Giffords is not out of the woods yet. But, cautiously optimistic sounds pretty good after an injury as devastating as this one.Post by: Dr. Sanjay Gupta - CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Filed under: BrainDr. Sanjay Gupta We recommendFrom around the webNext entry Should I give my 1-year-old milk?

The news on CNN states that within seconds he was on the ground propping her head up so that she could breath easier as well as using his bare hands to minimize bleeding. When employees brought out smocks, he then applied pressure using those to apply pressure to the wound. He held her hand the entire ride to the hospital which I'm sure was priceless in helping to minimize the shock she was experiencing.

I believe there are arguments for and against gun control  Making it tougher to obtain guns will only prevent honest people from obtaining them.  Unless guns are elliminated from this earth, there is nothing to prevent a determined individual from obtaining a device that will shoot a projectile.  Whether it be home-made or purpose-built, if there is criminal intent, that individual will figure out a way.  So, we elliminate ALL firearms from the face of the earth . . .  then we start elliminating ANYTHING that can be used as a weapon?  Where do we stop?Instead of becoming a closed-in society where we live in constant fear, why don't we make bigger examples of individuals that can not live by the rule of law?  Have fun with that one . . .January 10, 2011 at 11:37 | Report abuse | DPSorry, my comment was specifically referencing the idea that EVERYONE should be carrying guns.

I don't care if people can carry strapped, own a small arnsenal, whateverbut you should have to pass a psych eval and have a longer waiting period to allow for a better background check. The latter probably wouldn't have helped here, but the first would've. I doubt having anyone else armed would've helped, unless you're talking about a trained individual. People really underestimate what adrenaline and shock can do to your ability to act effectively.January 10, 2011 at 12:56 | Report abuse | Colin in FloridaIn England and Australia it's almost impossible for average people to own handguns.

If the public were "armed to the teeth" there wouldn't be "36 people with weapons drawn when the police arrive".  There would be a dead murderer, fewer victims and hundreds of witnesses to help the police sort it out.  An armed citizen that just shot a mass murderer is not going to be pointing a weapon at the police.  He will be handing his weapon to the police. Your solution to "wait for the police" resulted in a lot of dead bodies in this case.January 10, 2011 at 23:54 | Report abuse | emunadateWe need to find better security to protect our people.

It just seems that the congress woman got treatment first because of all the publicity due to her being a public servant and the apparent "target" in the attack. just because I didn't read (or see) as much coverage about the treatment of the man and his wife, doesn't mean that they weren't cared for quickly....or the other 3 victims for that matter.  I did read in another article that the 9 y.o. was shot in the chest and was pronounced dead later at the hospital after attempts to revive her.If this had not been an assaination attempt on a public servant or there be a 9 y.o. girl born on 9/11/01 involved, it wouldn't get this much attention.

This is a free country. Police presence at every public political gathering would turn our country into a fascist state. The better solution is for our leaders in govt to lead by example.
