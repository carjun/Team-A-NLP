The new GOP majority in the House of Representatives will wage a campaign to disable health reform, financial regulation, and the EPA; stonewall executive and judicial appointments; slash nondefense discretionary spending (thus undermining the economic recovery); gut Social Security and Medicare; and launch investigations into every possible White House indiscretionpotentially leading to a vote for impeachment. Democrats only recourse will be to practice what Howard Dean famously derided as damage controlto abandon hope for big progressive accomplishments and hunker down until 2012, like the Clinton administration did after the Gingrich Revolution, defending government from the worst excesses of those who would like to eliminate it altogether.Theres only one problem with this scenario: the time-frame. Politicos and pundits are used to thinking in two-year cycles, and its easy to convince oneself that, in 2012, Obama will be able to capitalize on an improved economy, favorable voter-turnout patterns, and aweak GOP presidential field in order to sweep into office with a renewed mandate. But that misses a big part of the picture. Even if Obama wins reelection by a comfortable margin, its most likely that the House will remain in Republican hands and Democrats will lose seats in, and perhaps control of, the Senateand beyond that, Republicans will probably do fairly well in 2014. In other words, we could be looking not at two years of damage control, but sixMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesDemocrats, Democrats regaining control of Congress, House reapportionment of seats, The House, The SenateRead moreToday in Congress1/7/11.January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsBy David Waldman @Dailykos..I have something special for you to see today.

John Boehner (R-OH)Republicans deficit reduction platform, which may have helped catapult them into the majority, is about to run headlong into a hard reality: Many of their key policy goals will increase the deficit dramatically.To get around this fact, theyve included measures in their new rules package to exempt some of their biggest legislative priorities from deficit consideration. Among the exceptions, which the House is likely to consider in the 112th Congress, are the health care repeal bill (scheduled for a vote a week from Wednesday), the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts, an AMT patch, extending the estate tax, and more.Read more Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesGOP backs away from Budget cuts, New Rules in the House, The Deficit, The HouseRead moreThe House AND Senate are trying for Operating Rules Changes.January 4, 2011jamesb101No commentsBy David Waldman @ Dailykos.Heres the 411 on the House.Hey there, Constitution fans! If you thoughtreading the Constitution out loud in the House of Representatives was all the founding document-y goodness there was contained in the Republican changes to the House Rules, dont worry!Theres more!And then they will require that every new bill contain a statement by the lawmaker who wrote it citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation.This is far more awesome, obviously, than the existing House Rule XIII (d)(1):(d) Each report of a committee on a public bill or public joint resolution shall contain the following:(1) A statement citing the specific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution to enact the law proposed by the bill or joint resolution.The statement of constitutional authority is being moved from the committee report, which is written after a bill is refined and amended in committee, to a slip of paper that accompanies the bill as its introduced,before all the changes are made.That should be pretty awesome right there! (Hey, I wonder what they would have put on that slip of paper for the 1996line-item veto legislation they passed, and that was later struck down by the Supreme Court. Im sure they can totally show the Court the piece of paper next time. Thatll learn em, the sociamalists!)There are also a couple ofsomewhat less exciting changesbeing made, too:Committee name changes: The Committee on Education and Labor will become the Committee on Education and Workforce, and the Committee on Science and Technology will become the Committee on Science, Space and Technology.The Committee on Education and Workforce, of course, is what Republicans used to call the same committee the last time they had the majority, enshrining their hatred for even thewordlabor. Actually, at first  in 1995  they called it the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, but I guess that was a little too dumb sounding even for them, and they switched it in 1997.The Committee on Science and Technology, of course, used to be called the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, only that was under the Democrats, who added Space to the name in 1987. In 1995, when Republicans took over, they deleted both Spaceand Technology, going with just the Committee on Science. Democrats re-added Technology in 2007. And now, Republicans will show how awesome they are by re-adding Space. (Dont tell them that Democrats were the ones who added Space the first time, or they might not do it!)The grown-ups are back in charge at last!Yes, there are more changes. And more serious ones at that. Well get to them. For right now, I just wanted you to know that U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! Number one! Wooooooo! America!!!! F yeah!!!!Heres the 411 on the SenateBy now youre aware that the effort to reform Senate rules kicks off, thanks to the efforts of Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) and his supporters, on the first day of the new Congress  this Wednesday, January 5th.Much has been made of the connection between Senate rules reform and that first day, but there are a few finer points that deserve discussion, and that might help you make sense of events as they unfold.First of all, we should get some sense of where the significance of the first day comes from. Weve discussed before how the Senate has in the past reconciled its constitutional right to adopt its own rules of procedure with its tradition as a continuing body. And perhaps the most comprehensive statement of how this paradox has been viewed comes from a 1957 advisory opinion delivered from the chair by then-Vice President (and President of the Senate) Richard Nixon, during a similar effort to reform Senate rules.Just to set this up for you, at the time he delivered this opinion, a motion to adopt new rules changes was the pending business, and reform opponents had moved to table the proposal, prompting one Senator to ask just what rules the Senate was then proceeding under:The constitutional provision under which only one-third of the Senate membership is changed by election in each Congress can only be construed to indicate the intent of the framers that the Senate should be a continuing parliamentary body for at least some purposes. By practice for 167 years the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another.The Constitution also provides that each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. This constitutional right is lodged in the membership of the Senate and it may be exercised by a majority of the Senate at any time. When the membership of the Senate changes, as it does upon the election of each Congress, it is the Chairs opinion that there can be no question that the majority of the new existing membership of the Senate, under the Constitution, have the power to determine the rules under which the Senate will proceed.The question, therefore, is, How can these two constitutional mandates be reconciled?It is the opinion of the Chair that while the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another, the right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming as it does from the Constitution itself, cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a majority of the Senate in a previous Congress.Any provision of Senate rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it desires to proceed is, in the opinion of the Chair, unconstitutional. It is also the opinion of the Chair that Section 3 of Rule 22 in practice has such an effect.The Chair emphasizes that this is only his own opinion, because under Senate precedents, a question of constitutionality can only be decided by the Senate itself, and not by the Chair.At the beginning of a session in a newly elected Congress, the Senate can indicate its will in regard to its rules in one of three ways:First. It can proceed to conduct its business under the Senate rules which were in effect in the previous Congress and thereby indicate by acquiescence that those rules continue in effect. This has been the practice in the past.Second. It can vote negatively when a motion is made to adopt new rules and by such action indicate approval of the previous rule.Third. It can vote affirmatively to proceed with the adoption of new rules.Turning to the parliamentary situation in which the Senate now finds itself, if the motion to table should prevail, a majority of the Senate by such action would have indicated its approval of the previous rules of the Senate, and those rules would be binding on the Senate for the remainder of this Congress unless subsequently changed under those rules.If, on the other hand, the motion to lay on the table shall fail, the Senate can proceed with the adoption of rules under whatever procedures the majority of the Senate approves.In summary, until the Senate at the initiation of a new Congress expresses its will otherwise, the rules in effect in the previous Congress in the opinion of the Chair remain in effect, with the exception that the Senate should not be bound by any provision in those previous rules which denies the membership of the Senate the power to exercise its constitutional right to make its own rules. (Congressional Record, 85th Congress, 1st Session, January 4, 1957, pp. 178-179.)So what does that mean in terms of the importance of the first day? What it really means is that at some point before the Senate begins conducting its substantive business, there needs to be some clear and early objection to the continuance of the old rules. Its really about heading into the business of the new Congress with a clear definition of what rules will and will not be continuing in force, rather than being anything magical about the first day. The first day is just the best opportunity to guarantee that you can get that rules discussion started before any substantive business is conducted.Thats the key.During the last successful fight to change cloture rules, in 1975, that key objection was indeed made on the first day of the 94th Congress, but rather than have it out right then and there, the Senate agreed to a unanimous consent request to lock in all the rights Senators had to object to the rules on the first day, but postpone the actual debate until later that month:Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, in order to nail down doubly the protection accorded to the Senator and his cosponsors, I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding any delay in the consideration of the resolution, all proceedings, rights and privileges, concerning the efforts to change rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate be reserved, so that proponents of such a change not be prejudiced in any way in the actual commencement of the consideration of this resolution.As a result of the agreement, the 1975 rules reform debate actually stretched into early March of that year. Theoretically, the same could happen today.But youre probably already thinking that getting unanimous consent on this issue in the 112th Congress is probably about as close to impossible as anything can be.So what might happen instead? Well, the reform-minded Senators might have to stay there and fight  something that would have to start on Wednesday, but might actually continue for quite some time  all the while objecting to the conduct of substantive business under the old rules.The situation is somewhat complicated by Senate rules and practices (what a surprise!) such as, well, the definition of what constitutes the first day as well as how to define substantive business. Yes, even the definition of a day is like something out of Wonderland in the Senate. Because a legislative dayisnt the same thing as a calendar day:legislative day  A day that starts when the Senate meets after an adjournment and ends when the Senate next adjourns. Hence, a legislative day may extend over several calendar days or even weeks and months.If the Senate breaks in its proceedings with a recess rather than deciding to adjourn, the next calendar day is still a part of the same legislative day. So if theres no adjournment, the first day of the new Congress could  by this definition  last for days, weeks, or even months.As for what constitutes the kind of substantive business that could signal the acquiescence of the Senate to the old rules, nobodys sure exactly what that could mean, either. Most assume its the consideration of bills, resolutions, nominations and the like. But others say its any business, perhaps as routine as having the Senate chaplain offer an opening prayer. The definitive word will come from the Senate Parliamentarians office, and as usual, theyre not talking to the public, and neither is anyone whos talking to them.Well have to wait and see to find out whose definitions theyre working with, and what that might require reform leaders to do.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Other Things, Politics, Updates112th Congress, Congress, Democrats in the Senate, Filibuster Rule change, House AND Senate are trying for Operating Rules Changes, Republicans/GOP, Rule changes, The House, The SenateRead moreThe Lame Duck 111th Congress was busy..December 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsThe Capitol building stands in Washington, D.C.(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)While the US Congress took almost all of its last year wrestling with HealthcareThe last few days have been feverishThe list of accomplishments have been surprisingly goodHeres the few I can remember.Feel free to add more to my list which I will update..The Stimulus.The Wall Street Economic Reform BillThe Healthcare BillThe Obama Tax Deal ..Dont AskDont Tell Repeal.The Defense Budget.The 9/11 Healthcare BillThe START Treaty ratificationTwo Supreme Court Justices The Food Inspection Bill.The College Education BillThe Pay Equity Bill***However history judges the 535 men and women in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate the past two years, one thing is certain: The 111th Congress made more law affecting more Americans since the Great Society legislation of the 1960s.For the first time since PresidentTheodore Roosevelt began the quest for a national health-care system more than 100 years ago, the Democrat-led House and Senate took the biggest step toward achieving that goal by giving 32 million Americans access to insurance. Congress rewrote the rules for Wall Street in the most comprehensive way since the Great Depression. It spent more than $1.67 trillion to revive an economy on the verge of a depression, including tax cuts for most Americans, jobs for more than 3 million, construction of roads and bridges and investment in alternative energy; ended an almost two-decade ban against openly gay men and women serving in the military, and today ratified a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia.Before adjournment today, Congress approved legislation to help rescuers and clean-up crews suffering from illnesses linked to the wreckage caused by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. The Senate approved it on a voice vote, the House by a vote of 206-60. New York SenatorsCharles Schumer andKirsten Gillibrand, in a statement, called it a Christmas miracle.For all of its ambitious achievement, the 111th Congress, which may adjourn this week, also witnessed a voter-backlash driven by a 9.6 percentunemployment rate that cost Democrats control of the House and diminished their Senate majority.This is probably the most productive session of Congress since at least the 60s, saidAlan Brinkley, a historian at New Yorks Columbia University.

Some liberal-leaning writers, in particular, have suggested that Democrats have played a poor game of poker, having folded their hand before they really needed to.Im more inclined toagree with my colleague David Leonhardt, however: the Democrats position  while perhaps not backing them all the way into a corner  is not very strong.There are essentially three possible outcomes in the debate: first, that the tax cuts are extended for everyone; second, that they are extended for no one; and third, that they are extended only below some threshold, most likely $250,000 for couples (although alternatives like $500,000 and $1 million have been proposed).The way in which Republicans would rank these outcomes is clear. Their first preference would be to extend the tax cuts for everyone. But presumably, when push comes to shove, theyd prefer to extend some of the tax cuts  on incomes below $250,000  instead of ending all of them.Its a little bit more difficult to identify the preferences of Democrats, because there are more divisions within the party: between the president and Congress, between moderate Democrats and liberal ones, between Democrats who are electorally vulnerable and those who arent. It is safe to say, however, that on balance, the Democrats would prefer to extend the tax cuts only below the $250,000 threshold, and not above it.This is also the most popular choice among the general public.Four recent polls  from CBS News, Gallup, The Associated Press, and CNN  find an average of 49 percent of Americans preferring this position, versus 33 percent who would rather see all of the tax cuts extended and 14 percent who would like to see all of them expire. (Another 4 percent are undecided.)So, the theory goes, if Democrats would prefer extending the tax cuts for incomes below $250,000 to letting all of them expire, and so would Republicans  and so, for that matter, would the general public  then what, exactly, is the rub? Not that victories in Congress ever come easily, but shouldnt this be a fight that the Democrats can win?The problem with this theory is that it relies, implicitly, on the assumption that the Democrats can take the third option  extending the tax cuts for everyone  off the table. If the Democrats could do this, then they would be in a very strong position. But this is not so easy to do.Read moreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Politics, The Economy, Updates2010 Midterm Election results, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Politics, Polls, President Obama, Republicans/GOP, The House, The Tax cut Dilemma for the DemocratsRead moreThe Dream Act Updates.December 3, 2010jamesb1013 commentsHeres the latest on the legislation that would create a path for citizenship for immigrant studentsThe Act has been changed to garner more GOP votes in both HousesWhich isnt necessarily badThats the way things work in Congress.Heres the story in the House.Legislation carving a path to legal residency for thousands of illegal immigrant students will hit the House floor next week, according to a leading Democratic supporter.Democrats had hoped to move the DREAM Act through the Rules Committee as early as Thursday, setting up a Friday floor vote. But, with no votes scheduled for Friday, leaders simply ran out of time, pushing consideration of the bill to next week, according to Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.).We are still on track to pass the DREAM Act in the House, but we ran out of time to have a vote this week, so it looks like we will have it next week, Gutierrez said in a statement. We have to follow certain rules in the House and do things in a certain order to call bills to the floor and we ran out of time for the DREAM Act this week.A House aide familiar with the debate floated another reason for the delay: A handful of CBO hangups led Democrats to scrap their plan to consider the bill this week, the aide said, referring to the Congressional Budget Office.On Thursday, CBO estimated the bill would reduce the deficit by $1.4 billion over the next decade. The figure reflects a $1.4 billion increase in on-budget deficits, and a $2.8 billion decrease in off-budget deficits, CBO noted. Only on-budget figures are considered under pay-as-you-go budget rules adopted by the House.Earlier in the day, Gutierrez indicated the bill has enough support to pass through the lower chamber.Im encouraged, he told The Hill, because the obstacles appear procedural in nature  its not the votes.More from the Hill.Heres the story in the Senate.DREAM Act gets watered down, and latest whip countbykosThe GOP has sent out marching orders to its members  vote no on everything. But a handful have to deal with a growing Latino population in their states or districts. Others want to do the right thing. Thus the DREAM Act is a dilemma for several of them. The act would legalize the children of undocumented immigrants who either complete two years of college or serve in the military.Thus in a bid to bring aboard the 7-9 Republicans necessary to pass, thefollowing changes have been made to DREAM Act:The latest version, filed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) late Tuesday night, would bar illegal immigrants from receiving in-state college tuition; drops the age of eligibility to 29 from 34; would not grant permanent legal status to anyone for at least 10 years; would restrict eligibility for those who commit certain misdemeanor crimes; and would limit individuals from being able to sponsor family members for U.S. citizenship, among other changes.Those who receive conditional legal status under the DREAM Act also would be ineligible for Medicaid, food stamps and other government-funded benefits.These changes are designed to appease Republicans who want to prove to everyone that theyre big assholes. No in-state tuition? If anything, why not allow the states to make that decision? Instead, Republicans seek to put up further roadblocks for those kids getting educated and trying to live the American dream. These changes universally scream, were going to be assholes simply because thats what we are  assholes.Mission accomplished. Theyre a bunch of assholes. Thank heavens, too, because Im sure the DREAM kids didnt have enough assholes to deal with already.That said, this thing is still worth passing, because itll still be a lifesaver for many undocumented youngsters who are in America by no fault of their own, yet are American in every possible way. Penalizing children for something that isnt their fault is about as low as an elected official can go.Heres the whip count as of early this morning, apparently before these changes were introduced:GOP probably voting yes:Bennett (UT)Lugar (IN)Murkowski (AK)DEMS probably voting no:Baucus (MT)Conrad (ND)Manchin (WV)Nelson (NE)Pryor (AR)Tester (MT)Now we have a poll in the field in Montana, last calls are being done right now, to see how Montanans view the issue. One thing is for sure, if Tester votes no on this bill, then this site wont lift a finger to help him in his 2012 reelection bid. We dont help people who are assholes to innocent kids.Conrad, Manchin, Nelson, and Tester all face tough reelections in 2012. Baucus, Manchin, Nelson and Pryor are members in good standing of the asshole caucus.GOPers who might vote yesBrownback (KS)Brown (MA)Collins (ME)Gregg (NH)Hutchison (TX)Kirk (IL)LeMieux (FL)Snowe (ME)Ensign (NV)Voinovich (OH)Hutchison and LeMieux (who was a placeholder appointee) are both under particularly intense pressure from home state Latino Republicans, faith groups, university presidents, etc. Hutchison is going to get teabagged, so her vote may be an indication of how she plans to proceed  if she votes no, itll likely be because she still thinks she can win a Republican primary. If she votes yes, consider it the first sign that shell run as an independent. LeMieux represents a state with a large Latino population (and a significantly Republican one, too). But he seems to have caught the Senate bug and rumors are that hell be back for another shot at the seat. If so, he might figure a yes vote will kill him with the teabaggers in a primary.The Maine twins would normally be good possibilities for yes votes, but with the teabaggers rising in their homestate and a 2012 election looming, I wouldnt hold my breath on Snowe. Brown has to be reelected in 2012 in liberal Massachusetts. Voinovich has retired and has nothing to lose. Kirk has said he thinks this is not the time for this bill, but hedoes represent liberal Illinois. Hell have to start voting accordingly at some point.Democrats who might vote noLandrieu (LA)McCaskill (MO)Hagan (NC)Dorgan (ND)Im surprised Landrieu is even in play. Shes a member of the asshole caucus. Dorgan has retired and has nothing to lose. Hagan is in a tough state, but with a growing Latino population. She wouldnt be Senator without their vote. Hagan lost the white vote 57-39, yet won the state 53-44. Given that whites were 75 percent of the vote, you can do the math. It was a dominant black and brown vote that won her the seat. McCaskill wont survive 2012, but if she still thinks she can, shell vote no to try and keep the hounds at bay. Wont work.Bottom line?DREAM Act supporters need to pick up 7-9 Republicans, and then limit loses among Democrats to no more than 5-7. Hopefully that new compromise language is assholishness enough to attract more than a few members of the asshole caucus.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesChanges to the Act, The Dream Act, The House, The SenateRead moreDaniel..Charlie Cook in the FINAL PRE-ELECTION Report predicts Republican House TakeoverOctober 26, 2010jamesb1016 commentsHello Dog Pound and Good Afternoon!Charlie Cook has just issued his FINAL PRE-ELECTION Report for the House of Representatives.Here is his Write-Up:October 26, 2010The Cook Political Reports pre-election House outlook is a Democratic net loss of 48 to 60 seats, with higher losses possible. A turnover of just 39 seats would tip majority status into Republican hands. The midterm maelstrom pulling House Democrats under shows no signs of abating, if anything it has intensified. Whereas fewer than a third of Democratic Senate seats are up for election, House Democrats are suffering the full violence of this national undertow. Over a quarter of the entire 255-member House Democratic caucus have trailed GOP opponents in at least one public or private survey, and nearly half have tested under 50 percent of the vote in at least one poll. At this point, only 190 House seats are Solid, Likely or Lean Democratic, while 198 seats are Solid, Likely or Lean Republican, and 47 seats are in the Toss Up column. While there are certain to be at least 43 new members of the House thanks to 41 open seats and two vacancies, between 40 and 50 incumbents (over 95 percent of them Democrats) are likely to lose their seats, making for possibly the largest freshman class since 1992.Cook is predicting a NET SEAT LOSS for the Democrats between 48 to 60 Seats  WOW.Daniel G.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Politics, Polls, UpdatesCharlie Cook Predictions, Daniel @ PoliticalDog, November 2010 elections, Polling, The HouseRead moreNate Silvers latest on the House and GovernorsOctober 26, 2010jamesb1014 commentsHouse Forecast: 8 Days to GoByNATE SILVERDemocratic chances of retaining control of the House are essentially unchanged in todays FiveThirtyEight forecast. They have a 21 percent chance of doing so, up from 20 percenton Friday; that means Republicans have a 79 percent chance of instead claiming control.The average projection returned a result of 205 Democrats in the House and 230 Republicans, which would reflect a gain of 51 seats for the G.O.P.; this figure is unchanged.There is little evidence of a change in the fundamental conditions of the race as the campaign enters its final full week.The Gallupgeneric ballot poll, which publishes results using two separate turnout models,had its enthusiasm gap closing somewhat: it now has Republicans gain either a net of 5 or a net of 10 points when likely voters are accounted for rather than allregisteredones, depending on which model is used.This enthusiasm gap is somewhat lesser for Democrats than in past surveys, when Gallup had found differences of as large as 10 and 16 points, respectively, and brings Gallup into better alignment with other polls.Read moreGovernors Forecast Moves Toward Democrats in 3 Blue StatesByNATE SILVERDemocrats have made progress in several states in our latest gubernatorial forecast. Although it remains very probable that Republicans will control the majority of the nations governorships after Nov. 2, it is now more likely that Democratic and independent candidates can hold Republicans to victories in 20 to 23 of the 37 contests that will be held on Election Day.Most of the Democrats gains in the new forecast come in blue states. InMaryland, the race appears to have shifted sharply for the Democratic incumbent, Martin OMalley, who holds double-digit leads over Robert Ehrlich, a former governor, in three new surveys. Mr. OMalley also has at least 52 percent of the vote in each of the surveys, and Mr. Ehrlichs winning chances have dropped to just 4 percent from 19 percent, according to the model.InHawaii, a state that had shown some surprisingly close polling, a survey for theHonolulu Advertiser gives Democrat Neil Abercrombie an 8-point lead over the Republican Duke Aiona; three surveys conducted earlier this month had shown a lead for Mr. Abercrombie of just 2 to 3 points. Hawaii is atricky state to poll, and some of the work there has been odd this year  for instance, a Rasmussenpoll that gave longtime incumbent Daniel Inouye just a 13-point lead against a complete unknown in the Senate race there. Im not going to pretend to know exactly how to untangle everything, but the model now has Mr. Abercrombie as an 85 percent favorite, up from 79 percent.Read moreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesNate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polls, Predictions, The Governor races, The HouseRead moreThe President signs the $26 Billion Aid package for civil servants and Medicaid that the House came back for.August 11, 2010jamesb101No commentsThis was done deal.Pelosi said she had the votes and would not have called the House if she didnt..Congress on Tuesday gave final approval to a $26.1-billion aid package for cash-strapped states that will keep 161,000 teachers and thousands of police, fire and other local government workers from being laid off. The legislation was quickly signed byPresident Obama.The funding will also help states maintain medical services for low-income people.The measure was approved on a virtual party-line vote after the House was summoned back to Washington from its August recess for a rare one-day session. The House approved the bill, 247 to 161, with all but threeDemocrats present voting for the bill and all but twoRepublicans present voting against.Democrats supported the bill as crucial to maintaining vital public services at a time when the nations faltering economic recovery has left state and local governments in dire financial straits.Republicans denounced it as another expensive federal bailout and accused Democrats of catering to teachers unions and other special interests.In a sign of how heavily deficit concerns have come to weigh on this Congress, the bill is fully paid for mainly by ending some tax breaks for companies operating overseas, as well as by imposing an earlier end to a food stamp program.Prior to the vote, Obama, joined by teachers in the Rose Garden, urged swift passage.We cant stand by and do nothing while pink slips are given to the men and women who educate our children or keep our communities safe, Obama said.Thats why today were trying to pass a law that will save hundreds of thousands of additional jobs in the coming year.The House returned for the vote after the Senate surprised Washington by quickly passing the measure last week.I cant think of a better reason for members to rush back to the capital than to invest in our children, our future, said Jared Polis, a freshman Democrat from Colorado. This is not spending we are considering today. This is an investment  an investment in our children and our future.Republicans had been under pressure not to yield on the aid package, even as governors from both major parties sought the funds. Many states had already counted the money in their budgets.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Health, Media, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesHouse Speaker Pelosi, Pelosi, President Obama, The $26 Billion Medicaid/Civil Servants Bill, The HouseRead morePage 1 of 212Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
