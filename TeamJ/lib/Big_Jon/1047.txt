Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head Saturday by a gunman who opened fire outside a grocery store during a meeting with voters, killing a federal judge and five others in a rampage that rattled the country and left Americans questioning whether divisive politics had pushed the suspect over the edge. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Giffords was the target of a gunman whom he described as mentally unstable and possibly acting along with an accomplice. He said Giffords was among 13 people wounded in the melee that killed six people, including Arizona's chief federal judge, a 9-year-old girl and an aide for the Democratic lawmaker. He said the rampage ended only after two people tackled the gunman. Doctors were optimistic about Giffords surviving as she was responding to commands from doctors despite having a bullet go through her head. "With guarded optimism, I hope she will survive, but this is a very devastating wound," said Dr. Richard Carmona, the former surgeon general who lives in Tucson. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Gabrielle Giffords is able to communicate with doctors by following simple commands, a doctor said Sunday. "We are very encouraged by that," said Dr. Michael Lemole, Jr., chief of neurosurgery at University Medical Center in Tuscon, Arizona. "I am cautiously optimistic." Giffords remained in critical condition after a gunman shot her in the head and then opened fire on a crowd at a political meet-and-greet Saturday outside an Arizona supermarket. The shooting killed six people, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl, and wounded 14 others, authorities said. Two people tackled the suspected shooter, stopping a spray of bullets that turned a calm "Congress on Your Corner" event in Tucson into what President Barack Obama later described as an "unspeakable tragedy." Local authorities took a suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, into custody at the scene, and he was later transferred to federal custody, FBI Director Robert Mueller told reporters Sunday. A federal complaint filed Sunday charged Loughner with five counts, including attempting to kill a member of Congress, two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. His first appearance in federal court is scheduled for 2 pm Monday (4 pm ET).

The judge celebrated Mass on Saturday morning like he does every day before stopping by to say hello to his good friend Giffords.

Ms. Giffords, 40, was described as being in very critical condition at the University Medical Center in Tucson, where she was operated on by a team of neurosurgeons. Dr. Peter Rhee, medical director of the hospital's trauma and critical care unit, said that she had been shot once in the head, "through and through," with the bullet going through her brain. "I can tell you at this time, I am very optimistic about her recovery," Dr. Rhee said in a news conference. "We cannot tell what kind of recovery but I'm as optimistic as it can get in this kind of situation." Early into the evening, there was still confusion about the number who were killed. An official with the Pima County Sheriff's Department said that six people had been killed, including a child about 9 years old and John M. Roll, the chief judge for the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. President Obama said in a news conference that at least five had died, including the child and Judge Roll.

Loughner was taken into custody shortly after the shooting at the "Congress on Your Corner" event hosted by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. A total of 19 people were shot. Six people were killed, including Judge John McCarthy Roll and a 9-year-old girl. Thirteen others, including Giffords, were wounded. While a motive for the shooting has not been released, witnesses said Loughner was yelling names as he opened fire. One man said Giffords was clearly the target. Although authorities have not officially released any details about Loughner, 22, sources tell 3TV the Tucson resident has some limited military experience and is quite active on the Internet, even launching his own YouTube channel back in October. Some say his videos indicated anarchist leanings. Loughner also had a MySpace page, but it was taken down shortly after he was identified as the suspect. In a news conference Saturday evening, Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik alluded in general terms to Loughner's troubled past, including brushes with the law and possible mental issues. "Based on what we know right now, you're dealing with someone who is disaffected, angry, and a coward," said Dr. Steve Pitt, a forensic psychiatrist. "Beyond that, I think it is really, really difficult to come to any definitive conclusions based on Facebook or YouTube postings."American Renaissance Publishes Monthly Magazine 'American Renaissance'Order: ReorderDuration: 1:40Published: 2011-01-09Uploaded: 2011-01-09Author: raenxicaehttp://wn.com/American_Renaissance_Publishes_Monthly_Magazine_'American_Renaissance'Email this videoSms this videoPlease click MyStarMovie.com to watch full video for freeAmerican Renaissance Denies DHS Charges - Any Affiliation With ShooterOrder: ReorderDuration: 1:36Published: 2011-01-09Uploaded: 2011-01-09Author: dafathermeishttp://wn.com/American_Renaissance_Denies_DHS_Charges__Any_Affiliation_With_ShooterEmail this videoSms this videoPlease click HappyPopy.com to watch full video for freeAZ shooting targets US congresswoman, kills 6Order: ReorderDuration: 1:33Published: 2011-01-09Uploaded: 2011-01-09Author: Kisar1http://wn.com/AZ_shooting_targets_US_congresswoman,_kills_6Email this videoSms this videoTUCSON, Ariz. -- The "shady individual" showed up at a public gathering for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords asking to see the lawmaker, according to event volunteer Alex Villec. Told he would have to wait his turn, the man left but returned minutes later and gunfire erupted.The man, wearing a black cap and baggy pants and shirt, rushed by a table separating him and Giffords, raised an arm, and then came shots, Villec, 19, told The Associated Press. Firing a semiautomatic weapon, the gunman targeted Giffords as she met with constituents around 10 am Saturday outside a busy Tucson supermarket. Authorities said Arizona's chief federal judge and five others were killed and 13 people were wounded, including the Democrat lawmaker. He also fired at her district director and shot indiscriminately at staffers and others standing in line to talk to the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a communications staffer for Giffords. "He was not more than three or four feet from the congresswoman and the district director," Kimble said, describing the scene as "just complete chaos, people screaming, crying." Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said the rampage ended only after two people tackled the gunman."He was definitely on a mission," said Villec, a former Giffords intern.
