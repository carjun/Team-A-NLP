And then there are others,who thrive on raw talent, who can quietly steal a scene from under the veryhandsome noses of those who think they are stars. One only has to look at his picture to know which category,our beloved Pete Postlethwaite belonged to. He had the kind of face that made writersache to carve out characters for.  He hadthe kind of face that you would remember but couldnt always put a name to. Hewasnt a diva or a rapscallion. He was honourable, unassuming and a craftsmanof highest order.He can inhabit a character totally, convey emotions with a gesture, a casual shrug, a steely look and the intonation of his voice. He didn't need histrionics nor high drama, he was a magnificent actor. He has been quietly building up an astonishing repertoire ofcharacter roles others would kill for. But sadly, he was taken away from usafter a long battle with Cancer this weekend., at the age of 64. Steven Spielberg called himthe  best actor in the world to which, Pete in his own inimitable way, said,  Steven probably said thatPete thinks    he is the best actor in the world, such was his humility andcharacter. A Brief BioPete Postlethwaite was born in 1946 in Warrington ( then Lancashire, now inCheshire) ,UK. After a career as a teacher and a sheet metal worker, Pete chosethe path of acting after attending Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. It was in Liverpool Everyman Theatre that hebuilt up a repertoire of character roles on stage along with his contemporariesJulie Walters, Bill Nighy, Anthony Sher and Jonathan Pryce. He continued  his work on stage in The Royal Exchange inManchester and also the Royal Shakespeare company in the mid 80s. He film career started in small roles at first ( A PrivateFunction, Franco Zefirellis Hamlet) and brokethrough in a powerful role of anabusive head of the family in Distant Voices, Still Lives in 1988. He continued playing small roles in Alien 3 and The Last ofthe Mohicans in which he starred with his old pal from the repertory days,Daniel Day-Lewis. The latter recommended Pete for the role of Guiseppe Conlon in the award winning film in theName of the Father. In this breakout role that was nominated for an Oscar, Peteconfirmed his presence as an actors actor. Pete won many awards and was rightfully given the Order of the British Empire in the 2004 honour's list. I was fortunate to see Pete Postlethwaite in Harold PintersThe Homecoming at the Royal Exchange Theater in Manchester. Stooped anddishevelled, with a flat cap, crumpled Cardigan and a cane, he played the roleof Max with such conviction and physicality; he quickly wormed his way into myheart as one of my favourite actors. He returned to his first love. the theatre, in the past few years, by playing King Lear at Liverpool and also touring with his role of a Clown who discovers he only has till midnight to live. Pete died peacefully at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital in Shropshire after a long battle with Cancer. He never stopped working, turning out great performances in last years 'The Town' and 'Inception'. He even turned up to filming in what might be his last role, in 'Killing Bono' while still undergoing chemotherapy, showing courage, determination and a great love of the craft. I am saddened at the loss of such a great actor and thoughtI would share some of his best roles for those who would appreciate greatcharacters delivered with great aplomb. You can see from this following selection that Pete broughtdepth and authenticity to his roles in films and Television roles thatstraddled genres and endeared himself to anyone who loves good acting. In the Name of the Father: Daniel Day Lewis and Pete PostlethwaiteIn the Name of the FatherIn the Name of the Father In this anguished and powerful drama of the falsely accused Guildford four. Pete plays the role of Guiseppe Conlon, the father of Gerry Conlon played by Daniel Day -Lewis. Bringing quiet dignity and pent up rage of a peaceful man drawn into the controversy as his son stands falsely accused of IRA bombing, Pete shines and forms the central heart to a this emotional tale.  He was rightly Nominated for an Oscar in the best supporting actor category for this rich and rewarding film directed by Jim Sheridan. The film was nominated for seven Oscars and won several critics awards across Europe and USA. Highly recommended for a brilliant screenplay, astonishingly good cast and a heart rending drama.

Bryan Singer's explosive , genre bending mind mash-up wiht a screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, the film brought startling visuals, gripping and twisting screenplay and that almighty twist in the end that started endless discussions and debates. A cult and box office success.  Pete plays the mysterious lawyer 'Kobayashi' with a strange accent that cannot be placed, with a dry wit and hidden menace. As an ally and spokesperson for Keyser Soze, his role is central to the magnificent puzzle that the film is. If you haven't watched it, shame on you.

Pete Postlethwaite turns in a fine comic performance as Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur, the cowardly narrator and chronicler of the mock kinght's chivalry. The false knight and the last of the Dragons from an unlikely bonding to rid the land of tyranny and falsehood. A stirring adventure fantasy with a good cast and action. This underrated fantasy is worth a watch, even if it just to see the wise old Dragon's CGI matched up to Sean Connery's curly lipped ack-shent. Will be enjoyed by children and adult alike.

To a marvellously mounted musical tragedy, Pete brings gravitas and depth to his role as the kindly Friar who attempts to help the starstruck lovers.

The film is a quintessentially British comedy drama in the vein of films like ' The Full Monty' ( another film where jobless British men resort to forming a band of male strippers),  Pete's stirring speech when he receives an award is truly inspirational and a master-class in delivery- see video below. There is a scene where the band  plays 'O Danny boy' below the window of the hospital room where the character Danny lays dying. It will bring a tear to any soul. A Great, under rated gem of a  film.

One was a small but not insignificant role of the prosecutor William S Holabird in the anti-slavery drama Amistad. The other, perhaps Pete's most lucrative role was that of the 'philosopher- hunter' Roland Tembo. in the sequel to Jurassic PArk, The Lost World. Postlethwaite brings a world weary cynicism to this gruff and tough role of a Dinosaur hunter, chewing scenery right under the scary noses of those CGI dinosaurs. A worthy sequel to a ground breaking film, perhaps not as good as the first time, but then the wonder of seeing all those Dinosaurs first time around was perhaps a bit jaded the second time. A gripping film, nonetheless.Science Fiction and ThrillsShort Story : ArboretumThe following story contains disturbing imagery and themes White male, third degree burns, its ugly.

It has a brilliant cast with Kevin Spacey as Quoyle, Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench. Postlethwaite plays Tert Card, the editor of the local news the 'Gammy Bird' and quietly chews the scenery with all those veteran actors. A good film. Beautiful scenery and a heartwarming tale of loss and redemption. The plot reveals layers upon layers of intricate story, emotions and depth.

A Boston set drama of immense power, excellent acting and a gripping storyline, The town has managed to convince critics and movie-goers as one of the best crime dramas of 2010. Starring and directed by Ben Affleck ( who has already proved his directorial chops in Gone baby Gone, another excellent thriller/drama) this film also boasts Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively and Jon Hamm.

The ITV TV series has been very successful and very well produced.

This is a testament to the man who picked his projects with care and dedication, who always delivered breakout performances and who has consistently starred in quality Drama.There are many other roles in TV and film but I have included ones that are my personal favourites and also because they show the breadth of his dramatic range and genre. He was also a great supporter of many causes and starred in a climate change film with an environmental message,called 'Age of Stupid' recently. Pete Postlethwaite will be sorely missed. But the greatest tribute one can give to any actor of his calibre is to go and watch his performances and marvel at the talent and craftsmanship. So join with me in raising a toast to a great actor and  a humble human being. We Salute you! May your soul rest in peace, Pete. Our thoughts are with your family.
