At the Consumer Electronics Show, conference goers weighed in on the news.(WSJ)The move will for the first time let U.S. consumers choose the network that carries their iPhone and perhaps give them additional pricing options that could affect their monthly bills.It wasnt immediately clear when Verizon would have the device in stores.It will also upend the balance of power in the industry, ending Verizon rivalAT&T Inc.s exclusive hold on the device and leaving smaller players likeSprint Nextel Corp. and T-Mobile USA facing two well-capitalized competitors offering the worlds most popular smartphone.The Verizon phone will be similar to the iPhone 4 but run on the carriers CDMA technology, people familiar with the matter have said.Verizon Wireless is a joint venture betweenVerizon Communications Inc. andVodafone Group Plc.Apple is moving to expand its carrier base in the U.S. at a time when it is facing increasing pressure from phones powered by rivalGoogle Inc.s operating system, called Android.Google gives its software away, hoping to stake out space on mobile phones where it can sell ads and other services.Android-based phones passed the iPhone in sales in the second quarter, according to research firm GartnerRead more:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704739504576068170230339348.html#ixzz1ASctZdac*http://getclicky.com/marketshare/us/droid/Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Entertainment, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAndroid phone system vs iPhone, Apple Computer, AT&T, Verizon iPhone salesRead moreThe 15 Most Hated Companies in America..January 8, 2011jamesb101No commentsFrom The Atlantic magazine.Some of the results shouldnt surprise you. Many of the companies on this list are partially doomed by their industry. Airlines, cable companies, and banks for example, are often maligned by their customers. Retail firms and companies that were sensitive to downturns in the economy had to lay off significant numbers of employees during the recession, which bred resentment.But several companies you might have expected on this list arent. AIG became a pariah after its federal bailout, but it does not show up on the list thanks to high earnings over the past year, as its stock has nearly doubled. Goldman Sachs, that infamous vampire squid of Wall Street, earned a fair share of negative press and popular resentment since the credit crunch. But Goldman also ranked near the top in categories like customer satisfaction, shareholder satisfaction, employee satisfaction and CEO approval. GM has faced similar obstacles, but its also seen a spate of good news in the last few months, with profits, hires, and a successful IPO winning it more positive press coverage.More..Why am I not surprised that Bank of America tops the list?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAT&T, Bank of America, BP, Citibank, Dell, Direct TV, McDonalds, Nokia, The 15 Most Hated Companies in America, ToyotaRead moreThe Pentagon will be asking Congress for around $120 Billion for war fighting.January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsHummm.$535 BILLION for general Defense operations..$120 BILLION for the wars..=s $655 Billion in totalDamn. Thats a lot of MONEY!I see they are mentioning a first thought figure of $159 Billion that they say is now the $120 BillionI wouldnt count on the savings of $39 Billion.Somehow I think that money will end up back in the budget some way..For the current fiscal year, the Obama administration has assumed about $159 billion in costs for military operations, chiefly in Afghanistan and Iraq. The new estimates now appear to reflect the double impact of pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq and also getting a better handle on stepped-up operations in Afghanistan.Nonetheless it is a very different picture than President Barack Obama had once hoped for as a candidate backed by anti-war forces in his party. In contrast with the Bush-era budgets, Obama has made a point of including some place-holder for war costs in his spending plans, but these have proven more of a gesture than any accurate forecast of the dollars needed.For example, Obamas 2011 budgetjust a year ago at this time assumed $50 billion as a placeholder for contingency war funds in 2012, less than half of what now is expected to be needed.Given the nature of war and the changing tempo of operations, even detailed, timely estimates are vulnerable to the same short-comings. In some respects, the $159 billion request for 2011 may have proven too high and the extra contingency funds became an escape valve of sorts for House and Senate Appropriations looking for ways to buy new military equipment and still cope with proposed cuts from the core defense budget.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Military, Politics, The Economy, Updates$120 Billion vs $159 Billion final number, The War budget request to CongressRead moreUnemployment drops by .4% to 9.4%..January 7, 2011jamesb1019 commentsThis should be a big deal..But this morning it isnt.Its like a secret..Now Im no econmist.But a few things need to be mentioned.First of all Just about every economist and business expert really doubted the last number from the Labor DepartementThey all believed that the numbers should have dropped last month.(They in fact where revised)Second of all. the 9.4% includes adjustments for holiday employment.Third.The listing of additional jobs number created is just over 100,000..far less that experts feel is needed to sustain good growth.297,000 additional people reported they found employment..This is the best news heard on this front for 19 months.This is very good for the Economy(which IS improving)And VERY good for the President for 2012..***The unemployment rate plummeted in December, as more Americans indicated they were working, according to a government report released Friday that offers new confirmation that the economy is clawing its way out of the deep downturn.The unemployment rate was 9.4 percent, the Labor Department said, down from 9.8 percent in November, as 297,000 more people said they had found jobs. That surprising drop  which was far better than the modest step-down economists had forecast  was the steepest one-month fall in the unemployment rate since 1998 and the lowest in 19 months.But that improvement came despite a weaker-than-expected report from employers on job creation. Employers said they created only 103,000 jobs, according to a separate survey, which was less than the 150,000 that economists had expected and below the 125,000 or so needed to keep pace with a growing population over time.Taken together, the two numbers offer a muddled but generally positive portrait of the job market: one in which employers continue creating jobs, though at a modest pace, while Americans are feeling more confident about the job market.That conforms to other recent data showing a solid improvement in the job market as 2010 ended..MoreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, The Economy, Updates2010 Un-employment rate, Drop in un-employment rate, Drop to 9.4%Read moreGovernor Christie of New Jersey scrambles for funding of Transportation Projects.January 7, 2011jamesb10114 commentsNew Jersey Governor Chris Cristie now has to face the music.Talkandpolitics ( our brother site ) highlighted some of the controversy over the Governor turning down federal money for the tunnel between NY and NJ that had been ten years in planning.Both sites did pieces basically agreeing that the state couldnt pay for the project.But Talkandpolitics pointed out that New Jersey was walking into a problem with funding of transportation projects..Governor Christie has announced on Thursday (1/6/11) that he will try to solve that problem in two ways.First.. He seeks to borrow through bonds $4.4 Billion in funding..Second .He seeks to get up to $600 million from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.The reception to his announcement has been cool to cold.The democrats are not happyabout the amount of money the Governor wants to borrow.(Remember the Feds still want about $127 million back on the money given to the state for the tunnel).Going to the Port Authority, a bi-state agency that is jointly beholding to the New York and New Jersey Governors is gonna take some horse trading with New York Governor Cuomo.(Christie would also take some money from the New Jersey Turnpike Authority)The Authority had made a commitment to help funding the tunnel..So Christie feels hes on safe ground to ask for the money from themHe will have to see how the bond market greet his idea of borrowing which doesnt make him look too good.With the tunnel he would have got a good deal of money as grants from the Feds.Now with this plan. He puts the NY-NJ region drivers using the Port Authoritys Tunnels and Bridges and NJ Turnpike on the hook, along with the New Jersey taxpayers for 30 yearsNone of his plans change the statement he made about the tunnelThe state doesnt have the money ..The Republican Governor seems to be following his friends in Congress.Spend now.Pay later..Mr. Christies plan came more than two months after he had scrapped a commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River, saying that New Jersey could not afford it with its main fund for highway repairs about to run dry. The Port Authority and the federal government had each committed to provide $3 billion toward the tunnel.The tunnels supporters had argued that it would alleviate congestion for New Jersey residents who travel daily across the river to work and would stimulate growth of the regional economy. Now, Mr. Christie is instead asking the Port Authority to spend $1.8 billion to build and repair infrastructure that does not span the border between the states, including the Pulaski Skyway, which connects Newark to Jersey City.The tunnel didnt happen, and the money is there to be utilized, Mr. Christie said. It should be utilized for transportation projects to improve this state.Mr. Christie, a Republican, said his plan was more fiscally responsible than those of his predecessors because it would rely less on borrowing, and more of the $1.6 billion in annual spending would come from cash on hand. The principal and interest on the $4.4 billion in borrowing would be paid off in level payments over 30 years, he said.So no big balloon at the end, Mr. Christie said. No big payments that someones going to have to swallow 30 years from now.The plan would divert some money collected as tolls by theNew Jersey Turnpike Authority into the fund for transportation improvements. Over the five years, the amount of annual spending not derived from borrowing would rise from $75 million in 2012 to more than $600 million in 2016, Mr. Christie said.The governor said that $672 million a year would go towardNew Jersey Transit, which operates the states trains and buses, and an additional $200 million would be spent annually on local projects.Democratic elected officials and some mass transit advocates criticized the plan as being vague and as lacking any suggestion of an alternative to the tunnel as an aid to commuters who cross the Hudson River every dayMoreSome more details on the story. Under the governors plan, the state will pull money from various sources  including Port Authority and Turnpike Authority dollars that were supposed to go to a Hudson River tunnel project that Christie scrapped in October  to pay for projects between fiscal years 2012 and 2016.Altogether, the Transportation Trust Fund plan blends about $4.4 billion in borrowed money with the Turnpike Authority and Port Authority money and money from the general fund to pay for $8 billion in transportation spending over five years, Christie said at a Trenton press conference.He said it is more fiscally sound than the previous 5-year-plan because it uses less borrowing.The previous plan, which expires June 30, was a plan that relied almost exclusively on borrowing and on the most irresponsible borrowing you could possibly do. Christie said. That plan relied on 30-year notes with no principal or interest due until year 30, he said.Fast factsGovernor Christies transportation plan also calls on the Port Authority  a bi-state agency  to pay for the following projects in the Port District:The Pulaski SkywayWittpenn Bridge on Route 7 in KearnyRoute 139 which links the Holland tunnel to Routes 1&9 and Route 78Portway New Road: A new road to connect St. Pauls Avenue along the CSX rail road crossing over New County Road and terminating at Secaucus Road in Jersey City.Critics, however, slammed the governor for borrowing money, and for directing money from the scuttled tunnel project, known as Access to the Regions Core, or ARC, to keep highway, bridge and transit projects afloat.MoreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesBorrowing for transportation projects, Getting money from the Port Authority of NY&NJ, National Transportation Trust Fund, NJ Governor Chris Christie, NJ Turnpike Authority, NY Governor Cuomo, Port Authority of NY&NJ, Talkandpolitics @ Politicaldog101Read moreTurns out that Bacteria ate the Gulf Oil spill faster that most expected.January 6, 2011jamesb101No commentsThis Dog went with the scientists that quietly told everyone that the Gulf Oil spill was NOT going to be a long lasting catastrophe.Several scientists correctly predicted that the spill would be history by this past ChristmasAnd to the medias and nay sayers surprise that is exactly what happenedAlso while the sceptical media didnt report thisThe fact is Oil naturally oozes from the earth underseaIn those cases again.Bacteria works to naturalize the danger to the sea creatures and environment..Our Earth has millions of ways it fixes things that go wrongAnd we should be thankful for thatAnd not screw it up..Scientists investigating the fate of the oil and natural gas that spewed into the Gulf of Mexico during last yearsBP spill established quickly that bacteria had consumed much of the propane and ethane that leaked from the well.Now they have found that bacteria also made short order of the most abundant hydrocarbon released during the spill  methane  probably consuming most of the 200,000 tons the well ejected within 120 days of the onset of the leak from the ruptured well, according to research published Thursday in the journal Science.The discovery was a surprise, said David Valentine, a professor of microbial geochemistry atUC Santa Barbara and a member of the research team.We expected it to stick around a year or more, he said.

Mr. Gates was also able to persuade the White House to reduce its demands for cuts over the next five years to $78 billion from $150 billion.But even so, Mr. Adams said, I think the floor under defense spending has now gone soft But given the Congress authorizes government spending a year at a time, he said, the projected numbers beyond 2012 are up for grabs. Dont count on any of it.Once Mr. Obama releases his budget proposals in February, the battle will shift to Capitol Hill, where it is hard to predict how the cross-currents will shake out now that the Republicans control the House..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Military, Politics, The Economy, Updates$553 Billion figure, Congress, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Gates wanted more money, Program cuts, The Defense Budget, The White House, Winners/LosersRead moreBill Daley gets the Chief of Staff job.Gene Sperling will replace Larry Summer at Economic CouncilJanuary 6, 2011jamesb1012 commentsThe President sticks to the script and appoints a Chicago old hand that has Clinton experience to the Chief of Staff jobOnce again the Liberal and Progressivesof the Democratic party find themselves on the outside looking inBill DaleyPresident Barack Obama has reached outside his West Wing bubble  but well inside his Chicago comfort zone  to tap moderate former Clinton Commerce Secretary Bill Daley as his chief of staff, a move that will delight the business community but rankle liberals who see Daley as too conservative.

A more detailed analysis of the legislation is forthcoming, the CBO said.The $230 billion estimate is higher than one from last year, largely because it now examines the effect of the law between 2012 and 2021 instead of an earlier window.On top of all of this .It appaers that Healthcare spending has actually grown slower in the past year( effected by the economy for sure )..So if the Healthcare law con cut spending WTF are the Republicans trying to upset things by going backwards?Many consumers decreased their use of health care goods and services, partly because they had lost employer-based private health insurance coverage and partly because their household income had declined, said Anne B. Martin, an economist and principal author of the report, issued by the office of the actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.In many cases, Ms. Martin said, people decided to forgo health care services they could not afford.The number of visits to doctors offices apparently declined. Manyhospitals reported fewer admissions, as patients put off medical procedures. Spending on dental services declined slightly. Many hospitals and other health care providers reduced their capital investments. Spending on doctors services in 2009 increased at the slowest pace since 1996, according to the new federal study, being published in the journal Health Affairs.***Republicans pounced on the new numbers. No one should take solace in the fact that health spending grew at a lower rate in 2009, said SenatorOrrin G. Hatch of Utah, who is in line to be the senior Republican on the Finance Committee.Mr. Hatch said the new health care law could lead to crushing increases in health costs and premiums.By contrast, the chiefMedicare actuary, Richard S. Foster, has estimated that the new law will lead to an increase of only nine-tenths of 1 percent in national health spending over 10 years.Uninsured people who gain coverage will use more health care, Mr. Foster said, but the law is also supposed to reduce the growth of Medicare payments to many health care providers..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Politics, The Economy, WomenBudget Deficits, Cost to the Government, Democrats vs the GOP in the House, Repealing the Healthcare vote, republicans, The Healthcare LawRead morePage 1 of 90123...90Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
