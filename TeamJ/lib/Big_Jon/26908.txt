We have Hubbers from just about everywhere... Just think! - If we could recruit one of the astronauts from the International Space Station, HubPages would rule Outer Space as well!Mid-way through December, HubNuggetry is celebrating with this HubNugget Holiday Awards Dinner. The weekly HubNuggets Awards will be presented after you, our Readers, vote for your favorite in each of the three categories below. You will be dazzled, delighted, and dumbfounded with unusually Good and Tasty Nuggets of writing as we gather around the communal table. At the same time, our solid-as-a-rock (think "diamond") HubAngel, ripplemaker, will spread her usual Joy amongst the Wannabes making every day a holiday. Andlet's not discuss politics at dinner, although that may prove difficult...  You'll remember from the last HubNuggets episode that I retrieved my paper on the Anthropological Traditions of Mardi Gras. It's so good to have it back, because it contains interesting interviews with grandparents and great grandparents of acquaintances in Louisiana. Also-like, because Mardis Gras can begin with weekly celebrations during the Christmas Season. Beginning with the 12th Night Party (the 12th Night ofChristmas), these celebrations snowball into more frequent events and into daily galas during the week before the biggest party of all: Fat Tuesday. I don't know if the New Orleans Krewes will do the weekly parties this year, but our HubNuggets Krewe will!We'll begin early and highlight current Hubs by new HP Writers (HubNuggets Wannabes) in 1) Gender and Relationships, 2) Holidays and Celebrations, and 3) Religion and Belief - topics just right for Christmas and Winter Holidays. And since we begin pre-Mardi Gras with an early 12th Night, I have a good excuse to wear a mask.

Enelle Lamb - More for the rest of us!

Simone, Jason, and Maddie attended the dinner as the Ghosts of Mardi Gras Past.Act the SecondThe four kitchen ninjas produced enough food for the throngs of celebrants that attended the HubNuggets Holiday Dinner Awards - and nobody criticized the mashed potatoes. The kitchen krewe also developed a place to put relatives that stay too long. The back pantry was equipped with trays of food and sedated drinks, big screen HDTV, a small dance floor, and a sound system. Anyone led back to this brig would never know the difference. Already, two party crashers were ensconced in the chamber - Mitt Romney, and Glen Beck in his Christmas Sweater, both talking at once and having a good time.Enelle Lamb and RedElf - Chef P.I., are you really related to all those politicians?

However, none of them could find the final list of HubNugget Wannabes! It was lost somewhere (perhaps in the pages of one of their important new books).RedElf and Enelle Lamb put on their cutest Kitty smiles and wove in and out of the crowd at the podium, asking for autographs. They led the distracted politicians to the back pantry whilst immersed in signing their names. Rush went easily, speaking to the cats about his talk show and the recent appearance on Family Guy); Sarah and her family were very happy to see a dance floor in the pantry. Charlie got into an argument with Glen Beck, asking him what in blazes his Christmas Sweater book meant. The First Family headed off to their next dinner engagement.Charlie'sFrench choral group sang for the crowd out front and my Native American relatives blended right in at the table, as the Eastern Woodlands tribes often did, even in the 1600s.
