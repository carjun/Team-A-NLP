Sarah Palin Reportedly Had Gabrielle Giffords on a Target List  It is unknown at this time why Jared Lee Loughner shot Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, along with about seventeen others, including a chile and federal judge John Roll who died from their wounds. However, many are drawing the comparison between Sarah Palin's Target List and the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords in Tuscon Arizona today.  Giffords was on the list of people Palin wanted unseated during the midterm elections, and after releasing this map, including Gabrielle Giffords, Palin tweeted, "Don't retreat, instead RELOAD    In the minutes following the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and members of her staff, the website operated by Sarah Palin that illustrated Gifford's 8th district with gun crosshairs drawn on a map was scrubbed from the internet. The site, TakeBackThe20.com, was operating normally at 1:07 CST when I connected to obtain an image of the crosshairs map: When I connected approximately one hour later at 2:10 PM, the site had been replaced with a webserver error, meaning that the webserver was answering but that the content upon it an hour earlier was not being served   soon.

I have never been a Palin fan and personally am tired of her and her daughters whining.However, this was an excellent report.            Reply  Posted By     UND001|about 3 hoursagoThis is of no surprise and so sad. I saw it coming, so why did Sarah Palin? She appears to lack sound judgment, seemingly arrogant and obviously a conduit of bifurcation. This country needs unity and not irrational, emotional unreconstructed judgment. Not a fan of Sarah Palin - GOP or not. Right is right, and wrong is wrong, no matter the gender, race or political affiliation. Thank you for the article.            Reply  Posted By     joe19|about 3 hoursagoI'm Australian and I have a message for the USA...please don't elect this fruitbat to any position of influence. She is as thick as a box of hammers and has the common sense of a 2 month old pup. Seriously, the fact she is even a remote chance to become President at some stage should make us all very, very nervous. Her answer to any question seems to be 'Shoot it.' Imagine if this irrational, bigoted troglodyte ever had her hand hovering over the 'Big Red Button'. Good-bye world.
