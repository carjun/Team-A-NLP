The people who are at the front lines of putting out these asinine statements clearly think that the public is completely without intelligence and willing to swallow any absurd "explanation" if it's repeated incessantly for a time and attached to the lips of some so-called "experts". Hmmmm...could they be right about that?I've been saying, since I heard the first thing about the redwinged blackbirds and fish in Arkansas, that there are now toxic clouds not too far up that are gathering from all the burning and evaporation they encouraged to happen in the spill and getting more dense. I figured that just like their chemicals cause congealing of the oil in the water its also combined in the air for a gaseous congealing of sorts so now theres the same kinds of toxic clouds in the air that there were/are in the water. Then when it rains through those gas clouds it precipitates out and poisons the inland fresh water and some species are more immediately killed off than others. I've heard also that this is not just happening in the U.S.Of course this will be denied and possibly several such mindbendingly stupid explanations as "blunt trauma" and fireworks displays will be spat out by various "experts" until the corrupt, junk science establishment can come to a consensus about what idiotic party line they feel comfortable getting behind as their official pronouncement in an effort to provide culpable deniability for their corporate masters.  16:3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.16:4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.16:7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.(King James Bible, Revelation) 2 days agoflag  reply0royuleryhere in santa barbara, we have a variation of red wings, they have orange patches and flock in incredible numbers. 5 days agoflag  reply0postlapsaria...so 2011 is the preview of the amargeddon-ish 2012?PUM PUM PUUUUUUM.  :o 5 days agoflag  reply0Dejan_Croatiashut the fuck up with the bible crap..its our own pollution!! 5 days agoflag  reply+1pjacobs51. . . and today even more birds fall from the sky in Louisiana . . .

This maybe means fish deaths are unrelated - except for the whole "1 species being effected" thing.Get Mulder & Scully on the horn! 5 days agoflag  reply-1Vierotchka  ryanryanryanryan:It doesn't rule it out at all - they crashed into trees and buildings and got badly hurt. Some died immediately, others took longer to die. 5 days agoflag  reply+1Charles_WallProofread much? Jeez in the title too. 5 days agoflag  reply0MizPizI thought this happened last year, or at least before the bird incident. Any ways, since its one species of fish that was effected, I don't think we had anything to do with this. I can't say for the birds, but I don't think its because of fireworks. If it was, we should here more reports like this. 5 days agoflag  reply-18SomeMoreI actually used to live not too far away from Bebee a few years back. I lived in Jacksonville. I have a theory about this die-off. They say "massive trauma" to the inner organs, blood, etc. To me this sounds like some sort of electromagnetic pulse or shock wave, possibly coming from the Air Force Base in Jacksonville, may be responsible for this. It certainly could explain the limited location and sudden death. Fireworks will not do this. 5 days agoflag  reply-1Vierotchka  8SomeMore:If there had been some sort of electromagnetic pulse or shock wave, people and other animals would have felt it. 5 days agoflag  reply0funnyandspicyAnother bird who may face such consequence...http://funnyandspicy.com/amazing-bird-bar-tailed-godwit-flies-11000-km-nonstop-f... 5 days agoflag  reply0EmperorThanthen* thousands of fish. Not 'than'.As a person named Than I take the difference between "Then" and "Than" very seriously. lol 6 days agoflag  reply0Vierotchka  EmperorThan:Also, he got the chronology backwards since the fish kill occurred one day before the bird kill! 5 days agoflag  reply0littlwarriorUntil they bring me evidence to say otherwise, I'm going with pollution on both counts. Those birds were sick and dying all day long, something made them sick, what that was I don't know but my money is on some corporate bastard putting something where it don't belong. 6 days agoflag  reply0coolplanet  littlwarrior:But why were they flying at night? 5 days agoflag  reply0littlwarrior  coolplanet:that's what I am saying, why would birds be flying at night, near loud noises with bright colors it just makes no sense. There has to be something other than fireworks to explain this. 5 days agoflag  reply+2ryanryanryanryan  littlwarrior:But it's only 1 species of fish in the Arkansas River, if it was pollution THEN other fish would be affected but they are not. 5 days agoflag  reply0littlwarrior  ryanryanryanryan:I can see that it being only one species there is a chance that it was just some disease but the birds story I am not buying. 5 days agoflag  reply-1Vierotchka  littlwarrior:The birds were suddenly awakened by very loud bangs, panicked, took flight, and as they have extremely poor night vision, they collided with trees and buildings. 5 days agoflag  reply0littlwarrior  Vierotchka:That does sound feasible, except I watched the clips from AC360 and there were birds still dying, flopping around unable to fly. If they had all died from flying into things would they have died more quickly? 5 days agoflag  reply0Vierotchka  littlwarrior:Some will have crashed less violently and survived longer than others, some will have collided with each other, some will have crashed into objects that are softer than walls or trees, some will have hurt themselves on electric wires, in my opinion. 4 days agoflag  reply0littlwarrior  Vierotchka:That does sound plausible, but until i see cold hard evidence i will still be watching for that sudden revelation of foul play. 4 days agoflag  reply0remannsp.s.damn weird. 6 days agoflag  reply+2Sparky2U  remanns:It was a tough year, but I made it !!! But not everyone is as lucky as I am...... The economy is so bad that I got a pre-declined credit card in the mail. I ordered a burger at McDonald's, and the kid behind the counter asked,  "Can you afford fries with that?" CEO's are now playing miniature golf. If the bank returns your check marked  "Insufficient Funds," you have to call them and ask if they mean you or them . Hot Wheels and Matchbox stocks are trading higher than GM. McDonald's is selling the 1 /4  'ouncer'. Parents in  Beverly Hills and Malibu are firing their nannies and learning their children's names. A truckload of Americans was caught sneaking into Mexico . Dick Cheney took his stockbroker hunting. Motel Six won't leave the light on anymore. The Mafia is laying off judges. BP Oil laid off 25 Congressmen. Congress says they are looking into the Bernard Madoff scandal.  Oh Great!!   The guy who made $50 Billion disappear is being investigated by the people who made $ 1 .5 Trillion disappear! And, finally... I was so depressed last night thinking about the economy, wars, jobs, my savings, Social Security, retirement funds, our shrinking 401k Plans and our bleak future, that I called the Suicide Life line and was connected to a call center in Pakistan .   When I told them I was suicidal, they got all excited, and asked if I could drive a truck. 5 days agoflag  reply+2Mark701  Sparky2U:Good stuff. The kind of humor Rodney Dangerfield would have appreciated. 5 days agoflag  reply0remannsDamn. 6 days agoflag  reply+2Mark701I'm going with the fireworks theory. Other than owls perhaps, birds don't fly at night, and definitely not as a flock.  They were probably startled awake by the fireworks, got disoriented and flew into things. Sad. As far as the fish, who knows. Low oxygen levels in the water, pollution, could have been anything. 6 days agoflag  reply+2Vierotchka  Mark701:"Adding to the mystery is an apparent fish kill 125 miles away in the same state. A day before the bird die-off, a tugboat operator near Ozark, Ark., spotted thousands of dead drum fish floating in the Arkansas River. Biologists say the two events are probably not related and suggest that the fish kill  a much more common event than a bird rain  is likely linked to a disease that affected only one species."http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2011/0103/Search-for-clues-is-on-after-bird...In other articles I read on the subject, it was written that the fish kill affected drum fish only, and that these fish gather in very large numbers in deep waters in the winter, and this proximity allowed the pathogen (virus or bacteria) to spread rapidly to a huge number of these fish. 6 days agoflag  reply+1remanns  Vierotchka:Thanks for the additional data.          +^d 6 days agoflag  reply-1danitassin  Mark701:Then why doesn't this happen every new year or 4th of july? Why didn't this happen all over the world? Please tell me you're not that naive to believe that fireworks are the cause. 6 days agoflag  reply0Vierotchka  danitassin:Because red-wing blackbirds don't flock in large numbers in the summer time, they do so only in the winter, and similar incidents have happened in the past in other parts of the world involving other species of birds - red-wing blackbirds exist only in the US. 6 days agoflag  reply+1Mark701  danitassin:If the conditions were identical i.e. thousands of birds perching in the exact area with the same weather and atmospheric conditions around New Years and July 4th,  it probably would. I don't claim to know the cause for certain but the fact it occurred in an area where there was a fireworks display and the birds were in flight at an unusual time says a lot. What's your theory? 5 days agoflag  reply-4MrMxyzptlkWell these people seem to think so...http://www.wecanknow.com/We are living at a time when mankind seems to sense that the end of all things is very near. Just about everyone has a theory as to how the world is threatened and when that end might come. The media and the Internet are full of doomsday speculations concerning the New Age "Mayan Calendar" and the year 2012. Some scientists predict that Global Warming could wipe out life on Planet Earth within a certain number of years. At the same time, politicians work to halt the proliferation of life-destroying nuclear weapons before it is "too late." High profile news reports of economic downturns, crime, wars, tsunamis, earthquakes, and disease outbreaks cause people to question whether God is bringing judgment on the world.These ideas cause people to fear greatly. Some realize that God knows how and when the end of the world will come, so they wonder if He tells us. Rather than turning to the Bible as the source of all truth for these answers, they turn to the churches and religious leaders. They may be told that the end will not come until Antichrist rises as a political leader who will make them take the "mark of the beast." Many are told that God will rapture His people before a 7 year Great Tribulation after which Christ will set up a 1000 year reign from an earthly throne in Jerusalem. Others are told that Christ will come to rapture believers the same day he destroys the world. While just about every church has a different idea as to what the Bible teaches concerning the end, they all seem to agree on one thing; no man can know the day or the hour of Christ's return because the scriptures say that He is coming as a thief in the night. But are they correct? Can We Know?This web site serves as an introduction and portal to four faithful ministries which are teaching that WE CAN KNOW from the Bible alone that the date of the rapture of believers will take place on May 21, 2011 and that God will destroy this world on October 21, 2011. Please take your time and browse through the teachings of Harold Camping, President of Family Radio. Visit EBible Fellowship, Bible Ministries International, and The-Latter-Rain to read and listen to many faithful teachers give scriptural insight on the doctrines that God is teaching His people. Learn about the Biblical Timeline of History, the correct method of Bible interpretation, the End of the Church Age and God's command to believers that they must depart out of the churches. Study the proofs that God has so graciously given in His Word showing us that these dates are 100% accurate and beyond dispute. Above all, please READ THE BIBLE and prayerfully ask God to open your spiritual eyes to these truths. May it please Him to have mercy on each of our souls. 6 days agoflag  reply+2coolplanet  MrMxyzptlk:So how many times does your god have to destroy the earth before he gets it right? 6 days agoflag  reply+3Vierotchka  MrMxyzptlk:Oh please... what would be nice, though, is that you would act like the Christian you pretend to be. 6 days agoflag  reply-5MrMxyzptlk  Vierotchka:Did you start smoking crack again?  You know that stuff is bad for you.  It makes you post things that make no damn sense. 6 days agoflag  reply-4MrMxyzptlk  coolplanet:You're the one in the Cult of Doom.  I'm the one who mocks you for making as much sense as the people at www.wecanknow.comThere, does that get you back on track? 6 days agoflag  reply+3danitassin  MrMxyzptlk:ha aha ha ha hah haha !! seriously?! You realize the bible is just a collection of stories right? I'm better off reading mythology books. Thanks 6 days agoflag  reply-2MrMxyzptlk  danitassin:They are just one more of the many Cults of Doom floating around out there.  Seeing only the signs that prove their ideology and ignoring the ones that show them to be wrong.  Much like the AGW Cult of Doom that puts up a lot of their crap here. 6 days agoflag  reply+1coolplanet  MrMxyzptlk:Christians invented doomsday. Thomas Jefferson called the Revelation of John "the ravings of a mad man."Judaism talks about "the end of time" but doesn't consider it doom. Quite the opposite.The 25,630 year Mesoamerican calenders end on 12/21/12 but they don't see this as the end of the world. They consider it a great time of human renewal and evolution.It is Christianity that has become a cult of doom. 5 days agoflag  reply-2MrMxyzptlk  coolplanet:Christianity was in fact the first real doom cult.  They used thier Judgement Day to keep the peasants in line.  If everyone was going to die and be taken inot heaven fairly soon then why worry about how the lords were treating you.  A pretty good scam.  Their problem was the same with all the other Doom Cults, what happens when the impending doom takes too damn long to get here?  So you keep having to redefine the terms to justify why the end didn't come this time, or for that matter the last several hundred times.That's why it's just like the AGW Doom Cult.  Using fear of the impending ecological judgement day to keep the followers in line and scare others into joining up.  It does a fine job of distracting most folks from the fancy trappings the high preists have.  As each predicted doom filled milestone fails to pass things are redefined and more bullshit is spread to cover for the past failures.  Fear of the unknown is such a great motivator.  It's why so many ecomentalists are lapsed christians.  They left the religon of their parents but still needed that impending doom feeling to make their lives have meaning.  So they join up with the AGW Doom Cult which is why it has so many religous trappings. 5 days agoflag  reply+1Mark701  MrMxyzptlk:Really?  May 21, 2011 and then October 21, 2011? And what are you going to say when this doesn't happen? God works in mysterious ways? I do agree there are many doomsday cults out there. Maybe one of them is correct about the day and time. Perhaps even biblelists have correctly guessed the time. But what difference does worrying about it make? Right or wrong about the date we all die anyway, eventually. Like the man said, "None of us get out of this alive". And IF there is a God and he condemns us or allows us to condemn ourselves for what is done in the microscopic flash of our existence, then he is a cruel God indeed and I want no part of "Him". 5 days agoflag  reply-2MrMxyzptlk  Mark701:What will I say when it doesn't happen?  The same thing I say when the Globla Warming Cults predictions fail to pass.  I'll yawn and mark it down as another failure of religious types to scare me into joining one of their wacky little cults.I find all this funny.  That's why I posted it.  Not because I think they are any more right than the AGW Cult...  They're all nutters as far as I think. 5 days agoflag  reply+2figgdimensionhttp://www.figrd.blogspot.com/US scientists believe fireworks may have caused thousands of birds to fall from the sky over an Arkansas town on New Year's Eve.Karen Rowe, of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, said the red-winged blackbirds probably flew low to avoid explosions and collided with objects.However, she stopped short of declaring the mystery solved, saying further tests on the dead birds are planned.Officials say more than 3,000 birds fell over the city of Beebe.The few that survived their fall stumbled around like drunken revellers, witnesses said.Birds were "littering the streets, the yards, the driveways, everywhere," said Robby King, a county wildlife officer."It was hard to drive down the street in some places without running over them."Initial laboratory reports said the birds had died from trauma, the AGFC said.Residents reported hearing loud firewor 6 days agoflag  reply0figgdimensionand i posted the follow up its most likely fireworks no word on the fishkiller yet still at large...   :/' 6 days agoflag  reply0figgdimensionThan fish than them birds  than the church wut next hambone! 6 days agoflag  reply0figgdimensionanyone else notice the typical Arkansas spelling and use of the word "than"...?! 6 days agoflag  reply0figgdimension  figgdimension:The Title... lol 6 days agoflag  reply-1royuleryi grew up in a junk yard and one day we were burning an enormous pile of batterys to get the lead.  birds fell like rain,dead before they hit the ground.  the cloud of acid smoke was so thick that it stopped the freeway and we got the first smog ticket in southern california. 6 days agoflag  reply0ikkibu_emuqahow would this be biblical? explain!!!!!!!!! give examples!!!!!!!!!!!! lol 6 days agoflag  reply+1VierotchkaThe fish kill is most likely a natural phenomenon:"Adding to the mystery is an apparent fish kill 125 miles away in the same state.
