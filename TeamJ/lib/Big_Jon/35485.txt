It could be the fact that the US is the largest melting pot on the planet, it could have to do with disparity of economy, the facts simply do not support it having anything to do with gun laws.After 1996, less than 10% of nonfatal violent crimes involved firearm. http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/percentfirearm.... After peaking in 1993, the number of gun crimes reported to police declined and then stabilized at levels last seen in 1988.http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/guncrime.cfm Yet during this same time, every single year there were literally millions more new guns sold to private citizens and during this time the US went from 4 or 5 states with legal concealed carry to, IIRC, 46 states today.Homicide rates recently declined to levels last seen in the mid-1960s http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/hmrt.cfm Nonfatal firearm-related crime has declined since 2000. http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/firearmnonfatal... Serious violent crime levels declined since 1993.http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/cv2.cfm Since 1994 violent crime rates have declined, reaching the lowest level ever in 2009.http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/viort.cfm In spite of the fact gun laws have been loosened, several millions more people are carrying concealed guns every day, and there are more, and more guns on the streets every single year.If the contention is that more guns = more crime, I believe the statistics completely disprove any correlation.edit...Oh, and I see you offered no solution to remedy the hundreds of millions of guns in the US, even if gun laws were responsible for higher crime rates (which they obviously are not).Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topwikileaksfan      (54 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 10:48 AMResponse to Reply #121138.Yeah because we worship guns, gun culture is part of our vocabularyIt's time to treat the gun culture as a enemy of civilization.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toppipoman      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:05 PMResponse to Reply #138147.Oh, I seeit really has nothing to do with reality then, only your fear of inanimate objects which is the issue.

And again, your asserting a man o'straw don't make it true. In fact it demonstrates how utterly hollow your argument is. You don't care about facts, it is reduced to your pitiful feelings which have been proven void in this very thread.Still no links to anything resembling a basis for:"Your side is the one that's adamantly opposed to doing ANYTHING about violence involving guns in this country.""That leaves only one action you can favor---everybody arming-up and hoping for the best.""Along with the generally unspoken adjunct to that sickening Law Of The Jungle mindset---that anybody who fails to take armed action and ends up getting killed or injured pretty much deserves what he or she gets." All completely baseless accusations, meaningless without demonstration of fact.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTelly Savalas      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 07:50 PMResponse to Reply #49167.It's a paraphrase of "an armed society is a polite society"Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopEFerrari      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 10:50 PMResponse to Reply #238.That turned out not to be true, per the Pima County Sheriff today. n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topvalerief      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 09:38 PMResponse to Original message3.It's Saturday.

We believe that avoidance can best be achieved by the potential victim status, their training in the use of weapons, and their willingness to do so if  it  becomes necessary for their own protection or the protection of others.The Concealed Carry Association assists those who want to express their unwillingness to become a helpless victim, and help you avoid the serious consequences that inevitably accompany an armed confrontation. These tools help you to communicate that you are in possession of a deadly weapon and  that you possess the training and determination necessary to efficiently protect yourself and others.The 2nd Amendment to the constitution of the United States guarantees the right to keep and bear arms. Many states have augmented this constitutional guarantee by enacting concealed carry laws, which allow private citizens to possess a deadly weapon for the purposes of protection and self-defense.As important and effective as our laws may be in regard to the citizens right to appropriately respond to an unprovoked violent attack, they do little to deter a perpetrator who is in the planning stage of their attack.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toppipoman      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:57 AMResponse to Reply #115116.Why not cite anything here which indicates aresponsibility or purpose for public protection?

Often times, all it takes is just drawing a weapon to cause a perpetrator to think twice about what he's doing.Fact is, you can never hope to prevent crimes of this nature when the perp gets the jump on you.  What you can do is minimize the violence, and I really wish there was someone in that crowd packing heat (or not too afraid to draw) to stop this guy from killing as many people as he did.

I haven't read a discussion or report on this subject. But assume that it was legal to carry a weapon at the event. You are standing in the middle of a crowd when you hear something that sounds like firecrackers. It will take you perhaps 15 seconds to figure out what exactly is happening. If the shooter is not standing right by you, you will have to try a difficult shot at a moving target surrounded by a mass of terrified people attempting to escape. Pulling your firearm may make you appear to be part of the problem rather than a solution and lead to you being shot by law enforcement or other person with a concealed weapon.  I understand a number of people jumped on the shooter and stopped him. If you were standing right by him, this might have been the best approach to handling the problem. A good class on self defense will teach you some very effective ways for disarming a person with a handgun. Also the fact that you have a concealed weapons permit in no way makes you a police officer or requires you to use your weapon in such a situation. That is your choice. edited for typo  Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topfriendly_iconoclast      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:10 AMResponse to Original message117.Youve responded several times- All those words, and yet not *one* citation!Why am I not surprised?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCTyankee      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 07:09 AMResponse to Reply #117119.I think #l04 made the case well.Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 07:09 AM by CTyankeeI would imagine, tho,that what I have been saying has been said in the Gungeon plenty of times.
