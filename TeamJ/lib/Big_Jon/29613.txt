Peter KingSource: SalonNow that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., has assumed the chairmanship of the House Homeland Security committee and is promoting hearings on Muslim "radicalization," there's been a burst of media coverage surrounding his decades-long support for the IRA, the Irish terrorist group, which he broke with only recently, in 2005. But for Tom Parker, an official at Amnesty International in Washington who hails from Britain, the distaste for King is personal. As Parker notes in a new Op-Ed, and explained further in an interview with Salon Thursday, he survived an IRA terrorist bombing in 1990 when he was 21."I have no problem with his support for a unified Ireland. What really bothers me is the hypocrisy of the man," says Parker, who is now policy director for terrorism, counterterrorism and human rights at Amnesty International USA.It was King's designation of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as a terrorist that prompted Parker to go public. Parker himself is critical of Assange, "but to call him a terrorist when you have supported people who actually blow stuff up, it seemed to me that that was really beyond the pale," he says. "This is a guy who is happy to bully other people when he has a whole crowd of skeletons in his closet on this issue." ...Parker, meanwhile, lays out this standard for assessing terrorism in his Op-Ed:    That problem is simple: if your test for whether or not terrorist violence is acceptable is whether or not you agree with the cause that it furthers, you will never have the moral authority to condemn such acts when they are carried out by others. The use of violence against innocents must be wrong in whatever form it takes. Take any other position and you are open, as Congressman King undoubtedly is, to charges of hypocrisy.Read more: http://www.salon.com/news/terrorism/?story=/politics/wa...

My grandfather was an open and ardent IRA supporter for years. Financially too.He was Irish by heritage, and he ended up with a real distaste for the British after visiting the country during WW2. When he became financially successful a couple of decades later, he started funneling a serious chunk of change to the IRA.Up until the late 1980's, nobody cared at all, and most people were generally supportive of the idea. After all, he was supporting "freedom fighters", which is as American as apple pie and baseball. Of course, he mostly traveled in Irish-Catholic circles, where support for the IRA was a bit higher anyway.In the late 80's it started to get harder to donate money to them, and by the early 90's he had to give it up completely because of new laws that added new penalties to the behavior and made it easier to find people doing it. Socially, however, he was never chastised for it. Even people who disagreed with him "understood" and "sympathized" with his position and wouldn't really call him out for it, and he was unrepentant up until the day he died. There was definitely a double standard.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopAgent William       (481 posts)Fri Jan-07-11 03:32 PMResponse to Reply #913.I've heard similar accounts of that.Most of the money that was collected usually nevr made it to Northern Ireland, but was instead pocketed by people running a scam to fight a perceived British occupation.  It's not just Americans, but many in mainland British contributed to the IRA and its political wing, Sinn Fein. And a double standard indeed... Could you image the outrage if any politician or anyone of high social stand in stood up for the Palestinians?

According to relatives, he didn't care one iota about Ireland before WW2, but came back home with a genuine hatred for the U.K after the war. My grandfather was a very kind, generous, likeable man in most regards, but he had a hair-trigger for all things British. He even went off on me once when I was a teenager for having a damned Police poster in my bedroom, ranting that listening to "British music" disrepected my ancestors and my "fellow Irishmen". Being a smug teenager, I couldn't resist pointing out to him that half of my Dad's family is British, so AVOIDING that music because of its origins would have been equally disrespectful. He didn't speak to me for a month after that  To be honest though, I'm just as guilty as anyone else when it comes to the double standard. I was in college when he finally stopped donating, and though I strongly disagreed with his support for the IRA, I don't remember ever once actually challenging him about it. I doubt it would have made any difference anyway.

I don't know why it was so difficult for many Americans to understand that the IRA were a bunch of terrorists who murdered innocent people and being opposed to them didn't mean that people couldn't support the Irish. Even here at DU, I've seen some attempts to romanticise and minimise what the IRA did, like when a few people tried to argue that the IRA wasn't nearly as bad as Palestinian suicide bombers because the IRA very nobly gave warnings before their attacks....When it comes to that King hypocrite, very little leaves me gobsmacked when it comes to US politicians, but it's actually pretty scary that someone like him who openly supported terrorism has any sort of connection with Homeland Security...Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topwhathehell      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 06:58 PMResponse to Reply #1840.Mistaken again, Violet...There were, in fact, not "so many Americans" doing thisEdited on Sat Jan-08-11 07:10 PM by whathehellThere were a handful..a mere handful...The minuscule number who did offer unreserved support were disappointed.Being alive, adult and in America in 1969 when the "troubles" re-emerged, I think I can speak credibly to the matter.To view the issue in context, you would have to start off with the event that kicked off the highest level of IRA support/sympathy in this country, and that would be the 1981 Hunger Strike.  If you know anything of American and British history, you know that it occurred during the Reagan Administration, more precisely, the era of the Reagan/Thatcher Alliance...If King was involved, he would have been exceptional on at least two levels: for being American, and for being a member of a party and a two nation conservative "movement" that strongly denounced the IRA. The anger and sympathies that were aroused were countered by, not only the aversion most Americans feel toward political violence generally, but by many of the IRA tactics specifically....Had Americans needed "more" to discourage them, they had that "special relationship", strengthen immensely by above mentioned political alliance...In terms of monetary support, they had to confront a law that stipulated groups donating to IRA-related causes had to register as members of a "foreign agency".This supposed "support" for the IRA, was GREATLY exaggerated by British politicians..Any one here who followed the matter can remember their frequent appearances on national television, in which they lectured us, with characteristic officiousness, on the immorality moral of "supporting terrorism".  Most Americans sympathized with them, but their outrage and indignation were in such inverse proportion to the reality, they were sometimes mocked as caricatures of themselves. I'm exasperated by the fact of these misconceptions have continued and that they have apparently been recorded as historical "fact".  It's simply not true.*Such groups were very few..A tiny group called "NorAid" is the only one I recall.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJDPriestly      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 05:00 PMResponse to Reply #1720.When I lived in the UK in the early 1970s, I often heard the term "Irish" used to refer to some worthless, despicable person.  In fact, the Irish people were abused by the British for centuries.The hatred of the Irish against the British and the contempt the British had for the Irish is very hard for us to understand.But we need to acknowledge it and try to understand it because it is the hatred on the one side and the contempt on the other that arises when an imperial power, a mighty military power, exerts its influence and governance on a conquered people.That kind of action by an imperial power, regardless what power it is, regardless how well-meaning it is, regardless how democratic its own government is, results in anger by those people in the conquered country who feel demeaned and powerless under what the conquered people perceive as the boot of the imperial power.The anger is very much the feeling of an abused spouse who is too weak and powerless to defend her- or himself, but seething inside.  It is the feeling of the abused child whose parent beats him or her.  So, we need to approach angry people, whether the Irish, with calm and respect but also with the firm intention to stop the violence on both sides that engenders and reacts to the sense of oppression.Respect for the autonomy of others whether nations or individuals while at the same time expecting and insuring respect for one's own autonomy is what is needed.Rep. King is way off balance.  He does not understand this concept.

KingThe last all-Ireland election was an overwhelmingly Sinn Fin majority.  Then England sent over the Black and Tans.  The IRA fought them, with Sinn Fin as the republican political party.  26 counties were freed, 6 were not.  There are still plenty of native Irish in the 6 counties amidst the English settlers, troops etc.God bless the IRA.  Who the hell are the English to be marching around Irish soil?  When the IRA freed the 26 counties, this is beautiful Irish history, but them still trying to get the English out in the 6 remaining counties is bad?The English, in Ireland, in Iraq, wherever they are, are the colonial, imperial, terrorists.  I was quite happy to see the torch passed from the IRA to the Muslims who attacked England in July 2005.  Of course, the IRA targeted military and political targets, and alerted police to clear the area otherwise.  The Muslims are equivalent to the English, using the same sort of tactics they used in the Malvinas, in Iraq, in Afghanistan etc.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topwhathehell      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 06:07 AMResponse to Reply #132.Few "who"?..Republicans or Americans in general?I don't know about the former but as an American who was an adult at the very inception of "The Troubles" I can assure you that Americans "in general" did NOT support the IRA..A number of Irish Americans were sympathetic towards the IRA's goals and were sympathetic toward their prisoners during the Hunger Strike of 1981, for instance and they called out the Brits regarding their historic role in the whole mess, challenging Thatcherite "line" on the matter, but almost ALL drew a line against acts of murder, knee capping and other particularly violent acts.It would be ironic in more than one way if King was a supporter since his party's leader at the time, Ronald Reagan, had a close relationship with Thatcher, and most definitely did NOT support them.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topwesterebus      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 04:03 AMResponse to Reply #3249.I guess that would depend on you ancestry.

During his last stint in that post, King used his influence to intervene on behalf of Malachy McAllister.McAllister, like many Catholics in Ulster, endured inexcusable treatment at the hands of  British occupation forces and Loyalist thugs. He admits to committing the acts for which he was incarcerated, but describes himself as a combatant in a civil war, rather than a terrorist. That distinction is difficult to defend in light of the fact that McAllister was a member of the Irish National Republican Army (INRA) -- the military wing of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP).Whatever the merits of the Irish Republican cause, the INRA was not created merely to obtain independence for Northern Ireland, or to defend the rights of an abused minority. The group, which budded off from the "official" IRA in 1974, was a tiny, ultra-violent Leninist cell within the IRSP. While the Party specialized in political agitation, the INRA carried out bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, extortion, and other forms of "direct action" that frequently targeted helpless civilians.http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/ Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topprovis99      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 01:25 AMResponse to Reply #1130.so Protestants defending their homes are loyalist thugs?As a Southerner descended from Scotch-Irish Protestant immigrants, like 20 million other southerners, I am sick of this glorification of Catholic terrorist and the put down of Protestants, who have every right to protect themselves from terrorists.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCeleborn Skywalker      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 03:06 PMResponse to Reply #3038.Well aren't you special.Both sides share equal blame in the conflict, don't try and pretend the Protestants had the moral high ground.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLeftishBrit      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:38 PMResponse to Reply #3852.Quite; and if Peter King had supported the UDA or other Protestant 'paramilitaries' i.e. terrorists,Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 01:38 PM by LeftishBritthat would ALSO make him a hypocrite.However, in his case it happened to be the IRA.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopXanaDUer      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 03:09 PMResponse to Reply #3039.When you take the train up from Dublin to Belfastonce you pass the border into the north, the protestants put up anti-catholic hate signs in their back windows so Catholics can see them.So, the blame is on both sides.

Look at the "contras" in Nicaragua. Terrorists.  It's okay to label combatants  they like  as "patriots" yet anyone else fighing for "freedom" is a terrorist in their eyes today.They are quick to label like their leader druggie limballs.  They can't understand why anyone would call conservative republikans "conservanazis".

Think about this:Mr. King's actions funded the organization that nearly killed Baroness Margaret Thatcher (then Prime Minister). Mr. King's actions funded the organization that bombed Harrods, Canary Wharf, the London financial district, centre of Manchester, many pubs where Army soldiers were said to frequent, and more places besides. Mr. King's actions funded the organizations' purchase of mortar bombs from Libya, and fired said mortar bombs at Number 10 Downing Street. Mr. King's actions funded the organization who at one time devised the "proxy car bomb" - kidnap a person, and force them to drive their vehicle to a destination, where the car (with driver) will be detonated.  (though this practice was discontinued because local nationalists were appalled at this).  Mr. King's actions funded an organization that killed 0.12% of the population of Northern Ireland.  In contrast, 9/11/2011 killed 0.0016% of the American population.  About 0.2% of the NI population died because of "The Troubles" on all sides.  Extrapolated across the US population that's about 500,000 Americans.   However I know "The Troubles" have ended (for the most part) and I got to remember that bygones must be bygones but it still is distasteful to me. Yes, Gerry Adams has shook hands with Rev Ian Paisley, and Rev. Paisley and Martin McGuinness had a good working relationship in the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly.  Yes there is relative peace.  However I feel Mr. King should at least step down as chairman of the committee because his judgment is clearly impaired and I feel he poses an actual risk TO Homeland Security because of the simple fact that I feel homegrown terrorism is a bigger problem than the perceived threats from the Middle East.  Leave that to Hillary Clinton at the Department of State.
