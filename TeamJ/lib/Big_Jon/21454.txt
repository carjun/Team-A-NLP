Life Circles by Pearldiver: Always moving forward from its source; we are that source. There are many events that occur and people that we meet in our lives which help shape positively the outcomes of future generations. Though often we dont know at the time; how much a random act of hope, courage or craziness, will eventually shape our destinies; sometimes an outcome will be such that the world as we know it, changes forever. You Cant Sink a Rainbow is a tribute to special people and a little ship called The Rainbow Warrior. In 1985, she sailed into history when preparing to protest French nuclear testing in the Pacific, she was blown up at anchor in Auckland harbor in tranquil New Zealand, by French saboteurs, on direct orders of the French President of the day.. (Who is: Not worthy of mention).The Rainbow Warrior was Greenpeace's Flagship and 25 years ago, paid the ultimate price for changing a world environment to be nuclear free as we take for granted today. The events of 10th.July 1985 along with the special people who sailed on this Greenpeace vessel, made such a change when they responded to the cowardly act of aggression against this ship of peace. This single act, along with the presence of other nuclear facilities in England and the USA, was responsible for women of the world standing up against nuclear proliferation.So this poem of hope is a tribute to all of those courageous people and the members of Greenpeace who sailed in The Rainbow Warrior. Their selfless actions helped unite the people of the Pacific and ultimately a world generation; to make a stand against potential nuclear war. As a direct result of these events, New Zealand become a Nuclear Free Nation and gained worldwide respect for that stance. The world changed and I am proud to have experienced those days.The Original Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior. (photo courtesy of Greenpeace)Today New Zealand remains nuclear free and a permanent rainbow blesses the clear, tranquil waters of Northlands Matauri Bay. The Rainbow Warrior has completed her full life circle and now takes her lasting place as a protector of the marine life that envelopes her in the hope that she will never fade into obscurity. Please enjoy this poem of hope: They Cant Sink a Rainbow.Throughout the world the 25th Anniversary of the Rainbow Warrior Bombing was celebrated this year on 10th July 2010. No where more so than in Auckland, New Zealand. Check the web site of Greenpeace NZ to find out what occurred. This poem was released especially for the occasion; I hope you enjoy it.Who were they to dictate nukes? In 1964 the French developed the nuclear bomb and tested it throughout pristine coral atolls in the Pacific. Worldwide pressure, Greenpeace and the bombing of Rainbow Warrior forced the end of testing in 1995.As they tested their bombs they increased the size of the blasts. In the foreground are naval battleships whose crews also acted as test subjects. The boats show the sheer magnitude of what was described as 'Safe Detonations.' This is what GreenpeaceA Nuclear Free Pacific Lagoon. White coral beaches, pristine reefs and waters. Home for a huge and diverse range of marine life. Why Destroy it?An explosive place to vacation.  French paradise Moruroa Atoll did not encourage tourists. It was used as testsite after the local island community were evicted to outlaying islands, but they still suffered from the nuclear fallout, which was monitored by the french.An Act of Cowardice by France. Victim of two french bombs the Rainbow Warrior has sunk at her moorings in Auckland harbor.The First Act of Terrorism in NZ. With such damage to the Rainbow Warrior's hull and two terrorists in police custody, the French government's denial backfired as it served to unify condemnation of their nuclear testing and arrogance.

Today the only explosive thing that is attached to her hull... Is Life. A full life circle for Rainbow Warrior. When all that one has is Hope... hope is eternal. Some of the Warrior's history.The Rainbow Warrior though only a small ship measuring 40 metres, at full speed generated a wake long enough to encircle the world. She had been a commercial trawler before her purchase for the princely sum of $40,000 by the founders of Greenpeace. Once refitted and refurbished she approached her first trip, as effectively and passionately as she would carry on.  Her first mission was against Icelandic whaling and what Greenpeace deemed to be an unnecessary slaughter of the sea's great mammals. In Iceland the public were horrified by the campaign and more so by the methods used by Greenpeace when the Rainbow Warrior was steered between the hunter's harpoons and the targeted whales. This action effectively destroyed the hunt by preventing the whalers from harpooning any whales.  The same style of anti-whaling campaign was conducted against Spain and all daily media coverage ensured growing support for Greenpeace. In the same year, the Rainbow Warrior was sent to intercept a chartered English ship that had been secretly polluting our oceans by dumping tons of live toxic radioactive waste. When caught by the Rainbow Warrior attempting to dump yet another load, the idea doing so, was abandoned to the ground swell of public opinion. Her next mission was equally successful as the Rainbow Warrior and crew used the public outcry and their courage to halt the slaughter of thousands of Grey Seals in and around the Orkney Islands. In 1979 the Rainbow Warrior headed back to confront the whalers in the Icelandic waters but now the stakes had been raised. The whalers showed their anger this time by firing their harpoons over the heads of the crew, in hope that they would break off the protest. In yet another protest against whaling by Iceland the Rainbow Warrior and her crew were boarded and illegally arrested. This action served to raise the stakes yet again. In 1980 the Rainbow Warrior took her protest action directly to France and in her opposition to the shipped delivery of nuclear radioactive waste from Japan, the French ensured that any campaign against them was going to be a bitter one. Raising the stakes yet again this time it was a French naval vessel that did so, when it intentionally rammed her. Having proven her point, the Rainbow Warrior was off again to the North Sea and back to blockading another shipload of chemical waste, intended for dumping. That done it was back to Spain and another round with the Spanish whalers, who were no less docile than their Icelandic colleagues. The Gulf of St. Lawrence was again the venue for her in 1982. She was back for a campaign to stop the killing of baby seals. In an all out approach by Greenpeace this seal campaign would prove to be very successful even though several Rainbow Warrior crew members were arrested. The effort and resulting media attention forced the EEC to announce an immediate international ban on the importing seal pup skins. Victory for Greenpeace and the organisation's tireless team; the industry had been given a kiss of death. The little ship sailed to Peru and found the people there, happy to follow the rising number of nations which comprehensively banned whaling. The power of the Rainbow was growing and no shortage of volunteers meant Greenpeace could fight on numerous fronts, without depleting her human reserves. Then in 1983, the Rainbow Warrior sailed into the Bering Sea and ran headlong into the then superpower Russia. She was there to tackle the problem of raping the oceans with the use of endless drift nets.  She documented and the crew dealt with the issue of deep sea salmon drift nets, showing the world for the first time this disgusting practice. Off the Russian coast the crew found and recorded evidence of illegal Russian whaling out of Siberia. The whole crew were arrested by Russian authorities, but after a media leak that created a huge public outcry, they were freed. Greenpeace, the Rainbow Warrior and her crew were here to stay.  When the Rainbow Warrior arrived in Auckland, New Zealand in July 1985, she had only recently completed extensive panel beating, refitting and maintenance. She was good to go and would have, had the events of 10th. July 1985 not occurred. We are; as people of the free world; indebted to those who were referred to as Eco-Terrorists and the Rainbows that they have introduced us to.  If you travel to New Zealand and wish to visit a special place called Matauri Bay in Northland, you will find this amazing ship has over 25 years begun to turn into an amazing reef. She is part of New Zealand now and the people of that land know how much she changed our lives. Come dive this peace of history, believe me you will find many locals who will come with you; including the author. One Day Soon - Come DownUnder and Dive the Rainbow Warrior - If You Do: She Will Change Your Life. The Rainbow Warrior legend continues to sail. Four years to the day that her predessor was bombed Greenpeace launched the Rainbow Warrior 2. She became testimony that they could not sink a rainbow.

July 1985. She was launched on the 10th. July 1989 exactly four years to that day. The catch cry of 'You Can't Sink a Rainbow' rings true and has acted as testimony to the courage and determination of Greenpeace and the organisations followers throughout the years.The global issues may well have changed today; but Greenpeace, the Rainbow Warrior and the hundreds of special people who have and do collectively believe and act for the betterment of our environment; in my view, shows how truly wonderful the human spirit can be and aspire to. If you believe that you can change the world; then join or contribute to the cause that has; with a few good people, shown so many what it is to truly believe and to act.Your Opportunity to Learn and Earn:If you have ever hoped to learn to write and professionally publish your work then here is your opportunity to do so.

Take care mate.Peace20097 months ago Excellent Writing , really enjoyed reading it.Keep up the great work.Pearldiver7 months ago Hi Peace, your name is very apt for this hub, thank you for reading this work and your kind comments. You take care.travelespresso7 months ago Poignant PD.  A poignant reminder of a time in NZ history which challenged us, robbed us of a particular naivety and confused us.  But kiwis were staunch and "right" in the pursuit of the culprits even if they weren't punished sufficiently for the crime.This has moved me and I enjoyed your word-smithing of the event.Pearldiver7 months ago Hi TE, thanks for reading this, yes it was exactly that wasn't it? I remember talking to an elderly lady just after that and she told me that as a result, she had started locking up her home when she went out... the first time in 50 years she said. lol. Overall, I think we did well under the circumstances. Take care and raise a beer salute 10/7 ok?wesleycox7 months ago This is a nice story.  Thanks for sharing it, I never knew about this before reading your story so thank you.maven1017 months ago Hi Rob...Thank you for this interesting and informative Hub on the original Rainbow Warrior...The prose was simply beautiful and well constructed with your large talent for poetic expression...I really liked the word picture you drew of a " fearless dove " sailing into your bay...Thank you for sharing this with us...Tight lines, my friend...LarryPearldiver7 months ago Hi Wesley thanks for calling by and your comments. Glad you enjoyed the story, I'm also glad that it has enlightened you to a piece of history that changed the world. As Travelespresso has stated above.. the events covered in this hub had a massive affect on the psych of our nation (NZ). Take care mate and be well.Pearldiver7 months ago Hi Larry, thank you for reading this work and your kind comments. I'm glad you enjoyed the prose for this little ship. Here we think of her as our own and for a year after the bombing french restaurants suffered greatly. To the people of NZ the event probably shocked us as much as Pearl Harbour moved the American people. We did live the emotions didn't we? Thanks again Larry, I hope you and family are well. Tight lines mate... take care.. it must be bass time.. Rob.tonymac047 months ago Tnanks for a wonderful and poignant reminder of a brave little ship! I well remember my horro at that evil bombing. I love Greenpeace and all it stands for - the best of humanity is in that movement.Thanks for sharing this (and sorry about the Super 14!) better luck next time! I live in Bulls territory and my wife is a fanatical supporter. Me not so much but anyway I live with it!Thanks againLove and peaceTonyPearldiver7 months ago Hi Tony, thank you for reading this work, I'm glad you enjoyed the tribute. I agree completely with you in relation to Greenpeace and its active members. Truely an organisation that cut through the barriers of race etc and brought so many together in a common goal. Wow you tell your wife her team deserved every point they gained in the contest.... she has good taste mate... as I'm sure you will agree. Don't write off the kiwis in FIFAs WC. Take care and be well.mandybeau17 months ago I was particularly p...ed at France, marfart and Prieux, were more or less Agents so, basically did what they were told. The french Govt. was totally to blame, and yes Frogs very often have a lack of intestinal fortitude (I can say that look at my name) Wars have been fought on French soil, and the Allies have lost many lives saving French Bacon. I am a Greenpeace Supporter, and believe that our Govt, were also lacklustre and showed no Balls at all sending those two off to that Atol, they should have been imprisoned here. For Life. It was obvious that Dominique Prieux would get herself spudded.  I wasn't sure How Alain Marfart, was going to get off, but he did.A horrible Crime and sadly one with no one held accountable. I saw the Boat myself I was in Auckland at the time.Good one Pearldiver. Then the crappy Japs, that all should have been finished off in World War two got our little Boat Earth race rammed by Whalers. Give me 2 hours in a room with them. I hate the Japanese with a vengeance.mandy Beau.......Pearldiver7 months ago Hi Mandy, thanks for calling by to read this work. Bit of a kiwi flavour to it huh? Yep, it wasn't a good day was it.. and I think many felt the same way you did.Re: the Adi Gil, I think the NZ government should have supported the protest.. but they have a cowardly vested interest and did nothing about the ramming, the arrest or the whales. Japan is NZs 4th largest trading partner... I guess that's a good enough reason to let them get away with it huh?  Take Care mate.equealla7 months ago This is sad. I've spent my due time on the ocean waters as well. Anyone who has done that, will know, that you can't help to have a love afair with a vessel like that. At night time, especially, they talk to you with creaks and groans which is very comforting, when there is just water and water and water all around you. I am just glad that she'd found a resting place close enough not to dissapear from memory forever. She is indeed a hero, and your poem will help us to remember.Deerwhisperer7 months ago I'm glad people like GreenPeace are out there! Good WorkPearldiver7 months ago Hi equealla, Thanks for reading this work about the Rainbow Warrior and your comments.  Yes it was a sad story and one that did affect the whole world for the duration that Greenpeace could not achieve their objectives as a result of the bombing of her.  You are so very right about hulls and gear at night. New Zealand has honored this warrior who now lies in one of the most beautiful coastal spots in the country. Take Care.Pearldiver7 months ago Hi there Deerwhisperer, thank you for taking the time to read this work. Greenpeace have done more good than most could know, merely by being there to witness, obstruct and report those actions we would not have otherwise known occurred and in some cases believed. Take care.Micky Dee6 months ago Excellent hub! This is a great tribute! Thank you Pearldiver!Pearldiver6 months ago Hi there again Micky Dee, thanks for reading this and your kind comments. Such heavy days then weren't they? I hope my words really do do justice to this tribute. Thanks again mate.. you take care.travelespresso6 months ago AND today is the 20th Anniversary of the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior! Kudos Greenpeace!Once again, your poem is inspired PD.  You have a great talent!Pearldiver6 months ago Hi TE, Thanks for that, but today is the 25th Anniversary of the 1985 bombing. It seems like just yesterday... Yep I agree; Kudos Greenpeace.. Kiwis will always support you and your efforts to change the world. This event and the terrible sacrifice of Fernando Pereira, will always ensure that generations beyond ours never forget.
