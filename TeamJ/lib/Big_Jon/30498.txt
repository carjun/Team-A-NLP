The Republicans, incumbent Pete Sessions of Texas and freshman Mike Fitzpatrick, missed the swearing in, but watched it on television from the Capitol Visitors Center.There is no provision in the Constitution for a remote swearing-in by television.Roll Call notes its unclear whether Democrats will force the chamber to restart the entire process of opening the new Congress. That would result in a delay of the health care repeal vote for several days.***Pete Sessions Breaks Rules, Briefly Shuts Down Rules CommitteeEvan McMorris-Santoro | January 6, 2011, 5:17PMRep. Pete Sessions (R-TX)Call it a stumble out of the gate. Or a failure to find the gate entirely. Veteran Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) and freshman Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA) failed to make the official swearing in ceremony yesterday, a violation of the Constitution that has sent Republicans scrambling and briefly brought an end to the new majoritys push to repeal the health care reform law.Freshly-minted House Rules Committee chair David Dreier (R-CA) had to recess hearings on repealing the health care law after he learned that Sessions, a member of the committee, was not in fact a Constitutionally-valid member of the 112th Congress. Sessions had been casting votes all day like the duly-sworn members on the committee.Dreier spokesperson Jo Maney told TPM that she didnt know it happened that Sessions wasnt sworn in, but after Dreier found out about it, he recessed the hearing to sort out the mess.Sessions has now been officially sworn in as required by the Constitution, Maney said. The same goes for Fitzpatrick, she said, though thats of less concern to the health care repeal as hes not a member of the Rules Committee like Sessions is. But the failure to be sworn in could mean the rules package the House passed on Wednesday doesnt count, according toRoll Call. The action is now behind the scenes, as Speaker John Boehner tries to persuade House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to agree to a unanimous consent decree that would make all the work Sessions and Fitzpatrick did over the past day count retroactively.Read more GOP lawmakers cast House votes despite missing swearing-inReps.

A more detailed analysis of the legislation is forthcoming, the CBO said.The $230 billion estimate is higher than one from last year, largely because it now examines the effect of the law between 2012 and 2021 instead of an earlier window.On top of all of this .It appaers that Healthcare spending has actually grown slower in the past year( effected by the economy for sure )..So if the Healthcare law con cut spending WTF are the Republicans trying to upset things by going backwards?Many consumers decreased their use of health care goods and services, partly because they had lost employer-based private health insurance coverage and partly because their household income had declined, said Anne B. Martin, an economist and principal author of the report, issued by the office of the actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.In many cases, Ms. Martin said, people decided to forgo health care services they could not afford.The number of visits to doctors offices apparently declined. Manyhospitals reported fewer admissions, as patients put off medical procedures. Spending on dental services declined slightly. Many hospitals and other health care providers reduced their capital investments. Spending on doctors services in 2009 increased at the slowest pace since 1996, according to the new federal study, being published in the journal Health Affairs.***Republicans pounced on the new numbers. No one should take solace in the fact that health spending grew at a lower rate in 2009, said SenatorOrrin G. Hatch of Utah, who is in line to be the senior Republican on the Finance Committee.Mr. Hatch said the new health care law could lead to crushing increases in health costs and premiums.By contrast, the chiefMedicare actuary, Richard S. Foster, has estimated that the new law will lead to an increase of only nine-tenths of 1 percent in national health spending over 10 years.Uninsured people who gain coverage will use more health care, Mr. Foster said, but the law is also supposed to reduce the growth of Medicare payments to many health care providers..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Politics, The Economy, WomenBudget Deficits, Cost to the Government, Democrats vs the GOP in the House, Repealing the Healthcare vote, republicans, The Healthcare LawRead moreThe incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner has a very hard two years in front of himJanuary 4, 2011jamesb101No comments80 new GOP House members..The Tea Party looking over his shoulderA Popular President.Running for re-Election in less than two yearsI huge Debt overrun.Only so much he can actually cut from the budget.A Democratic Majority Senate.And the knowledge that IF he does not get ANYTHING done in two yearsAnd the Economy comes roaring back with jobs.He could very well become the Minority Leader.Again.He says hes up for it.Everyone will be watching(Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)Driven from his partys leadership in 1998 and sidelined for nearly a decade, Mr. Boehner, a 61-year-old Ohio native who revels in his big-family, Roman Catholic roots, now faces the challenge of harnessing theTea Party zeal that propelled him to power without disheartening those who might be expecting too much.While he will preside over a substantial and energized Republican majority, Mr. Boehner must contend with a Democratic president with whom he has little personal history and a Democratic Senate leader who is disinclined to make Mr. Boehners life easier and who failed to consider hundreds of bills passed by the House even when his own party ran it.The problem is going to be the grass-roots movement out in the countryside, said Vin Weber, a former Republican House member and Washington lobbyist who served with Mr. Boehner in the 1990s. They have no sense of the limits on a party that controls only one of the three seats of power. Managing that relationship is going to be difficult.And that is just one of the problems confronting Mr. Boehner, a former small-business man who has been carefully preparing for his new role for months and seems to relish the chance to finally run the often-unmanageable House the way he believes it ought to be runMoreNote: Rep. Boehner in assuming the Speaker of the House spot will become the 2rd person in the succession line for the Presidency.As such he will assume a Capitol Police Detail and have the priviage of traveling on military planes while on offical business.He will also be afforded additional local police protection when in his home state.Behind him on the list (#3) is Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye who as Senate Pro Tem has the same Capitol and Local Police added protection.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesIn line for the Presidency, incoming House Speaker Boehner, Police Protection Details, republicansRead moreThe Senate 2012 movesDSD..January 1, 2011jamesb1016 commentsHere are the comments I added to my original post (on an earlier thread by someone else about the NRSCs top 5 targets: Fla, Neb., ND, etc.) So (after adjusting for Scott Browns election) there are 21 Democrats, 1 Independent Democrat, 1 Independent and 10 Republicans up for re-election or retirement in 2012. The GOP has more targets.A few Republicans (e.g. John Ensign [Nev.], Scott Brown [Mass.], Bob Corker [Tenn.]) are not immune from plausible challenge, but should they run again such home-state institutions as Jon Kyl (Ariz.), Richard Lugar (Ind.), Olympia Snowe (Me.) and Orrin Hatch (U.) wont be dislodged short of scandal or a tectonic landslide.In theory, Sen. Snowe could lose if the Maine GOP collapses, but her current position seems more like John Chafees (R.I.) than his son Lincoln. On the other hand, Margaret Chase Smith (R.-Me.) slowly lost popularity and touch with her electorate and eventually lost re-election.The other three Republican Senators up in 2012 are John Barrasso (Wyo.), Kay Bailey Hutchison (Texas) and Roger Wicker (Miss.)*** I hate to sound like Daniel G., but the DSCC (Dem. Sen. Campaign Ctee) will have to run the table to shift the current stalemated Senate back away from Mitch McConnells obstructionism. Theyll have to hold on to seat like North Dakota and Nebraska, while trying to dislodge someone like John Ensign or Scott Brown.Twenty-two months before the event, it seems (I say grudgingly and regretfully) more likely that in the 113th Congress well return to the knife-edge do-nothing Senate we loved so well between 2001 and 2009. Worse if McConnell becomes Majority Leader while John Boehner remains Speaker.

Congressional action was backed by Pentagon officials as a better alternative to a court-ordered end.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Military, Politics, Updates, WomenDADT/Don't Ask...Don't Tell, Gays in the military, republicans, Sen Collins, Sen Lieberman, Sen.

Former Alaska Gov.Sarah Palin has parachuted into a handful of major events, including big-venue rallies for Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Karen Handel. Minnesota Gov.Tim Pawlenty has made several early-state and regional campaign swings, balancing his responsibilities as a sitting governor with his surrogate work as vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association.Other possible candidates  like former House SpeakerNewt Gingrich and former Arkansas Gov.Mike Huckabee  have picked their targets even more selectively, helping out contenders they have personal relationships with or diving into especially hot races like the gubernatorial primaries in Florida and Georgia.Romneys schedule is so all-inclusive that it barely looks like hes picking his targets. In just the past few weeks, hes campaigned for Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson and gubernatorial candidate Nathan Deal. He made a Western campaign trip that included stops for Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, Nevada House candidate Joe Heck and gubernatorial nominee Brian Sandoval, among others. He also made a trip to Florida on Oct. 1 to boost Rick Scott  who won an upset victory over state Attorney General Bill McCollum, whom Romney campaigned for back in June  in the GOP gubernatorial primary.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesConservatives/GOP, Mitt Romney running for 2012 GOP Presidential nomination, republicansRead morePage 1 of 7123...7Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
