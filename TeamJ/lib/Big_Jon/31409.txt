Gabrielle Giffords (D) and the murder of six of her constituentsserves as a terrible reminder to all of our political and civic leaders about the need to end the use of appeals to violence in our political rhetoric. We must find ways to passionately debate and even disagree with each other without using words that can give unstable individuals an incitement to engage in violent acts.The attack came as Giffords met with her constituentsfor a public meeting outside a grocery store.The gunmanseriously wounded Giffords, killedsix people and wounded 13 others. In an e-mail today to AFL-CIO activists, Trumka writes that during the past few years,violence in political dialogue has gotten out of control.We do not know why the shooter targeted Rep. Giffords, or if he was influenceddirectly or indirectlyby the outrageous rhetoric thats become all-too-common in our politics.But toomuch vitriolic, hate-filled rhetoric that we hear on radio and television hasdemonized public servants and candidates as enemies and has made them sounds less than human. In the short run, it may inspire passions and votes. But in the long run, its toxic to the survival of rational discussion in our democracy. And its not worthy of our great nation.In 2010, as the anti-government rhetoric heated up on radio and television airwaves and across websites, threats of violence against members Congress jumped 300 percent, according to Politico.AFSCME President Gerald McEntee says the horrendous crime has spurred a national conversation about the use violent imagery and extremist anti-government rhetoric in political discussions.As public employees, our members know what it is like to be on the receiving end of anti-government attacks. Less than a year ago, an anti-tax extremist smashed his airplane into the IRS office building in Austin, Texas, where more than 200 federal employees worked. Only last week, two mail-bombs were sent to government offices in Maryland where AFSCME members work to provide vital services.We urge everyone engaged in public debate to take concrete steps to ensure that our discourse remains civil and that nothing is said or done that might precipitate another attack on our democracy and the values we all cherish.United Steelworkers (USW) President Leo W. Gerard calls Giffords a principled public servant on the issues important to Arizonas working families, and saysWe need to be a nation that comes together and rises to our best values.When theres talk of target lists illustrated by gun sights, when theres talk of Second Amendment remedies for political problems, when vitriol has gone as far as it did in the recent election season, says Trumka, it must be condemned as dangerous and unacceptable by leaders and citizens across the political spectrum.Ive always believed that America works because many people contribute many ideasand thats good, even when some of them I flat out disagree with. But all people must come to the table in good faith. Those of us in the public eye have a special responsibility not to employ violent rhetoric, because it can have dire consequences. As leaders and activists, we have the responsibility to weigh our words carefully and to foster respect and understanding, not violence.Add a CommentNamerequired, use real nameEmailrequired, will not be publishedWebsite addressoptional, your blog addressCAPTCHA Code Next Post: Australia floods menace BrisbanePreviose Post: CNN: Jobs market on the right pathVirgil Bierschwale - click hereI added a new page at the top about your townA little humor for todayNames, Not NumbersLets assume that Gallup is right about 60 percent unemployment World WideGet It?Mitch Gurney - click hereClaims U.S Founded as Christian Nation Misrepresents HistoryTea Party Nationalism  what is it?Our World is at a Cross roads  a 2nd perspectiveAmericas Unemployed and some employed get a stiff middle fingerMasters of Compromise  how things get done in DC, but sometimes the public gets shaftedDerek Singleton - Click to viewStrategies for Growing as a Domestic ManufacturerWhat is good for America?
