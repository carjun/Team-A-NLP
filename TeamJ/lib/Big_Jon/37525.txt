U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head Saturday morning during an event with voters outside a local grocery store. U.S. District Judge John Roll, and at least five others, were killed in the attack.The official, who has been briefed on the investigation, spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the case. Officials have identified the shooter as 22-year-old Jared Loughner of Tucson. He is in custody. The Washington Post reported late Saturday that Loughner purchased the gun Nov. 30 from the Sportsman's Warehouse in Tucson.

From what we know, Jared Loughman's acts were those of a madman divorced from reality, let alone from public debate. But that doesn't make Tucson politically meaningless. The president need not, and should not, speak of ideas or programs or parties. What he can speak about, and what perhaps he will speak about, is civility.

It's disingenuous.   What country are they living in?   An armed society is a polite society according to the late Charlton Heston.   How Canada can be such a polite society without guns is beyond me.   Must be the water.   Or the sanity.Two weeks from now (maybe sooner), the intense media attention, and concern will abate about this incident, and it will be forgotten until the next "senseless" gun massacre rolls off the American assembly line in two or three months time. The cost of living in America is accepting a higher an annual number of gun deaths than the rest of the Western world combined.  Six people paid that cost today.  And now they are no longer living.We'll probably have another two or three quarterly gun massacres before the year is out.  That's a safe bet.  That's the American norm.  That's our "American Exceptionalism".

I do not think too much should be inferred about changing the ability of people to legally own guns, simply because Loughner owned one.  Florida is a state which has tons of permit holders.  As prevalent as legal gun ownership is there, the state licensing website's statistics demonstrate less than a tenth of a percent of said permits have been revoked due to crimes committed by those who legally carry guns.I disagree with attacking the notion of legal gun ownership as applied to everybody due to .1% who prove to be incapable of following the law.  A fraction of a percent indicates a lack of a causal relationship between legally owning a gun and the tendency to commit a crime with it.

I hate to think that this will result in even tighter security and even less access to our elected officials, but who would even think of being a public figure or even coming to an event one of them is hosting if we have to be afraid that every person next to us could be an armed madman in waiting.Its fine to want to protect yourself, and your loved ones, but can we please leave the guns at home?  Those who died today deserved better than this, and this could have been any American citizen or official.  Any one of us who support our politicians on any end of the spectrum are the same as the Americans grieving today, and any one of us could have met this same fate, just for being American, and involved in politics.Obviously a crazy person will find any way they can to hurt others, but we can at least try to stop making it so easy for them to accomplish their goals.            billjmcdaniel: I still support the rights of Americans to own guns,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/billjmcdaniel/gabrielle-giffords-shooter-gun_n_806297_73228282.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itBarbara Hendrick                                                    21 hours ago (11:11 PM)                        0 Fans                after what happend to day no one should be able to get a hold a of guns at all now look what happend its reail scarey what is world comeing to where the parents of  this young man no guides at all. and they shouldend be able to use shuch things a mentail illennes as a exoueces for what they did. that been used to manny times. we have to think much more safer for everyone.may all prays go out to all that where hurt to day.
