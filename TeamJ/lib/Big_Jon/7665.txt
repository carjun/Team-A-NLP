But it is not that hard to come up with scenarios in which the new electoral math might have altered the outcome of the election. If, for instance, Mr. Obama had won each of the states that John Kerry did in 2004, as well as Ohio, his total would be 264 electoral votes under the new allocation, leaving him 6 shy. By contrast, those same states would have been worth 272 electoral votes in 2008, giving him a narrow victory.Over all, however, it would be easy to exaggerate the difference that these shifts in the electoral college might make.Consider this: under the new electoral college allocation that will go into effect in 2012, the outcome of every presidential election in the past century would have been the same had the new numbers been used.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, Updates2010 Census figures, 2012 House redistricting, Limited effect, Nate Silver@FivethirtyeightRead moreThank You Bill Clinton for gettting the ball rolling on Healthcare and Dont Ask..December 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsIn a piece in the Washington Post we are reminded that President Clinton started out on changing both and got ran over.(Hillary did actually Healthcare)..Truly momentous legislation that changes policy takes a long time..To get things done requires heavy lifting and persistence.President Obama has done both more a decade later because Americans have also changed.And despite fear, politics and egos.This is all good for America..At a highly unusual news conference more than two weeks ago, President Obama introduced former President Clinton, then left the briefing room to go to a Christmas party whileClinton touted a tax agreement the White House was pushing. But for most of the last two years, the opposite has happened: Obama has campaigned to enact goals Clinton failed to achieve.On Wednesday morning, Obamawill signed into law a repeal of the ban on people who are openly gay from serving in the military  a ban that Clinton tried to get rid of in the early 1990s before settling on dont ask, don tell as a compromise.In the afternoon, the Senate islikely to give final approval to a major nuclear weapons treaty with Russia that the Clinton administration unsuccessfully pursued more than 10 years ago.And most famously, Obama earlier this year signed a massive health care expansion that had eluded his Democratic predecessor.These policies and priorities are of course not unique to either man; most Democratic presidents would likely have pushed them. And their successful passage during Obamas second year in office has as much to do with timing as either presidents legislative skill.Support for gay rights, for example, has increased dramatically since Clinton tried to change the militarys policy on gays almost two decades ago. Many of the people who helped push Obamas health-care law through Congress, such as then-chief of staffRahm Emanuel, personally participated in and learned from the 1993-94 experience.The former president does not sound envious when he talks about his successors achievements. Tensions from the 2008 campaign have cooled, as the two have praised each other publicly and Obama has sought the advice of both Clinton and his wife, the highly regarded Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton.I was in the Oval Office talking to the president about a number of things, Bill Clinton said in an interview last week on Larry King Live, recalling his meeting with Obama earlier this month..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Media, Men, Military, Politics, Polls, UpdatesDA/DT- Don't Ask/Don't Tell, ex-President Bill Clinton, President Obama, The Healthcare BillRead moreDont Ask GOP votes followed the polls..December 19, 2010jamesb101No commentsYou think?..Popularity of Dont Ask Repeal May Have Drawn Republican VotesByNATE SILVERHeres an important, but not surprising, statistic from Saturdaysvote to repeal the militarys dont ask, dont tell policy.There are, in the lame duck session, 11 Republican senators from states that President Obama carried in 2008. Of these, 7 voted with the Democrats to repeal the policy, while 3 voted against it. (One other  the retiring Republican Judd Gregg of New Hampshire  did not vote at all.)By contrast, right there are now 31 Republican senators from states that Senator John McCain won in 2008. Just one of these  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska  voted to repeal the ban on gay servicemembers. Another 28 voted against it, and two did not vote.Ms. Murkowski just won re-election as a write-in candidate, running against a conservative Republican. She is the only Republican to have voted both to repeal the ban on openly gay soldiers and to break a filibuster on theDream Act, which would have provided a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Ms. Murkowski clearly seems to feel as though she has license to legislate as a moderate.The three Republicans from states Mr. Obama carried who voted against the bill, meanwhile, are each something of an unusual case. Iowas Chuck Grassley just won re-election and, since he will be 83 in 2016, may not run for it again. Indianas Richard Lugar will face re-election in 2012, but he is is extremely popular among Indianans in general and may face a stronger threat from a Republican primary challenge than in the general election (although, interestingly, he joined Ms. Murkowski in voting for cloture on the Dream Act.) And Floridas George LeMieux is retiring.In what reflects a shift from the way that gay rights initiatives have been perceived in the past, however, other Republicans seemed to conclude they might have been taking on some measure of risk by voting to perpetuate a policy thata clear majority of the public wanted to see repealed.Read moreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Military, Politics, Polls, UpdatesDA/DT- Don't Ask/Don't Tell vote in Congress, Gays in the military, GOP Senators who voted for repeal, President Obama, Public opinion, Voting with the public's feelingsRead moreMidterm voters: substantially misinformedTalkandpoliticsDecember 18, 2010jamesb101No commentsIll pin this straight in the face of Dan Pfeiffer, 34 (!), White House Communications Director.Voters have huge misconceptions ofdocumented positive effects of thestimulus billlong-term deficit-reducting effects ofhealth care billactual (but slow) growth of theeconomy for 18 months (!)scientific agreement onclimate changeMore details from TPM:Though the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) concluded that the stimulus legislation has saved or created 2.0-5.2 million jobs, only 8% of voters thought most economists who had studied it concluded that the stimulus legislation had created or saved several million jobs.

Going into 2010, Democrats felt confident that they would hold their ground and had their sights set on 2012 when President Obama would be up for re-election and the Governors office would be open since Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels is term limited. Alas, not only did the 2010 midterm election unravel the progress that Democrats made over the past four years, it set them back a few steps. Democrats got another piece of bad news this week when outgoing Sen. Evan Bayh announced that he would not run for Governor in 2012, depriving the party of its best shot at winning the seat.http://cookpolitical.com/As for the Presidential Race:While I do think that Obama may have a shot winning VIRGINIA again the State which went for Obama in 2008 and is certainly going RED again in 2012 will be INDIANA.The President has very likely dug himself to deep in a Hole in the Hoosier State to win it again in 2012.Daniel G.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesDaniel@Politicaldog101, Obama and Virgina, Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) WON'T RUN for Indiana Governor in 2012Read morePoliticalwire on Party Switching and Democratic House Return matches in 2012..December 16, 2010jamesb101No commentsParty Switching Usually Doesnt WorkThe Fix notes that of the last 12 party-switchers in the House of Representatives, just six won their next elections. Of the last four party-switchers in the Senate, only Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) won re-election.The problem with party-switching is twofold: the party you leave takes it personal affront and does everything it can to beat you AND the party you join is skeptical about your real motives with doubts lingering about whether you are a wolf in sheeps clothing.***Many Rematches PossibleMore than a half-dozen defeated House Democrats are considering running again for the seats they lost in the November elections,Politico reports.Some members  including Reps. Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire, Phil Hare of Illinois, Dina Titus of Nevada, Frank Kratovil Jr. of Maryland, Alan Mollohan of West Virginia and Glenn Nye of Virginia  have said publicly that they are mulling over rematches.

His lowest marks come on the professional side: being a good commander-in-chief (41%), achieving his goals (33%), uniting the country (30%), and changing Washington (24%). Bottom line: The jurys still out on whether the president is going to be successful or not, as over 40% tell us its STILL too soon to judge what kind of president Obama is going to be.Reassuring Signs for Obama in PennsylvaniaA newQuinnipiac poll in Pennsylvania finds President Obama in decent shape heading into the 2012 campaign, with improving approval numbers and strong support for his recent deal with Republicans on tax cuts.Pennsylvanians now narrowly approve of President Obamas job performance 44% to 43%, the first time since March 2009 that he has had positive net approval in the state. There is also overwhelming support for the tax cut deal, 69% to 24%, with independents providing a stronger level of support than Republicans or Democrats, 72% to 20%.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesObama Poll numbers, Obama Polls well in Pennsylvania, Polling, President ObamaRead moreObama remains more popular than GOP AFTER the Midterms..December 14, 2010jamesb1015 commentsPresident Obama and his people appaer to have a hit a home run on the Obama Tax Deal..Which plays into this polls numbers that show Americans DO want compromise over GOP rhectoric.Obama playing against the Left of his party will not hurt him in a national election enough to lose oneNot bad politics this deal is gonna turn out to be, huh?The midterm elections  in which Republicans gained 63 seats to take control of the House and added six seats to their Senate minority  were widely seen as a rebuke toPresident Obama. Still, the public trusts Obama marginally more than congressional Republicans to deal with the countrys main problems in the coming years, 43 percent to 38 percent.The poll suggests that the election may have been a vote against the status quo, but that it was not a broad mandate for Republicans and their plans. The survey also underscores the degree to which Americans are conflicted about who they think is setting the agenda in Washington.The presidents narrow advantage is a striking contrast to the publics mood at this time in 1994 and 2006, the last twomidterm election years when one or both chambers of Congress changed hands.After Democrats won back the House and the Senate four years ago, they had a large, double-digit lead over PresidentGeorge W. Bush when it came to big issues. Similarly, afterthe GOPs 1994 landslide, people expressed far more confidence in congressional Republicans than they did in PresidentBill Clinton.In the new poll, just 41 percent of respondents say the GOP takeover of the House is a good thing. About 27 percent say it is a bad thing, and 30 percent say it wont make any difference.
