Palo Alto :  CA :  USA|Jan 09, 2011By carolvillanueva        1 0     Views: 105      http://weeklyworldnews.com/headlines/27321/facebook-will-end-on-march-15th/  I read the link above and it says: PALO ALTO, CA Mark ZuckerbergMark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook will be shut down in March. Managing the site has become too stressful. Facebook has gotten out of control, said Zuckerberg in a press conference outside his Palo Alto office, and the stress of managing this company has ruined my life. I need to put an end to all the madness. Zuckerberg went on to explain that starting March 15th, users will no longer be able to access their Facebook accounts. After March 15th the whole website shuts down, said Avrat Humarthi, Vice President of Technical Affairs at Facebook. So if you ever want to see your pictures again, I recommend you take them off the internet. You wont be able to get them back once Facebook goes out of business. etc... Now millions of users of facebook might have been trying to visit the site and it's flooded that's why you will be having hard time to access it. Let's just pray that this will not happen. Because this too popular "Social Network" has been part of lives of many of us. Facebook is a social network service and website launched in February 2004 that is operated and privately owned by Facebook, Inc. As of July 2010[update] Facebook has more than 500 million active users,Users may create a personal profile, add other users as friends and exchange messages, including automatic notifications when they update their profile. Additionally, users may join common interest user groups, organized by workplace, school, or college, or other characteristics. The name of the service stems from the colloquial name for the book given to students at the start of the academic year by university administrations in the US with the intention of helping students to get to know each other better. Facebook allows anyone who declares themselves to be at least 13 years old to become a registered user of the website. Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow computer science students Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before opening to high school students, and, finally, to anyone aged 13 and over.        1 of 39         Is It True That Facebook Will End on March 15, 2011?      carolvillanueva is based in Bian, Southern Tagalog, Philippines,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (44.2%) United Arab Emirates (25.0%) Canada (6.7%) Philippines (6.7%) 12 other countries (13.5%)           READ MORE: facebook, end of Facebook, Social Network, Zuckerberg, education, entertainment-news, Avrat Humarthi, Palo Alto, Social information processing, Dustin Moskovitz, Eduardo Saverin, Chris Hughes, Social network service, Facebook features, California, World Wide Web, Criticism of Facebook, Online social networking, Mark Zuckerberg, Technology Internet   More News From: Palo Alto :  CA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Facebook shut down hoax spreads like fire By: myscottishfitba      Facebook shut down hoax spreads like fireInternet faux news site Weekly World News postedan outrageous story that Facebook will be shut down on March 15th 2011,due to the stress it has put Founder Mark Zuckerberg through.Normally this type of news would not even be worth our time andeffort, but an unfortunate situation o  about 2 hours ago     Facebook Will NOT End on March 15 By: glassshards      Have you heard the rumors that spread like wildfire across the cyber nation that Facebook will end on March 15?The rumored closing of the biggest social networking site sprouted when CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly announced that managing the website has taken a toll on him, and has "to put an end to all the madness."The good news is that it is ...  about 5 hours ago     Facebook Is Shutting Down,Ending Operations On 15 March 2011,...
