U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head Saturday morning during an event with voters outside a local grocery store. U.S. District Judge John Roll, and at least five others, were killed in the attack.The official, who has been briefed on the investigation, spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the case. Officials have identified the shooter as 22-year-old Jared Loughner of Tucson. He is in custody. The Washington Post reported late Saturday that Loughner purchased the gun Nov. 30 from the Sportsman's Warehouse in Tucson.Read more: http://www.salon.com/wires/us/2011/01/08/D9KKHB780_us_c...

You may sell a handgun, as a private non dealer to anyone that you are not aware of as being prohibited from buying one. In other words, if you don't ask the guy if he is crazy or a felon, it is legal to sell to him. Back ground checks are only for FFLs, stores and gun shops. I think about 5 states require background checks on sales of handguns between private parties.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Sat Jan-08-11 09:39 PMResponse to Reply #1011.Deleted messageMessage removed by moderator.

Guns are the tools of choice for this activity.  The chances of being effective are far better with gun.  This is why police are armed with them.  I am sure some cops carry a knife as well, but a sidearm is standard equipment.  You would have to agree that there is a reason for this marked preference.  The human imagination is never at a loss for new and inovative means for mayhem.  But there is a reason police do not carry broadswords, pruning shears, maces, garottes, nun-chuks, throwing stars, crossbows, muskets, chainsaws, bazookas, claymores,.... but do carry Glocks.  I think it is because they believe this type of weapon gives them an advantage...  I could be nuts, but I don't think so.I also happen to think people buy sidearms "for defense" as opposed to any of the above, because they believe the sidearm will give them an advantage greater than the other potential options.  Machetes are quite easy to obtain around here, and certainly if well sharpened, could be quite lethal.  But curiously, folks don't rush out and stockpile them for home defense, they buy sidearms instead.  If they were equivalent, one would perhaps wonder why the preference?  Machetes are after all quite a bit cheaper and easier to maintain.The problem arises when a mentally unbalanced person gets the same sense of advantage that every one else seems to get by owning such a weapon.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topfasttense      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 08:41 AMResponse to Reply #4973.A dog, truck, and baseball bat all have uses beyond killing.

Jan Brewer signed legislation that will  before summers end  enable citizens there to carry concealed handguns without a concealed carry permit.  Arizona now becomes the third state, following Vermont and Alaska in that order, which has no requirement to obtain a carry license to pack a defensive sidearm. The legislation was strongly lobbied by the Arizona Citizens Defense League, and gun rights activists across the map think this is a hot idea, insisting that governments should not have the authority to regulate the carrying of firearms by requiring a permit for concealed carry. Gov. Brewer signed the bill because she trusts the citizens she serves. The law will become effective sometime this summer, 90 days after the legislature adjourns."http://www.examiner.com/gun-rights-in-seattle/gun-right... Having grown up in Central Illinois I was shocked and dismayed by AZ guns laws when I moved to Tucson in '95.  I remember working in a local camping store that sold ammo.  The first time I sold ammo to someone who was carrying their firearm on their hip just left me floored that it was legal to walk into stores, banks, etc with a gun.

The basic presumption of innocence means that sometimes people who do bad things can get tools that we may wish they didn't have.A much better solution in my opinion is to make mental health care more easily available to everyone.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbrentspeak      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:56 PMResponse to Reply #98103.There's a legal determination of mental illness prior to commiting a crime?

A clearly unstable like the shooter in question, because he had never been previously committed, easily falls through the NRA-approved definition of "legally adjudicated as mentally ill":http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/27cfr478.... Act. 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44.    Adjudicated as a mental defective. (a) A determination by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease:    (1) Is a danger to himself or to others; or    (2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.    (b) The term shall include--    (1) A finding of insanity by a court in a criminal case; and    (2) Those persons found incompetent to stand trial or found not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to articles 50a and 72b of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. 850a, 876b.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topslackmaster      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:59 PMResponse to Reply #118119.Please post a change in law that you believe would have prevented yesterday's shootingOne that would pass a constitutional challenge in court.Thanks in advance.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbrentspeak      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 03:07 PMResponse to Reply #119122.Police-issued handgun permits, with demonstration of justifiable need to own such permit n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topslackmaster      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 03:08 PMResponse to Reply #122123.I can't accept subjective criteria being used to determine who gets to exercise civil rightsOn this, we shall disagree.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbrentspeak      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 03:19 PMResponse to Reply #123126.Of course, none of it is actually "subjective criteria"Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 03:19 PM by brentspeakas such information culled from police-issued background checks are thoroughly discussed between not only among both local and state police, but also before a state police board, and, if necessary, the courts.

The issuance of permits would not be consistent from one place to another, or at different times in a given place.  Police could simply deny you a permit because they don't like you, and there wouldn't be jack shit you could do about it....but also before a state police board, and, if necessary, the courts. That's several layers of ultimately objective fact-finding.It's not fact until a court says so.  Your Byzantine system adds many layers that might take so long to get through that a person's civil rights have been effectively denied without speedy recourse.A purely objective system (i.e. no felony conviction, no adjudication, no dishonorable discharge from the military, lawful resident of the state, of a particular age, etc.) avoids that problem.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbrentspeak      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:23 PMResponse to Reply #138145.Police don't "deny you a permit because they don't like you"As has been patiently explained to you probably a hundred times on these boards in the past several years (are you really qualified to handle the awesome responsibility to own a firearm if you have to have things explained to you time and time and time again?) -- and which your own response accidentally points out -- the background check involves several layers of review (local police, state police, etc.).Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topslackmaster      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 08:40 PMResponse to Reply #145147.The background check takes less than three minutes most of the time, in most statesEdited on Sun Jan-09-11 08:41 PM by slackmasterPassing or failing it is determined by a set of clear, concise rules.  You're talking about creating a bureaucratic maze that could take weeks or months to wade through, and you are unwilling to produce specific criteria that would disqualify a person from owning a firearm.The system we have in place right now has very clear factors for determining who can have a gun and who can't.  You're talking about giving more people opportunities to screw with peoples' exercise of a civil right, in which results would be inherently unpredictable.  I thought our party's philosophy was for government to treat all people equally.  The system in place works, and it's not at all certain that your proposed process would have prevented yesterday's massacre in Tucson.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcleanhippie      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:03 PMResponse to Reply #126140.Dude, "demonstration of justifiable need to own such permit " is NOTHING BUT subjective.How can you say in one post that the police should have the power to subjectively issue permits based on a "need" that they and they alone determine is applicable or not and then in the very next post say that it is not subjective.You seem to be having a serious disconnect here.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbrentspeak      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:17 PMResponse to Reply #140144.You seem to have a serious problem with readingI never said that the police alone make the judgment on the issue of justifiable need; I wrote that a permit-holder's request is reviewed by local police, state police, a separate board, and, if necessary, a court of law.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPaladin      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:45 PMResponse to Reply #8299.You Have A Problem With His Behavior?
