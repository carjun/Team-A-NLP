Photo by Stephen Bass All Rights ReservedWhen do you need a labor law attorney?When you have exhausted every possible resource and you still have not been able to get resolution to the labor law problem, then you need a labor law attorney. Before obtaining a labor law attorney you could try to address the problem on an administrative level within the company you are working for. This may not result in much because companies and corporations usually have their own labor laws set by their own attorneys. The worker is always wrong.However, if the labor law broken falls outside the jurisdiction of the company's or corporation's legal reach you probably have grounds for a win-able case- in that event consider hiring a labor law attorney. Realize please that I am not an attorney and am not authorized by any source to provide legal information. However, what I am saying here just makes common sense to me.I experienced several labor union riots while I was teaching English and living in Korea. If you are considering teaching English in Asia, or anywhere else for that matter, check out the riot and civil unrest status first. Classes that you miss because of civil unrest will usually not be paid for by your employer.Attorneys in the NewsLabor Attorney Michael Axelrod diesLong Island Business News2 days agoA 15-year partner with East Meadow-based Certilman Balin Adler & Hyman lost his battle with cancer today.

In the upper right hand corner of this segment you will see labor law leaders, students and the public engaged in a labor law riot. I was sitting in a typical South Korean Hoff, or coffee house, when the riot police first arrived. Shortly after their arrival, the labor leaders and students arrived. The riot police carried a variety of armaments including 12 gauge semi-automatic shotguns. I observed the entire length of the time the demonstration and riot was in progress and no shots were fired. However, there were a number of very bloody beatings.What these people wanted was higher wages and better working conditions. Some of the people worked at major automobile manufacturing plants in Korea. A bystander in the Hoff told me that competition from Japan and China was causing some Korean companies to put a hold on salary increases and benefits because that would have had to result in an increase in product sales prices. Many Korean manufacturers were not able to increase the prices of their goods and still be able to compete internationally with the other Asian business tigers, China, Thailand, Malaysia and others.So, the workers, labor law leaders and the public took to the streets when all other efforts to change labor laws had failed, including efforts at the local and national levels involving introduction of new legislation and amending previous labor law legislation.You won't see these types of labor law riots in most countries involving reforms in labor law policies. For that you can be thankful because such civil unrest, although taking place thousands of miles away, can have some effect on your local economy.If you are currently having difficulty with your employer over some labor law business or government policy and the problem seems unresolvable I have posted several links below that may be of help.
