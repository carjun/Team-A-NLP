I glance toward the door. I feel drunk, as if my legs cant hold my weight. I grasp the window sill and push my forehead against the window. I need air. I gasp, choking on the silent scream that sticks in my throat. Thick, like molasses, I cant swallow it or vomit it up.  She cant shower in the daylight anymore. She cant look at her own body. She feels her body has betrayed her. So, I sit on the floor in the bathroom as she showers in the dark. Sprays of water hit my face as I squint in the darkness watching her. She cant close the shower curtain, so we leave it open. Her athletic body has shriveled. She has lost 30 pounds. No hips, no breasts, no more monthly period.   I watch as she soaps her body, moving the soap up and down her belly. I catch glimpses of her as the candle flickers. Something catches my eyes and move closer to see what it is. They are jagged lines across her stomach and legs. The red jagged lines almost glisten like ruby threads stitched into her body. They seem deliberate. And then it finally hits me. Self-inflicted wounds. Bright red Xs marking her stomach. A sharp blade of self hatred. I stand there frozen to the very marrow of my own bones. Our eyes meet and my mother hand automatically reaches to touch the rough edges of her wounds. I pull several squares of toilet paper from the roll and moisten it with my lips. I dab at them, wanting them to disappear. The blood seeps onto the paper and it frightens me. I am on my knees rubbing at her stomach, watching the diluted redness rush toward the bathtub drain. She starts to cry. I start to cry. I am on my feet running toward her bedroom. I am gathering objects in my hands. Scissors, tacks, pens, pencils, anything I think she can hurt herself with. I am frantic, searching under the bed, emptying drawers, pulling things out of the closet. I am out of control. Everything is out of control and I feel desperate. She runs to the safety of inside her closet. A place I find her hiding more often than not. I pull her sixth grade picture off of the wall. I am in the closet beside her. Look at her! Look at this little girl! This is you! This is the little you! Look at her and tell her that she doesnt deserve this! Tell her that together we are going to protect her and she is going to survive all of this! She slaps the picture from my hand, I dont know who that is. I dont remember her! Oh My God Mom, dont you get it? I cant find her anymore! I crawl into the closet next to her. I want to touch her, but I am afraid. I can only touch her now with her permission. Rape takes away permission. I want to reach out and touch her baby skin. I want to smell her and touch her hair. I want to hold her and tell her it is going to be okay, but I am not sure it will be. I tried everything to stop it. I tried to fight, hit, beg, plead and even bargain with him! she says, choking on her sobs, But,he wasnt listening! There were three of them and only one of me. One was holding my legs and one was holding my hands. One was pulling off my pants and trying to penetrate me. I was still fighting and they kept hitting me. I started bleeding from my nose and mouth. I could feel the blood between my legs. When I bled they got even madder. I tried to squeeze my legs together to prevent my blood from getting on the couch. When he was done with my vagina, he started forcing his penis in my mouth. At that point, I couldnt even cry or begin to reason with them, because every time I opened my mouth, he succeeded in pushing his penis in. All I could do was whimper. Whimper like a wounded animal. I felt as if was suffocating. When it was over, everyone went on watching television like it never happened. For a few minutes I questioned myself and wondered if I had imagined the whole thing. If maybe I had gone crazy. But then the bleeding between my legs told me that I didnt. I was afraid of the bleeding. It wouldnt stop. I wadded up as much toilet paper as I could and put it between my legs. Ive gone over it in my mind. Over and over.  Thought about what I would like to do to the person who raped my daughter. I thought about how I would strip him down. Force him to be naked and vulnerable. I thought about him pleading, begging me and how I would ignore him. How I wanted to press a gun against his skin, make him fear for his life. I thought about what I would say as I pushed the gun against his lips, Suck this, mother fucker. Yet, I realized in my fantasy of revenge, I could scare him. I could make him beg, but I could never physically or sexually assault him. It wasnt in my makeup. I wasnt capable of those things and I could never understand anyone who could do things like that. But, then it happens on a warm spring day. Im driving down a country road and it doesnt take long to notice the car in front of me belongs to one of the boys who raped my daughter. I can see him looking at me in his rear view mirror. He knows that it is me. He stops at the stop sign. It seems as though he is lingering there, taunting me. My fists are balled-up and I am aware of the tightness in my jaw as I grind my teeth together. I want to get out of the car. Its only him and me on this deserted country road. I want to open my car door and run toward him. I want to put my hands around his neck and squeeze. I want him to beg me to stop and delight in showing him no mercy. The same amount of mercy he showed for her. The anger inside me is intense, as my hand cramps around the steering wheel. I imagine myself running toward him with a tire iron, smashing his windows, jabbing at him, emptying this anger. Then in an instant I pull my car around him and start to speed past him. I slow down when my car is even with his. I raise my middle finger in his direction, Fuck you! You are a fucking animal! I feel stupid and victorious at the same time. I needed that moment of power over him. My friends no longer know what to say to me. They begin to avoid me. Rape is a topic that scares people. Its an assault on your sexual organs and that makes people uncomfortable. My friends are afraid if they talk to me I might talk about it. They are afraid I might need to talk about it. My daughter is now that girl according to them. That girl that was raped. My tears ooze out fast and greasy, sliding into my mouth. Pure and pathetic. I sob loudly. I want the sobbing to drown out the loudness of the pain I feel inside. I want to shake uncontrollably and finally collapse. How does one let out the hidden pain and then suddenly uncap it and demand that those emotions fall out like a bottle of pills on the counter? I ache inside. Find myself wishing my life away. It becomes like a disease that takes over my thoughts. I look at other people and wish I could be them. I walk past evening windows trying to peer inside from the street wondering how other people live. I want to pound on the glass, screaming and shouting. I want the whole world to acknowledge this pain. I want a hush to fall across the city, the county, the state and world and for every human being to stand up demand the protection of my gender. I truly want the world to stop, hear the gasp, and wait for the droves of people to come, rally next to rape survivors and claim they we arent going to take it anymore! But nobody ever comes. Three months later we are back at the hospital. Flashbacks and panic attacks. The nurse is talking to me, Oh I see, she, umm, was she, you know?  Yes, I answer. She was raped. You can say the word, you know. If you have cancer, you say cancer. If you have a wart, you call it wart. She was forcefully, sexually assaulted and I believe we call that rape. The nurse isnt sure how to respond to that. But, she tries.  Oh, I can relate. When my boyfriend and I broke up, he lit my couch on fire! I felt so violated, she says. I stare at her. Its not the same. A couch and body are two different things. One is human and one is not.   They settle us into a hospital room. A room with no sheets, no electrical outlets and a television encased behind a Plexi glass box. My daughter is curled up in a fetal position on the bed. I am standing next to her as there isnt even a chair in the room. Mom, she says, Did you notice we are in the crazy room? It isnt a crazy room,  I say, Its a room designed to protect a person from hurting themselves. And if women are crazy because of rape, then that makes one in six of us crazy. The doctor enters the room. Well, all of her blood tests have come back normal, he says, rubbing his chin with perplexed look, I mean, she looks okay to me. Does she look okay to you? I cant find anything wrong with her, he said.. Before I can answer I start laughing. Laughing loudly. I am amazed at the lack of knowledge involving rape. I am in shock and perplexed at how even the so called professionals still dont know how to deal with it. I stopped laughing and looked at him. Heres the deal, doc, this is how it goes. Once the physical evidence is gone, the inside stuff stays for a long time. And people cant get a grip on what they cant see. If you have a black eye, its evident. You look at the person and see they clearly have a black eye. Its the same with broken arm, or an open wound. Its obvious. But, do you have any idea how to heal something invisible to the naked eye? Can you cut open a heart and remove the sadness? Can you stab into a brain and control the fear, the humiliation, the devastation? I guess not, huh, docso why dont you take out your little prescription pad and a pen and give her some meds to numb the shit of her for another couple monthsbecause all we have is time. Time to let it pass and get over it. Isnt that how its done? We medicate women? Put a band aide on all that ails them? Oh your husband beats you? Heres a pill! Sexually molested? Raped? Weve got a pill for that too! Im not me anymore. I feel like a walking Rambo. Im more aware of the hunters now. Men are the hunters and women are the prey. Because men are bigger and stronger than we are, we lose choices. Where is the equality? How can we not see that every time a person is raped, society as a whole lets down a valuable human asset in this world? Im engrossed in a deadline news story. Ive tuned out all others clicking their keyboards. I dont hear him coming up from behind me. I jump when I feel his hand on the back of my chair. He hesitates for a moment when I look at him. Its Nolan. Head sports writer. Just one of the faces that share the east end corner of the newsroom. Just one of those loud, obnoxious sportswriters that live and breathe sports. Ahwe sort of have a bet going. he says, as he glances back at the other sportswriters, We kind of betwell, on what kind of underwear youre wearing. Thong or one of those french cuts? I stare at him for a moment. I want to say, Seriously, fuck nut? Instead, I lean into him. Hes smiling. I smile back at him, cocking my head to one side. Well, Nolan, you see, sorry to burst your bubble, but I dont think anyone has a chance at winning this bet and you know why? I ask, whispering in his ear, Because Im not wearing any underwear. Of course, that isnt true, but Im not about to let him have the better of me. Im not going to allow him to intimidate me or treat me that way. The look on his face tells me that my response was the right one. I watch him as he sheepishly walks back to the sports department, not even daring to look at his fellow playmates. I turn around and stare at them for a moment, almost daring them to smirk or say something.  But, they dont. And time passes and they say time heals all wounds. But it doesnt. Women merely learn coping skills. They learn to accept the sleepless nights and to control the panic. They attempt to fall in love and trust. They attempt to figure out boundaries in a normal, healthy sexual relationship. And some drink it away or take drugs in a hapless attempt to dull their senses. And some, like my daughter, move forward, like a robot, having good days and bad days, highs and lows, but are never the same. We call it BR and AR. Before Rape and After Rape.Weve become a society of women trying to keep ourselves safe. A society of women who count on KarmaKarma coming around and biting our assailants in the ass, because its all weve got. How are the laws designed to protect us when only six percent of rapists ever spend a day in jail? Every two minutes someone in the U.S. is sexually assaulted. In the time it has taken you to read this article at least ten others have been assaulted. One in six women have had an attempted or completed rape imposed upon them. College women are four times more likely to have it happen to them. 17.7 million American women can tell you their story. But only 6 percent are willing. This is my daughters story and this is my story. Of the one in six women, we are two of them. In 1977 I was raped, beaten, and left for dead. But I lived because I believe we cant walk around merely existing in our skeletal remains. We have to fight back. We have to change things. We have talk about it. We have to protect ourselves and protect the future generation of women.We are worthy. We are human, flesh and bone. We are not to be discounted and tossed aside like old shoes. We matter. We are women. We are survivors.-http://www.rainn.org/get-help/national-sexual-assault-online-hotlineShare/Bookmarkfrom  Opinion10 Responsesleave one             Michelle permalink             June 1, 2010          OMG, its raw, in your face, and lets those who have been through it know that they shouldnt be ashamed to say it out loud.  It has a NAME. Yet youve also pointed out that even though theres a certain amount of awareness out there, we have a long way to go in supporting the victims of sexual violence.   I felt your anger, your pain, your frustration. Well DONE.            Phil Polizatto permalink             June 1, 2010          This story tore my guts out!  Every paragraph made me cringe with an empathy I did not want because it was too unbearable.  I have no words, nothing I can say, that can approach the reality of this awful experience.  So much easier to be bleeding from an artery for all to see and be concerned.  But when the artery bleeding is that of a young girls living nightmares and the justifiable anger and torment of her mother, people dont see, dont appreciate the visceral pain, the years of rehabilitation if there is such a thing as complete recovery.Thank you so much for writing this.  I could comment on what a wonderful writer you are, but I think in this case, it poured out of your heart and could be nothing but powerfully written as if you were channeling your daughters pain as well as your own.Peace to you and your daughter.  I hope eventually it does come.Phil            Mitchell Waldman permalink             June 1, 2010          This article is raw and to the point. It makes real to so many what the word rape is, how it affects women. You put it right out there with your heart and soul and everyone needs to read this so they can feel even a little tiny bit of what rape survivors and their families go through.  Gut-wrenching and powerful writing that every man and woman needs to not only read, but tell others to read  medical personnel who deal with rape survivors, men who need to understand what a blight on society this is, members of the legislatue and courtsthat this is not just a crime against women but against humanity and all of society. We are not animals. And men and women will never be equal until all understand how devastating this isand how strong the women who have had to deal with it are.  You have put the words out her that the reader cant help but feel cutting deep into their souls. Hopefully this will make us all take notice and action to make the terrifying reality that is rape a thing of the pastsomedaysomeday.            RJ Morris permalink             June 1, 2010          Rape is not something you can put a bandage on.  The author stepped forward knocking down years of barriers to bring forth these two stories.  These two women who share more than blood, they share a life altering experience.  This mother has found the courage to look past what society would see and/or do, this mother has risen above her pain and shame to make a difference.  She is there for her daughter.  With every tear, with every gulp, with every breathe they walk this road of courage together.  They make their way past the societal barriers to take a stand, to help others, to speak out.  Im sorry for any pain, ever caused to any woman or man through the physical violence of another.  We can only pray for justice.  Until that comes we can pray for the sustainability of this mother and her child.  God bless them.            Rose permalink             June 1, 2010          My God.  I dont know where to begin.  As a incest and sexual assault survivor as a young adult, EVERY word leaped off the page at me as all of my own memories came rushing back. I am sad. My compassion is BOUNDLESS for the women who are written about above. I have lived this experience and have had to live WITH it over the years. Ive also had to live with the ignorance in how our society views or treats people who have been in this position.  Most people think:  Well it happened but its time to get over it. They have NO idea what they are talking about.  What is the old adage?  Never judge someone until youve walked a mile in their shoes?  Or, in this case, dont give unsolicited advice unless you know what they hell youre talking about. I would like to believe that, as a culture, we are evolving more and more every day but, the truth is, until we change what is in our hearts for our fellow human being, and how we view their life experiences, most will remain in the dark. From the average person to the medical professionals who perform the rape kit,  we MUST enlighten ourselves to what they reality truly is: The physical scars may heal but the emotional scars will remain forever from the trauma.  We MUST have compassion and extend it to those who have been subjected to this violent form of control and humiliation by force. If we change what is in our hearts, collectively, we can change the world. Baby steps are OK. One step at a time. Lets start HERE. There isnt a choice but to move in this direction. Please: Will the rest of you who read this pledge with me for change?Linda Wolf permalink             June 2, 2010          WOW!  I have so many emotions churning inside of me right now.  Your article stirred up a lot of feelings I had forgotten.   A person VERY close to me was raped about 20 years ago.   I truly understand your feelings of helplessness, rage and anger because I felt the same.  It took my friend at least a few months until she was able to talk about it.  I learned, through her help, that shes a survivor!   Because of my friend, the trial,  the victim/witness counsel, the other survivors and my research, I found most rapes have a common thread.  Once  the survivor empowers or takes back power she began to heal.If I learned  that, what the hell is wrong with the professionals in the medical field?  Ms. Diana, you said it best  Weve become a society of women trying to keep ourselves safehow are the laws designed to protect us when only six percent of rapists ever spend a day in jail?    I hope your article reaches and teaches our society.   I believe everyone should learn more, talk more AND demand a change.  I think thats called empowering!  Thank you.Sallie Elkordy permalink             June 3, 2010          RAPE KITS cost $500 dollars and will reveal the DNA of the offender.  This is a superb investment because it is my considered opinion that very few men rape and that it is those few (that are responsible for the majority of rapes committed) who can be quickly discerned by developing these rape kits for each of the assailants.  I would go as far as to say you will be getting the same results several times for numerous assaults.  Its called serial rape for a reason.  The info is sitting on shelves, as I understand waiting to be sponsored, while repeat offenders are getting away with RAPE.I believe that to catch a few, is to catch the majority, because most men are not rapists.            Ars Moriendi permalink             June 4, 2010          I want to touch her, but I am afraid. I can only touch her now with her permission. Rape takes away permission.All of the crisis counseling and years of mental heath treatment in the world could never have given me what that one statement says. I am going to go cry real, bitter tears now and then I am going to come back, read this again and remember WHY we fight. TY for renewing my own strength.            Lev Ferrer permalink             October 1, 2010          I feel both of your pain, I really dothis story hits me where it hurts!  I am an advocate of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response in the military.  And you are right!  Assault such as rape is a sore topic that no one wants to talk about.  I just recently created an FB account and FB page to promote sexual assault awareness and I am having the hardest time promoting it.  No one even click the Like button or click open all those links that Im trying to promote and yet, people are so quick to response to stupid posting such as I just got my nail done today!  But I am taking it one person at a timeif I can reach out to one a month, I know that at least I am making a difference.  Your story really touch my heart and should continue to be told            Maria permalink             November 2, 2010          Dear Diana,Sitting here gulping , in tears.Thank you for being so brave ,as to shed light on a topic we all need to be more aware of. We all need to learn of, before its too late.  This kind of violence has got to stop! I wish you and your daughter well. Health I wish your daughter joy again  nd peace with her body once again and self love for this was not her fault nor was it yours .Only by continually putting the blame where it belongs will there be justice I know  as you say , it stays with the body, with the mind , heart and soul, yes , but it does , have less power,  as  your daughter and you continue  to by gain power telling and telling and  re-telling everyone who will listen. bringing some healing always. RAINN is the very best, we need more advocates.We need professionals  to really understand the long lasting consequences  if help is not given!
