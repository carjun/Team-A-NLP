In fact, I seriously doubt if you could tell me how Japan in the 1990s, or the S&L crisis, or the housing bubble, have anything at all to do with the price of gold today.As for "concrete" reasons for valuing of stocks, that is absolutely laughable. The prices of stocks are even more irrational than the price of gold, as you yourself alluded to with the Tech stock bubble. With stocks, you have to factor in a whole set of subjective information that may or may not be accurate, and pump-and-dumpers (a.k.a. "market makers") can get suckers, er, investors interested in an otherwise worthless company, and get the price up to a point where insiders can bail out and leave outsiders holding the bag.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topwesterebus      (1000+ posts)      Sat Dec-25-10 07:53 PMResponse to Reply #92102.What's the p/e on net flicks these days?

It varies. The fact is that gold is only worth what someone else wants to give you for it. Sure there are runs sometimes on precious metals but would you know when to sell? It's not like you can pick up a piece of gold and get what you paid for it all the time. It's just as risky as the stock market.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopArt_from_Ark      (1000+ posts)Thu Oct-07-10 11:07 PMResponse to Reply #522.Gold jewelry is not an investment item in the USIt is in some parts of the world, but not the US. Tangible gold investment items in the US are mainly limited to coins and bars. In most cases, it is better to have US-minted coins since there is a bigger domestic market for those. Notable exceptions include Canadian, Australian and Chinese gold bullion coins (although I personally would stay away from the Chinese stuff), British sovereigns, and Mexican gold coins. Bars should be from one of the well-known suppliers, such as Johnson-Matthey, Englehard or Credit Suisse.If you stick with bullion, with the weight and fineness stamped on the coin/bar, then there is a market that will buy and sell that gold at relatively fixed prices that are based on the market price. I'm not talking about fly-by-nighters like SellMeYurGold.com or IBuyYurGoldCheap.com, I mean dealers like those who advertise in coin publications like Coin World and Numismatic News.If you get real gold from a legitimate dealer, there is no way that gold investment is "just as risky as the stock market". With stocks, you have absolutely nothing that is tangible, and many big name stocks have lost a huge amount, sometimes 90% or even 100%, of their value. Gold will NEVER do that. But gold investment is not for everybody. You have to do your homework first.

First of all, the US price was kept artificially low because of the gold restrictions that were in place at the time. A lot of people thought that owning gold of any kind (except jewelry) was illegal, so that also helped to depress the market. Ownership of US gold coins was not illegal, though, and it was also legal to hold foreign coins dated 1960 or earlier. It was not legal to hold (that is, buy and sell) bullion, though, and the ownership of foreign coins dated 1961 or later was regulated. For example, if I had wanted (or been able to afford) the $20 gold coin that Canada struck in 1967 to commemorate 100 years of confederation, I would not have been able to order it directly from the Canadian mint due to US restrictions. Only certain dealers with a special import license could order new foreign coins directly from foreign suppliers (but I'm not sure if that provision was in place in 1967).But prices started to rise around 1969 or so when it became clear that owning US gold coins was perfectly legal (the legality of holding US gold coins had been affirmed by the Coinage Act of 1965, but the word was apparently slow to spread). The gold market started to perk up, and prices for both US and foreign gold coins began to rise. For example, common British gold sovereigns (about the size of a nickel and containing about 7.2 grams of gold) quickly rose from about $12 to $20 or so. Gold prices got a bigger boost in 1971 when Nixon removed the last vestiges of the Gold Standard, as well as the last vestiges of precious metals in US coinage, and inflation started to kick in. People became increasingly interested in buying gold (and silver) as hedges against inflation.Inflation continued to rise, and in 1973 was exacerbated by the first Oil Shock. The price of gold increased more, and while the official US price had been raised to a little more than $42/ounce, the world market was higher, and the prices for US and foreign coins reflected the world market. British sovereigns which had been selling for $12 in 1967 were now selling for $30 or more.Then, on December 31, 1974, President Ford signed a law that removed the last restrictions on gold ownership for Americans and, in conjunction with inflation, gold prices also kept rising (albeit with various fluctuations, of course). By that time, British sovereigns were selling for $50 or more. The inflationary trend continued through the rest of the '70s, and there was great demand for gold and silver as inflation hedges. Prices were still comparatively low compared with today, with, for example, common US $20 gold pieces selling for around $300 in 1978, when I bought my first one. But the next year, prices started to take off, with the price of $20 gold pieces doubling and silver going from about $5 per ounce to well over $20 per ounce in just a few months, due to inflation, another oil shock, market manipulation by the Hunt Brothers and others, and a general feeling of economic unease. That time was a classic bubble, since prices were rising too fast. I sold most of my stuff at that time, to pay for various personal expenses. I was quite happy to receive 13 times face value for US silver coins that I had bought a year before for 4 times face value.But the dam bust in January 1980. Silver reached an official high of $50/ounce (although almost no one was buying at that level) and gold blipped at $850 (once again, no one was buying at that level). When it became known that the Hunt Brothers had been trying to corner the silver market, silver prices collapsed. Gold prices went down $100 almost immediately, and then started on a slow descent in the 1980s when inflation eased and interest was turned to other investment options such as stocks and bank CDs, which had become quite attractive. Gold prices during this period were greatly affected by market manipulation by European central banks, which were quietly buying when prices were low, then dumping when prices were high. This situation lasted until the euro was officially adopted in 2002, and the EU pledged to set annual limits to gold sales. It is no coincidence that there was renewed interest in gold starting around this time.Today, we are in a situation where there is supposedly no inflation but prices on a lot of basic goods and services are rising nonetheless. We also have a situation where the US government is in debt for trillions of dollars, and no one knows exactly how much. Also, no one seems to have any idea about how much fiat money there is in circulation (including both coins/notes and electronic "money"), although it is generally assumed to be in the trillions.What's more, other investments such as bank CDs are probably the least attractive they have ever been, and there is much doubt and suspicion about the stock market, which seems to be stacked against the average investor, especially in the wake of the Lehman Brothers crisis and the derivatives scandals. And there are also many new players in the gold market, including China and India. China, for example, only recently lifted the restrictions on private gold ownership, and gold has consequently become a popular item with both the Chinese government and the Chinese nouveau riche. Moreover, gold and other precious metals are about the only investment vehicle (besides land) that cannot be artificially grown or produced. Gold can also be easily fashioned into small coins and bars that nonetheless represent high value, it does not corrode or break down, and the world market has a relatively good idea of how much gold is available, and how much new gold is entering the market each year. Moreover, gold has played a role as a monetary medium for millennia. Therefore, I am not surprised at all that the price has risen so much. Nonetheless, I would not buy gold bullion at these levels. My gold purchases, what few there are these days, are limited to coins that have both a bullion and a numismatic appeal.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTaitertots      (1000+ posts)Sat Dec-25-10 02:22 PMResponse to Reply #9495.You are trying to answer the wrong questionA better way to phrase it might be "why does gold have value"?  You are getting close with "it does not corrode or break down, and the world market has a relatively good idea of how much gold is available, and how much new gold is entering the market each year".  This is one of the remaining qualities of gold that causes it to have intrinsic value.  The other qualities are usefulness in electronics, coin collection, and jewelry.  The things you listed are changes to underlying factors.  Every change you listed is nothing more than animal spirits.  There have been no changes that effect market fundamentals that make gold intrinsically more valuable.You are trying to explain why gold has it's current price, not why gold is valuable in the first place.  If everyone wanted 1980's McDonald's happy meal toys the price would go up, but it wouldn't increase the intrinsic value of 1980's McDonald's toys, it would be an unsustainable bubble.  Gold is a fad, like beanie babies, just don't get caught holding it when the bubble bursts.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopArt_from_Ark      (1000+ posts)Sat Dec-25-10 02:46 PMResponse to Reply #9596.A fad like beanie babies?

The US, for example, has been issuing gold bullion coins since 1986 (or 1982 if you count the American Arts series of medallic coins). Many other countries have produced gold bullion coins within the last 40 years, including Turkey, Mexico, the UK, Australia, Austria, South Africa and China. Dozens of other countries have issued gold commemorative coins.Your argument loses all credibility when you compare the gold price with beanie babies or McDonald's toys, and shows just how little you know about metals and their role as a monetary medium.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTaitertots      (1000+ posts)Sat Dec-25-10 03:07 PMResponse to Reply #9697.It was an absolute failure as a monetary mediumWhich is why every advanced economy ran away as fast as they could after how much it worsened the Great Depression.

So we have two reasons why gold should have value.Durable:McDonald's toys are plastic, they will outlive us all without significant degradation.Rare: There are a limited number of old McDonald's toys.  They are more rare than gold, more gold can be mined, you can't go back in time.The only difference is that institutional investors benefit from causing a bubble in Gold because they have gold already.It is exactly like beanie babies.

There is a reason that a stock has value beyond just expected price increases.  Of course they have risk and can be over priced.  That doesn't mean that the reason they are valuable is any less valid.  The principal reason that gold has value is that people expect the price to go up.  People expect the prices of stocks to go up because the companies are profitable or may become profitable.  Comparing gold to all other commodities demonstrates just how irrational the gold market is.  All other commodities are priced based on the concept they will be sold for production.

The main reason is that wages are flat. There is excess manufacturing capacity and housing prices are falling. However, if someone is living on a fixed income, has been renting an apartment, buys food and drives a car, they are absolutely feeling the effects of inflation. In a few years, when housing turns around and the lower cost excess capacity is used up, it's gonna be painful. By that time, the only thing keeping prices down will be wages.

This is not inflation, this is the result of failed Republican policies that they are claiming as inflation.  It isn't going to be painful when we recover.

By the time the month is up, inflation has vastly reduced the buying power of the paper money, but the buying power of gold theoretically remains relatively constant. And paper money can become worth so little that it ends up being demonetized. This has actually happened in numerous countries around the world, including Germany, Serbia, Hungary, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and Zimbabwe, to name a few.Can the dollar become demonetized? Maybe. Virtually every country has demonetized/replaced its currency since the US Dollar made its official debut in 1794. And the US has demonetized various coins and paper notes at one time or another. Currently, though, all US-issued coins and currency are officially legal tender in the US. So it seems unlikely that a total demonetization would occur, but these are strange times.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWarpy      (1000+ posts)      Sat Dec-25-10 10:56 PMResponse to Reply #7103.Cheap diners used to trade meals for gold jewelry back in the 30sat a fraction of a cent on the dollar the stuff was worth.

The only time gold "lost" value in the United States before 1933 was the result of the California Gold Rush, when it briefly became worth less than 16 times the same weight/fineness of silver. Nonetheless, from 1834 to 1933, the price of gold in the US remained at $20.67 per troy ounce. And in 1934, the official US gold price was raised to $35 (to artificially create inflation), where it remained until the early 1970s. On December 31, 1974, the gold market was completely liberalized in the US, and gold went up to a more natural level. And your statement that jewelry is harder to unload than bullion is unsupportable for a number of reasons:First, most jewelry sold in the US is at best 75% gold (18K). 14K gold is less than 60% pure, and 10K gold is only 41% pure. The lower the fineness, the lower the price, percentagewise, you can get for it. Also, much if not most of the price you pay for jewelry is for workmanship, not the actual gold content, so if you have to unload jewelry, you probably won't get anywhere near what you paid for it, even if the market remains relatively constant.In contrast, US gold coins are at least 90% pure gold, and some recent bullion coins are 99.99% pure. The higher the purity, the more desirable the gold is from an investment perspective. It is obvious you don't have much experience in this field.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topxchrom      (1000+ posts)      Tue Oct-05-10 08:34 PMResponse to Original message8.Cause it's 'bubbled' right now?

There's a backyard "wild game processing" business about 2 miles from me.Heh! I'll have 2 gardens. One is up by the house and road, where everybody can see it, for warm weather veggies. The new, big(50x70 or so) cool weather veggie one is hidden behind the house at the bottom of a steep incline. The only person who knows it will exist is the guy who rototilled for me a few weeks ago.  Oh, and wintertime trick for root veggies: bury them under a couple feet deep of straw and supposedly you can dig them out midwinter and they'll be fine.

With jewelry, you're mostly paying for the workmanship. With bullion, you're mostly paying for the actual metal itself (with some mark-up). Standard bullion gold coins with a marked weight and fineness generally trade at buy and sell prices that are closely tied to the market price of gold, if you deal with a legitimate dealer.And jewelers always have massive sales going on. That is because the price of the jewelry is always several times higher than the value of the precious metal it contains (if it even contains precious metal). For example, a 14K gold ring with a small stone might be priced at $150, but if the metal weighs 1.5 grams, that means it contains less than 1 gram of actual gold, which is worth only around $44 even at today's  prices. So there is some leeway in finding a happy medium between list price and the price the jeweler actually has to pay for the piece.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnorthernlights      (1000+ posts)Fri Oct-08-10 09:43 AMResponse to Reply #2627.so you can eat bullion?Or you can sell bullion for...what?

I believe you're up in Alaska, where a lot of people live off the land, and the population density is only about 2 people per square mile. Down in the lower 48, the population density is 50 times that, and that includes the desert and mountain areas as well. It would be a lot more difficult to live off the land in the lower 48. Considering that Alaska has been a gold-producing territory/state since nearly the time it was purchased in 1867, and it is currently the 2nd-largest gold-producing state in the nation (with much of that coming from small-time operations), I seriously doubt that all of your neighbors "won't have use for gold in any form".

(Diamonds come to mind)Gold and silver (Au/Ag) exist in forms used specifically as currencies. They have known size and weights too ease their use as a currency. Au/Ag are recognized all around the world, and are easily  exchanged for goods or local currency. There is nothing else comparable that is portable, easy to value, and an indefinite shelf-life.You may not be able to eat it, but you can go anywhere in the world and within 2 transactions have a full plate of groceries sitting in front of you.In 1960 a US quarter (90% silver) bought a gallon of gasoline. 50 years later that same quarter will buy more than a gallon of fuel. In all the years in between that quarter had approximately the same buying power with relation to petroleum products. If you have a silver quarter you will be able to exchange it for go juice for the rototiller. If you have more that just one you'll be able to replace the shovel after it breaksAu/Ag trade within a very small range when used as currency. This has been going on for longer than recorded time.

If you are deep enough in the woods, you might not want to spend your money for something you don't need. You would be better off buying  seeds, chickens, solar panels, and ammo. Co-oping with neighbors to provide common needs. Security and labor, skills and mutual support.  If you're in the ex burbs, gardens and guns are not a bad idea. Getting your neighbors on board is not a bad idea either. If you have well water that's a plus. Do you have a pump if the electricity goes down? Got a barn with a horse? Well, horse's love chickens. Geese too. Ever try to sneak up on a goose? Just have to be careful with chicken eating dogs thought. Fencing in the garden is not a wish for, it's a to do. After, you take care of the to do's, a little gold wouldn't hurt. If you live in the burbs ask your self, if things go to hell are you going to stay or go? Got family  that live deep enough in the woods? Do they like you? Would they put up with you?  Then your first concern is how to get from where you are to where they are. If you can do it early enough, it may not be a problem. Do it to late, the kids are in school and they are only rioting in LA and the National Guard is just been mobilized in your state, don't expect discount airfares and forget about trains. Who will you have to bribe and with what?  If you stay, and your community is not very tight knit, you may be on your own. Water, food, guns, ammo, medicine and cash in some form. Some gold and silver. Trade-ables in the form of booze, sanitary products, batteries, sleeping bags, crank lanterns, water filters, coffee, contact lens solution, sterno, lolly pops, gum, etc. etc. Forget about help from the authorities. Forget about highways.  Forget about ATM's. If you missed the opportunity to get out, prepare to stay and possibly fight. Hopefully every body will be scared enough to stay home till things calm down. That could take a few days or a few weeks. Can you make it for three weeks on your own. The first priority is safety. Distance from trouble works best. Second on the list, water and food. Simple as rice and beans, pasta and sauce, power bars and protein shakes and powdered milk, can soup counts as water. And no, what's in the freezer will last three days when the power goes out,the good news is you pig out on that first. Third, guns and ammo. Revolvers do not jam. Point and click. Shotguns change hearts and minds. Practice with what you own. Than you can think about shiny stuff. If you live in a city. Get to know a cop, a fireman, an EMT or better yet their spouse, sister, or mother. If they pack up at 5 am to go visit family out of town, you are out of there too! Even if it's just to the burbs. Distance from trouble works best. If you are not safe, it doesn't matter what you own.

Gold is valued in currency. At one time there was a gold standard, money was valued in gold or silver. It fixed the rate of exchange. One ounce was equal to X number of dollars.  Empires have come and gone, one thing found in most of them was gold or silver in flat bars, chains and coins used as currency. Today, paper currency is the norm. Fading fast as transactions are more data entry than cash in hand.  If you were willing to purchase something with gold, say very high end electronic equipment, there are some folks who could accommodate you. No bank records. No visa cards accepted. No sales tax. No import stamp. No end user certificate. No last names.  That's what I've heard. Many years ago. I don't recall where or who said it.  The problem with gold or silver is weight. When gold was $500 an oz, you needed 10 oz to get to $5000, 20 oz to get to $10,000. 20 oz of hundred dollar bills is considerably more money. If you get into Zimbabwe dollars, hyper inflation, 200 oz of ZBD's is still pretty much worthless. There are not that many people who hold gold or silver compared to the number of American Express card holder's. You may have one or several credit cards. American Express can pull your credit line at any time they are required to. As can Visa or Master card. They can't pull that gold coin out of your pocket. Your bank account can be frozen. Your debit card voided.  That has no affect on the coffee can bank under the rabbit hutch.

During FY 2009 the BEP delivered 6.2 billion notes at an average cost of 7.5 cents per note. 95% of the notes printed each year are used to replace notes already in, or taken out of circulation.

I get a special kick out of posts that claim that "gold is in a bubble" because it's being advertised on Fox, or Glenn Beck, or some other right-wing media outlet. Any bull market will naturally attract people who see it as an opportunity to fleece some lambs. But you have to look at the big picture. The gold market isn't just a US market-- it's a world market, with lots of big players outside the United States. What they do has a much bigger impact on the gold price than the relatively small purchases made by Fox and Glenn Beck viewers.What I am particularly concerned about is not the actions of small-time purchasers, but the actions of the big-time purchasers. It used to be that European central banks wielded a big influence over the price of gold buy dumping their holdings when prices were high, and discretely buying back after they had depressed prices low enough. That practice basically ended with the introduction of the euro, and now there are new, nouveau-riche players who weren't involved in the first series of gold run-ups. I am especially interested in what the Chinese have up their sleeve.

The only time to buy gold is in a major dip because the only thing raising gold prices is psychological - fear.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPo_d Mainiac      (1000+ posts)Fri Oct-15-10 02:41 PMResponse to Reply #5859.Wow40% gains and you won't even share any of your secrets.The worst time to try to buy a PM is during a crisis, but that's when you really need itPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcbdo2007      (1000+ posts)Fri Oct-15-10 05:17 PMResponse to Reply #5960.No secrets - just research.That's the great thing about stocks is that all the information is right there for you to find. I know most of DU is terrified of the stock market because they don't get it but just reading a few books will change your life and your investment strategy.People invest in metals because they're easy to understand because for some reason everyone thinks they know gold and are a gold expert and it's shiny. People are scared of stocks because they have to sit for a couple of hours a week and look at some numbers and some graphs and they'd rather watch the football game.Of the 8,800 stocks that appear on Google's stock screener, here is a link to the 1,045 of them that have gained 40% in the past 52 weeks:http://www.google.com/finance/stockscreener#c0=Price52W...

Ho-kay.Perhaps you would like to share the names of the stocks that have provided you with such treasure, and will continue to provide you with 40% returns well into the future. But I won't be holding my breath on that. It sounds a lot like you're talking out of your rear end to me.And a year and a half ago, gold was trading at $880. Today, it's nearly $500 higher. Quite a respectable return, I would say.

You can't see the value in gold, it is all hypothetical and is usually based on a collapse of our entire financial system, which if that happens the price of gold will plummet just like everything else.I've made well over 40% in the past year and a half. Bought Sirius radio SIRI at $0.10 a share and it's now at $1.38. That one was fun too because a few months ago it kept bouncing between $0.90 and $1.10 so you could just keep buying and selling and buying and selling, raking in the dough. That's got no sign of slowing down over the next few years.How about Netflix? NFLX. I bought in January this year because I had 5 frieds tell me in one week that they signed up for Netflix. I did the free trial and started looking into it. Bought at $54 and it's gone up almost 200% since then.Sure, I haven't made money on every stock but it isn't because the stocks have gone down, only because I sold on a dip out of fear. Stocks go down because people sell due to fear. Gold goes up because people buy due to fear. Making your investment decisions based on fear will always cause you to lose money. It took me a long time to figure that out, but it's true. Anyone actually making money in stocks can tell you that's the truth.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopArt_from_Ark      (1000+ posts)Sat Oct-16-10 11:11 AMResponse to Reply #6667.You don't seem to know the first thing about metals. Not the first thing.Both Po_D Maniac and I have been involved with coins since at least the '60s.  I am impressed with Po_D's knowledge  of coins because it is obvious that he has been involved with and studied about them for a long time. And when you are seriously involved with coins as long as we have been, you gain a knowledge of metals and how they have been involved in the monetary system.I bought my first gold coin in 1968 when gold was $35 per ounce. Since that time, gold has risen in price by a factor of nearly 40. Are you going to tell me that that price rise is completely due to fear? Since civilization began, gold has served as a monetary medium longer than anything else. It is only recently that unbacked paper money has become the worldwide norm. But where you have unbacked paper, you have inflation. Gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation. Countries can issue all the paper money they want, but every time they issue new unbacked paper, they dilute the value of the existing supply. Sometimes they get into trouble and print so much paper that it becomes nearly, or even completely, worthless. Yet gold in such countries has retained its purchasing power.For the past several years, we have been seeing an unprecedented expansion of the paper money supply, and the US dollar is about the weakest it has ever been in the post-war era. Those of us old enough to to have been interested in monetary matters since the Vietnam era have witnessed a steady erosion of the buying power of Uncle Sam's paper. Yet, as Po_D has pointed out, silver has maintained its purchasing power during that time. And gold has actually increased its purchasing power.As for your Google stocks, I checked out some of them and found that there are many lightly traded stocks that are near their historic highs. In other words, prime targets for pumping and dumping. Been there, done that, got burned. And if you want to talk about bubbles, you should take a look at that stock you were promoting, NFLX. The P/E ratio is more than 63! And all it is is a company that rents out videos. Sorry, but I think I'll pass on that one.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPo_d Mainiac      (1000+ posts)Fri Oct-15-10 07:42 PMResponse to Reply #6062.Ah I get it ...spam alert.....Spam alertPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topwesterebus      (1000+ posts)      Fri Oct-15-10 10:45 PMResponse to Reply #6263.Spam.

I use a refiner in the city who has an office upstairs; no walk-ins allowed. I weigh my pieces on my jewelers' scale in pennyweights before I see him and do the fine gold calculations myself, so that we were within .01 dwt of each other's weight (they weigh it in front of me).   When gold was less volatile, I would get about 96% but now it's 88% (he had to recover some stones for me plus he gets a fee for small batches).I upgraded my camera to earn some money taking portraits, got a new tripod, am mostly investing in new equipment for my business.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topgolfguru      (1000+ posts)Tue Oct-19-10 12:51 AMResponse to Original message70.Buy low and sell high is the way to make moneyRight now it is buy and sell low!Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopfrankieT      (364 posts)Wed Dec-15-10 10:57 AMResponse to Original message71.GOLD IS A BARBARIC RELICIf we had to switch back to gold standard, that would be terribly deflationist.

I have had people berate me for my choices but I have done well and have managed to protect a large chunk of my nest egg. I have tangible gold, silver, stocks (in indexed funds and overseas) , and the kind of commodities that come in cans. I also have a defined pension plan.I have people that I know that will help in a pinch (and it works both ways). I have a skill that has value (Nursing with an informal study of herbs) both now and in the event of a collapse. I have dabbled in gardening and storage for years. I fish and hunt and can clean and dress what I catch. We have saved up to buy a house now while the price is down (and I advised Mom to sell when someone offered her top dollar in 2007). We bought gold and silver while the price was low. I sold off the bulk of stocks in 2006-07 at enough of a profit to make up for most of my losses in the dot com bust. Gold and silver are not the only investment. I don't buy it for profit, but I have made profit from it. I look it as a means to preserve wealth. I sleep better at night knowing that I have some gold and silver in the basket.Go with your knowledge and your gut.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toperidani      (1000+ posts)      Tue Dec-21-10 03:43 AMResponse to Reply #7376.Presumably that means you actually have your hands on the gold and silver?What does it mean to have a piece of paper that says you own gold or silver?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopArt_from_Ark      (1000+ posts)Thu Dec-23-10 10:51 PMResponse to Reply #7678.Having a piece of paper saying you own gold or silver doesn't mean shitThe only way to own gold or silver is to have physical possession.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toperidani      (1000+ posts)      Sat Dec-25-10 04:55 AMResponse to Reply #7890.I agree.
