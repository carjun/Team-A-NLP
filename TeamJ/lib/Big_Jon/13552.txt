"Liberal" and "Left" became negative terms because our leaders let the attacks on them go unchallenged.  Voters turned against us because we looked like we were ashamed of our core values.THIS HAS TO STOP!We must stand up and say "Hell yes, we're liberal.  Sometimes we're even radical. AND WE'RE RIGHT TO BE, DAMMIT!"If it wasn't for liberals and leftists, millions would have starved in this country in the Thirties.If it wasn't for liberals and leftists, Hitler and Mussolini would have been allowed to take over the world.If it wasn't for liberals and leftists, we'd have seen our troops dying in Vietnam for years and years longer.  Maybe they'd STILL be dying there.If it wasn't for liberals and leftists, segregation would have lived on forever.If it wasn't for liberals and leftists, there'd be no laws at all protecting the environment from destruction.If it wasn't for liberals and leftists, free speech would only be a theoretical right, reserved in practice solely for rich white men(In practice, the ACLU won the right of freedom of expression for all.)If it wasn't for liberals and leftists, the arts would have died out in this country for lack of funding.If it wasn't for liberals and leftists, this wouldn't be a civilized country at all.This is a proud heritage, and we as Democrats must never let it be besmirched and smeared and allowed to die from neglect.Long live DU for defending the most American tradition of all-the liberal and radical tradition, the tradition that gives hope that someday, finally, this country may become a democracy.No surrender!  No compromise!  No quarter given!Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this thread"I'm a liberal and that's the most hateful, unchristian thing I've everWarpyJun-20-06 08:10 PM#1JesuscadeyrnApr-08-10 04:57 PM#38College Educated Veteran and Proud Liberal HereBOSSHOGJun-20-06 08:11 PM#2lol...stepnw1fJun-20-06 08:12 PM#3Back at ya teammate!!BOSSHOGJun-20-06 08:20 PM#4Well said gentlemen!acmejackJun-20-06 08:44 PM#5They called Andrew Jackson a jackassIronLionZionJun-21-06 02:08 PM#6You are so right!carolinabeachbumJul-21-06 01:14 AM#7It's not just "they"wickedcityJan-15-07 01:25 PM#8Completely agreeTeenagerNov-28-07 11:25 PM#9DittoDeanDem10Dec-18-07 05:42 PM#10Make that "PROUD LIBERAL" will ya...4dscDec-24-07 09:33 AM#11Yes, and the only thing worse than tax and spend isWouldBe SpeechwriterMar-24-08 10:53 AM#12It is conservatives who should be ashamedPapiApr-09-08 09:58 PM#13It is Conservatives who should be ashamed.Ezzard Mack CharlesJul-06-08 09:57 PM#18Deleted messageName removedMay-30-08 11:00 PM#14major politicians run from the lablecompanionnowJun-04-08 12:42 AM#15deadpanjmungerJun-05-08 01:05 AM#16take it backtuumiJun-09-08 03:36 PM#17Remember the Santos/Vinick debate from the WEST WING?Karl_Bonner_1982Aug-10-08 06:49 AM#19Well...Rebelscum954Aug-15-08 06:49 PM#20Does DU always allow lies in its forums?bhbwlOct-23-08 01:19 AM#23LIBERALS HAVE THE GREAT RECORDclarence swinneyAug-16-08 12:45 PM#21I don't mind being called a Liberal, i'm proud of it.HellatazSep-22-08 04:16 PM#22'Conservatives' need some of that 'liberal' flowRabiaOct-28-08 07:09 PM#24I think it became a dirty word in 1988 when George Sr. used it against DukakisspookytoothOct-31-08 11:44 AM#25tell hannity thatihatehannityJan-26-09 06:06 PM#26Liberal yes, "progressive" noBlue Dog DominionJan-26-09 06:30 PM#27LIBERAL LIST OF GREATNESSclarence swinneyApr-20-09 01:13 PM#28Deleted messageName removedJun-05-09 02:03 PM#29I would, if it weren't a lie.Political HereticJun-21-09 11:55 PM#30Deleted messageName removedJun-22-09 08:02 PM#31LIBERALS CREATED SUCCESS FOR MIDDLE CLASSclarence swinneyJun-26-09 07:13 PM#32Yeplk9550Jul-14-09 01:20 AM#33Clarence, we get it that you like the guy, but "LORD William Jefferson Clinton"?Ken BurchApr-26-10 01:33 PM#39Hell Yes!gwashington2650Jul-23-09 03:34 AM#34Hell yeah!

Reagan's budget guy Dick Darman later wrote a book about how the "starve the gov" strategy didn't and couldn't work ("Triumph of Politics").  The Repubs still use "tax and spend" to get elected.  But the republicans tax us all by spending on war and by giving huge bailouts to the economy after the CEO's of major corporations take the money and run.  In the 80s in was Neil Bush's Savings and Loan scandal.  Now it's the Sub-Prime Mortgage crisis.  We are all paying for these bailouts and that's a tax.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPapi      (16 posts)Wed Apr-09-08 09:58 PMResponse to Original message13.It is conservatives who should be ashamedI honestly would not come out of my house if the world knew I were a conservatives.

Right now the Republicans HAVE the upper hand  more than enough no votes in the Senate to keep tax cuts for the wealthy in ANY compromise. If Democratic candidates campaigned on tax cuts for the wealthy during the 2010 Campaign as the President suggested, perhaps  90% rather than 40% of eligible voters would have voted in the midterms and the Democrats would have the upper hand regarding the tax cut controversy, but thats past history. Because of the midterm results, Republicans will be in charge of the House and the 60 vote filibuster-proof Senate on the side of Democrats will be out the door come January 1st.  At least now a compromise will benefit the middle class, the poor, and the unemployed and small businesses with the extension of unemployment benefits, tax cuts for the middle class, payroll tax cuts, and incentives for small businesses to create jobs. Its not the best of both worlds, but its better than nothing at all.  After January 1st when the Republicans are in charge of the House, you can be guaranteed that those benefits will be gone with the wind. WE criticized the President and Democrats when we didnt get the public option but WE didnt fight for it. We let the Tea Party and health insurance industry do ALL of the squawking and we didnt start raising Cain until after the fact. WE must deliver the upper hand. WE must speak out in ONE voice.  WE must shame the Republicans into ending those tax cuts THROUGHOUT the next two years.  WE must hold local rallies. WE must fight for our rights in local AND national newspapers, internet, radio and media outlets. WE must email, fax and call Republican Congressional offices EVERY DAY.  We must let Tea Party-backed Republicans know that if they continue to fight for the wealthy and ignore the middle class, the poor and the unemployed, WE WILL vote them out in 2012 and WE must mean  it!
