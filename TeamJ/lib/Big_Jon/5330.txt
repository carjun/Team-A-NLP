Before 2004, it was illegal to manufacture or sell magazines that held more than 10 rounds. Loughner's held 31 rounds. Reports are that he fired 15 to 20 rounds. If the ban was still in place he would have had to reload which would have given time for him to be stopped.So, the gun laws are so weak that someone who had been deemed unworthy for the military, kicked out of college and requires mental testing in order to return, and has a drug conviction can walk in and buy a semi-automatic weapon with a magazine that carries 31 rounds of ammunition.There is a dead 9-year-old little girl who might be alive today had that ban been kept in place.Refresh|+5 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadits not guns that kill people, its gun owners  ntmsongsJan-09-11 08:38 PM#1No, it's the parents who gave birth to the gun owners.wtmusicJan-09-11 08:40 PM#4I would like to see someone kill more than one person with a knife...texsheltersJan-09-11 08:51 PM#258 people stabbedtammywammyJan-09-11 08:54 PM#35Actually, multiple people are routinely killed with knives.TheWraithJan-09-11 08:54 PM#377 are dead, 10 are injured in stabbing spreeX_DiggerJan-09-11 08:54 PM#39The Second Amendment is very clear that 10 rounds aren't enough ntwtmusicJan-09-11 08:39 PM#2I bought a half dozen >10 rnd magazines durring the "scary black rifle" ban.StatisticalJan-09-11 08:39 PM#3This guy wouldn't have had access to one, would he?wtmusicJan-09-11 08:42 PM#5Why wouldn't he have?

Have you ever handled one?Any firearm can jam.  Anyone.  I have seen a Glock jam on the range multiple times.  The most common reason is limp wristing which results in incomplete recoil cycle.  However dud or poor loaded ammo can do the same thing.   Also if the mag spring broke/failed then the weapon would most certainly jam and the jam would be unavoidable until the magazine was replaced.A Glock is a high-quality killing machine, used by policemen around the world.

The essential design hasnt really changed since it started to become popular over 100 years ago.  the Glock 19 is designed for reliability and ease of use- two things that are essential for a self-defense weapon.Its silly to try to draw a distinction between guns that are "killing machines" and those used for self defense and sporting- because there is no distinction- all guns are capable of being used to kill people.  We say we want to ban "sniper rifles" but hunting rifles are okay.  But a hunting rifle that can take a deer down at long range can also take a human down at long range with ease.  We say that people shouldnt own police weapons but guns for self defense are okay without realizing that these are the same guns- that police side-arms are chosen with the principle in mind that these are self defense weapons.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 09:14 PMResponse to Reply #4870.Deleted messageMessage removed by moderator.

On September 29, 2010, college police discovered a Loughner-filmed YouTube video in which he claimed that the college was illegal according to the United States Constitution. The college told Loughner that if he wanted to come back to school, he needed to resolve his Code of Conduct violations and obtain a mental health clearance indicating, in the opinion of a mental health professional, that his presence did not constitute a danger to himself or others. Instead he withdrew from Pima.While PCC may have required him to get a mental health clearance to return, it wasn't mandatory...once again does not disqualify a person from purchasing a gun.According to court records, Loughner had two previous offenses, one of which was for drug possession. In October 2007, Loughner was cited in Pima County for possession of drug paraphernalia, which was dismissed after he completed a diversion program, according to online records. A year later he was charged with an unknown "local charge" in Marana near Tucson. That charge was also dismissed following the completion of a diversion program in March 2009, the Daily Star reported.A citation is not the same as a conviction, and it was dismissed after he completed a diversion program. The other charge was also dismissed, once again after he completed a diversion program. Once charges are dismissed. it's as if nothing happened.
