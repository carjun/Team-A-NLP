See all 18 photosFinally a Wine Glass that Makes Sense! There is no doubt about it, laughter is good for you. Doctors recommend it for depression, and advise patients to seek out environments where they will find themselves laughing as much as possible, be it with amusing friends, a comedy club, a humorous film at the cinema or a comedy TV series.Remember how good it feels to be literally aching with laughter, and how this pushes all your stresses and worries to the back of your mind, even if only for a little while? Laughter is therapy, and best of all, it can be easily found free of charge and without a prescription.You know that Monday morning feeling, where you really don't want to go into work, but know you have to? Again, a good laugh before work can really pep you up and give you the motivation to go and face the day.As you probably know, I have run a small series of hubs lately featuring my favourite humorous images and emails that I have been sent over the last couple of years. Fortunately I had saved most of them in a file on my computer, and now I am enjoying the ability to share these with those of you who have not seen or read them before. Some of them may be familiar to you, but I am sure others will not be, and all bear reading or viewing more than once in any case.This is my latest contribution from my archives. I hope you all enjoy them, and if you do I have added links to my other humorous hubs in the links section at the bottom of the page.I Always Seem to be in the Wrong Place at the Wrong Time! Who Invited These Guys? Things You May (or May Not Know)...If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days you would have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it.)  ***If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it!) ***The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood 30 feet. (O.M.G.!) ***A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes. (In my next life, I want to be a pig.) ***A cockroach will live nine days without its head before it starves to death. (Creepy.) (I'm still not over the pig.) ***Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. (Do not try this at home...... maybe at work.) ***The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off. (Honey, I'm home. What the....?!&quot;) ***The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a human jumping the length of a football field. (30 minutes... lucky pig... can you imagine??) ***The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds. (What could be so tasty on the bottom of a pond?) ***Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (I still want to be a pig in my next life...quality over quantity) ***Butterflies taste with their feet. (Something I always wanted to know.) ***The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue. (Hmmmmmm........) ***Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people. (If you're ambidextrous, do you split the difference?)*** Elephants are the only animals that cannot jump. (OK, so that would be a good thing....) ***A cat's urine glows under a black light. (I wonder who was paid to figure that out?) ***An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain. (I know some people like that.) ***Starfish have no brains. (I know some people like that, too!) ***Polar bears are left-handed. (If they switch, they'll live a lot longer.) ***Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure. (What about that pig??) ***How Men Think.I received a phone call from a gorgeous ex-girlfriend the other day. We lost track of time, chatting about the wild, romantic nights we used to enjoy together. I couldn't believe it when she asked if I'd be interested in meeting up and rekindling a little of that "magic. ""Wow!" I said. "I don't know if I could keep pace with you now". I'm a bit older and a bit balder than when you last saw me. "She just giggled and said she was sure I'd "rise" to the challenge. "Yeah. "I said. "Just so long as you don't mind a man with a waistline that's a few inches wider these days! " She laughed and told me to stop being so silly. She teased me saying that tubby bald men were cute, and she was sure I would still be a great lover. Anyway, she giggled, "I've put on a few pounds myself!" So I told her to f**k off.  My New Hat Definitely Looked Better in the Store! I washed my hair and now I can't do a thing with it. 2006 Darwin Awards2006 Darwin AwardsIn case you have been waiting breathlessly for this year's Darwin Awards , awards are given each year to bestow upon (the remains or estate of, in most cases) that individual, who through single-minded, self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. Just think... until these events occurred, these same people were walking the streets just like normal people.SIXTH PLACE: Goes to a San Anselmo , California man who died when he hit a lift tower at the Mammoth mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad. 22-year old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth Hospital . The accident occurred about 3 a.m. , the Mono County Sheriff's department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump alley and removed some yellow foam protectors from lift towers, said Lt. Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are used to protect skiers who might hit towers. The group apparently used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has since been investigated and determined the tower he hit was the one with its pad removed.FIFTH PLACE: Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death. FOURTH PLACE: Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above him on an overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him. THIRD PLACE: "Man loses face at party." A man at a West Virginia party (probably related to the winner last year, a man in Arkansas who used the .22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off his lips, teeth, and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D . Payne. "Another man had it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying to explode it. It wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show you how to set it off." He put it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his teeth out and his lips and tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday with extensive facial injuries, according to a spokesperson at Charleston Area Medical Division. "I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that," Payne said. SECOND PLACE: Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men Anonymous) in Grants Pass , Oregon . A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon, Doctor Johnny Delashaw, at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that had Roberts tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts, "I feel so dumb about this." "REALLY"?! No charges have been filed, but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the initiation stunt is under investigation. (Editor's note: he probably would have gotten first, but he survived .)THIS YEAR'S WINNER: John Pernicky and his friend, Sal Hawkins, of the great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets (but having had 18 beers between them), they thought it would be easy to "hop" over the nine foot fence and sneak into the show. They pulled their pickup truck over to the fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100 pounds heavier than Mr.Hawkins, to hop the fence and then assist his friend over. Unfortunately for (the late) Mr. Pernicky, there was a 30-foot drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken, along with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts. Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some bushes below him. Possibly figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the tree. Finally free, Mr. Pernicky crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his ENTIRE body and now, without the protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his rectum. To make matters worse, upon landing his pocket knife penetrated his thigh. Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, threw him a rope and tried to pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup truck and slowly driving away. However, in his drunken haste, he put the truck into reverse and crashed through the fence, landing on his friend and killing him. Police arrived to find the crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100 feet from the truck and dead at the scene from massive internal injuries. Upon moving the truck, they found John deceased under it half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25 feet in the air. Congratulations gentlemen. You win. Five more idiots have been removed from the gene pool and we are richer because of your supreme sacrifice. (I can hardly wait till next year... can they get any better?)  That lunch really didn't agree with me!

It is said people who laugh a lot stay healthy and look younger.mistyhorizon20032 years ago Hi Juliet, glad it cheered up your day. It is true, laughter does keep you healthier and looking younger. I can see you must have laughed plenty in your lifetime :)cgull8m2 years ago I agree with you laughter is always good for us, not only us but also others around us. Sad everyone is grumpy with faces twitched all the time especially on the streets. If they keep doing that, it will become permanent on their faces :). Darwin Awards is always funny, it is bizzare what they do sometimes, it looks like a Bugs Bunny cartoons.mistyhorizon20032 years ago Thanks cgull8m, pleased you agree, and thanks so much for dropping by and commenting :)Starscream142 years ago I love so much your funny Hubs... Keep writing them, I can't stop laughing ;)... Thank you very much!mistyhorizon20032 years ago Thanks Starscream, I shall keep on bringing out more until I run out of examples from my archives :)RGraf2 years ago Very good!  I needed that laugh.mistyhorizon20032 years ago Thanks RGraf, More to come yet so keep looking out for my newest released Hubs :)trish10482 years ago Uhhhhhhhh? Misty?  the Porsche? hahahahahahahahaha, too funny!  Wonder if that info was derived from a survey LOLThanks for sharing :)mistyhorizon20032 years ago Thanks Trish, yes, quite possibly, one thing I know for sure is I am not interested in men in Porsche's, as too much money and not enough going on downstairs!! Not that I need to be impressed by the downstairs dept, but I certainly need more than a car to make me go weak at the knees :) :)trish10482 years ago I totally agree!! In high school, cars did impress me a bit, but those were the common 'working class' cars, although I had one boyfriend who drove a big white cadillac, which, at the time was impressive. Most boys were driving souped up mustangs and the like. I did have another boyfriend who drove a gorgeous T-bird, the year that they had the little port windows on the sides in the back.Also, as far as guys with expensive cars, not only is there not a lot going on downstairs, but quite often, not much upstairs either :)mistyhorizon20032 years ago LOL, love the comment about the 'upstairs dept', so very true :) :)trish10482 years ago Of course!!  I've been around the block once or twice, and I know whereof I speak LOLmistyhorizon20032 years ago LOL Trish, not sure what age you are, but I have certainly been around the block a few times aged 38. Still, not to worry, I learnt alot and now need so much more than material wealth to be happy :)trish10482 years ago You're learning well Misty.  I just turned the horrible big six-zero.  I had a dr. appt last week, and this young girl came in to ask me some questions, one of which was how old are you.  When I replied 60, I said ughh!  I told her she was the first person to ask me that since my birthday in October, and actually saying it out loud sounded awful to me.  Funny, I didn't have a problem with 30, 40, even 50, but for some reason, 60 is now sounding ancient to even me.  All I can say is it's been a long road lol.  You're right inbetween my kids ages, 37 and 39.mistyhorizon20032 years ago Ah Trish, you don't come across as being at all old, so don't worry. Somehow I imagined you to be in your thirties :)countrywomen2 years ago Cindy- You are a very bold person for publishing such hubs and interacting about those things. I have yet to learn to deal with such talk and never know whether I ever will. Were you always so bold and frank with men about those things?mistyhorizon20032 years ago Hi CW, I guess I became more frank as I got older because I realised it was a lot better than feeling embarrassed and blushing whenever such things are talked about normally. Too many people get a kick out of trying to make you blush once they know it is easy to embarrass you, so I took the attitude 'if you can't beat them, join them'.One of the nicest compliments I ever received was from a guy in the pub who said "Oh Cindy, she's one of the boys". That felt really good, as if I had been accepted.Also, don't forget that I used to drive buses for a living, and you have to be pretty thick skinned to work day in and day out with over 300 male drivers. Definitely not a job for the easily shocked :)countrywomen2 years ago Cindy- I am 25 years old but still feel shy about these things and surely I will have a tough time dealing in a profession where I have to deal with so many men (OMG 300!!!)I have a lot to learn and maybe once I get married I will learn so many things. Thanks sister for that line "Oh Cindy, she's one of the boys" even I felt the same when I saw your hub about men's thing...LOLmistyhorizon20032 years ago LOL, CW, don't worry you will soon get the hang of it, especially by the time you reach my age (39). I have been pretty 'bold' since about the age of 28, so I guess you too will catch up if your future Husband is one of the lads :)countrywomen2 years ago Cindy- So I have 3 more years to catch up then...hehe. Btw what do you mean "one of the lads"?mistyhorizon20032 years ago Hi CW, 'One of the lads' basically means the men know you are not shockable and are as much a bloke as they are in many ways, down to earth and not afraid to sink a few beers or tell a dirty joke etc.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites93mistyhorizon2003From Guernsey (Channel Islands)1081 Followers286 HubsJoined 2 years agoRead more hubs by mistyhorizon2003Contact mistyhorizon2003Follow mistyhorizon2003Subscribe to mistyhorizon2003's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk mistyhorizon2003 a question based on this Hub.Related Questionshow do i litter train 2 rabbits who have chosen different areas as there toilet space?asked by janeneh 4 months ago3 answersAnswer this questionCan anyone give me a wise/meaningful or beautiful phrase in Italian please?asked by sophs 11 months ago4 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsUnusual Humorby jacobt2Exploring Fort Rock, Oregon - An Amazing Geologic Formationby stephhicks68Vacation Destination: SunRiver in Central Oregonby akirchner Eastern Sierra Nevada Ski Mammothby bgamallSalzkammergut.
