As for Clinton and Obama, I can't decide which of them is the bettr Republican President.  Clinton actually balanced the budget, repealed Glass-Steagall, enacted NAFTA, abolished AFDC, and signed the Telecommunicatons Act of 1996.  He also made two very good appointments to the Supreme Court.  As Republican Presidents go, Clinton was the best since Eisenhower.  Obama still has a long way to go, so I can't decide yet whether he's a better Republican than Clinton.My referring to Clinton and Obama as Republicans is tongue-in-cheek, obviously, but suffice it to say that neither Clinton nor Obama would be second on my list of "best Democratic Presidents in my lifetime."

Seriously.Here's what's happening.  I'm an experimental psychologist, and I find people fascinating.  In my real life, I study them.  I study them at work, I study them when I'm not at work.  And I study them here on DU.Recently, there has been an exciting back and forth between those who support Obama, and those who don't.  I find it fascinating.  So yesterday, I wrote an OP in which I indicated that I am ~47 and that I consider Obama to be the best President of my lifetime.  Which is all true.  In addition to making that claim, I also asked DU folks to indicate how old they were, and to indicate which President do THEY consider the best in their lifetime.Here is a link for reference ... http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph... When I wrote that OP, I was interested in an number of things.1) I expected lots of DU members younger than 40 would select Obama.2) I expected folks older than 40 to split, some Obama, some LBJ, some Clinton, some Truman (wondered if I'd get any FDR).3) I expected some of the folks who responded with some one other than Obama to also use the opportunity to take a swipe at Obama.  A common theme on Du recently.And that's basically what happened.  So now on to the second part of my experiment.  The question in my mind was ... for those who took a swipe at Obama, how would they respond if I asked them this follow up question ... "So is Obama your 2nd choice?"  My expectation was that few would respond to that follow up.  Which is what happened.  Given the framing of the current OP, I'm very confident that it is basically side-ways response to my OP from yesterday.You will notice that I ask that same question in post #3 above, "So, would Obama be 2nd best then in your view?"My experiment continues.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLittle Star      (1000+ posts)Thu Dec-23-10 07:41 PMResponse to Reply #31107.Oh my.......Sorry, I am not impressed with your survey questions.

One of the reasons historians are loathe to consider sitting or recent presidents for any kind of rating is that there is the long range ramifications of policy that need to be addressed. One exception is bush, he is consistently rated in the bottom three, but usually as the last, simply because his dealings domestically and internationally are so pathetic, historians realize that if we stay on the same track he put the nation on, there is nothing in the future but disaster.LBJ was the consummate politician, he was ruthless when it came to getting legislation passed, he was a former congressman and Senator and knew what closets held which skeletons and was never afraid to use that knowledge to advance his agenda, it has been said that even J Edgar Hoover was afraid of the man, and that's saying a lot simply because LBJ bested him Hoover at his own game. In one case, it was rumored that LBJ had photo's of Hoover in drag, and mentioned to him that "you look damn good in those pumps, but they don't go well with the gown". I don't know if there is truth to this, but it is most certainly something LBJ would have said if the need arose; he had the killer instinct.Although this has been called a "political ploy" by his detractors, LBJ was the only member of congress during WWII that left his seat to Join the Navy; and if it was a "ploy", it worked brilliantly. If it wasn't, (as I tend to believe), it showed him as someone who had high principles and a devotion to duty. It should also be noted that he listened to the generals and admirals during the VN buildup, and thought they knew what they were doing, he lost much sleep and agonized over the losses, but once in the swamp, he found it extremely difficult to extricate the nation from the war. For the record, Nixon campaigned on getting the nation out of VN, but did a very poor job of it, (talk about a "political ploy"), and it was Ford, after the House reused to bankroll the war any longer that got us out.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopMH1      (1000+ posts)      Thu Dec-23-10 10:29 AMResponse to Reply #929.LBJ also had a more solidly Democratic Congress.I don't think that can fairly be left out of the equation.But I'll let Obama finish his term(s) before I spend a lot of thought on comparisons.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptilsammans      (1000+ posts)Thu Dec-23-10 11:07 AMResponse to Reply #2936.And Democrats generally were true to Democratic principles . . .. . . back then.

He takes what he can get, according to this theory, and given the intransigence of congressional Republicans, especially in the Senate, it is impossible for Obama to enact truly liberal legislation.  Liberals are supposed to be pleased that Obama managed to accomplish as much as he has given the current political climate, and liberals are supposed to presume that in a more favorable political climate, Obama would have had the power to effect the transformative change we were promised in the 2008 election campaign.  The flaw in this theory is that it ignores everything Obama has done that did not require congressional approval.  Appointing Rahm Emanuel, a died-in-the-wool corporatist and leader of the DLC, as Chief of Staff?  An industry insider, Ken Salazar, as Secretary of the Interior?  Arne Duncan as Secretary of Education?  Tim Geithner and Larry Summers as the foxes guarding the financial industry hen house?  Republicans didnt force Obama to appoint any of these people, and each one of these appointments constitutes a direct attack on a core Obama constituency.  Environmentalists hate Salazar.  Teachers hate Duncan.  Most Americans who realize that bankers and financiers are making record profits and pocketing record bonuses on the public dime, while working Americans are forced to tighten their belts, hate the people who got us into this mess.  Both Geithner and Summers played key roles in creating the financial meltdown from which we are now trying to recover.  Everybody, of course, hates Rahm Emanuel, but liberals have more reason to hate him than most given that he is fond of calling them fucking retarded.  To argue that Obama has liberal political instincts, but that he has been constrained by congressional Republicans, is patently absurd given the people he appointed to run the Federal Government.And its not just his appointments that have irked liberals.  Obama promised to close Guantanamo Bay.  Its still open for torture and unconstitutional detention.  Obama promised to end the Iraq war.  Our troops are still there.  Obama said he would escalate the war in Afghanistan, and he has kept his word on that, but he also promised to bring the troops home in 2011.  Whoops.  Now liberals are supposed to be happy that theyll be coming home in 2014 ... maybe.  Obama promised open government, but in nearly every case that has come before the Courts, Obamas Department of Justice has argued for secrecy and for denying the public the right to know exactly what our government is doing in our name.  Even worse, the Obama administration has taken a hard line on whistleblowers and is dead set on punishing Julian Assange for having the audacity to actually provide the people with some knowledge about the inner workings of their government.  Obama could have eliminated Dont Ask, Dont Tell with the stroke of a pen.  Instead, he ordered a survey and drug his feet on this issue for two years.  Environmentalists were hoping that Obama would actually do something about global warming, but the Obama delegation effectively sabotaged negotiations in Copenhagen.  Those of us who value our constitutional rights were hoping that Obama would put an end to warrantless wiretapping.  That practice has been endorsed by this administration, not to mention that this administration is fully responsible for the electronic, full-body, naked-image searches that are now routine practice at airports across the country.  Those of us who care about the republic were hoping that Obama would disavow the unconstitutional Unitary Executive theory of government propounded by George W. Bush.  Instead, time after time, Obama has fought to preserve executive privilege and power.Given all of this, liberals are supposed to believe that Obama has liberal instincts and intentions, but that he has been stymied by Republican resistance?  Republicans didnt force Obama to take any of the positions he took on the long list of issues cited above. The argument that Obama is some kind of liberal pragmatist is patently absurd.http://laelth.blogspot.com I think it wise to let Obama finish his time in office before making a final judgment, but the threads calling him the "Greatest President Ever" are a bit too much for me to stomach without objection.-LaelthPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toprasputin1952      (1000+ posts)      Thu Dec-23-10 03:33 PMResponse to Reply #5869.When I look at presidents, Washington, Lincoln, FDR, Truman, TR allcome to mind as incredible presidents. LBJ is right up there as well.When I think of "worsts", bush, Buchanan, Harding and Coolidge have to be among the worst. It's far to early to figure Obama in the mix, (although bush is pretty easy even though he's so recent, I can't think of anyone that comes close to the disaster that bush was, except perhaps Buchanan for setting the stage for the Civil War).Time will tell how Preisdent Obama pans out, the last few weeks have shown he can help push things through congress, but, as it always is, at a price. He's done quite a bit in 2 years, but could have pushed for more. The challenge in 2011 will be if he can take his case to the American People, because the House will be out for blood. If Boehner even comes close to shutting down the government like Gingrich did, R's have to know it's a death knell for any hopes they might have for the future...and the Teabag candidates will get crushed in the General election, they are full of themselves and the ?movement" is actually less than a sparrow fart in a hurricane.In the reality of the situation, regardless of the party our congresscritters are in, it is up to us to hold them accountable. I have an R Rep, an R senator and one I don't really know anymore, (Nelson ?-NE). But I am in constant contact with their offices and they are pretty well sick of me, but they always answer my e-mails, snail mail and calls, (yes, I've gotten call backs from all three). It's  a question of taking the time and effort to hold them accountable, or at the very least, letting them know they are prepared to vote for a pathetic Bill, (it also pays to let them know when they do a good job on legislation).Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLaelth      (1000+ posts)      Thu Dec-23-10 03:58 PMResponse to Reply #6973.I agree that it's far too early to judge Obama.Edited on Thu Dec-23-10 04:00 PM by LaelthMore than anything else, that explains why I object to threads calling Obama the "Greatest President Ever."

The fights for Civil Rights, the incredible passion and compassion of MLK...and it was Johnson that pushed for those Rights and a lot of other things. He helped open colleges to "average" people and pushed for federal funding for education. He tried desperately to alleviate poverty...and Lady Bird's legacy has been all but forgotten as billboards rise up again and litter is still a huge problem and getting worse.What Johnson did is always overshadowed by VN, one thing cannot be taken from him though, regardless of what people think of him as a president, he certainly knew how to get things done, and he was unafraid to take things to the people to make a point and put pressure on congresscritters. he was a compassionate individual, but once again, got caught up by those who use war as the answer to everything...

Covertly we sent supplies by air and two American pilots were killed by antiaircraft fire. Eisenhower made it known he did not want to get involved in VN, but behind the curtains, things were moving toward a the conflict. Ike sent advisers there in the late 50's to help South Vietnam build up and maintain it's defenses after the French left, but the # were small.The kicker was the great "Commie Scare" of the 50's and after the Korean conflict, the nations taste of war soured, but because of jerks like McCarthy and his cronies worked the system to drum up fear...so, it was decided to send observers in to watch the Russians and gain intelligence.There is a distinct possibility that JFK was assassinated because he was talking about pulling out completely from the conflict. The Gulf of Tonkin "incident" was a lie, and LBJ was eventually caught in it, but at the time, we were so "anti-Communist" that people were willing to try war again. There is a pattern here that still exists to this day...hawks and zealots drive up the fear index to the point where they get what they want...live fire, w/o them having to go fight the damn thing. It seems that a lot of them profit from it though.It is indisputable though that LBJ escalated the conflict in to full hot war, constraints kept US forces from crossing the border and making quick work of Hoi Chi Mihn and Giap in the North. We lost for several reasons, not the least being a fear of escalating the war to the point where either the Russians of Chinese would have entered on the side of the North...both nations most likely would have let the North fall as opposed to committing troops. For the record, it is virtually impossible to come out of a conflict if "static defense" is the strategy.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOhioBlue      (1000+ posts)Fri Dec-24-10 02:08 AMResponse to Reply #116129.Thank you for adding this bit of fact!!!!It was indeed Eisenhower that sent the first "advisers".

It certainly didn't get any better under Nixon.  LBJ did very well with what he had, and brought about a lot of legislation which was ultimately good for the country.

I know what you're talking about, and you're right to be critical of him.  I would note that he wasn't alone in those feelings.  Ultimately, though, I judge Presidents by what they do, and seldom for what they say, and LBJ deserves a lot of credit for passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Those laws have made an enormous difference in the lives of millions upon millions of people.  I will forgive him for speaking (privately) like the racist that he was.  How he spoke made little difference to the people.  The laws he passed made a tremendous difference, and I could care less whether his motivation was ethical, spiritual, or political.As for the draft, let me say that we might be better off were the draft to be re-instated.  That might focus more attention on our wars of choice and get us out of those wars more quickly.  Lots of people died needlessly in Vietnam, and I am sensitive to that.  I do not condone LBJ's escalation of that war any more than I condone Obama's escalation of the war in Afghanistan.  But if we're going to have senseless un-winnable wars, I'd like to see our Democratic President get a lot of good stuff in exchange.  I am not pleased by what Obama has gotten for the people in exchange for his concessions to the right.  I think he could have done better.  LBJ did.I would also note that it does the Democratic Party no good for its members to bad-mouth one of the great, liberal, Democratic Presidents of the 20th century.  FDR, Truman, and LBJ should be lauded for what they accomplished.

I like Pres. Obama's low key style. I like that he seems a hard worker. I like that he gets things done - maybe not the whole thing at once but there have been some pretty positive steps taken - Lily Ledbetter. The healthcare bill which maybe is not ideologically pure but on a practical level will be helpful to many of us. My son can now have insurance coverage - That's a big deal to me. Repeal of DADT. START treaty. There are more but I have to get going and I'm sure you know the accomplishments - you just choose to define them otherwise. And, no I am not 9 years old nor am I 29. I'm 53 and frankly I like someone who gets things done. I don't need a fight or a showboat.I never expected him to deliver me a perfect world - I figure the world is more than about me and everyone's needs and opinions are as important as mine.

Have I betrayed her? No...I'm just giving her what I can given the situation we live in.. I might want the same thing for her, but I know I can't get it. I personally think what could defeat  Pres.Obama is our slanted, dumbed-down media. A lot of what he's done is actually very progressive and good but how much do people hear about it with thorough explanations of the bills? Not much in my opinion because the media would rather run after the Tea Party and Sarah Palin in search of stories that will help ratings and cater to an audience more accustomed to People magazine than to the New York Times. What worries me is that attacks from the left rather than keeping the Pres. on track and prodding him to more progressive positions is at times only weakening him. Look at the results of the midterms - Had more progressives/democrats come out in his support, we wouldn't be stuck with the Congress we are now. I think in a lot of cases, we need to stop complaining and look at the big, long-term picture.

In 40 or so years, when the Obama administration becomes much more transparent (through records being released to historians), how will views change?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toprasputin1952      (1000+ posts)      Sun Dec-26-10 06:54 PMResponse to Reply #168170.Most things, both politically and in personal lives, are depenentupon specific circumstances and how those circumstances are approached.It is easy for us today to see the Civil Rights Act as a given, but those of us who were alive at the tie realize what a difficult situation was presented. LBJ, by pushing for the CRA, virtually guaranteed his any bid at re-election was to fail. He also knew he was at the the last part of his life, and the strain he had just gone through would have pretty well done him in, (he died a couple of years later, and was barely able to get around before he died).Truman decided that desegregation of the military services were long overdue, and he knew there would be political blowback, but he proved correct, only because the time had arrived for him to act. Suffrage for women was gained in 19209 because a preponderance of states decided it was time, (although it should have been included in the original Constitution).Throughout our history, people younger than 21 were told to go to war, and yet could not vote for or against those who would send them.People thought it was time for a "dry" nation, so Prohibition came about, only to be rescinded, partly because of the incredible power organized crime gained through illicit sales. Oddly, considering the "Drug War", no one looked back at to how Prohibition enriched mobsters, now the drug cartels far out pace what the mobsters ever dreamed of reaping in as profit.Some of the problems PO face are as old as greed itself, some are newer and more nuanced. All things considered, he's doing pretty well, and comparisons often don't hold water. How can he be compared to Lincoln, who placed nation as a whole during the Civil War above all else?Can we compare PO to FDR, who faced some of the harshest economic times and then a World War?Can we compare him to bush, who drove the nation to brink of collapse, and left in utter disgrace and vilified?What was/is the alternative? Could we have been able to afford a McCauin...I don't think so. So I'll work with what we have...and hope for the best.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLydia Leftcoast      (1000+ posts)Sun Dec-26-10 08:07 PMResponse to Original message171.I am completely in agreementIn addition, there were the National Defense Student Loan Program, with 2% interest, 50% forgivable if you went into public school teaching, the military, VISTA, or the Peace Corps, 100% forgivable if you taught school in a poverty area for five years.

No other president has had this kind of power in my lifetime and few have ever had such power.He was the only President in recent times positioned to enact major legislation, and to his credit he did so. It's a great pity that he was not as visionary as Truman and tried to get single-payer.  He was the only President in my lifetime who had the congressional power to achieve it.  However, ironically his progressive civil rights achievements would weaken the Democratic party for years as Southern racists and racist sympathizers moved to the GOP after his term, thus spelling the end of further significant social legislation.  It only took twelve years after LBJ left office for Reagan to begin the destruction of the Great Society and the demonization of progressive philosophy.

I can't argue with any of that, nor would I want to.Obama has not been gifted with a Congress capable of passing the kinds of laws LBJ could pass, but I refuse to let Obama off the hook for that.  Too many of his decisions that did not require Congressional approval have been right-leaning.  I list some of them here:Another theory holds that Obama is some kind of liberal pragmatist.  He takes what he can get, according to this theory, and given the intransigence of congressional Republicans, especially in the Senate, it is impossible for Obama to enact truly liberal legislation.  Liberals are supposed to be pleased that Obama managed to accomplish as much as he has given the current political climate, and liberals are supposed to presume that in a more favorable political climate, Obama would have had the power to effect the transformative change we were promised in the 2008 election campaign.  The flaw in this theory is that it ignores everything Obama has done that did not require congressional approval.  Appointing Rahm Emanuel, a died-in-the-wool corporatist and leader of the DLC, as Chief of Staff?  An industry insider, Ken Salazar, as Secretary of the Interior?  Arne Duncan as Secretary of Education?  Tim Geithner and Larry Summers as the foxes guarding the financial industry hen house?  Republicans didnt force Obama to appoint any of these people, and each one of these appointments constitutes a direct attack on a core Obama constituency.  Environmentalists hate Salazar.  Teachers hate Duncan.  Most Americans who realize that bankers and financiers are making record profits and pocketing record bonuses on the public dime, while working Americans are forced to tighten their belts, hate the people who got us into this mess.  Both Geithner and Summers played key roles in creating the financial meltdown from which we are now trying to recover.  Everybody, of course, hates Rahm Emanuel, but liberals have more reason to hate him than most given that he is fond of calling them fucking retarded.  To argue that Obama has liberal political instincts, but that he has been constrained by congressional Republicans, is patently absurd given the people he appointed to run the Federal Government.And its not just his appointments that have irked liberals.  Obama promised to close Guantanamo Bay.  Its still open for torture and unconstitutional detention.  Obama promised to end the Iraq war.  Our troops are still there.  Obama said he would escalate the war in Afghanistan, and he has kept his word on that, but he also promised to bring the troops home in 2011.  Whoops.  Now liberals are supposed to be happy that theyll be coming home in 2014 ... maybe.  Obama promised open government, but in nearly every case that has come before the Courts, Obamas Department of Justice has argued for secrecy and for denying the public the right to know exactly what our government is doing in our name.  Even worse, the Obama administration has taken a hard line on whistleblowers and is dead set on punishing Julian Assange for having the audacity to actually provide the people with some knowledge about the inner workings of their government.  Obama could have eliminated Dont Ask, Dont Tell with the stroke of a pen.  Instead, he ordered a survey and drug his feet on this issue for two years.  Environmentalists were hoping that Obama would actually do something about global warming, but the Obama delegation effectively sabotaged negotiations in Copenhagen.  Those of us who value our constitutional rights were hoping that Obama would put an end to warrantless wiretapping.  That practice has been endorsed by this administration, not to mention that this administration is fully responsible for the electronic, full-body, naked-image searches that are now routine practice at airports across the country.  Those of us who care about the republic were hoping that Obama would disavow the unconstitutional Unitary Executive theory of government propounded by George W. Bush.  Instead, time after time, Obama has fought to preserve executive privilege and power.Given all of this, liberals are supposed to believe that Obama has liberal instincts and intentions, but that he has been stymied by Republican resistance?  Republicans didnt force Obama to take any of the positions he took on the long list of issues cited above. The argument that Obama is some kind of liberal pragmatist is patently absurd.http://laelth.blogspot.com Liberalism is, sadly, DEAD in the Democratic Party.  The purpose of this thread to remind us of what we once were and what some of us expect out of a political party that we have supported for years and years.Thanks for the thoughtful response.-LaelthPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topretread      (1000+ posts)Mon Dec-27-10 08:21 AMResponse to Original message176.A very friendly President!

I don't admire Clinton as a person, but his policies led to unprecedented low unemployment and the only military actions were to prevent genocide.  Obama ended Iraq and will end Afghanistan, ended torture, extraordinary rendition and warrantless wiretapping, and although the children among us who have never witnessed the roll out of a major social program are gnashing their teeth about HCR because it wasn't exactly what they wanted, it will in retrospect be viewed as something as significant as Medicare and Medicaid.  The huge expansion of Medicaid alone would make HCR the most significant social program in 50 years.  Johnson got many things done, but the war was a catastrophe.  Anyone who thinks that Afghanistan or even Iraq is on the scale of Vietnam simply doesn't know their history.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLydia Leftcoast      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 01:18 PMResponse to Reply #194235.CLINTON?Mr. Welfare Reform?

My father was 57 years old when he died. Much of that life was spent fighting a war he ultimately lost. Even after coming home and settling down.So I find it absurd, just as I'm sure many liberals would, to suggest LBJ was the best president of the last 60 years. My father certainly didn't think so.

Look at the state of the now Soviet Union and their bread-lines....miserable situation they are in, no betterI'm not going to say that Obama was the best or worst president I have ever had simply because I can't think of a president that was around when I had a slight interest in politics...I mean, what is the measuring stick there?.
