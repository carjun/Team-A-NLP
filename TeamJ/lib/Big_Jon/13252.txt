Jan Brewers office is confirming federal judge John Roll[nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in 1991 by Pres. Geo. H.W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1991] was among the dead.Sheriffs authorities said there were six dead, including a child, as well as 18 wounded.Giffords, who is in critical condition, is out of surgery at University Medical Center, said Dr. Peter Rhee at University Medical Center.The shooting occurred at a Safeway supermarket where Giffords was holding one of her regular Congress on Your Corner events, which allows her to speak directly with constituents in her district.The gunman has been identified as 22-year-old Jared Loughner, according to the Associated Press.Giffords has held several events since first taking office in January 2007. At one such event in 2009, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell on the supermarket floor.This was her first event since her re-election to a third term in November.Giffords, 40, was talking to a couple in the store when a gunman rushed her, shouting as he fired his weapon.The gunman fired at people in line and got within 4 to 5 feet of the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a former Tucson newspaper executive who is now on her staff.The gunman fired at Giffords then ran out, continuing to shoot.Members of Giffords staff were among the wounded. District director Ron Barber remained in surgery, but his life was not expected to be in danger.Individuals at the event tackled the man after the shooting, said Pima County Sheriffs Department Bureau Chief Richard Kastigar.Last March, Giffords Tucson office was vandalized after the House vote overhauling the nations health care system.Giffords had just started the congressional session. She tweeted welcomes to new Republican congressman David Schweikert and had just sponsored legislation, with Republican Congressman Ron Paul, to cut congressional salaries.U.S. Congressman Raul Grijalva, Giffords seatmate from Southern Arizona, said, Its horrific. Its heartbreaking. Its very frightening. I hope she comes out of it. This is not what public service is all about.The heated rhetoric and civil discord creates an environment for something like this to happen.He lamented a series of incidents demonstrating the buildup that leads to something like this, including envelope of white powder sent to his Tucson office as well as a shot fired at his Yuma office.Gabbys contributions were all in the future. Her career was all in the future.Washington D.C. authorities have spoken with his staff to stay put.His family in Tucson now has security, but he doesnt know yet whether he will have a secret service detail in the future.***Backround from DSD.The gunman, who may have come from inside the Safeway, walked up and shot Giffords in the head first.Giffordss Tuscon constituency office was vandalised last March after she voted in favour of Barack Obamas controversial health bill, which has been bitterly opposed by the American right. Giffords had been named as a political campaign target for conservatives in Novembers elections by former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin for her strong support of Obamas reforms. Palin had published a target map on her website using images of gun sights to identify 20 House Democrats, including Giffords, for backing the new health care law. At an event in 2009 which was similar to the one Giffords was holding today, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell to the supermarket floor.Giffords, who was born in Tucson and has two children, took office in January 2007 supporting immigration control, embryonic stem-cell research and the right to abortion. While the motive for todays shooting was not immediately clear, Giffords was one of 10 Democrat members of Congress who were the subject of harassment over their support for the healthcare overhaul. Although a Democrat, Giffords was a strong supporter of the right to bear arms and was re-elected to her third term last November in congressional elections, edging out the Tea Party favourite Jesse Kelly.http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/08/gabrielle-giffords-shot-tucson-arizonaMore Backround for TPL and Daniel G..Quote by Timothy Peter Leal:She married Cmdr.

Donald L. Carcieri, had issued to crack down on illegal immigration.To cheers, Governor Chafee officially rescinded the edict that he termed an agent of divisiveness, incivility and distrust among the states citizens. He did so in a packed room at the International Institute of Rhode Island, a nonprofit agency that assists immigrants and refugees.Chafee said he was turning back the clock to March 26, 2008, the day before Carcieri issued his Illegal Immigration Control Order. Carcieri said then that he intended to curb what he termed an epidemic, the costly flow of illegal immigrants. The order sparked numerous protests and spread fear in the immigrant community.Today, we are living up to those standards established by Roger Williams when he came here in 1636, Chafee said, standards of welcome, tolerance, personal rights and the broadest freedoms in the world.The rescission lifts a requirement that state agencies and state vendors screen employees through the federal E-Verify system. Critics say E-Verify is prone to inaccuracy.Chafee also clarified that he is also directing state police Col. Brendan P. Doherty to end the so-called 287(g) agreement between state police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Carcieris order directed state police to pursue the agreement. It led to four troopers being deputized with immigration-enforcement powers.Chafee cleared up confusion left after one of his senior staff members said Tuesday night that the rescission would leave the 287(g) agreement in place, and that whether the governor would choose to terminate the agreement is a different question. Thats not whats on the table  for right now. That is an issue that will be addressed in due course.Asked if the memorandum of understanding with ICE will be revoked, Chafee replied, Thats correct. Thats correct. He added, We will continue to work with all the immigrant communities and state police to make sure were enforcing the laws to the best of our ability, but not doing immigration and customs work.Doherty said later, I thought the [287(g)] process was working well. Reasonable minds may differ, but he is the governor.He added, We will continue to communicate and cooperate with ICE on matters of mutual concern and make sure the people of Rhode Island are safe in a variety of ways.Chafee said the real answer to curbing illegal immigration is through federal immigration reform. He pledged to push for that through the National Governors Association to get our immigrant community  some of whom are living in the shadows  out of the shadows.Chafees repeal, accomplished through an executive order terminating [the] illegal immigration control order, drew immediate praise.But some attending the ceremony raised concerns that new Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartins stated intent to enter a federal Secure Communities initiative could overshadow Chafees repeal of the executive order.The initiative would allow law-enforcement officers to fingerprint people under arrest and have them automatically checked against an immigration databasehttp://www.projo.com/news/content/CHAFEE_RESCINDS_ORDER_01-06-11_8GLQJOO_v15.34cdb6.htmlShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updatesimmigration, RI Gove Lincoln Chaffe, Illegal Immigration Control Order -repealedRead moreArizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords among 12 shot at Tucson grocery.January 8, 2011jamesb10147 commentsRepresentative Giffords at an event in October.Congresswoman Giffords Shot in TucsonCondition of Rep.

Giffords critically wounded, 6 others shot at Tucson rally Arizona Daily Star | Posted: Saturday, January 8, 2011 11:16 am [PST]Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot in Tucson this morning after a public event outside a Safeway grocery store.Some national media are reporting that she was killed, but a spokeman for her office said after noon today that Giffords was in surgery. The reports that the congreswoman has died are not accurate shes in surgery, CJ Karamargin told the Star this afternoon.National Public Radio reports she was shot in the head.The Democrat, who was re-elected to her third term in November, was hosting a Congress on Your Corner event at the Safeway in northwest Tucson when a gunman ran up and started shooting, according to Peter Michaels, news director of Arizona Public Media, NPR reported.At least 10 other people, including members of her staff, were hurt. Giffords was transported to University Medical Center. Her condition was not immediately known.Sheriffs bureau chief Rick Kastigar said 12 people were wounded some of them greatly. Ten people were transported to hospital.The lone gunman is reportedly in custody.Kristin Ducat, a veterinary technician whose office, Northwest Pet Clinic sits across Ina Road from Safeway, said she heard about 15 rapid gunshots.It sounded like an automatic, she said.She and her coworkers ran to the front glass door after the gunshots.She said they saw shoppers and workers to the nearby Beyond Bread.

Now something has changed. Congressional Democrats are challenging Republicans, daring them to come out against the bills more popular provisions. The Democratic National Committee is aggressively distributing talking points. According to an account in theNew York Times, Democrats will soon have a campaign-style war room for making their case. Its almost as if the the Democrats want this fight now.Of course, they may not have a choice. Republicans have made repeal a top priority, so the fight is going to take place whether or not Democrats want it. But I think it also reflects a changing dynamic, as well. According toGreg Sargent, who was among the first to spot the shift, House Democrats in particular are aware of the opportunity they missed last year, while the party and most of its leaders were trying so hard to save endangered incumbents. They think theyre in a stronger position now, since people are starting to see the laws benefits and repeal will mean changing an increasingly favorable status quo.It also helps that the Republicans finally have to do some governing. And governing requires the kind of specifics Republicans could avoid when they were merely campaigning to win office..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, UpdatesCongress, Democrats, House Democrats, Politics, President Obama, Republicans/GOP, The Democrats losing the House, White HouseRead moreLadies and Gentleman we have a Conservative Civil War at CPACJanuary 8, 2011jamesb1013 commentsThis from PoliticoResentment at Grover Norquist (left) and David Keene threatens to undermine CPAC.(AP Photos)A conservative civil war over CPACThe proximate cause of the explosion is the inclusion in CPAC of the combative gay conservative group GOProud. But if the sheer intensity of the quarrel seems disproportionate to that seemingly straightforward dispute, thats because its also deeply personal. Long-simmering resentment of two of the leading figures on the economic right, American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene  who runs the event  and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, who has long been involved in planning it, has morphed into a conflict that carries the special bitterness of a civil war.There are a lot of conservatives who see a larger problem with Grover Norquist and David Keene, and theyve decided to fight it out and CPAC is a proxy for that, said Erick Erickson, the publisher of RedState.org, who said he wont be participating in the conference because he wants to stay out of the conflict. The underlying question is whether the conservative movement still has strong planks for social conservatism and national security conservatism. But it has also become very personal.If youve been around this town for a long time, as I have youve got people who disagree with you substantively and youve got people who dont like you and if you hang around long enough, their numbers increase, said Keene, who dismissed many of the attacks as residing in the fever swamps of the website WorldNetDaily.Its no secret that some social conservatives are very upset at the idea that there would be any participation by any organization thats gay, but over the course of the 37 or 38 years that CPACs been in existence weve had all kinds of people suggest that other people ought to be tossed out, he said. Our mission is once a year to allow social, economic, and national security conservatives to come together.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesConservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, David Keene, GOProud, Grover Norquist, Libertarian, Republicans/GOP, Social Conservatives, the 'Right'Read morePresident Obamas Approval 1/8/11..January 8, 2011jamesb1011 commentPresident Obamas Poll numbers..From Realclearpolitics.

Many of the companies on this list are partially doomed by their industry. Airlines, cable companies, and banks for example, are often maligned by their customers. Retail firms and companies that were sensitive to downturns in the economy had to lay off significant numbers of employees during the recession, which bred resentment.But several companies you might have expected on this list arent. AIG became a pariah after its federal bailout, but it does not show up on the list thanks to high earnings over the past year, as its stock has nearly doubled. Goldman Sachs, that infamous vampire squid of Wall Street, earned a fair share of negative press and popular resentment since the credit crunch. But Goldman also ranked near the top in categories like customer satisfaction, shareholder satisfaction, employee satisfaction and CEO approval. GM has faced similar obstacles, but its also seen a spate of good news in the last few months, with profits, hires, and a successful IPO winning it more positive press coverage.More..Why am I not surprised that Bank of America tops the list?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAT&T, Bank of America, BP, Citibank, Dell, Direct TV, McDonalds, Nokia, The 15 Most Hated Companies in America, ToyotaRead moreArizona politicians/officials continue their effort to disenfranchise its Latino population.January 8, 2011jamesb1014 commentsThis time its ruling is Mexican-American studies classes taught in the Tucson School District are illegalBut any other Ethic Studies class is OkThings arent helped by the fact that the guy who wrote the ruling as the states superintendent of public instruction.Is now the states Attorney GeneralCurtis Acosta spoke to his students about their future after Arizona said their Mexican-American studies program was illegal.(Jill Torrance for The New York Times)Its propagandizing and brainwashing thats going on there, Tom Horne, Arizonas newly elected attorney general, said this week as he officially declared the program in violation of a state law that went into effect on Jan. 1.Although Shakespeares Tempest was supposed to be the topic at hand, Mr. Acosta spent most of a recent class discussing the political storm in which he, his students and the entire district have become enmeshed. Mr. Hornes name came up more than once, and not in a flattering light.It was Mr. Horne, as the states superintendent of public instruction, who wrote a law aimed at challenging Tucsons ethnic-studies program. The Legislature passed the measure last spring, and Gov.Jan Brewer signed it into law in May amid the fierce protests raging over the statesimmigrationcrackdown.The state, which includes some Mexican-American studies in its official curriculum, sees the classes as less about educating students than creating future activists.In Mr. Acostas literature class, students were clearly concerned. They asked if their graduation was at risk. They asked if they were considered terrorists because Mr. Horne described them as wanting to topple the government. They asked how they could protest the decision.Then, one young woman asked Mr. Acosta how he was holding up.They wrote a state law to snuff this program out, just us little Chicanitos, he said, wiping away tears. The idea of losing this is emotional.At a recent news conference, Mr. Horne took pains to describe his attack on Tucsons Mexican-American studies program as one rooted in good faith. He said he had been studying Spanish for several years and had learned enough to read Mexican history books in Spanish and to give interviews on Univision and Telemundo, two Spanish-language broadcasters.Asked whether he felt he was being likened toBull Connor, the Alabama police commissioner who became a symbol of bigotry in the 1960s, Mr. Horne described how he had participated in the March on Washington in 1963 as a young high school graduate. He said of his critics: They are the Bull Connors. They are the ones resegregating.Mr. Hornes battle with Tucson over ethnic studies dates to 2007, whenDolores Huerta, co-founder of theUnited Farm Workers, told high school students there in a speech that Republicans hated Latinos. Mr. Horne, a Republican, sent a top aide, Margaret Garcia Dugan, to the school to present a different perspective. He was infuriated when some students turned their backs and raised their fists in the air..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesArizona Mexican-American studies classes, Latino's, Rulled illigal, Tucson Ethnic studies classesRead morePage 3 of 576Previous Page12345...576Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
