Joan BrunwasserElection Integrity Editor             Joan Brunwasser is a co-founder of Citizens for Election Reform (CER) which since 2005 existed for the sole purpose of raising the public awareness of the critical need for election reform. Our goal: to restore fair, accurate, transparent, secure elections where votes are cast in private and counted in public.  Because the problems with electronic (computerized) voting systems include a lack of transparency and the ability to accurately check and authenticate the vote cast, these systems can alter election results and therefore are simply antithetical to democratic principles and functioning.   Since the pivotal 2004 Presidential election, Joan has come to see the connection between a broken election system, a dysfunctional, corporate media and a total lack of campaign finance reform.  This has led her to enlarge the parameters of her writing to include interviews with whistle-blowers and articulate others who give a view quite different from that presented by the mainstream media.  She also turns the spotlight on activists and ordinary folks who are striving to make a difference, to clean up and improve their corner of the world. By focusing on these intrepid individuals, she gives hope and inspiration to those who might otherwise be turned off and alienated. She also interviews people in the arts in all their variations - authors, journalists, filmmakers, actors, playwrights, and artists. Why? The bottom line: without art and inspiration, we lose one of the best parts of ourselves. And we're all in this together. If Joan can keep even one of her fellow citizens going another day, she considers her job well done. Joan has been Election Integrity Editor for OpEdNews since December, 2005. Her articles also appear at RepublicMedia.TV and Scoop.co.nz.

Today he is an avid bicyclist and is active in several Green organizations and Progressive organizations such as  Transportation Alternatives, East Coast Greenway, Common Ground, and has a presence on Facebook, Change.Org, OpEdNews, and PickensPlan.  Scott is a strong proponent of the Georgist Single Tax: "Tax the use (and abuse) of natural resources, not wages or capital," which would dramatically reduce use of finite resources - which, rightfully, belong to all of us, and increase productivity in Earth-saving ways, while virtually eliminating unproductive Speculation (by taxing away the fuel for it) and decrease poverty and Social Injustice.Technorati code: a72h4zxgud EditorSheila SamplesSheila Samples is an Oklahoma writer and a former civilian US Army Public Information Officer.

Ed TubbsAn "Old Army Vet" and liberal, qua liberal, with a passion for open inquiry in a neverending quest for truth unpoisoned by religious superstitions. Per Voltaire: "He who can lead you to believe an absurdity can lead you to commit an atrocity." Jennifer HathawayMother of two adult children, freelance artist with fine works in private collections in 20 US states, 7 European countries, Africa, China, and Japan, concerned citizen of the US.  Overreaching corporate controls of food, housing, clothing, medicine, transportation, information, and education have been a serious concern of mine for decades. Consequently I've spent a great deal of time studying and practicing self-sufficiency/ removal from "the grid".   I no longer have credit cards, I raise my own vegetables and chickens, am an herbalist, a reiki master, a shiatsu practitioner who's worked with people with serious illnesses for more than a decade, as well as an ordained minister [I call myself a shamanist because it's the closest description of what I do, not because I'm from Tibet]. I've worked in construction for many years, and I've spent some time beating dead horses on the subject of independance from corporate control and learning to live a life of value as opposed to one of dehumanization.  My message to surburbanites: rototill your front lawn, grow vegetables, put up solar panels, stay home more often, make things for yourself, and cut up your credit cards.  Live your life as if truth, honor, and love were the most important things. The corporate culture would have us believe that we owe someone rent for the privilege of being on the planet, that some pigs are more equal than others, that it's important to be royalty- as opposed to noble- and that happiness is available for purchase. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out the truth of things. Eric NelsonEric Nelson is freelance writer, an editor at OpEdNews, and a spiritual progressive from Minnesota who has become more politically active.

By the end of 2001 he was blogging on a daily basis across a range of topics from progressive politics to environmental concern to critical theory and postmodernism. In those early days, a lot of his writing was a meta narrative: blogging about bloggers and blogging. The navel gazing didn't last long. Soon he was blogging about what bloggers were blogging about.  In the 1960s he was thoroughly alienated by the Vietnam War and rampant race and gender discrimination. He dropped out of his PhD program and left Madison, Wisconsin for the San Francisco Bay Area. In San Francisco he worked for the Bank of America and became an expert in the fields of data networking and information technology. He also wrote for "underground" newspapers, alt weeklies as they're called today. He accepted the contradictions of corporate work and life in the counter-culture. Those contradictions remain unresolved today.  Paynter is a progressive, a pacifist, and a fan of government regulation of big business. He would rather see a military draft than an all volunteer army augmented by mercenaries. A supporter of Barack Obama from the earliest days of his candidacy, Paynter worries today that the President is squandering the mandate for peace that we gave him in November 2008. In 1990, realizing his expertise was portable and that distances had been destroyed by public and private networks, he returned to the Madison area, bought a small farm from the Nature Conservancy, and went into the Information Technology consulting business. Married, a farmer, and the father of two grown sons, Paynter's activist interests include organic agriculture, land use planning, energy alternatives to fossil fuels and other combustibles and addressing racial disparities in justice administration. His educational background includes a BA in English, an MBA, and telecommunications engineering course work at Berkeley and MIT. In 2007, he received an honorary fellowship in Sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he studied the drivers that influence racial disparities in criminal justice administration, issues in public policy formation around this concern, and how these disparities affect us culturally and personally.
