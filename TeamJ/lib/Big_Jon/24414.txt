First lady Michelle Obama has lobbied for the bill as part of her "Let's Move" campaign to combat childhood obesity.House Democrats said the GOP amendment, which would have required background checks for child care workers, was an effort to kill the bill and delayed a final vote on the legislation rather than vote on the amendment.Because the nutrition bill is identical to legislation passed by the Senate in August, passage would send it to the White House for President Obama's signature. If the bill were amended, it would be sent back to the Senate with little time left in the legislative session.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. said the House would hold separate votes on Thursday on the amendment and the bill.Republicans say the nutrition bill is too costly and an example of government overreach."It's not about making our children healthy and active," said Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., the top Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee. "We all want to see our children healthy and active. This is about spending and the role of government and the size of government - a debate about whether we're listening to our constituents or not."Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has also taken a swipe at the first lady's campaign, bringing cookies to a speech at a Pennsylvania school last month and calling the campaign a "school cookie ban debate" and "nanny state run amok" on her Twitter feed.The legislation would give the government the power to decide what kinds of foods could be sold and what ingredients may be limited in school lunch lines and vending machines.The Agriculture Department would create the standards, which would likely keep popular foods like hamburgers and pizza in school cafeterias but make them healthier, using leaner meat or whole wheat crust, for example. Vending machines could be stocked with less candy and fewer high-calorie drinks.The bill would provide money to serve more than 20 million additional after-school meals annually to children in all 50 states. Many of those children now only receive after-school snacks. It would also increase the number of children eligible for school meals programs by at least 115,000, using Medicaid and census data to identify them.The legislation would increase the amount of money schools are reimbursed by 6 cents a meal, a priority for schools that say they don't have the dollars to feed needy kids.groups:News, Politics, Health tags:Michelle Obama,School Lunches |335 comments// GOP Blocks Childhood Nutrition Billhide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

They need to be upgraded not done away with. For many poor children lunch is the only meal they have in a day, and that is not their fault. I find it outrageous that they would be used as leverage to appease a partisan political grudge. A good diet is essential to maintaining good grades and health. How sad and hateful that some see this as someone taking their money, but don't utter one word when these same children are sent off to fight in a war for the benefactors of these bastards that would literally take the food right out of their mouths. 1 month agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  JanforGore:you find it outrageous that school children are being used as leverage in the government? i dont... after all, their christmas is being held as leverage this year in the government too... their very well being, food, clothing, shelter, electricity, etc... its all being held leverage by the republicans in the house right now with the unemployment fiasco going on. 1 month agoflag  reply+3navideris anyone surprised!?

I dont get enough food stamps to make it through the whole month and i'm extremely grateful that my son can eat breakfast and lunch at school. in my town, thankfully, there is a little bit of restriction on what children can eat. they have the calories and nutrition of each meal on the menu for the parents. but as far as you... well it must be nice living in your world... maybe you should come visit the less fortunate sometime... all people on food stamps arent selling them for crack ya know... 1 month agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  JohnA:i pray to whatever god there is in heaven that you lose your job... i really want you to feel what a lot of other people are feeling first hand. then i hope that you dont qualify for unemployment because your company finds an excuse to fire you instead of lay you off. then i hope that you get sick, and you dont have health insurance. i hope your whole family gets incredibly sick and you get bancrupted, i hope you lose everything, i really do. 1 month agoflag  reply+1ImConcerned  Mark701:you're a better man than me, because i hope he goes through hell to get some understanding and human relativity. 1 month agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  JohnA:you have got to be the most unthinking, pea-brained, asshole that i have ever spoken with. if you dont want to pay taxes, go move to a fuckin cabin in the woods. stop driving on my paved roads, stop sending your kids to my schools, and DO NOT COLLECT SOCIAL SECURITY or MEDICARE!!! you fuckin idiot... 1 month agoflag  reply+1ImConcerned  JohnA:because you were a college student with no children... i bet if you were a grown adult with children to feed, u might feel a whole lot differently. i never got government help before i had children either. i've been homeless, i've been evicted, i've had nothing to eat before... before i had my son, that was just fine... but now, if im homeless, he's homeless. my god... what is wrong with you? how many college males with no kids do you know on government assistance? i'd assume none since they dont qualify... 1 month agoflag  reply0JohnA  ImConcerned:I was smart enough to know if I couldn't feed myself, I couldn't feed a child. 1 month agoflag  reply0JohnA  ImConcerned:As if I will ever get out of Social Security what I have paid in. 1 month agoflag  reply+2ImConcerned  JohnA:things dont always work out as planned... u might be say... nearly 4 years at the same job, grew up on the other side of the country, lose your job because 2 stores merged together and fired half their staff... lets say, you're 7 months pregnant and showing... its the dead of winter, you're in milwaukee wisconsin, 7 months pregnant with no job.... your car breaks down... so you're 7 months pregnant, in the dead of winter in milwaukee wisconsin, catching 3 busses to get to your new job making 7 dollars an hour, its a part time telemarketing job, but hey, its a job and ya gotta do what ya gotta do, rent is due... rent doesnt get paid because you're makin about 100 dollars a week, and 100 dollars goes fast in a week when you're scraping to just stay above water, so you can never get 500 dollars together at one time to pay the rent, let alone the car note, on the broke down car... so one night you lose it at work and blow the fuck up on a "perspective" who threatened to kill you, and lost your 7 dollar an hour telemarketing gig... you're almost 9 months pregnant, its the dead of winter. you're car gets reposessed, you lose your job, AGAIN, and you're 2 months behind on the rent and the land lord dont give a shit about your personal life. so then you're almost 9 months pregnant with no job, no car, no place to live. you had to leave your furniture and everything you own but some clothes for you and the baby, and start staying with this chick from the telemarketing place that does a lot of pills and cocaine. you're never been into the drug scene so being pregnant and in this situation is most difficult...so you call your grandparents and catch a bus back to texas, defeated, bruised, beat up, sore... and the only thing that u had was 120 dollars a month worth of nourishment for yourself and your baby. thank god for that, right? now, throw in the fact that the child your carrying is the result of a rape that you couldnt even comprehend "getting rid of".... after all, at the time, you were making good money. you were 25, you didnt need a man to take care of you anyways. whats really sad is that this is not an isolated incident... shit happens every day like this to people who least expect it. i hope you take the time to read this, sincerely... this is life 1 month agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  JohnA:at least you're already old... i'll never even get to enter the program at all... but i'll pay more for social security in my lifetime than you will. because even poor people pay taxes my friend. 1 month agoflag  reply0JohnA  ImConcerned:I have lost my job, more than one, to tell the truth.  I've worked for companies that fired me for bullshit reasons, and for ones that went bankrupt.  I'll send you my resume if you want to see it.  I know what they are feeling first hand.  And I have taken unemployment checks.  But I didn't expect them to sustain me, they were little more then beer money.  So I got a job.  Maybe not the best one in town, count me as the under-employed, but I'd rather do what I do than depend on the government to do it for me. 1 month agoflag  reply0JohnA  ImConcerned:Food stamps go for 25 cents on the dollar in Memphis, and the Memphis City School Superindentant has a six figure salary and the Teachers Union will never allow a pay cut.

The "2008" financial crisis was the result of the Bush Administrations refusal to reign in the sociopaths on Wall Street. It was The bailout itself was Hank Paulsons idea (Bush's Treasury Secretary). The budget that Obama operated under in 2009, was in reality, the last Bush budget passed in 2008.  I agree however that the middle class American got royally screwed. Especially when you consider that federal tax dollars were also used to bail out foreign banks with American subsidiaries and little to no money went to homeowners. Still, as much as the crisis was the fault of the GOP, once it happened, there was little else Bush could do to stave off a global economic depression than spend, spend, spend. I will credit him and the Congress for having the guts to do the right thing, even though it was a bitter pill to swallow for the rest of us. I will fault them, however, for only pumping up the supply side of things while ignoring the genuine needs of the middle class. 1 month agoflag  reply0CalgarC  ayipis:quit talking about your dad... 1 month agoflag  reply-7ayipisLOL..so you got money to buy dope but no money to buy food for your kids??stay in school kids..or else you would be a dependent of the state.. 1 month agoflag  reply+6JahBuLon  ayipis:but we are talking about those kids in school who are on their way to not becoming dependent of the state.  my stepmother works in the buffalo public school systems as a dietician for their school cafeterias.  about half of the children she feeds thank her for giving them their only meal of the day. 1 month agoflag  reply+2Nephwrack  ayipis:LOL so you got money to buy meth but no money to buy food for your kids??stay in school kids or you'll end up a tweaker neo con puppet! 1 month agoflag  reply+2alexandrek  ayipis:So many psychiatrist, neurologist and I guess even anthropologist that would dream to meet you!you are pure nobel price material for a shrink! 1 month agoflag  reply0KSirys  Nephwrack:voted up!! 1 month agoflag  reply0Mark701  JahBuLon:Don't bother trying to reason with ayipis because you'll be wasting your time.

"the definition of insanity is to keep repeating the same ideas and habits and expect different results."  so let that be our major premise.  then let's have our minor premise state that conservatives keep repeating the same ideas and habits and expect different results (because CONSERVING an idea is REPEATING an idea.)  therefore conservatism=insanity.  use logic, don't just draw conclusions like the rest of your people do.  use reason.

The last thing they want is individuality. Individuals who exhibit personal responsibity do not make good wards of the state."In reality, Liberals are for human rights and individuality, while conservatives are for traditional values and conformity.  Liberals believe every individual has the right to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they do not harm others. Conservatives believe the community as a whole can set standards for the people within it to conform to.In other words- the exact opposite of what you wrote.Conservatives want a government with them making the rules, them deciding what is best for you. The last thing conservatives want is individuality.Just look at the composition of the two parties- Republicans are almost clones. Democrats are filled with various religions, ethnicities, sexualities, and even ideologies.Basically, the Republicans are lock-step NeoCons, and the Democrats are everyone else, in all of our diversity and individuality.Now, your claim about taxes:Many have latched on to the myth of Independence vs Dependence.It is a false dichotomy, created by the pundits.In the real world, we are all INTERDEPENDENT.The country, as a whole, is a single economic unit, because we are all interdependent on each other. We all count on each other. Every life has impact on every other life.We all benefit by having a populace that is healthy and educated. So, a nation has the responsibility to provide education to it's citizens, so the nation as a whole benefits. It has a responsibility to provide health care, especially preventative health care, so that we have a strong, healthy, productive population. Helping the least of us is not purely altruistic- it benefits us ALL.Take education for example.Imagine no government supplied education. The children of the rich go to excellent private schools, the children of the middle class go to cheap private schools, and the children of the poor get nothing.They wander the streets, comiting crimes- like stealing your car or breaking into your home. They make more work for the police, so they don't have the manpower to deal with your 911 call.Imagine QUALITY government provided education. Where intelligent children of any economic background have the ability to succeed, and all children have the opportunity for careers.More educated people. More doctors. More businessmen. More scientists. More inventors.A larger, stable middle class.Now, health care. Without freely available health care, especially preventive health care, easily treatable conditions in their early stages are cured before they become expensive medical conditions, draining hospital resources away from you when you get sick.Without medical care for the poor, impoverished neighborhoods become incubators for plagues. AIDS, Tuberculosis, Avian flu- Whooping cough is making a comeback.And those poor people prepare your food.By having a nation filled with healthy, educated people we ALL benefit, far more than if we horde every single penny out of a greedy desire to never pay taxes. 1 month agoflag  reply0JohnA  alexandrek:There is plenty of blame to go around for both sides.

Do not expect your government to help you out, when you have your benevolent corporate buddies to fluff your pillow and graciously bestow minimum wage on you, while spewing out toxins, fighting social reform and equitable distribution of wealth.  Shit, they pray with you at church, ain't that enough?  You ungrateful surfs.  Get off your butts and start working for us.  If your lucky maybe we will give you a raise 40 years from now.  That's about how long ago we gave you your last raise.  So shut the fuck up and if you don't like it go live in some other commie, socialist country with a higher standard of living.  But you'll probably have to learn German or French.  Which may be easier for you mono lingual non citizens of Hispanic decent.  Or Asian decent or African decent. Or if you really want to be in the party, start a business and steal something or bribe someone or pollute something.  Then you can make millions, date Paris Hilton while working hard for 2 or 3 hours a week.  Time is money.  How hard can it be to steal millions?  George W did it and he ain't very bright at all.  So if you ain't been born into privilege cause God loves you less than George W, then suck it up and get strokin.  Just cause I was born and raised as a middle class white guy, doesn't mean I have to pay attention to your bad luck and shitty birth right, I mean your bad choices.  I'm sure that if I was born a poor black child or in a Mexican ghetto, I would have pulled myself up with my pets the cockroaches and I would be doing as well as I am today.

Too many loop holes not foreseen by our slave owning, happy go lucky forefathers.  Kinda like the Bible is a little short on women's equality issues.  Time for a new government.  Actually the changes needed are structurally pretty simple. But as any good German knows, you must have the WILL to triumph. Eliminate lobbies, donations and restrict politicians from the private sector after serving in office.  One person, one vote.  Regulate political advertisement and support non-scripted public debates.  Please feel free to add to this list.  Corporate reform would pretty easy as well with the use of a few principles.
