On His Prudent Fiscal Decisions, Perrys Deficit More Than Twice What He Thought            By Pat Garofalo  on Jan 10th, 2011 at 2:15 pm          After Lecturing D.C. On His Prudent Fiscal Decisions, Perrys Deficit More Than Twice What He Thought Back in September, Gov. Rick Perry (R-TX) guessed that his state was facing a $10-11 billion budget shortfall for its fiscal 2012-2013 budget, and refused to entertain reports that his budget gap might be larger until he received the state Comptrollers official report. He even poo-pooed pronouncements from his 2010 election opponent, Houston Mayor Bill White, that Texas deficit may be twice what he was estimating. If [White] wants to be the budget forecaster for the state of Texas, thats a different job, Perry said. Its called the comptroller.Well, the Comptroller released its report today, and Perry had it wrong:Texas is expected to collect $72.2 billion in taxes, fees and other general revenue during the 2012-13 budget, down from the $87 billion used in the current two-year budget, Comptroller Susan Combs announced Monday. That puts the shortfall at $27 billion given that maintaining services would run $99 billion for biennium.Not only did Perry severely underestimate the depth of his states budget woes, but he has also spent the last few years lecturing Washington D.C. on its supposed fiscal improprieties, giving speech after speech in which he held up Texas as the economic model for the nation to follow. Just last week, he said that Congress needs to propose a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, or else the hard work that Texas and states like ours have done to make prudent fiscal decisions will be washed away by Washingtons growing avalanche of excess:I am convinced that a constitutional limit on Washingtons spending sprees and irresponsible borrowing is the only boundary they will understand and heed. Otherwise, the hard work that Texas and states like ours have done to make prudent fiscal decisions will be washed away by Washingtons growing avalanche of excess. [1/7/11]Americans are growing ever more aware of this spending explosion, and increasingly interested in grabbing the throttle, so they can slow down Washingtons runaway train. Im convinced that the hardworking citizens of our state and country simply want government to handle the basics, then get out of the way, as we have done here in Texas. [1/15/10]I dont suspect Im the only person in this room who is concerned about a national debt that has blown past $11 trillion and a federal deficit that is well over $1 trillion Fortunately, we have taken the opposite approach here in Texas. [6/30/09]In Texas and South Carolina, weve focused on improving soil conditions for businesses by cutting taxes, reforming our legal system and our workers compensation system. Wed humbly suggest that Congress take a page from those playbooks by focusing on targeted tax relief paid for by cutting spending, not by borrowing. [12/2/08]Though its facing a budget mess of roughly the same magnitude as California, Texas has received far less attention, and at this point, theres practically nothing left in the states budget to cut besides education and health care spending (while Texas already has some of the lowest per-pupil spending rates and the highest number of those without health insurance). As Paul Krugman wrote, Texas is where the modern conservative theory of budgeting  the belief that you should never raise taxes under any circumstances, that you can always balance the budget by cutting wasteful spending  has been implemented most completely. If the theory cant make it there, it cant make it anywhere. And it seems the theory cant make it there.Cross-posted on The Wonk Room.TweetPrintBelacHe would have gotten away with it, too if it hadnt have been for those darn accountants and their meddling.http://www.thezxbecollection.comzxbeA Republican whose rhetoric on fiscal conservatism doesnt actually match the numbers.

Texas is the US equivalent to Ireland.  The Republicans keep saying that reduced taxes creates jobs and balances the budget at the same time.  They said, look to Ireland look to Texas.  Oops.PilotsharkOT but speaking of Jan one wonders if she will pick one or two of the 26 points to gain enough money to stop HER DEATH PANELS?http://pennsylvaniaforchange.wordpress.comCats r FlyfishnThat should be interesting considering that the Republicans in Congress are planning on NOT handing out any extra money this year to the States.PilotsharkLOLthink here in about a month or so gov good-hair will be wishing for California budget problems cause his will make that look like a speed bump.Pilotsharkyes.but considerer that the 26 points you dont have to ask for more money cause its already there and has been.sad sad and just a piss poor job on the Governors side!!!Pilotsharkcome to texas we are AMERICAs Ireland.right wing conservative government in action.http://pulse.yahoo.com/_Z6VUJDXCSG26NM3KGUVEUN55PQAnyThe estimate is based upon a pessimistic outlook on the Obama economy.  If Obama/Pelosi/Reed werent stifling the recovery with run away spending, the revenue outlook would be better.PilotsharkLOL at the new cult troll sock.think that sock can stand in the corner all by itself.AnonymousHad they only succeeded in secedingThe country/state of TX would be dying a slow death with no one to bail them out.Anonymousi guess that explains why the dow is flagging, corp. profits are way down, and were still having negative jobs growthwait  whats that?? were not? the dows strong? profits are up? job growth is picking up?AnonymousAs a Texan I can say, without any guilt at all, that Perry is a corporate whore and a buffoon who would best serve the state by moving to Arizona.PilotsharkLOLguess they be learning what the word UNITED stands for in UNITED STATES of AMERICA.BelacIs that more of that patented Republican responsibility I always hear about?AnonymousHave any reasoning and facts about how they are stifling the economy?  Anything at all?http://pennsylvaniaforchange.wordpress.comCats r FlyfishnMy heart reaches out to you.  It must be difficult being surrounded by the undereducated.http://tpzoo.wordpress.com/ZooeyAfter Lecturing D.C.

Running Texas right into the ground!Oh waitAnonymoushow ya gonna blame the feds for that ricky?Oh, dont worry. Slick Rick will find a way. Hes probably thought of a way already. We all know how GOPigs blame everyone else for their own fcukups.BadmoodmanAfter Lecturing D.C. On His Prudent Fiscal Decisions, Perrys Deficit More Than Twice What He Thought      Gov. Perry, step up and suckle at the Federal teet, ya bonehead.AnonymousHes even wearing a losers hat (yes, I bleed Orange & Black  Gs win the World Series   beating Texas Rangers)[apologies for the gloating but looking at that loser of a Gov...]AnonymousHey Gov. Ricky Boy,Texas is always bragging about everything in Texas being bigger than everywhere else.Hows it feel to be the second biggest moron in Texas? You would be the biggest moron but GW Botch lives there.AnonymousMN has the same issue.A right wing Governor left town to run for President and left us a $7.2B deficit.He refused to raise revenue capture for 8 years, assuring us the free market will solve all of our fiscal issues. He severely cut social programs, particularly for sick & disabled children.This IS compassionate conservatism. Its also cruel, sickening and sad.AnonymousNot to mention Texas isnt the largest, in size  Alaska is!http://tpzoo.wordpress.com/ZooeyI wonder how many of the Arizona 98 will have to die before Brewer responds to that list?Two are gone already.AnonymousNah, I think Texas should go ahead and default on their debt obligations and just go bankrupt.  Let the invisible hand of the free market take control.  Other states around them can buy up chunks of Texas at fire sale prices.  Or maybe we can just sell it back to Mexicowe could solve the whole deficit and immigration problem in one fell swoop!Pilotsharklike to say i have three teams.AnglesGiantsand any team that beats the dodgers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!go giants!!Pilotsharksadly two many at this point.AnonymousNo deal, not while Dubya still lives in Texas!PilotsharkOr in population as well.http://tpzoo.wordpress.com/ZooeyThat would be a conservative wet dream, since it would have the effect of breaking teacher contracts, lowering or breaking pension accounts, and busting unions.  As for selling TX back to Mexico, hell they wouldnt want it!AnonymousZXBE, Where HAVENT we heard this before ????? ;-)until he received the state Comptrollers official report   Would this be a.k.a. Just their opinion ?And may I ask that between Texas and S Carolina, what else could they do to make the environment more hospitable to business other than lining up to donate their bodies for Soylent Green ?  And how has that paid out for the wages of workers, money for education, etc. ?Austininc4Perry  is an Idiot,   OWNED  and OPERATED    by  Oil Companies  and the NRA.  He cant take a Sh!t  without their  permission.Badmoodman   I guess those expensive new revised school textbooks in Texas werent really worth it.AnonymousJust deputize him and send him after all those drug cartels.  Its all good.  ;-)AnonymousReasoning and facts, from a troll? Thanks for the laugh CZ_1, I sure needed one.AnonymousTrue, too true  again my state CA beats TXBadmoodman  PALIN RESPONDS VIA BECK.With what appears to me to be a renewed threat of violence:  I hate violence. I hate war. Our children will not have peace if politicos just capitalize on this to succeed in portraying anyone as inciting terror and violence.Its barely literate, but what can it mean that children will not have peace if people are held morally responsible for consequences of their violent rhetoric? How can asking people to turn the volume down lead to an absence of peace?  Then this    According to Beck he wrote to her saying:    Sarah, as you know, peace is always the answer. I know you are feeling the same heat, if not much more on this.  I want you to know you have my full support.    He then encouraged her to get some protection because a attempt on you could bring the Republic down.Way to calm things down  by presaging a civil war based on an assassination attempt on Palin. It takes projection to an entirely new level.http://pulse.yahoo.com/_Z6VUJDXCSG26NM3KGUVEUN55PQAnyBased on the Liberal view of the world, he should have simply raised taxes on the top 2% of all earners by $27 billion.  That would show them.AnonymousI think that would be the LEAST of the problems for the good people of Texas.  As for not wanting it, I seriously think they would want it.  Heck, if some states can sell off their capitol buildings to raise money, why not start selling off some of the states that dont like being united?AnonymousWasnt it Beck who predicted that the left would resort to violence after losing the November midterms?AnonymousThe T on Perrys baseball cap should have the letter L for LOSER!Anonymouschanged your identity already did ya?AnonymousWell, damn. Isnt it obvious? They need to lower taxes to fill the gap! In fact, to run a surplus they need to start giving away money and pay to give it away as well. And being good right wing conservative teabaggers, they will take no money from the Federal Government as well.AnonymousYep, and Texas would have more revenue to promote the welfare of their State. Instead of promoting the welfare for the wealthiest Texans. Idiot!http://thebookofcletis.blogspot.com/CletisPerry, like many Republican officials of our time, does have an excess. Unfortunately, it is only an excess of hubris, and that will cook your ass every time.AnonymousYa got any other solutions?  Anything?  Anything at all?  Any?AnonymousWow, do these characters actually think that they are that important?  Talk about delusional.AnonymousBut depicting the poisoning of Nancy Pelosi is quite peaceful.Hey, Glenn Beck! Who was the moron stoking those flames? Do we have a video?Mucking forons.Pilotsharkwho does nothing for the state.AnonymousBeck thinks that someone attempting to kill Palin would bring the republic down? What is so special about Palin? She isnt a Govener or anything else, she has no position with the government at all. If Palin died, for any reason, the Republic wouldnt even notice.Anonymous[head slap, face palm] Of course!  Lower taxes!  How could I have forgotten the one size solution to all problems!  Lets see, Texas has zero state income tax, so what other taxes can we cut?   Anything?http://medjhiesco.wordpress.com/HoodathunkIm certain all Texans are proud of their Governor for keeping them free of the leftists ebil of huge budget deficits.  snickerAnonymousDid you mean moron, or Mormon?AnonymousWell would you rather tax billionaires that barely pay any taxes at all at 16  17% or remove food from Americas starving children and families that dont have jobs because the Republicans bankrupted all of us?Will you stand beside your kid when you are struggling and try to tell them how deserving billionaires are so they dont get to eat tonight or they have to move out of their home?Why does the right idolize billionaires over American families that cant feed their kids or put a roof over their heads?You are so brainwashed the right has you thinking its okay to remove our income and give it to rich people while we have millions of struggling American families?  Gawd, get a brain will ya.Austininc4Beck  and Palin  both need protection.  Protection  from all those  MORONS  they have been stroking   for   the past two years.    They created   these  Reichwing   Morons,  now they cant  control them.AnonymousThis woman reminds me a lot of Sarah Palin. It doesnt matter that someone else found a way to pay for these 98 people to get their transplants. She has dug in her heels as if it is a personal matter and no amount of pleadng can change her mind. She has done it with other issues  SB 1070 comes to mind. She is truly a Republicant.AnonymousOMG nurtured that possum! Im falling down laughing! Thats some good stuffAnonymousAccording to trickle  down economics with no state income tax Texas should be rolling in extra cash.  What could possibly have gone wrong?AnonymousDamn those number crunchers from the Government! /snarkhttp://www.thezxbecollection.comzxbeBased upon the Conservative view of the world if we lower taxes to zero, wed have infinite revenue.PilotsharkLOL well the T is just Texas way of spelling Loser.AnonymousWelib. For the rabid right there is no choice. Remove food from Americas starving children is the only way to go, of course. And remove their health care on top of it.AnonymousThere are consequences to public policy decisions. When, as conservatives members of a legislature refuse to raise revenue by way of taxes than deficts are what results. Which suits conservatives just fine because they can then claim that cuts are needed to balance out of control budgets. And so on and so on. They want to destroy all our social bonds except for one: the one where we all sell each other endless amounts of crap, without government interference, of course!AnonymousWhy state facts when republicans can lie like dogs on a rug and no one NO ONE WILL CHALLENGE themEVEN WHEN THEY KNOW THE FACTS!!! Hey Luntz types a lie it will be spreaded faster than the spped of light faux beck limbaugh then CNN all withoiut challene.Are we sick of this BS yet????http://pulse.yahoo.com/_BQAYKGCPCHEEWRBWHWBJN7C6AETrooperYou know that FACTS have a liberal biasread em and weep Rick!1.

Im sure youve all heard it before.Never let the facts get in the way of a good story. h/t to the late great Molly Ivins.The point iswhen Christian Evangelical Teabag/GOP Goobers of hate and hypocrisy dont have the facts on their side?  No worries. They have a three part plan for just such occasions direct from the play book of Karl Rove.First: Theyll just jerk their desired reality or Their Truth out of their stinking nether regions at random and when it suites their needs. Never mind the actual facts on the ground. Thats part one.Part two is to stick to their story long enough for Fox and Clear Channel to breathlessly spew the lie as Truth news cycle after news cycle after news cycle for all their Sheep to digest.  Perry knows he can make stuff up.  He knows no one is going to call him on it.  No one is going to say You Lie! No. Instead, hell be rewarded for his deception and featured on say Fox and Friends or some other Fox Flying Monkey show to double down on the BS.By this time, some other distraction has come along and Perry gets to return home to Austin to a heros welcome from his fellow Teabag/GOP Secessionist thugs who slap him on the back for getting one over on everyone  and- fully willing and able to make up more bat-crap crazy lies all over again.Thats part three.Welcome to todays Christian Evangelical Teabag/GOP Goober world.http://pulse.yahoo.com/_2246Y2NDHG7BYZF5Y3VIEKFA4UWILLIEwhen it comes to deficitsyou cant mess with texasEl BruceWingnuts are almost as good at math as they are at law, history, economics or critical thinking.https://me.yahoo.com/a/yEaYBB431esiJnCqKlPRmU4VW.FQZ_Pv#adb41sandy hSo hes standing by his earlier statement even as he contemplates denying transplants to sick people just like that one-woman death panel Jan Brewer?

She was a rabid Giants fan, and I was trying to convince her that she could enjoy the Series for a while longer if the Angels won.I felt pretty bad after the Angels won 2 straight. I had been hoping that the Giants would win so she could enjoy some hometown pride. Not only did they win, they did it without Bonds, so my hats off to them.AnonymousThere was a 2008 political cartoon that went something like this:Ronald Reagan, fiscal conservative: big deficit.George H.

But you know what the trolls themselves sayif he cant go out and work for himself then he deserves to starve. ;-)http://twitter.com/EzluchAria KAnd lets not forget that 25% of all Texans do NOT have health insurance coverage. The national average is 17%.http://twitter.com/EzluchAria KNo, no, consider the last time Republicans, mainly Reagan, handled the recession (early 80s), it took them 7 full years to bring the unemployment down to high 5%. They didnt even have to deal with the worst global financial meltdown to begin with.http://www.yuregininsesi.comyuregininsesiSurprise, surprise! Texas is the US equivalent to Ireland.
