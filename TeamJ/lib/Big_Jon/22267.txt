Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head and a number of others were hurt or killed following the incident."Gabby Giffords was a friend of mine," said Obama during a televised news conference. "She is not only an extraordinary public servant, but she is also somebody who is warm and caring. She is well-liked by her colleagues and well-liked by her constituents."The president added, "I know Gabby is as tough as they come and I am hopeful that she is going to pull through... Our hearts go out to the family members of those who have been slain."The White House issued the following statement on Saturday:This morning, in an unspeakable tragedy, a number of Americans were shot in Tucson, Arizona, at a constituent meeting with Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.  And while we are continuing to receive information, we know that some have passed away, and that Representative Giffords is gravely wounded. We do not yet have all the answers.  What we do know is that such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society.  I ask all Americans to join me and Michelle in keeping Representative Giffords, the victims of this tragedy, and their families in our prayers.WATCH:        Get HuffPost Politics On        Twitter and Facebook!

From what we know, Jared Loughman's acts were those of a madman divorced from reality, let alone from public debate. But that doesn't make Tucson politically meaningless. The president need not, and should not, speak of ideas or programs or parties. What he can speak about, and what perhaps he will speak about, is civility.

I was disappointed that president Obama did not make that point in his address yesterday. I hoped after sending out his prayers and message of hope. He would have said that we need to have a conversation about hate and racism in America.All of the politicians seem to be making this personal when in fact they should be talking about taking responsibility for their actions, and talking about our racial divide and the hatred running throughout American society. President Obama likes to use the term " a teachable moment" well this is one of them, lets not blow it on the blame game.            p456: I agree with sheriff Dupnik and I applaud him forhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/p456/obama-gabrielle-giffords-_n_806263_73282993.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itbobclapp1936                                                    7 hours ago (1:31 PM)                        24 Fans                While I completely agree with OBAMA'S super comment, it is terribly incomplete and hypocritical.

If Obama forcefully pursues justice against all involved in both inciting acts of violenmce and actually pulling the trigger then this means he will have to have Sarah Palin arrested and put on trial for several federal crimes some of which stem from the patriot act.This may sound drastic but it is a far more reasonable course of action than seeing our culture revert to a wild west vigilante mentality where mob rule replaces our constitutional based system of justice. Please understand that Obama is legally not permitted to make himself the judge here. His thoughts regarding Palin's guilt or innocence are to be determined by a jury in Tuscon. Obama's job is to ensure that justice is done.Imagine for a minute if the vicitms had been black. Then we all know damn well that he would be all over this. Though race or sexual orientation were not a factor, todays shootings were hate crimes and acts of terror that could reasonably expected to follow from Palin' actions and there is no reasonable exuse to not bring her to justice.

Public frustrations is palpable. Blogs with first-hand experience or over-the-top commentary helps disseminate how corrupt the whole system is .... which it is!Public for its part is pampered, with leaders of each group preaching (sloganeering) how someone else is abusing the system and corrupting it. Yet no one has the courage to tell (and if necessary prosecute) individuals corrupting the system; when they have crossed the line. Unfortunately there is little prosecution; and even less appropriate punishment and disgorgement of wealth. So many million of dollars are at stake or some stakeholders are so pampered into a belief that they are 'entitled to the ill-gotten' benefits or wealth.  Some of these crooks are even idealized as great role models, till they fall-off their pedestals.  Time is come for this balanced Congress and Executive to present a package that will revamp the whole system and that ALL  AMERICANS will / can embrace in an awakening and a shared sacrifice. America is trying to invent a social system and society that took 5000 years of MANY civilizations all over the world to develop and finesse. Yet, we THINK / are experimenting with a new system, thatWithin one generation Using a 'responsible-free mobile-society' model and Govt as 'first line of support' with Yet-to-be-born Americans paying the bills.
