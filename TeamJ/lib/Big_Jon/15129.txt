Every Saturday, between now and the 2012 general election, I intend to put a few moments aside to write just a bit about Presidential politics and the developments of the race. While I am only an amateur pundit and writer, I think it will be interesting to look back on my thoughts every week, several years in the future.Not too much happened on the Presidential front this week. I could talk about various new potential Republican candidates and polls in New Hampshire, and what it might mean for the race, and especially for my preferred candidate Mitt Romney. Congress came into session this week, and a new Republican majority is in place in the House of Representatives. That will mean a lot in regards to our federal government in the next couple of years.But all of this is going to have to wait, at least for a week. The shocking news today out of Tuscon, Arizona surpasses all, and is going to be the biggest story in the country for quite some time.At the time of this posting, we do not know all the details. Arizona Democrat Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is said to be alive and undergoing surgery, but in critical condition. Previously, reports had her murdered, which would have made her the first female American political figure to ever be assassinated. The fact that the Congresswoman is Jewish, as I am, also is something that is weighing heavily on me, as I consider what kind of person might be responsible for such a cowardly act. A federal judge is now also reported shot in the attack. Several others, including members of the Congresswomans staff have been wounded or killed in this tragic act of violence.We will be hearing much in the days ahead about the horrific event, the victims, the suspect or suspects, and the motive. Fingers will be pointed, rhetoric will be heated, and many will sadly attempt to garner political advantage over a crisis situation.I believe all of us should at this time just pray for the recovery of the Congresswoman, the other victims, and also for our country.Coreyhttp://cgpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/01/race-for-white-house-2012.htmlShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Updates, WomenCorey's Weekly Political Post....1/8/11, Corey@PoliticalDog101, Presidential politics and the developments of the raceRead moreTucson shooting Update .18 shot.6 Dead including a US Federal Judge, and 9 year oldRep Giffords is alive.January 8, 2011jamesb10111 comments(Reuters Photo )From an earlier Press conference..18 Shot6 DOAsthe last one died in University Medical CenterUS Federal Judge John Roll is among the deceasedThe suspect is 22 Year old Jared LoughnerA white maleCongresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is out of surgery for a gun shot wound to the head that passed thru.She is sedated.The Hospital will wait 24 hoursBut believes she has a good chance for recovery.The Investigation is being handled by the Pima County Sheriffs Department and the FBI.***From DSD..[Major and minor updates from Arizona:]Arizona Daily Star | Posted: Saturday, January 8, 2011 11:16 am [Mountain Standard Time](someemphasis added by me)U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot point blank in the head on Saturday in a shooting at a northwest side grocery store this morning, but surgeons say they are very optimistic about her recovery.Meanwhile, Gov. Jan Brewers office is confirming federal judge John Roll[nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in 1991 by Pres. Geo. H.W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1991] was among the dead.Sheriffs authorities said there were six dead, including a child, as well as 18 wounded.Giffords, who is in critical condition, is out of surgery at University Medical Center, said Dr. Peter Rhee at University Medical Center.The shooting occurred at a Safeway supermarket where Giffords was holding one of her regular Congress on Your Corner events, which allows her to speak directly with constituents in her district.The gunman has been identified as 22-year-old Jared Loughner, according to the Associated Press.Giffords has held several events since first taking office in January 2007. At one such event in 2009, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell on the supermarket floor.This was her first event since her re-election to a third term in November.Giffords, 40, was talking to a couple in the store when a gunman rushed her, shouting as he fired his weapon.The gunman fired at people in line and got within 4 to 5 feet of the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a former Tucson newspaper executive who is now on her staff.The gunman fired at Giffords then ran out, continuing to shoot.Members of Giffords staff were among the wounded. District director Ron Barber remained in surgery, but his life was not expected to be in danger.Individuals at the event tackled the man after the shooting, said Pima County Sheriffs Department Bureau Chief Richard Kastigar.Last March, Giffords Tucson office was vandalized after the House vote overhauling the nations health care system.Giffords had just started the congressional session. She tweeted welcomes to new Republican congressman David Schweikert and had just sponsored legislation, with Republican Congressman Ron Paul, to cut congressional salaries.U.S. Congressman Raul Grijalva, Giffords seatmate from Southern Arizona, said, Its horrific. Its heartbreaking. Its very frightening. I hope she comes out of it. This is not what public service is all about.The heated rhetoric and civil discord creates an environment for something like this to happen.He lamented a series of incidents demonstrating the buildup that leads to something like this, including envelope of white powder sent to his Tucson office as well as a shot fired at his Yuma office.Gabbys contributions were all in the future. Her career was all in the future.Washington D.C. authorities have spoken with his staff to stay put.His family in Tucson now has security, but he doesnt know yet whether he will have a secret service detail in the future.***Backround from DSD.The gunman, who may have come from inside the Safeway, walked up and shot Giffords in the head first.Giffordss Tuscon constituency office was vandalised last March after she voted in favour of Barack Obamas controversial health bill, which has been bitterly opposed by the American right. Giffords had been named as a political campaign target for conservatives in Novembers elections by former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin for her strong support of Obamas reforms. Palin had published a target map on her website using images of gun sights to identify 20 House Democrats, including Giffords, for backing the new health care law. At an event in 2009 which was similar to the one Giffords was holding today, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell to the supermarket floor.Giffords, who was born in Tucson and has two children, took office in January 2007 supporting immigration control, embryonic stem-cell research and the right to abortion. While the motive for todays shooting was not immediately clear, Giffords was one of 10 Democrat members of Congress who were the subject of harassment over their support for the healthcare overhaul. Although a Democrat, Giffords was a strong supporter of the right to bear arms and was re-elected to her third term last November in congressional elections, edging out the Tea Party favourite Jesse Kelly.http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/08/gabrielle-giffords-shot-tucson-arizonaMore Backround for TPL and Daniel G..Quote by Timothy Peter Leal:She married Cmdr.

Donald L. Carcieri, had issued to crack down on illegal immigration.To cheers, Governor Chafee officially rescinded the edict that he termed an agent of divisiveness, incivility and distrust among the states citizens. He did so in a packed room at the International Institute of Rhode Island, a nonprofit agency that assists immigrants and refugees.Chafee said he was turning back the clock to March 26, 2008, the day before Carcieri issued his Illegal Immigration Control Order. Carcieri said then that he intended to curb what he termed an epidemic, the costly flow of illegal immigrants. The order sparked numerous protests and spread fear in the immigrant community.Today, we are living up to those standards established by Roger Williams when he came here in 1636, Chafee said, standards of welcome, tolerance, personal rights and the broadest freedoms in the world.The rescission lifts a requirement that state agencies and state vendors screen employees through the federal E-Verify system. Critics say E-Verify is prone to inaccuracy.Chafee also clarified that he is also directing state police Col. Brendan P. Doherty to end the so-called 287(g) agreement between state police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Carcieris order directed state police to pursue the agreement. It led to four troopers being deputized with immigration-enforcement powers.Chafee cleared up confusion left after one of his senior staff members said Tuesday night that the rescission would leave the 287(g) agreement in place, and that whether the governor would choose to terminate the agreement is a different question. Thats not whats on the table  for right now. That is an issue that will be addressed in due course.Asked if the memorandum of understanding with ICE will be revoked, Chafee replied, Thats correct. Thats correct. He added, We will continue to work with all the immigrant communities and state police to make sure were enforcing the laws to the best of our ability, but not doing immigration and customs work.Doherty said later, I thought the [287(g)] process was working well. Reasonable minds may differ, but he is the governor.He added, We will continue to communicate and cooperate with ICE on matters of mutual concern and make sure the people of Rhode Island are safe in a variety of ways.Chafee said the real answer to curbing illegal immigration is through federal immigration reform. He pledged to push for that through the National Governors Association to get our immigrant community  some of whom are living in the shadows  out of the shadows.Chafees repeal, accomplished through an executive order terminating [the] illegal immigration control order, drew immediate praise.But some attending the ceremony raised concerns that new Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartins stated intent to enter a federal Secure Communities initiative could overshadow Chafees repeal of the executive order.The initiative would allow law-enforcement officers to fingerprint people under arrest and have them automatically checked against an immigration databasehttp://www.projo.com/news/content/CHAFEE_RESCINDS_ORDER_01-06-11_8GLQJOO_v15.34cdb6.htmlShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updatesimmigration, RI Gove Lincoln Chaffe, Illegal Immigration Control Order -repealedRead moreArizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords among 12 shot at Tucson grocery.January 8, 2011jamesb10147 commentsRepresentative Giffords at an event in October.Congresswoman Giffords Shot in TucsonCondition of Rep.

Giffords critically wounded, 6 others shot at Tucson rally Arizona Daily Star | Posted: Saturday, January 8, 2011 11:16 am [PST]Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot in Tucson this morning after a public event outside a Safeway grocery store.Some national media are reporting that she was killed, but a spokeman for her office said after noon today that Giffords was in surgery. The reports that the congreswoman has died are not accurate shes in surgery, CJ Karamargin told the Star this afternoon.National Public Radio reports she was shot in the head.The Democrat, who was re-elected to her third term in November, was hosting a Congress on Your Corner event at the Safeway in northwest Tucson when a gunman ran up and started shooting, according to Peter Michaels, news director of Arizona Public Media, NPR reported.At least 10 other people, including members of her staff, were hurt. Giffords was transported to University Medical Center. Her condition was not immediately known.Sheriffs bureau chief Rick Kastigar said 12 people were wounded some of them greatly. Ten people were transported to hospital.The lone gunman is reportedly in custody.Kristin Ducat, a veterinary technician whose office, Northwest Pet Clinic sits across Ina Road from Safeway, said she heard about 15 rapid gunshots.It sounded like an automatic, she said.She and her coworkers ran to the front glass door after the gunshots.She said they saw shoppers and workers to the nearby Beyond Bread. The clinic shut down but had reopened by noon.Safeway employees were still being kept in the grocery store as of 12:30 p.m.http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_88b4b436-1b53-11e0-8354-001cc4c002e0.htmlShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Other Things, Politics, Updates, WomenBreaking News, Congresswoman Giffords Shot in Tucson, Politician shot, Rep.

Now something has changed. Congressional Democrats are challenging Republicans, daring them to come out against the bills more popular provisions. The Democratic National Committee is aggressively distributing talking points. According to an account in theNew York Times, Democrats will soon have a campaign-style war room for making their case. Its almost as if the the Democrats want this fight now.Of course, they may not have a choice. Republicans have made repeal a top priority, so the fight is going to take place whether or not Democrats want it. But I think it also reflects a changing dynamic, as well. According toGreg Sargent, who was among the first to spot the shift, House Democrats in particular are aware of the opportunity they missed last year, while the party and most of its leaders were trying so hard to save endangered incumbents. They think theyre in a stronger position now, since people are starting to see the laws benefits and repeal will mean changing an increasingly favorable status quo.It also helps that the Republicans finally have to do some governing. And governing requires the kind of specifics Republicans could avoid when they were merely campaigning to win office..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, UpdatesCongress, Democrats, House Democrats, Politics, President Obama, Republicans/GOP, The Democrats losing the House, White HouseRead moreLadies and Gentleman we have a Conservative Civil War at CPACJanuary 8, 2011jamesb1013 commentsThis from PoliticoResentment at Grover Norquist (left) and David Keene threatens to undermine CPAC.(AP Photos)A conservative civil war over CPACThe proximate cause of the explosion is the inclusion in CPAC of the combative gay conservative group GOProud. But if the sheer intensity of the quarrel seems disproportionate to that seemingly straightforward dispute, thats because its also deeply personal. Long-simmering resentment of two of the leading figures on the economic right, American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene  who runs the event  and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, who has long been involved in planning it, has morphed into a conflict that carries the special bitterness of a civil war.There are a lot of conservatives who see a larger problem with Grover Norquist and David Keene, and theyve decided to fight it out and CPAC is a proxy for that, said Erick Erickson, the publisher of RedState.org, who said he wont be participating in the conference because he wants to stay out of the conflict. The underlying question is whether the conservative movement still has strong planks for social conservatism and national security conservatism. But it has also become very personal.If youve been around this town for a long time, as I have youve got people who disagree with you substantively and youve got people who dont like you and if you hang around long enough, their numbers increase, said Keene, who dismissed many of the attacks as residing in the fever swamps of the website WorldNetDaily.Its no secret that some social conservatives are very upset at the idea that there would be any participation by any organization thats gay, but over the course of the 37 or 38 years that CPACs been in existence weve had all kinds of people suggest that other people ought to be tossed out, he said. Our mission is once a year to allow social, economic, and national security conservatives to come together.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesConservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, David Keene, GOProud, Grover Norquist, Libertarian, Republicans/GOP, Social Conservatives, the 'Right'Read morePresident Obamas Approval 1/8/11..January 8, 2011jamesb1011 commentPresident Obamas Poll numbers..From Realclearpolitics.

Mr. Hornes name came up more than once, and not in a flattering light.It was Mr. Horne, as the states superintendent of public instruction, who wrote a law aimed at challenging Tucsons ethnic-studies program. The Legislature passed the measure last spring, and Gov.Jan Brewer signed it into law in May amid the fierce protests raging over the statesimmigrationcrackdown.The state, which includes some Mexican-American studies in its official curriculum, sees the classes as less about educating students than creating future activists.In Mr. Acostas literature class, students were clearly concerned. They asked if their graduation was at risk. They asked if they were considered terrorists because Mr. Horne described them as wanting to topple the government. They asked how they could protest the decision.Then, one young woman asked Mr. Acosta how he was holding up.They wrote a state law to snuff this program out, just us little Chicanitos, he said, wiping away tears. The idea of losing this is emotional.At a recent news conference, Mr. Horne took pains to describe his attack on Tucsons Mexican-American studies program as one rooted in good faith. He said he had been studying Spanish for several years and had learned enough to read Mexican history books in Spanish and to give interviews on Univision and Telemundo, two Spanish-language broadcasters.Asked whether he felt he was being likened toBull Connor, the Alabama police commissioner who became a symbol of bigotry in the 1960s, Mr. Horne described how he had participated in the March on Washington in 1963 as a young high school graduate. He said of his critics: They are the Bull Connors. They are the ones resegregating.Mr. Hornes battle with Tucson over ethnic studies dates to 2007, whenDolores Huerta, co-founder of theUnited Farm Workers, told high school students there in a speech that Republicans hated Latinos. Mr. Horne, a Republican, sent a top aide, Margaret Garcia Dugan, to the school to present a different perspective. He was infuriated when some students turned their backs and raised their fists in the air..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesArizona Mexican-American studies classes, Latino's, Rulled illigal, Tucson Ethnic studies classesRead moreThe US will offer Pakistan more military aid with the understanding that they have to step up against the TalibanJanuary 8, 2011jamesb1013 commentsAs the US/NATO effort intensifies against the strongholds of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The US is not pleased with the actions of the Pakistani military. With the countrys Intelligence service divided and helping both the US effort and seeking to work with and control part of the Taliban effort there is a problemThe US has been steadily pushing the Pakistani government for more action to take away its refuge for Taliban action s in Afghanistan ..The administration has decided to ramp up military aid to Pakistan in order for them to assume a more active role ..Vice President Biden will bring this message and ask for a wish list next week in a trip to the country..Several things come to this Dogs mind upon hearing this.I am not surprised by this action.Which reinforces my preaching that the US isnt leaving the region anytime soon.In fact as I have pointed out things are escalating in the war.While Pakistan has had to divert attention from the war to handle the recent floodsThe US/NATO effort presses on.Remember that $30 Billion Gates said was chopped of the war effort that I posted yesterday?Ill bet it ends up going to the Pakistani military.Either the whole thingOra good part of itNowhere is India mentioned in the linked Washington Post piece..Hummm?I dont suppose India is gonna be very happy with the US rearming Indias nuclear traditional adversary..Oh, yea Budget cuts and debt ceilings?You ARE joking right?Pakistan has complained in the past that promised U.S. aid, currently projected to total more than $3 billion in 2011, has been slow to arrive and that requests for helicopters and other military equipment have remained unfulfilled.Beginning with Bidens visit, the time may be ripe for a frank exchange of views and priorities between the two sides, another administration official said. The Pakistanis understand that Afghanistan-Pakistan has become the single most important foreign policy issue to the United States, and their cachet has gone up. But they also realize that they may have reached the point of maximum leverage, this official said, and things about their region are going to change one way or the other in the near future, as Congress and the American public grow increasingly disillusioned with the war and a timeline for military withdrawal is set.Something is going to give, he said. There is going to be an end-game scenario and theyre trying to guess where were heading.On intelligence, the administration plans to address Pakistans complaints that the Americans have not established enough outposts on the Afghan side of the border to stop insurgent infiltration, while pressing the Pakistanis to allow U.S. and Afghan officials to staff border coordination centers inside Pakistan itself.The intelligence coordination is part of an effort to build political, trade and security links between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a way of assuaging Pakistans fears thatIndia, its traditional adversary, is building its own influence in Afghanistan. We think theres a lot of room for improvement on that front, the senior official said..MoreObama and his senior staff have had to beat down numerous requests by in-theater military staff to take the war on to Pakistan itself in cross border raids..
