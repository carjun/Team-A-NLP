The new GOP majority in the House of Representatives will wage a campaign to disable health reform, financial regulation, and the EPA; stonewall executive and judicial appointments; slash nondefense discretionary spending (thus undermining the economic recovery); gut Social Security and Medicare; and launch investigations into every possible White House indiscretionpotentially leading to a vote for impeachment. Democrats only recourse will be to practice what Howard Dean famously derided as damage controlto abandon hope for big progressive accomplishments and hunker down until 2012, like the Clinton administration did after the Gingrich Revolution, defending government from the worst excesses of those who would like to eliminate it altogether.Theres only one problem with this scenario: the time-frame. Politicos and pundits are used to thinking in two-year cycles, and its easy to convince oneself that, in 2012, Obama will be able to capitalize on an improved economy, favorable voter-turnout patterns, and aweak GOP presidential field in order to sweep into office with a renewed mandate. But that misses a big part of the picture. Even if Obama wins reelection by a comfortable margin, its most likely that the House will remain in Republican hands and Democrats will lose seats in, and perhaps control of, the Senateand beyond that, Republicans will probably do fairly well in 2014. In other words, we could be looking not at two years of damage control, but sixMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesDemocrats, Democrats regaining control of Congress, House reapportionment of seats, The House, The SenateRead moreHonorable Woman Becomes Your Honor.January 9, 2011jamesb101No commentsFrom Jezebel[Columbus, Ohio, January 8: Ohio Gov.

Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and several of her staffers.Formal charges are expected this afternoon, Mueller told reporters, though he said its still unclear when Loughner will first appear in court.Mueller said he was not going to preclude charges under domestic terrorism statutes as the investigation continues, and that investigation will focus in part on Loughners possible connections to white supremacist groups..Note..This Dog hopes that the case goes to the State courts alsoAnd that State prosecutors get the first try at the case.We must not let the death of the one Federal Judge however tragic overshadow the fact that 6 others died in the shooting,including a childShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesArizona State Prosecutors, FBI Director Mueller, Federal domestic terrorism charges, Federal Homicide/Assault Charges, Going Federal, Pima County Prosecutors, Pima County Sheriff, Satate Assault Charges, State Homicide Charges, The FBI, The US attorney for Arizona, Tucson District AttorneyRead morePima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the DayJanuary 9, 2011jamesb10113 commentsPima County SheriffClarence W.

Dupnik, who is overseeing the investigation of Saturdays mass shooting that critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D), became an overnight sensation with his remarks that the vitriol in todays political discourse contributed to the incident and that Arizona has become a mecca for prejudice and bigotry.Dupniks name wasa top search term on Twitter Saturday night, with many of the tweets thanking him for his candor, and overnight,a Facebook page titled Clarence Dupnik is my Hero sprung up.In a news conference Saturday evening, Dupnik condemned the atmosphere of hatred and bigotry that he said has gripped the nation and suggested that the 22-year-old suspect being held in the shooting was mentally ill and therefore more susceptible to overheated messages in the media.Theres reason to believe that this individual may have a mental issue. And I think people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible to vitriol, he said during his televised remarks. People tend to pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that. That may be free speech, but its not without consequences.His remarks especially resonated with liberals, who even before the name of the suspect was released suggested that the shooter may have had been incited by the tea party. There is no indication that the suspect, Jared Lee Lougner, identified with the tea party or was politically conservative. During the campaign, liberal pundits and politicians asserted that the sometimes militant language some conservative politicians used could incite violence..MoreOf course the knuckle head GOP Senator Kyl really doesnt get it..Kyl: Arizona Sheriffs Remarks InappropriateBrian Beutler | January 9, 2011, 11:50AMSen.

Donald L. Carcieri, had issued to crack down on illegal immigration.To cheers, Governor Chafee officially rescinded the edict that he termed an agent of divisiveness, incivility and distrust among the states citizens. He did so in a packed room at the International Institute of Rhode Island, a nonprofit agency that assists immigrants and refugees.Chafee said he was turning back the clock to March 26, 2008, the day before Carcieri issued his Illegal Immigration Control Order. Carcieri said then that he intended to curb what he termed an epidemic, the costly flow of illegal immigrants. The order sparked numerous protests and spread fear in the immigrant community.Today, we are living up to those standards established by Roger Williams when he came here in 1636, Chafee said, standards of welcome, tolerance, personal rights and the broadest freedoms in the world.The rescission lifts a requirement that state agencies and state vendors screen employees through the federal E-Verify system. Critics say E-Verify is prone to inaccuracy.Chafee also clarified that he is also directing state police Col. Brendan P. Doherty to end the so-called 287(g) agreement between state police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Carcieris order directed state police to pursue the agreement. It led to four troopers being deputized with immigration-enforcement powers.Chafee cleared up confusion left after one of his senior staff members said Tuesday night that the rescission would leave the 287(g) agreement in place, and that whether the governor would choose to terminate the agreement is a different question. Thats not whats on the table  for right now. That is an issue that will be addressed in due course.Asked if the memorandum of understanding with ICE will be revoked, Chafee replied, Thats correct. Thats correct. He added, We will continue to work with all the immigrant communities and state police to make sure were enforcing the laws to the best of our ability, but not doing immigration and customs work.Doherty said later, I thought the [287(g)] process was working well. Reasonable minds may differ, but he is the governor.He added, We will continue to communicate and cooperate with ICE on matters of mutual concern and make sure the people of Rhode Island are safe in a variety of ways.Chafee said the real answer to curbing illegal immigration is through federal immigration reform. He pledged to push for that through the National Governors Association to get our immigrant community  some of whom are living in the shadows  out of the shadows.Chafees repeal, accomplished through an executive order terminating [the] illegal immigration control order, drew immediate praise.But some attending the ceremony raised concerns that new Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartins stated intent to enter a federal Secure Communities initiative could overshadow Chafees repeal of the executive order.The initiative would allow law-enforcement officers to fingerprint people under arrest and have them automatically checked against an immigration databasehttp://www.projo.com/news/content/CHAFEE_RESCINDS_ORDER_01-06-11_8GLQJOO_v15.34cdb6.htmlShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updatesimmigration, RI Gove Lincoln Chaffe, Illegal Immigration Control Order -repealedRead morePage 1 of 114123...114Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
