Some articles can be tagged for speedy deletion or marked as an article for deletion.[edit] DatesIt is useful to add the date of the request (or sometimes, a bot will assist by doing it automatically) by appending |date=month year to the template code, like this: {{Unreferenced|date=January 2011}} to produce this:This article does not cite any references or sources.Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources.

For WikiProject Connecticut, see WP:CONN.This page is a how-to guide detailing a practice or process on the English Wikipedia.Shortcuts:WP:CITETWP:CITWP:CTSee also: WP:Template messages/Cleanup/Verifiability and sources for cleanup request templates, such as "citation needed" and many more.See also: Handy tools for making references in cite templates: MakeRef, Diberri's template filler, WP:RefToolbarCitation templates are used to format citations in a consistent way. The use of citation templates is neither encouraged nor discouraged. Templates may be used or removed at the discretion of individual editors, subject to agreement with other editors on the article. Because templates can be contentious, editors should not add citation templates, or change an article with a consistent citation format to another, without gaining consensus. The various citation templates below may be freely mixed, since they all produce a similar format.[edit] Use in footnotesFor a citation to appear in a footnote, it needs to be enclosed in "ref" tags. You can add these by typing <ref> at the front of the citation and </ref> at the end. Alternatively you may notice above the edit box there is a row of "markup" formatting buttons which include a <ref></ref> button to the right - if you highlight your whole citation and then click this markup button, it will automatically enclose your citation in ref tags (i.e. <ref>citation</ref>).Note, if this is a new page or if there are not already references previously cited, it is necessary to create a "References" section near the end of the page (see MOS:APPENDIX), thus:== References ==<references />or== References =={{Reflist}}See: Wikipedia style guideline on use of footnotes for more details.[edit] Using the same footnote multiple timesOptionally, one may add the name attribute by using <ref name=name>details of the citation</ref>. Thereafter, the same footnote may be used multiple times by adding <ref name=name/>. Note that named references begin with <ref instead of the usual <ref>. For detailed examples, see WP:REFNAME.[edit] Using multiple pages from the same sourceWhen an article cites many different pages from the same source, most Wikipedia editors have chosen to use shortened footnotes (see WP:CITESHORT). An alternative method is to use the template {{rp}}.[edit] Creating links to citationsWikilinks to citation templates can be created using the templates {{harv}}, {{harvnb}}, {{harvtxt}}, {{sfn}}, etc. For example this "Mumford 1999" links to a citation template below. This is of particular interest for inline citations using parenthetical referencing or when using shortened footnotes.[1] (See the examples below or wikilinks to full references)[edit] Using commas rather than periods{{Citation}} creates a citation in the same format as most of the {{Cite ... }} templates, except that the periods are replaced with commas and there is no final period. A complete list of templates that are mimicked by {{citation}} can be found at {{citation/core}}. The parameters separator= and postscript= (available for most templates) can also be used to affect the punctuation.[edit] ExamplesSee also Category: Citation templates Below are examples of how to use various templates to cite a book, encyclopedia, journal, website, comic strip, video and editorial comics, etc.For full description of a template and the parameters which can be used with it  click the template name (e.g. {{Citation}} or {{Cite xxxx}}) in the "template (required)" column of the table below.Required field(s) are indicated in boldCopy and paste the text under "common usage" to use the template.Following each example is the resulting article text.For a list of tools that can help create some of the templates below, see: Wikipedia:Citation tools.Citations are commonly embedded in reference templates.
