Authorities announced today that the Los Angeles Police Department recognized two of the suspects on the tapes, evidence that detectives have described as some of the most "disturbing" images they've ever seen. The suspects have not been identified to the public, but according to police, the individuals were investigated in 2007 and 2009, which resulted in one sexual assault conviction. Other cases involving these two suspects involved neglect, fiduciary crimes and sexual assault, but no videos. -----The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Special Victims Bureau is looking for at least two more men in the brutal attacks on as many as ten disabled women, many of whom appear to be patients at residential care facilities. According to Sgt. Daniel Scott, a package of 11 DVDs with more than 100 hours of video on them was left anonymously at the sheriff's office in March. Det. Ron Anderson, charged with viewing the material, quickly found that the material was like nothing he'd ever seen before. Read more: http://abcnews.go.com/US/assaults-disabled-women-caught...

I used to work in nursing homes as a CNA and I can tell you that 95% of the people in those facilities are covered and inspected by some sort of govt program/agency. For one, the govt inspectors are a joke because we go by our own rules 99% of the time and just switch out to official protocol when the announced inspectors visited. The problem is not so much as in private facilities but some of the people that work in those facilities and just like in any profession, you will attract your fair share of deviants trying to take advantage of the system. All evidence shows that these people knew what they were doing and were prepared for it. Every ill in the world cannot be the fault of the private sectorAlso I am sure this is an isolated incident cos in the 4yrs (worked in 4 facilities, 1 govt and 3 private) I worked in the profession, I never encountered abuse cases more sever than leaving a dirty brief on a residentPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCleita      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 08:15 PMResponse to Reply #2029.We don't have universal health care.

Led by Daniel Levinson, the inspector general of DHHS, federal investigators inspected and evaluated complaints from the nation's 15,000 nursing homes....snip...The results of this nationwide inspection found that 94 percent of for-profit facilities and 88 percent of nonprofit organizations received citations for non-compliance last year....snip...In most cases, violations cited by federal inspectors consisted of any combination of: Infected bed sores Malnutrition Medication mishaps Patient abuse (either psychological or physical) Patient neglectmore at http://www.nursing-home-abuse-news.com/html/nursing-hom... and http://www.nursing-home-abuse-news.com/html/links.html Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLe Taz Hot      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 05:57 AMResponse to Reply #2037.And my experience with nursing homesis exactly the opposite.  My Great Uncle went in to get PHYSICAL THERAPY.  Unfortunately, I came down with the flu right after that, came back 10 days later and I didn't even recognize him.  They put him on SEDATIVES.  How the hell you're supposed to get physical therapy on sedatives I have no idea.  If he would have gone home (as I urged) he would be alive today.  I figure it took that nursing home about 30 days to kill him.  My Great Aunt paid in advance and, since they kept having to rush him to the hospital for one thing or another during that time, she had a refund of $1600.00 coming.  Took the sons a bitches almost a year to return that money and that was AFTER they had to deal with me.  And one more thing.  They took EVERYTHING that wasn't nailed down and no, it wasn't the residents because the residents are all SEDATED.  It was the fucking staff who couldn't care less about these patients.There's a reason these places are known as snake pits.  The reputation is well deserved.  If anyone is put in this position, do NOT allow your loved ones to stay in one of these places if you can possibly help it.

More of it comes from the families wanting the damned old people to hurry up and die before the money's all spent.  Those don't usually get investigated either.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topwhathehell      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 04:39 PMResponse to Original message4.Ugly, ugly stuff...Useless scum.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopMineralMan      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 04:39 PMResponse to Original message5.Never mind how sick the acts themselves are,how sick do you have to be to make video after video of them?
