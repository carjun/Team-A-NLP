Here is a man with obvious pride, who is able to confess to sin. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/20...   He confessed that his policies decimated Haiti.  It is a pity that none of the Republicans seriously, no exaggeration here, are able to do this.  It is a pity that the Pope cannot do this.  It is a sorrow that so many religious leaders cannot do this. It is a sorrow when anyone who leads cannot examine themselves and admit to failures in philosophy, policy, and action.  Bill Clinton, bless his soul, just demonstrated, clearly, that light can still reach the core of his being.  That I respect.Refresh|+4 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadI did not always agree with Bill Clinton but I always respected him, and absolutely no one can topsaracatMar-25-10 02:23 PM#1I agree, but I disagree...GlassunionMar-25-10 05:57 PM#4Interesting.

I do respect him in most avenues he has traveled. But"absolutely no one can top him in speech making or charisima."I think Regan was a bit better. I hated what he had to say most of the time, but man could that guy give a speech. There are a couple of his speeches that I really liked though. The Brandenburg Gate speech was one. The other was the one when the Space Shuttle exploded. I still get choked up when I hear him give that speech. It was honest and from the heart.Of course he did have an unfair advantage. He was an actor.   Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topsaracat      (1000+ posts)Fri Mar-26-10 03:31 AMResponse to Reply #45.Interesting. I am an actor as well as a director and I STILL find Clinton betterI never saw Reagan in person though and I must say Clinton is something else in person.He literally radiates charisma! One look and you know what all the women fell for! He has the "personal touch" as well. He can meet you once not see you for years and still greet you by name. The man is amazing.As for Reagan being an actor, the old saying is that if you are good, they should never catch you at it. And to me Reagan was grade B and very obviously "acting". But that is just my opinion. But i do agree he gave a decent speech and could be charming, not unlike Clinton. I just found Clinton more convincing.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topleftofcool      (1000+ posts)Thu Mar-25-10 02:37 PMResponse to Original message2.I love Bill and I am not at all surprised at thisPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topfrebrd      (1000+ posts)Thu Mar-25-10 04:10 PMResponse to Original message3.That's why he's the Big Dog!   eomPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topclarence swinney      (673 posts)Sat Mar-27-10 03:32 PMResponse to Original message6.I MISS BILLCLINTON PRAISE-WITH PLEASUREGDP--rose from 6300 to 11,600NATIONAL INCOME-5,000 to 8,000 Billion--took 20 years to grow 2500B before ClintonJOBS CREATED--over 22 million--record by farAVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS--$360 to $478AVERAGE WEEKLY HOURS WORKED--never hit 35.0--hit that mark 4 times in 80'sUNEMPLOYMENT--from 7.2% down down down to 3.9%WELFARE TO WORK11,533,710 on federal roll in 1996 and 3,880,321 in 2007.MINIMUM WAGE--$4.25 to $5.15MINORITIES--did exceedingly wellHOME OWNERSHIP--hit all time highDEFICIT--290 Billion to whoopee a SURPLUSDEBT----+28%---300% increase over prior12 yearsFEDERAL SPENDING--+28%---80% under Reagan- who da true conservative?DOW JONES AVERAGE--3,500 to 11,800 all it's history to get to 3500 and Clinton zooms it NASDAQ--700 to 5,000---all of it's history to get to 700 and Clinton zooms itVALUES INDEXES-- almost all bad went down--good went up in zoom zoom zoomFOREIGN AFFAIRS--Peace on Earth good will toward each other---Mark of a true Christian--what has Bush done to Peace on Earth?POPULARITY---highest poll ratings in history during peacetime in AFRICA, ASIA AND EUROPE even 98.5% in Moscow--left office with highest gallup rating since it was started in 1920's.STAND UP FOR JUSTICE--evil conservatives spent $110,000,000 on hearings and investigations and caught--- ONE--- very evil man who took a few plane rides to events.BOW YOUR HEADS--Thank you God for sending us a man of Bill Clinton's character, intelligence, knowledge of governance, ability to face up to crises without whimpering and a great leader of the world.THANK YOU GOD FOR THE GOOD TIMES THE CLINTON YEARS.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topclarence swinney      (673 posts)Sat Mar-27-10 03:34 PMResponse to Original message7.I MISS BILL IIComparing Democrats hero-CLINTONversus Republicans  hero--REAGAN-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.JOBSgrew by 43% more under Clinton.2.GDP---grew by 57% more under Clinton.3.DOWgrew by 700% more under Clinton..4.

Seldom have I seen anyone express, so movingly and sincerely, a genuine sense of compassion and sympathy to those who were hurting.I felt that he, not I, was the real pastor that day.We spent much of the afternoon talking about the Bible and what it days about Gods plan for our lives. It was a time of warm fellowship with man who has not always won approval from his fellow Christians but who has in his heart a desire to serve God.2. James McDougal On Larry KingBill Clintons charisma and caring for others is real. He has always been that way.3. Hillary ClintonHe is the most optimistic and gregarious person I have ever known or heard about. He likes people, all people, with no pettiness or preferences.4. John BrummittAuthor of High Wire and Editor of Republican Arkansas Democrat GazetteBill Clinton  is no phony. He truly cares for others. I will repeat it for the umpteenth time that Bill Clinton is no crook. You may disagree with him but he does not hold it against you. He has no interest in financial things.5. David Maraniss-Author of Clinton Biography First in His Class and reporter for Washington Post. Bill Clinton truly likes people and feels their pain .He doesnt know how to hate. He doesnt have a mean bone in his body.6.Jack NelsonWashington Bureau Chief for Los Angeles Times for decades I have known Bill Clinton since he came to Washington but I know of nothing he has done that impugns his integrity. His integrity is as good as Bob Doles. He has to compromise from his original position to get things done and his critics crucify him for doing what every president must do.7. James StewartAuthor of BloodsportThe Clintons commited no crime in their investment in the Whitewater land purchase.8. Pillsbury-Madison Soutra ReportPaid 3.4 million by RTC to investigate Madison Guaranty S&L. Their final report-We found no culpability on the part of the Clintons or the Rose Law Firm.9. James McDougal-President of the Whitewater Development CorporationThere was no crime committed in the purchase and selling of Whitewater property.10. Robert NovakI think Bill Clinton is terrific.11. Newt GingrichBill Clinton charms me. It takes me days of detoxification after a meeting with him.12. DAmatoChair of Senate Hearings on WhitewaterThere was no crime. Many allegations, insinuations and smears but no crime.13. Clarence W. Swinney-Producer of  Lifeaholics-Work For A Life Not Just A living-President Bill Clinton  is one of our all time great presidents. He is no whiner like President Bush. He is intelligent unlike President Reagan. He fights like a pit bull for his programs unlike President Truman. His record of success on his basic programs  is phenomenal. The right wing National Review wrote President Clinton absolutely ate the cake of the Republican Congress in 1997.14, Sarah McClendonAuthor of Mr. President, Mr. PresidentI think Bill Clinton may go down in history as one of our really great presidents. Bill Clintons allure comes from the unmistakable feeling that he genuinely likes you.  The presidency has been broadened by Mr. Clinton from his high summitry on war and peace. International trade and foreign policy to include such matters as abuse of women, teen-age pregnancy, youth gangs and even schoool construction.  His actions extend a helping hand to those living with the problems in homes, communities and the job world.Mr. Clinton has taken on a lot more than he had to. He does not want to be anybodys enemy and he hates to hear you talk badly about anyone.15. Don Imus-President Clinton has a great heart. He truly cares.16. Gennifer FlowersBill Clinton would never do what Paula Jones said he did. Bill Clinton has respect for women and is a perfect gentleman at all times around women.17. Susan McDougalBill Clinton was not interested in the Whitewater account. My husband, Jim. Said everytime I tried to talk business with Bill Clinton his eyes rolled back in his head. He had no interest.18. Ronald K. AndersonArkansas State TrooperI guarded Governor Clinton for 8 years, night and day, and sometimes seven days in a row and I never saw him do anything wrong. The three of us that guarded him most of the tine were offered $700,000 each, to trash Bill Clinton, by Cliff Jackson.19. Dick Morris-Clinton adviser for yearsI was with Bill Clinton probably 1,000 days and 10,000 hours and I never saw him express any interest in any woman except Hillary and he would fight you over her.20. Carolyn Yeldell Staleyclosest lifetime friendBill sees religion as an important (but intensely personal) part of life. Bill is a Christian and his personal faith has grown and deepened through his adult life. Bill is private about his faith and does not trivialize it by overly publicizing his church attendance. His faith is very personal and real.21. Douglas EakeleyFellow Rhodes Scholar at OxfordBills potential for leadership was apparent. My first impression was is this guy for real. It didnt take long to find out. He was (and remains) one of the most gregarious persons I have ever met. Bills interest in others conveyed a sense of understanding and sympathy that gave him an ability to relate to people of all walks of life.22.Stephen Oxman-Fellow student at OxfordI remember how interested he was in talking with people and how much he enjoyed it. He displayed an unusual ability to engage people from many different backgrounds in friendly, substantive conversations. I think this skill arises from Bills inherent liking for people. He finds in others a great source of lifes richness and potential, and he gives of himself so that others find this in him as well. 23. Douglas Eakeleyfellow student at OxfordHis anguished decision to give up his draft deferment and subject himself to the draft reflects a combination of courage, integrity and a sense of calling that is so typical of Bill Clinton.24. Don PogueFellow student at OxfordBills warmth for people always seemed to help him maintain a balance in difficult times. My amazement at how well Bill maintained a balance during the war events. He talked with people. He listened. He read and he seemed to be reading a new book each week. He seemed to have a reserve of decency towards everybody he met that just kept him going.25. Congressman Thomas AllenClassmate at OxfordWhen I was with Presdient Clinton at Oxford he had greatness written all over him. His character, personality and leadership were obvious. You never felt he was patronizing or trying to gain something personal. He was impressive as a person who wanted desperately to do good for all. He has been that same person all these years.26. Britt HumeBill Clinton is the most charming man I have ever met. You cannot be around him and not like him. He makes Reagan look dull.27. Nelson MandelaPresident Clinton is one of the most decent men I have come across and he has got a thick skin and strong nerves.28. David Gergen-Reporter Ass someone who has worked with and known the man for more than a dozen years, I believe that in a crisis Bill Clinton steps up to the challenge. He can certainly do the damnest things but down deep he has a good heart and tries very hard to serve a higher good.29. Republican Rep. Asa Hutchinsonlong time opponent of Clintonwhen my family came to Washington in 1996, the Clintons invited my family for a tour of the White House. It was a great treat for mom. I will never forget the time Governor Clinton stayed at a town meeting until 1 a.m. discussing environmental problems in the small town of El Dorado. It just impressed me. His interest and commitment. I was also impressed when, in 1992, he ignored the advice of professional politicians and kept his campaign and transition team in Little Rock. His roots in Arkansas have always been very important to him.30. Prime Minister NetanyahuPresident Clinton is a warrior for peace. He never stops. He never quits. He has boundless optimism. I mean he does not stop. He has this ability to maintain a tireless pace and to nudge and prod and suggest.
