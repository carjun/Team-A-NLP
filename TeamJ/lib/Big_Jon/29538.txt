Dr. Peter Rhee of Arizona's University Medical Center told reporters Sunday she is in a medically induced coma as she begins to recover from surgery following the attack. But he said she has been following simple commands and that doctors are encouraged by her condition. Six people died in the mass shooting at a grocery store in Tuscon Saturday where Giffords was meeting with constituents. The victims include a nine-year-old girl, a federal judge, and a congressional staff member. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, told reporters late Saturday that the suspected gunman apparently intended to assassinate Giffords, a Democrat. The suspect is in police custody. Police have identified him as 22-year-old Jared Loughner. Doctors said of the 14 people injured, only Giffords remains in critical condition. Sheriff Dupnik said the gunman might not have acted alone. He said police believe the shooter came to the grocery store with another person, and that person might have been in some way involved. Authorities say they are interested in finding a white male in his 50s. In several YouTube videos, a person who posted under the name Jared Loughner criticizes the government and calls for a new currency. Law enforcement officials say they are investigating the videos. Last March, Giffords was one of at least 10 House Democrats harassed for their support of the U.S. health care reform legislation. The front door of her office in Tucson was shattered in an act of vandalism. In November, Giffords was re-elected to a third term in the House of Representatives. She was first elected to Congress in 2006. U.S. Capitol police responded to the shooting by advising lawmakers and their staff to take reasonable and prudent precautions regarding their personal security.        1 of 27         Supporters gather for a healing service at Congregation Chaverim after the shooting of U.S Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) among others at a Safeway in Tucson, Arizona      mfaisalrafique is based in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (58.3%) Pakistan (16.7%) Norway (8.3%) Germany (8.3%) France (8.3%)           READ MORE: political-news, tucson, Joe Arpaio, political-news, Gabrielle Giffords, State governments of the United States, Arizona, Peter Rhee, law crime, Jared Loughner, Clarence Dupnik, criticizes condition   More News From: Tucson :  AZ :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Gabrielle Giffords, Arizona shooting principal target, 'doing well' By: sanain      Gabrielle Giffords, U.S. congresswoman, who was the principal victim of the Arizona shooting, is responding great to the treatment and doctors are cautiously optimistic about her treatment.40-year-old Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head at a close range by a gunman in the midst of a public meeting at a Tucson supermarket in Arizona on ...  about 4 hours ago     Gabrielle Giffords is Able to Communicate By: sawangr8      U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona remains in critical condition after being shot in the head by a man who opened fire at her community meeting in Tucson, killing six people including a federal judge.Doctors treating Giffords report that they are very, very encouraged by her ability to respond to simple commands ...  about 6 hours ago     Federal Charges Filed Against Suspected Arizona Gunman By: KaziMajid      Federal charges have been filed against Jared Lee Loughner, the suspected gunman in a shooting rampage at a Safeway supermarket in Arizona that left six dead and 13 wounded, including Rep.
