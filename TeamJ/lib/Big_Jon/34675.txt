On behalf of Todd and my family, we all pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and justice.- Sarah PalinShe also tweeted a link to the statement with the words "On the tragedy in Arizona."There is no evidence at this time that the shooting of Giffords was politically motivated, but it's grimly ironic that the candidate appeared on a map of House Democrats "targeted" by Palin in 2010.The map controversially used actual target markers on locations these Democrats lived and listed their names.Story continues belowSee the controversial target map below:Scroll down for the latest updates on this story.live blogOldestNewest5:20 PMET Dianne Feinstein StatementSenator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) issued a statement today condemning the Arizona shootings:My heart sank when I heard the news of the tragedy in Tucson. My thoughts and prayers are with Representative Giffords and her family, the family of Judge Roll and all the other victims and their loved ones. Representative Giffords is a beacon of courage and hope in our nation right now. She bravely pursued her duties as a member of Congress, despite having been the target of vitriolic political rhetoric in the past.This senseless violence has no place in a free society. She and the other victims were engaged in the very essence of democracy, an elected representative meeting face-to-face with her constituents.I have seen firsthand the effects of assassination, and there is no place for this kind of violence in our political discourse. It must be universally condemned. We do not yet know the gunmans motivations, but I am convinced that we must reject extremism and violent rhetoric.Feinstein served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors with Harvey Milk, and was the person who found his body after he and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by Dan White. Feinstein succeeded Moscone as mayor of San Francisco after the tragedy.4:43 PMET Anti-Government Group Connection?The AP reports that the alleged shooter could be connected to the anti-government group American Renaissance:An official familiar with the Arizona shooting investigation says local authorities are looking at a possible connection between Jared Loughner and an online group known for its anti-government rhetoric.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation, says this is one of several motives that local authorities are pursuing in the shooting of Rep.

W. Bush in 1991 at the urging of Senator John McCain. Just minutes after learning of the slayings, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman of Chicago told TIME in an email that the news of the murder was "very disturbing... Just when we were beginning to feel more secure." Wrote Gettleman, "As judges I'm confident most all of us would like to feel safe as participants in our communities without believing we need special protection. I hope that's the norm, although recent events may indicate otherwise. We certainly don't want to live our lives like judges in some other countries (like Russia, Kenya) must, under constant guard."More here.1:55 PMET Sheriff Deplores 'Rhetoric About Hatred'On Saturday Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik called Arizona "the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry." Today the sheriff continued on the same theme:"I think that when the rhetoric about hatred, about mistrust of government, about paranoia of how government operates and to try to inflame the public on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, has impact on people especially who are unbalanced personalities to begin with."He also called his state "the tombstone of the United States of America."REPORTER: What are your observations about the state of Arizona gun laws in light of what happened?DUPNIK: Well, I think we're the tombstone of the United States of America....

Dupnik said the name of the woman was known but he did not share it during the press conference.After the confrontation with the woman, Loughner was able to load another magazine into his weapon, but "the spring in the magazine failed," Dupnik said, and two men were able to get his weapon away from him and subdue him until law enforcement arrived.Dupnik said the work of these three people potentially averted a "huge greater catastrophe."1:21 PMET FBI Director Robert Mueller Briefing ReportersSome details he's shared:- A filing in federal court is expected today listing specific charges against the shooter Jared Loughren and elaborating on his stated motives- Law enforcement still does not have an ID on the second suspect seen with Loughren in Safeway store1:02 PMET Congresswoman Choked Up While Praising GiffordsRep.

Already, appeals are being heard to tone down the rhetoric.The captured suspect's motives remain unknown despite his online diatribes betraying resentment of the government and a scattered state of mind. Still, the attack on Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and those who were with has intensified the scrutiny on how much is too much, and how hot is too hot, in political debate.Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democratic leader in the Senate, on Sunday cited imagery of crosshairs on political opponents and Sarah Palin's combative rallying cry, "Don't retreat; reload.""These sorts of things, I think, invite the kind of toxic rhetoric that can lead unstable people to believe this is an acceptable response," Durbin said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."The attack might be the work of "a single nut," Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva, whose Arizona district shares Tucson with Giffords' district, said Saturday, the day Giffords was shot. But he said the nation must assess the fallout of "an atmosphere where the political discourse is about hate, anger and bitterness."- AP12:41 PMET Loughner's School Wanted Mental Health EvaluationJared Loughner had a history of acting out in school and had as many as five run-ins with campus police for "classroom and library disruptions," ABC News reports. After he was suspended, the school requested that he pass a mental health evaluation before being allowed to return from suspension:On Oct. 7, Pima Community College sent a letter to Loughner's parents stating that if Loughner wished to return to the school, he would have to "obtain a mental health clearance indicating, in the opinion of a mental health professional, his presence at the College does not present a danger to himself or others," the school said in a statement. Two months later, he purchased the gun allegedly used in Saturday's attack.12:32 PMET Scott Simon On His Friend GabbyNPR's Scott Simon, a friend of Giffords, writes about family get-togethers with Giffords, "great quesadillas," and the heated political rhetoric pervading Arizona:The next time you're tempted to mock members of Congress, you might think about Gabby, who flies back and forth across the country every week, losing sleep, missing her family and wearing herself down  but determined to cast tough votes and fly back home to answer for them. [...]I don't think I violate any confidences to say Gabby has worried that intemperate people -- I'll call them nuts and cranks -- are poisoning politics in the state she loves.12:15 PMET Hospital UpdateCongresswoman Giffords is able to respond to simple commands and communicate with her doctors, hospital officials said this morning. She remains on a ventilator, so is not able to speak at this time.The bullet traveled the entire length of the left side of her brain, her doctors said. It did not cross from one half of the brain to the other, a much worse scenario."Overall, this is about as good as it can get," said Peter Rhee, the trauma medical director.

He pulled her into his lap, holding her upright against him so she wouldn't choke on her own blood. Giffords was conscious, but quiet. ...Hernandez used his hand to apply pressure until someone from inside Safeway brought him clean smocks from the meat department. He used them to apply pressure on the entrance wound, unaware there was an exit wound. He never let go of her."When I heard gunshots, my first instinct was to head toward the congresswoman to make sure that she was okay," Hernandez told ABC's Christiane Amanpour Sunday morning. "Once I saw that she was down, and there were more than one victim, I went ahead and started doing the limited triage that I could with what I had." 9:56 AMET Boehner's StatementHouse Speaker John Boehner announced Sunday morning that the flags on the House side of the U.S. Capitol would be flown at half-mast in honor of Gabe Zimmerman, Giffords' aide who was killed yesterday.

Soon after, as we started reporting more, we reported that she had not been killed, and we regret the erroneous news.Politico has more.8:43 PMET WowSheriff Clarence Dupnik, speaking about Arizona:"When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous. And, unfortunately, Arizona I think has become sort of the capital. We have become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry."It's not unusual for all public officials to get threats constantly, myself included. And that's the sad thing of what's going on in America. Pretty soon, we're not going to be able to  find reasonable, decent people who are willing to subject themselves to serve in public office."He later added:DUPNIK: Let me just say one thing, because people tend to poo-poo this business about all the vitriol that we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that.

Congresswoman Giffords serves Arizonas 8th District with distinction and thoughtful leadership, and it is horrifying that she was exposed to such violence at an event designed to reach the people she represents.   I couldnt agree more with Speaker Boehner, who earlier said that, an attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve.  Along with our nation, this institution has suffered a horrible tragedy.   We are saddened, mourn those who lost their lives, and stand together in hopeful prayer for the recovery of the victims and their families.All legislation currently scheduled to be considered by the House of Representatives next week is being postponed so that we can take whatever actions may be necessary in light of todays tragedy.

Gabrielle Giffords is a watershed event in many ways, some of which we cannot yet know, but one of the clearest and simplest is this: Congress and its members are about to be permanently quarantined, physically isolated, from the people it and they represent.Thirty years ago, there was no such thing as security on Capitol Hill or for members. Members of the public were free to roam the halls, and police presence was practically invisible. There were no barricades around the grounds, and even the leadership rarely had any form of protection.The Hill was the very model of the People's Place -- and in that respect it was an inspirational symbol of our democracy.Read the rest here.7:06 PMET Grayson On GiffordsFormer congressman Alan Grayson writes about Rep. Giffords:Gabrielle Giffords and I served together on the House Committee on Science and Technology.

USAGE:Although the murder of Dr. Tiller was never advocated explicitly, Operation Rescue engaged in a clear pattern of becking, including public prayers for his death and repeated use of terms like child killerall of which fueled the murderous rage of the killer.            frameofmind2: HUFFPOST BLOGGER Valerie Tarico 9 minutes ago (8:48 PM) 197http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/frameofmind2/sarah-palin-statement-shooting_n_806224_73333116.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itlenjabiah                                                    1 hour ago (8:58 PM)                        2 Fans                I see her condolences, but has she gone on record to condemn the act?

Gabrielle Giffords indeed assumed Sarah Palin's map showing various Democratic districts in the crosshair of a rifle was related to the threat of violence. This is what she told MSNBC on March 25, 2010:Quote from Gabrielle Giffords: "...for example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list, but the thing is that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district, and when people do that, they've gotta realize there are consequences to that action."Now, no one with a half a brain (and I have at least half) is suggesting that this had anything to do with the shooting, but the nutty, over-the-top, aggressive and offensive rhetoric from both the far left and the far right these days has to stop! The radio talk show host mentality of pontificating or agitating rather than edifying and educating is damaging this country to the point that we're more vulnerable to terrorism because we're more divided by the rhetoric. Thats all Im saying, nothing more, nothing less. Collectively stick to your politics, but lets all tone down the volume. It's easy to tell someone they suck, without the details of fact and the logic of sound reason. A child could do that, and that's what we sound like in politics today from the White House to the West Coast.This communication failure could be our undoing as a nation.Cape Codfish            Cape_Codfish: Rep.
