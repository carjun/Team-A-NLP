But by September, the methane had been reduced to background levels.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Health, Media, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesBacteria, methane, natural gas, Natural process of clean-up, Oil, The Gulf Oil Spill, The Gulf Oil Spill RecoveryRead moreThe Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil RigAn Analysis of what happened.December 26, 2010jamesb1015 commentsThe New York Times does an in-depth look for the public of what happened on the rig after the rig suffered explosions..The piece points out that while the floating city was rigged for emergenciesAs in most serious things gone bad situations..There starts a chain of events that once started .leads to disasterThe crew was not prepared for a catastrophic one The emergency systems where to cumbersome to initiate.Bad coordination and communications And as in many aircraft accidents..Human error[As the fire raged, the Deepwater Horizon buckled. More than 110 people escaped the rig on April 20, but 11 men died. Photographs of the burning rig were provided to The Times by a worker on a nearby boat who asked not to be identified.]It has been eight months since the Macondo well erupted below the Deepwater Horizon, creating one of the worst environmental catastrophes in United States history. With government inquiries under way and billions of dollars in environmental fines at stake, most of the attention has focused on what caused the blowout. Investigators have dissected BPs well design and Halliburtons cementing work, uncovering problem after problem.But this was a disaster with two distinct parts  first a blowout, then the destruction of the Horizon. The second part, which killed 11 people and injured dozens, has escaped intense scrutiny, as if it were an inevitable casualty of the blowout.It was not.Nearly 400 feet long, the Horizon had formidable and redundant defenses against even the worst blowout. It was equipped to divert surging oil and gas safely away from the rig. It had devices to quickly seal off a well blowout or to break free from it. It had systems to prevent gas from exploding and sophisticated alarms that would quickly warn the crew at the slightest trace of gas. The crew itself routinely practiced responding to alarms, fires and blowouts, and it was blessed with experienced leaders who clearly cared about safety.On paper, experts and investigators agree, the Deepwater Horizon should have weathered this blowout..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Media, Other Things, Updates'things gone bad', Chain of events, Crew error, Fire Safety system, human error, human factors, Incident analysis, NY Times piece, Poor Communication, The Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil Rig, The Gulf Oil Spill, The Macondo wellRead moreUS Files a Civil Suit against BP and other firms on the Gulf SpillDecember 15, 2010jamesb101No commentsAny damages settled out should be covered by the $20 Billion Kenneth Feinberg controlsI would think this is just so the government gets its piece of the money.There will NOT be a trial Im sure..The OTHER shoe has dropped..U.S. Sues BP and Others For Damages in Gulf SpillThe Deepwater Horizon rig burned and sank in April, killing 11 workers and leaving the well it was drilling to gush out of control on the gulf floor. Millions of gallons of crude oil spilled before the well was capped in July.The government is alleging violations of federal regulations concerning the operation and safety of oil rigs, including the failure to take necessary precautions in securing the rig before the explosion and the failure to use the safest drilling technology.The nine defendants include BP and its partners in owning the well,Anadarko Petroleum and MOEX Offshore 2007, as well as BPs operating partners, includingTransocean, the owner of the rig, and insurers. The 27-page complaint was filed in Federal District Court in New Orleans, where thousands of spill lawsuits have been consolidated.A leader of the group of plaintiffs lawyers in the case, James Roy, welcomed the newest litigant, saying, We look forward to continued cooperation with the U.S. government in pursuit of justice for all victims of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy.Halliburton, the contractor for the cement work on the well, was not named as a defendant, but Mr. Holder said the complaint could be amended later. The complaint specifically cites failures of cementing as a factor that contributed to the spill.David M. Uhlmann, a law professor at theUniversity of Michigan, said the filing had been expected. The only question, he said, has been when, not if, a civil suit would be filed.Professor Uhlmann, who led the environmental crimes section of the Justice Department during theGeorge W. Bush administration, called the filing the opening salvo in the governments response to the gulf oil spill. Although the suit could subject BP and the other companies to billions of dollars in civil penalties and natural resource damage claims, he said the next act could be even more dramatic: a criminal case, he said, would bring the most significant penalties and provide the most meaningful accountability for this tragedy.Scott D. Dean, a spokesman for BP, said the filing does not in any manner constitute any finding of liability or any judicial finding that the allegations have merit. The company, he said, will continue to work with the government, and he noted that BP had created a $20 billion fund to pay all legitimate claims from the spill, before any legal determination of responsibility and will continue to fulfill our commitments in the gulf as the legal process unfolds.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, The Economy, UpdatesAnadarko Petroleum, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, BP Oli, Kenneth Feinberg, Tarnsocean, The Gulf Oil Spill, The Gulf Oil Spill independent claim fund, The US sue's BP and other companiesRead more.Scientists Back Early Government Report on Gulf Spill..November 24, 2010jamesb1013 commentsJacks my friend now but, I cant resist a I told you so moment.Back when things when things was ging batshit crazy on the Gulf Old Spill ..I picked up on a pice about a guy who worked at Louisiana State who made the comment that no matter what the screaming memes where saying.The Gulf Oil spill would be cleaned up by the efforts of man.AND nature itself.The guy said by this time most of the oil would be gone..Well.He was rightAt Jack and my age you should be able to see a little bit of the forest from the trees..I know I can.Sometimes.***An early government assessment of the fate of the oilfrom the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico that was criticized as overly optimistic by some independent scientists was largely accurate, according to a revised report by federal scientists released Tuesday.Thepreliminary analysis, announced in August, estimated that roughly three-quarters of the oil had been eliminated  captured at the wellhead, skimmed from the surface, chemically dispersed or burned, or evaporating or breaking down through natural processes.About one-quarter of the oil had either washed up on shore or remained in the gulf as sheen, tar balls or weathered oil. An estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil escaped from BPs blown-out well.The new report revises some of those initial findings, but reaches broadly similar conclusions over all,said Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Todays report, now that weve had time to reflect, is a validation of the original numbers, Ms. Lubchenco said at a news briefing.But she also cautioned that the new figures were simply a refined estimate of where the oil went in the early months of the spill and did not reflect where the residual oil was now, or the ultimate environmental impact of the spill.It does not tell us where the oil is today or its final fate, she said. This report does not address impact at all.Unlike the initial report from August, the latest assessment was peer-reviewed by independent scientists and accompanied by extensive technical documentation. Most notably, it concludes that chemical dispersants were about twice as effective as had been initially thought and were responsible for breaking down about 16 percent of the oil from the spill, rather than 8 percent.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Health, Politics, UpdatesThe Gulf Oil SpillRead moreBottom kill doneTalkandpolitcs.September 19, 2010jamesb1013 commentsThe BP mess in the Gulf is finally sealed with cement, 2.5 miles beneath the sea floor.

But critics say using that higher baseline skewed the numbers.Lehr said the 4.1 million barrel figure is more accurate, as others outside the administration have also pointed out, because it takes into account 800,000 barrels that were captured directly from the BP well and did not leak.Lehrs estimate that roughly three-quarters of the oil remains in the environment  which would take into account oil that has evaporated and otherwise dispersed, and therefore cannot be recovered  appears to be merely an educated guess.Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), who chairs the Energy and Environment Subcommittee that held the hearing, said the administrations initial report this month  and the trumpeting of it  gave people a false sense of confidence about the environmental risks that remain.Intended or not, I think the reaction to the oil budget report that was released  is one of relief, Markey said. People want to believe that everything is OK. I think this report and the way it is being discussed is giving many people a false sense of confidence regarding the state of the Gulf. Overconfidence breeds complacency and complacency is what got us into this situation in the first place.Lehr did not have an estimate on the percentage of oil recovered to date from the shoreline and beaches, as that oil has had to be separated from debris.Thats not a simple process, he said..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Media, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesNOAA, Predictions/Analysis, The Gulf Oil SpillRead moreObamas swimming in the Gulf.Talkandpolitics..August 15, 2010jamesb1011 commentSome happy news  as the Obamas are enjoying a swim off the Florida coast!

That means the procedure known as a static kill appears to be working, though crews now must decide whether to follow up by pumping cement down the broken wellhead.Federal officials wont declare complete victory until they also pump in mud and then cement from the bottom of the well, and that wont happen for several weeks.Weve pretty much made this well not a threat, but we need to finish this from the bottom, retired Coast GuardAdm. Thad Allen, the governments point man on the spill response, told WWL-TV in New Orleans.About one-quarter of the BP oil that spilled out of its broken well remains in the Gulf, according to a report to be released Wednesday by scientists with theInterior Department andNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Nearly three-quarters of the oil  more than 152 million gallons  has been collected at the well by a temporary containment cap, been cleaned up or chemically dispersed, or naturally deteriorated, evaporated or dissolved.It was captured. It was skimmed. It was burned. It was contained. Mother Nature did her part,White House energy adviser Carol Browner said onNBCsToday show.That leaves about 53.5 million gallons in the Gulf. The amount remaining  or washed up on the shore  is still nearly five times the size of the 11 million-gallon Exxon Valdez spill, which wreaked environmental havoc in Alaska in 1989.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Health, Media, Politics, UpdatesClean-Up, Nature, The Gulf Oil SpillRead moreThe Gulf Oil is disappearing fast..July 28, 2010jamesb1016 commentsJohn David Mercer/Press-Register, via Associated PressThough much of the oil is clearing, on Monday it could still be found in Dauphin Island, Ala.You know the scientist from Louisiana Ivor Van Heerdenwas right.The lasting effects of the oil spill will be very small.The hype and the legal wrangling come nextAnd thats going to be a dozy..But Ill bet the people of the region are going to be VERY happy to see the Spill drop from the medias stories.And people start to return to the regions beaches and waters..After theyve be tested and reopened safely.The immense patches of surface oil that covered thousands of square miles of the gulf after the April 20 oil rig explosion are largely gone, though sightings of tar balls and emulsified oil continue here and there.Reporters flying over the area Sunday spotted only a few patches of sheen and an occasional streak of thicker oil, and radar images taken since then suggest that these few remaining patches are quickly breaking down in the warm surface waters of the gulf.John Amos, president of SkyTruth, an environmental advocacy group that sharply criticized the early, low estimates of the size of theBP leak, noted that no oil had gushed from the well for nearly two weeks.Oil has a finite life span at the surface, Mr. Amos said Tuesday, after examining fresh radar images of the slick. At this point, that oil slick is really starting to dissipate pretty rapidly.The dissolution of the slick should reduce the risk of oil killing more animals or hitting shorelines. But it does not end the many problems and scientific uncertainties associated with the spill, and federal leaders emphasized this week that they had no intention of walking away from those problems any time soon.The effect on sea life of the large amounts of oil that dissolved below the surface is still a mystery. Two preliminary government reports on that issue have found concentrations of toxic compounds in the deep sea to be low, but the reports left many questions, especially regarding an apparent decline in oxygen levels in the water.And understanding the effects of the spill on the shorelines that were hit, including Louisianas coastal marshes, is expected to occupy scientists for years. Fishermen along the coast are deeply skeptical of any declarations of success, expressing concern about the long-term effects of the chemical dispersants used to combat the spill and of the submerged oil, particularly on shrimp and crab larvae that are the foundation of future fishing seasons.After 86 days of oil gushing into the gulf, the leak was finally stopped on July 15, when BP managed to install a tight-fitting cap on the well a mile below the sea floor, then gradually closed a series of valves. Still, the well has not been permanently sealed. Until that step is completed in several weeks, the risk remains that the leak will resume.Scientists said the rapid dissipation of the surface oil was probably due to a combination of factors. The gulf has an immense natural capacity to break down oil, which leaks into it at a steady rate from thousands of natural seeps. Though none of the seeps is anywhere near the size of the Deepwater Horizon leak, they do mean that the gulf is swarming with bacteria that can eat oil.The winds from two storms that blew through the gulf in recent weeks, including a storm over the weekend that disintegrated before making landfall, also appear to have contributed to a rapid dispersion of the oil. Then there was the response mounted by BP and the government, the largest in history, involving more than 4,000 boats attacking the oil with skimming equipment, controlled surface burns and other tactics.Some of the compounds in the oil evaporate, reducing their impact on the environment. Jeffrey W. Short, a former government scientist who studied oil spills and now works for the environmental advocacy groupOceana, said that as much as 40 percent of the oil in the gulf might have simply evaporated once it reached the surfaceMore..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Health, Media, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesIvor van Heerden, Lasting permeant effects, litigation, Nature's recovery, The Gulf Oil Spill, The Gulf Oil Spill RecoveryRead morePage 1 of 41234Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
