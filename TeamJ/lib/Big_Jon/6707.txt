Bob Filner (D) blames right-wing media for Giffords shootingSource: press release just issued by FilnerCongressman Bob Filner (D-San Diego)  issued a press statement remembering his fallen colleague.  Gabby Giffords is a good legislator and a good friend. We work closely together as U.S./Mexico border Congressmembers. We pray for her full recovery." Filner faulted incendiary talk radio programming as contributing to a climate that may have encouraged today's violence.  "I cannot help but believe that the violent context of the recent election is responsible for this tragedy," he said. "Many of us were physically threatened by those who believed they were right and we were wrong  we were enemies, rather than sincere people with different opinions.  Their incendiary talk  given legitimacy by equally incendiary talk shows  make violence an acceptable political tactic. Violence as acceptable  bolstered by easy access to guns  made this tragedy almost inevitable. Let us all resolve to recommit ourselves to what is truly exceptional about America  that we conduct our politics with debate and respect, not violence.

Multiple credible news sites have reported that after Democratic Congressman Bob Filner was declared winner  by a 20-point margin, a mob of Popaditch supporters, including Tea Party and white supremacist members, cornered and spat on Popaditchs opponent, Filner. Video by the Chula Vista Star News reveals that Popaditch cursed at Filner, called him a liar, and made no efforts to calm down an increasingly virulent mob that forced Filner out of Golden Halls Election Central and into the lobby. Filner told CityBeat that he was shoved by Popaditch. Last night, Nick Popaditch made Election Central a threatening and unsafe place to be, CityBeats Dave Masse wrote. Mayor Jerry Sanders security detail ultimately rescued the Congressman from the mob, CityBeat reported.East County Magazine reporter Mary Paulet interviewed a witness, Robin Buse, during the altercation, whose statement confirms Filner's allegation. Buse told ECM that she saw Popaditch push Filner. I ran and got the cops, added Buse, a Filner supporter. Others, fearful for their safety, confirmed assaults by Popaditch and his supporters. A second witness, who asked not to be named, said she also saw pushing and cussing.  She added that a Popaditch supporter also pushed a Filner supporter. East County Magazine editor Miriam Raftery, also at the scene, spoke with yet another distraught person who said Popaditch just went after Filner. Raftery photographed police officers moving in to calm down the mob. Southwestern College Sun reporter said that a Popaditch supporter punched a Filner supporter in the face, that Popaditch backers spat on Filner supporters and chanted Bobs a bitch.(More at the link above. Note the rabid hate-mongering comments posted by some of Popaditch's Tea-Party followers, who don't seem to see anything wrong with pushing, swearing at, or physically intimidating a member of Congress.   This is exactly the mentality that needs to be changed and the sort of behavior that should not be tolerated anymore.)Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDBoon      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:17 AMResponse to Reply #115.and as a former congressman, he knows exactly the type fo threats we facentPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topstill_one      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 10:53 PMResponse to Original message7.Gee, I wonder if our president will say that?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcountmyvote4real      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:20 AMResponse to Reply #718.Don't hold your breath. n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topfascisthunter      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 12:25 PMResponse to Reply #727.he'll say the left is doing the same shitPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topprogressivebydesign      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 11:33 PMResponse to Original message10.Damn straight it is the Glenn Becks and the Palins who have done this.They need to STOP inciting the unstable.

The level of threats against elected officials (hugely disproportionately Democratic!) has gone up exponentially since the insurance/koch brothers/teabaggers starting fighting against heath care reform. The NRA (aka gun manufacturers lobby) has put money behind these vitriolic attacks, as well.  They know what they're doing... and the elected officials and innocent bystanders are all just collateral damage, in their fight to make sure that the insurance CEOs keep their multi-million dollar payouts.  It's a disgrace.. and a National shame.

Now that we have seen a series of right-wing assassinations take place, the original DHS report looks, in hindsight, to have been very timely and prescient. We have seen Jim David Adkisson open fire upon the congregation of the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church with a sawed-off shotgun, killing two, simply because he opposed the all-inclusive nature of the church, and of the church's liberal teachings. Adkisson wrote in a letter which he assumed would be his last, "I thought Id do something good for this country  kill Democrats til (sic) the cops kill me. His hatred for his fellow Americans could not be contained: Liberals are a pest like termites, millions of them  the only way we can rid ourselves of this evil is kill them in the streets, kill them where they gather.James von Brunn, a radical right-winger from Maryland sought to turn the nation's Holocaust Museum into a symbol for his particular brand of racism, when he went there with the intent to kill blacks and Jews, as an example to the rest of white America to emulate. Luckily for those visitors inside of the museum, the first man von Brunn decided to open fire upon was a black man who had the ability to return the favor, and so no one besides than the very heroic Stephen T. Johns died that day.Shawna Forde, and two other members of the anti-immigrant Minutman group which she founded, the ''Minutemen American Defense,'' decided that one way to finance her burgeoning organization was to dress up as law enforcement agents, and to rob Mexican immigrants. When Shawna and her compatriots illegally entered the home of Raul Flores, and demanded money, the head of the family ordered the trio to leave, prompting the radical right-wingers to put a bullet into the head of little 9 year old Brisenia Flores, and into the head of her father. Unluckily for the conservative killers, Brisenia's mother was able to barricade herself in her bedroom, where she kept a handgun, and she was able to keep at bay her would be assassins until the real police arrived. Richard Poplawski opened fire on police officers during a domestic disturbance call, in April of 2009, killing three of them. Why? The 23 year-old right-winger feared that the President was poised to take away his hand guns.Just a few days after that shoot-out, two sheriffs deputies in northern Florida were shot and killed by Joshua Cartwright who later was fatally shot by other deputies. The reason, according to Cartright's wife, was because Joshua "believed that the US Government was conspiring against him," and, according to her, he had been severely disturbed that Barack Obama had been elected President.The list of victims from right-wing terror does not stop there.It goes on, and on.Doctor George tiller.Arkansas Democratic Chairman Bill Gwatney.Congresswoman Giffords and the other victims of the Tucson shooting are but the latest victims of this madness.Hours before the shooting spree in Arizona which the took 6 lives including that of a Federal Judge and a 9 year old little girl, Christina Greene (born on 9-11-2001), Representative Peter King, a conservative Republican and the new chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, made clear his intention to use taxpayers' money - our money - to investigate the radicalization of American Muslims, claiming in his zeal to persecute American Muslims, that "These are very legitimate hearings." But since the day little Christina was brought into this world, on that fateful September morning, the number of victims who have been laid to rest due to domestic jihad pales when compared to those who have been killed by conservative terrorists during little Christina's 9 years on earth.For moderate conservatives to hide these blood-thirsty radicals within their ranks behind the legitimate dissent of the anti-abortion lobby, or of that of any other conservative movement, be it anti-immigration, or advocates for 2d Amendment Rights, and to deny any responsibility for help in fostering these lunatic's bizarre views, doesn't help the conservative lobbies attain their aims and goals... It, instead, helps the radical conservative terrorists attain theirs. We should be there, in Washington DC, on the day Rep. King begins his American Muslim witch hunt.We should be there to tell him with a thunderous voice that we know who the real domestic threats to America are.Del Wasso,Rockford Coffee Party Coordinator,Rockford, Illinois,www.rockfordcoffeeparty.org Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopSwagman      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 02:53 AMResponse to Original message19.he is correct and said it well.

Just the day before, she had voted in favour of Obama's healthcare reform, and that night, the door of her office was destroyed.She told the interviewer she wasn't fearful for her life, but that protesters' rhetoric was becoming "incredibly heated". She was asked if the Republican leadership should have spoken out more to denounce the violence. Diplomatically, she said both parties should. But then, she recounted how she was on Sarah Palin's hit list. "We have the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district," she said. "And when people do that, they've got to realise there are consequences."Giffords was referring to a map of the US that Palin had posted on her website. There were a number of gun sights; one was for Giffords. But shortly after the shooting on Saturday, it mysteriously disappeared from Palin's site.That's not all. Giffords' Republican opponent in the 2 November race for a seat in the House of Representatives was Jesse Kelly. He had held a campaign event in which he invited his supporters to "Get on Target for Victory in November". He asked them to "Help remove Gabrielle Giffords from office  shoot a fully automatic M15 with Jesse Kelly."More:http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011...

During the last election I was told (proudly) by an otherwise normal person that in his county there were no demonrats on the ticket because "they were smart enough to not run." Perhaps he just meant that it was because they would lose, or perhaps he meant something else.Just remember, their view is: "There ain't no end to doin' good," Captain Terrill in The Outlaw Josey WalesTo appreciate the irony, one must have seen the movie.Or, one can just wait as more and more right-wingers start Doing GoodPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLorien      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:23 PMResponse to Original message26.How much are we going to take before we even TALK about restoring the fairness doctrine??And no, breaking up the media monopolies alone won't cut it.
