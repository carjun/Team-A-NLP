Wikipedia:Administrators - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWikipedia:AdministratorsFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia(Redirected from Wikipedia:ADMIN)Jump to: navigation,searchThis page documents an English Wikipedia policy, a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus.Shortcuts:WP:ADMWP:ADMINWP:SYSOPWP:MOPThis page in a nutshell: Administrators are users trusted with access to certain tools. They are expected to observe a high standard of conduct, to use the tools fairly, and never to use them to gain advantage in a dispute.The symbol of a Wikipedia Administrator combines the site's logo with a mop, as sysops are colloquially likened to janitors for rhetorical reasons.The Five PillarsEnforcement policiesAdministratorsBanning policyBlocking policyBot policyHarassmentProtection policySock puppetryUsername policyVandalismviewtalkeditAdministrators, commonly known as admins or sysops (system operators), are Wikipedia editors trusted with access to restricted technical features ("tools"). For example, administrators can protect, delete and restore pages, move pages over redirects, hide and delete page revisions, and block other editors. See Wikipedia:Administrators/Tools.Administrators assume these responsibilities as volunteers; they are not acting as employees of the Wikimedia Foundation. They are never required to use their tools, and must never use them to gain an advantage in a dispute in which they are involved.The English Wikipedia has 1,767 administrators as of January 10, 2011.Requests for adminshipRequest assistanceFull list of administratorsAll user accounts with admin privilegesContents1 History2 Becoming an administrator2.1 Take care2.2 Places where administrators in particular can assist3 Administrator noticeboards4 Administrator conduct4.1 Accountability5 Grievances by users ("Administrator abuse")6 Misuse of administrative tools6.1 Reversing another admin's action6.2 Reinstating a reverted action ("Wheel warring")6.3 Exceptional circumstances7 Involved admins8 Review and removal of adminship8.1 Voluntary removal8.2 Disputes or complaints8.2.1 Administrator recall8.2.2 Requests for comment on administrator conduct8.2.3 Arbitration Committee review9 Security10 Related pages11 External links12 Notes13 Related informationHistoryIn the very early days of Wikipedia, all users functioned as administrators to perform various administrative functions, using a single password that was handed out fairly freely.[1] The modern form of administratorship is the result of a code modification which changed from password access to role-based access control, under which individual accounts could be flagged as per the roles they could perform, which in turn determined functions/tools they could access.During this transition, it was emphasized that administrators should never develop into a special subgroup. Rather, administrators should be a part of the community like other editors, with no special powers or privileges when acting as editors. Administrators are also expected to observe a high standard of conduct. Likewise, in general, most maintenance and administration aspects of Wikipedia can be conducted by anyone, without the specific technical functions granted to administrators. An often paraphrased comment about the title and process of administratorship was made by Jimmy Wales in February 2003referred to as "sysops" here:Shortcuts:WP:DEALWP:NOBIGDEALI just wanted to say that becoming a sysop is *not a big deal*.I think perhaps I'll go through semi-willy-nilly and make a bunch of people who have been around for awhile sysops. I want to dispel the aura of "authority" around the position. It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.I don't like that there's the apparent feeling here that being granted sysop status is a really special thing.Jimmy Wales, wikimedia.org archive entryStated simply, while the correct use of the tools and appropriate conduct should be considered important, merely "being an administrator" should not be. Whether this description remains accurateeight years after it was first statedis a matter of continuing debate.Becoming an administratorMain page: Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminshipNote: Each individual Wikimedia project (including other Wikipedias) may have its own policy for granting adminship.The English Wikipedia has no official requirements you must meet to become a Wikipedia administrator. Anyone can apply regardless of their Wikipedia experience. Administrators are expected to uphold the trust and confidence of the community, however, and considerable experience is usually expected. Each editor will personally assess their confidence in a particular candidate's readiness in their own way. Before requesting or accepting a nomination, candidates should generally be active and regular Wikipedia contributors for at least several months, be familiar with the procedures and practices of Wikipedia, respect and understand its policies, and have gained the general trust of the community.If at this point you are interested in requesting adminship, you should first read the guide to requests for adminship and the nomination instructions. When you are ready to apply, you may add your nomination to the Wikipedia:Requests for adminship ("RFA") page, according to the aforementioned instructions. A discussion (not a vote) will then take place among fellow editors about whether you should become an administrator. After seven days, a bureaucrat will determine if there is consensus to approve your request. This is sometimes difficult to ascertain, and is not a numerical measurement, but as a general descriptive rule of thumb most of those above ~80% approval pass and most of those below ~70% fail.Only one account of a given person may have administrative tools. See WP:ADMINSOCK.Adminship is granted indefinitely, and is only removed upon request or under circumstances involving high-level intervention (see administrator abuse below).Take careIf you are granted access, you must exercise care in using these new functions, especially the ability to delete pages and to block IP addresses. You can learn how to do these things at the Administrators' how-to guide and the new administrator school. Please also look at the pages linked from the Administrators' reading list before using your administrative abilities.Administrator tools are also used with judgment; it can take some time for a new administrator to learn when it's best to use the tools, and it can take months to gain a good sense of how long a period to set when using tools such as blocking and page protection in difficult disputes. New administrators are strongly encouraged to start slowly and build up experience on areas they are used to, and by asking others if unsure.Administrators and all other users with extra tools are expected to have a strong password, to prevent damage in the case of a compromised account.

Administrators acting in this role are neutral; they do not have any direct involvement in the issues they are helping people with. Lists can be found at Wikipedia:General sanctions and Arbitration enforcement requests and the related Arbitration enforcement noticeboard (WP:AE).Administrator noticeboardsTwo main noticeboards exist on which general administrator discussion takes place (any user may post or take part in discussions there).Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard (WP:AN)  used for things administrators may wish to (or need to) know, such as notices and general information.Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents (WP:ANI)  Used for matters needing attention from "any passing administrator/s". Although threads here can become long, this board is primarily for incidents and other matters needing advice or attention.Administrator conductShortcut:WP:NOTPERFECTAdministrators are expected to lead by example and to behave in a respectful, civil manner in their interactions with others. Administrators are expected to follow Wikipedia policies and to perform their duties to the best of their abilities. Occasional mistakes are entirely compatible with adminship; administrators are not expected to be perfect. However, sustained or serious disruption of Wikipedia is incompatible with the status of administrator, and consistently or egregiously poor judgment may result in the removal of administrator status. Most especially, administrators should strive to model appropriate standards of courtesy and civility to other editors and to one another.[2][3][4][5]Administrators should bear in mind that at this stage in the evolution of Wikipedia, they have hundreds of colleagues. Therefore, if an administrator finds that he or she cannot adhere to site policies and remain civil (even toward users exhibiting problematic behavior) while addressing a given issue, then the administrator should bring the issue to a noticeboard or refer it to another administrator to address, rather than potentially compound the problem by poor conduct of his or her own.AccountabilityShortcut:WP:ADMINACCTAdministrators are accountable for their actions involving administrator tools, and unexplained administrator actions can demoralize other editors who lack such tools. Subject only to the bounds of civility, avoiding personal attacks, and reasonable good faith, editors are free to question or to criticize administrator actions. Administrators are expected to respond promptly and civilly to queries about their Wikipedia-related conduct and administrator actions and to justify them when needed.Administrators who seriously, or repeatedly, act in a problematic manner or have lost the trust or confidence of the community may be sanctioned or have their access removed. In the past, this has happened or been suggested for:"Bad faith" adminship (sock puppetry, gross breach of trust,[7] etc.)Breach of basic policies (attacks, biting/civility, edit warring, privacy, etc)Conduct elsewhere incompatible with adminship (off-site attacking, etc.).Failure to communicate[6] this can be either to users (e.g., lack of suitable warnings or explanations of actions), or to concerns of the community (especially when explanations or other serious comments are sought).Repeated/consistent poor judgmentGrievances by users ("Administrator abuse")Shortcuts:WP:ADMINABUSEWP:ADMINISTRATORABUSEWP:GBUIf a user thinks an administrator has acted improperly against him/her or another editor, he or she should express their concerns directly to the administrator responsible and try to come to a resolution in an orderly and civil manner. However, if the matter is not resolved between the two parties, users can take further action (see Dispute resolution process below). For more possibilities, see Administrators' noticeboard: Incidents and Requests for comment: Use of administrator privileges.Misuse of administrative toolsMisusing the administrative tools is considered a serious issue. The administrative tools are provided to trusted users for maintenance and other tasks, and should be used with thought. Serious misuse may result in sanction or even their removal.Common situations where avoiding tool use is often required:Conflict of interest, non-neutrality, or content dispute  Administrators should not use their tools to advantage, or in a content dispute (or article) where they are a party (or significant editor), or where a significant conflict of interest is likely to exist. With few specific exceptions (like obvious vandalism) where tool use is allowed by any admin, administrators should ensure they are reasonably neutral parties when they use the tools.Communal norms or policies  When a policy or communal norm is clear that tools should not be used, then tools should not be used without an explanation that shows the matter has been considered, and why a (rare) exception is genuinely considered reasonable.Reversing the actions of other administrators  Only in a manner that respects the admin whose action is involved, and (usually) after consultation.Reinstating an admin action that has already been reversed (sometimes known as "wheel warring")  Responses have included Arbitration and desysopping even the first time.See below for these and for the very few exceptions.In most cases even when use of the tools is reasonable, if a reasonable doubt may exist, it is frequently better to ask an independent administrator to review and (if justified) take the action. This is a matter of judgment if necessary.Reversing another admin's actionAdministrators are expected to have good judgment, and are presumed to have considered carefully any actions or decisions they carry out as administrators. Administrators may disagree, but except for clear and obvious mistakes, administrative actions should not be reversed without good cause, careful thought and (if likely to be objected) usually some kind of courtesy discussion.Reinstating a reverted action ("Wheel warring")WP:WW redirects here; you may also be looking for Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words or Wikipedia:WikiProject WikipediaWeekly.Shortcuts:WP:WWWP:WHEELWP:0WWWP:RRAWhen another administrator has already reversed an administrative action, there is very rarely any valid reason for the original or another administrator to reinstate the same or similar action again without clear discussion leading to a consensus decision. Wheel warring is when an administrator's action is reversed by another admin, but rather than discussing the disagreement, administrator tools are then used in a combative fashion to undo or redo the action. With very few exceptions, once an administrative action has been reverted, it should not be restored without consensus.Do not repeat a reversed administrative action when you know that another administrator opposes it. Do not continue a chain of administrative reversals without discussion. Resolve admin disputes by discussing.Wheel warring usually results in an immediate Request for Arbitration. Sanctions for wheel warring have varied from reprimands and cautions, to temporary blocks, to desysopping, even for first time incidents. There have been several relevant arbitration cases on the subject of wheel-warring.[1] The term was also used historically for an administrator improperly reversing some kinds of very formal action.[2]Possible indications of an incipient wheel war:An administrator getting too distressed to discuss calmly,Deliberately ignoring an existing discussion in favor of a unilateral preferred action,Abruptly undoing administrator actions without consultation.Wikipedia works on the spirit of consensus; disputes should be settled through civil discussion rather than power wrestling. There are few issues so critical that fighting is better than discussion, or worth losing your own good standing for. If you feel the urge to wheel war, try these alternatives:Seek constructive discussion,Follow dispute resolution processes as with any other conduct matter. For example: move the issue to WP:ANI and wait for input, or (for serious and egregious misuse of tools) consider RFC or RFAR.Take a break and calm down.Exceptional circumstancesThere are a few exceptional circumstances to this general principle. (Note: these are one-way exceptions):Biographies of living personsmaterial deleted because it contravenes BLP may be re-deleted if reinstated, if it continues to be non-BLP-compliant.Privacypersonal information deleted under the Foundation's privacy policy may be re-deleted if reinstated.Emergencyin certain situations there may arise an emergency that cannot be adjourned for discussion. An administrator should not claim emergency unless there is a reasonable belief of a present and very serious emergency (i.e., reasonable possibility of actual, imminent, serious harm to the project or a user if not acted upon with administrative tools), and should immediately seek to describe and address the matter, but in such a case the action should not usually be reverted (and may be reinstated) until appropriate discussion has taken place.Page protection in edit warringreasonable actions undertaken by uninvolved administrators to quell a visible and heated edit war by protecting a contended page should be respected by all users, and protection may be reinstated if needed, until it is clear the edit war will not resume or consensus agrees it is appropriate to unprotect.Involved adminsShortcuts:WP:INVOLVEDWP:UNINVOLVEDIn general, editors should not act as administrators in cases in which they have been involved. This is because involved administrators may have, or may be seen to have, a conflict of interest in disputes they have been a party to or have strong feelings about. Involvement is generally construed very broadly by the community, to include current or past conflicts with an editor (or editors) and disputes on topics, regardless of the nature, age, or outcome of the dispute.One important caveat is that an administrator who has interacted with an editor or article purely in an administrative role, or whose prior involvement are minor or obvious edits which do not speak to bias, is not involved and is not prevented from acting on the article, editor, or dispute either in an administrative role or in an editorial role. This is because one of the roles of administrators is precisely to deal with such matters, at length if necessary. Warnings, calm and reasonable discussion and explanation of those warnings, advice about communal norms, and suggestions on possible wordings and approaches, do not make an administrator 'involved'.In cases which are straightforward, (e.g. blatant vandalism), the community has historically endorsed the obvious action of any administrator  even if involved  on the basis that any reasonable administrator would have probably come to the same conclusion. Although there are exceptions to the prohibition on involved editors taking administrative action, it is best practice in cases where an administrator may be seen to be involved that they pass the matter to another administrator via the relevant noticeboards.A user seeking administrator or uninvolved user help in a matter may use the {{uninvolved|type|details}} template to request admin assistance. Requests will appear in Category:Requests for uninvolved help until removed.Review and removal of adminship If an administrator abuses administrative powers, these powers can be removed. Administrators may be removed either by Jimmy Wales, stewards or by a ruling of the Arbitration Committee. At their discretion, lesser penalties may also be assessed against problematic administrators, including the restriction of their use of certain powers or placement on administrative probation. The technical ability to remove administrator status rests with stewards and Jimmy Wales.There have been several procedures suggested for a community based desysop process, but none of them have achieved consensus. Some administrators will voluntarily stand for reconfirmation under certain circumstances; see #Administrator recall. Users may use dispute resolution to request comment on an administrator's suitability.Technical noteremoval of rights does not currently show up in the usual user logs. Use {{Userrights|username}} for full links to user rights information and full logs, including the stewards' global logs on meta as well, or Special:ListUsers to verify a users' current rights. See: Bugzilla:4055.Voluntary removalAdministrators may request that their access to administrative tools be removed at m:Steward requests/Permissions. Administrators who stepped down in good standing (that is, not in controversial circumstances) may request their administrator status be restored at any time by a bureaucrat. This is commonly done at the bureaucrats' noticeboard.Some administrators may become inactive for a period of time, or may retire altogether. In these instances, as noted on the Perennial Proposals page, consensus has been that they will retain their rights unless they specifically request to have them removed.Disputes or complaintsFurther information: Wikipedia:Dispute resolutionIn most cases, disputes with administrators should be resolved with the normal dispute resolution process. If the dispute reflects seriously on a user's administrative capacity (blatant misuse of administrative tools, gross or persistent misjudgement or conduct issues), then the following steps are available.Administrator recallMain page: Wikipedia:Administrators open to recallSome administrators place themselves "open to recall", whereby they pledge to voluntarily step down if a certain number of editors in good standing request so. The specific criteria are set by each administrator for themselves, and is usually detailed in their userspace. The process is entirely voluntary and administrators may change their criteria at any time, or decline to adhere to previously made recall pledges. If an administrator steps down as a result of a recall, he or she then requests removal at m:Steward requests/Permissions.Requests for comment on administrator conductMisuse of administrator access or behavior that is incompatible with adminship may result in an involuntary request for comment on administrator conduct. Administrators who fail to satisfactorily respond to community feedback are likely to become the subject of an Arbitration Committee review - see below.Arbitration Committee reviewThis is an involuntary process. Generally, the Arbitration Committee requires that other steps of dispute resolution should be tried before it intervenes in a dispute. However, if the matter is serious enough, the Arbitration Committee may intervene without a request for comment on administrator conduct. Remedies that may be imposed, at the discretion of the Committee, include warnings, admonishments, restrictions, or a summary removal of administrator privileges.If the complaining user was blocked improperly by an administrator, they may appeal the block and/or email the Arbitration Committee directly.SecurityMain page: Wikipedia:SecurityIt is extremely important that administrators have strong passwords and follow personal security practices. Because they have the potential to cause site-wide damage with a single edit, a compromised sysop account will be blocked and its privileges removed on grounds of site security. In certain circumstances, the revocation of privileges may be permanent. Discretion on resysopping temporarily desysopped administrators is left to bureaucrats, who will consider whether the rightful owner has been correctly identified, and their view on the incident and the management and security (including likely future security) of the account.Administrators should never share their password or account with any other person, for any reason. If they find out their password has been compromised, or their account has been otherwise compromised (even by an editor or individual they know and trust), they should attempt to change it immediately, or otherwise report it to a steward for temporary de-sysopping. Users who fail to report unauthorized use of their account will be desysopped. Unauthorized use is considered 'controversial circumstances', and access will not be automatically restored.Related pagesMiscellaneousList of administrators (automatically generated version)What adminship is not, an essayWikipedia:User access levelsHistory and statisticsChart of the growth in number of administrators (through early 2007)Former administratorsRequests for Adminship by monthStatistics of administrator activityFor administratorsAdministrators' how-to guideAdministrators' noticeboardAdministrators' reading listAdvice for new administratorsNew admin schoolExternal linksWikiversity has learning materials about How to be a Wikimedia sysopAdministrators in all Wikipedias, Meta-WikiLinks related to wheel warringWheel wars entry at Jargon dictionarymeatball:AnarchyAndFreedommeatball:MetaModerationmeatball:SoftSecuritymeatball:TitForTatNotes^ Tony Sidaway; UBX war; Pedophilia userbox wheel war; Freestylefrappe; Daniel Brandt deletion wheel war; Sarah Palin protection wheel war.^ (E.g.: "Wheel warring against Jimbo Wales", "Wheel warring against BLP special enforcement")Related informationvdeNew admin schoolArticlesAccountcreator granting and revoking Admin how-to Advice for new administrators Blocking Dealing with disputes Deleting Protecting Protecting deleted pages (Salting) Reading list Rollback Rollback granting and revoking Viewing deleted pages and contributionsPoliciesAdministrator policy (WP:ADMIN) Banning policy (WP:BAN) Blocking policy (WP:BLOCK) Deletion policy (WP:DEL) Protection policy (WP:PROTECT) Revision deletion policy (WP:REVDEL)ScriptsDeletion  MiscellaneousRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators"Categories: Wikipedia policy | Wikipedia New admin school | Wikipedia adminship | Wikipedia enforcement policy | Wikipedia user access levelsHidden categories: Semi-protected project pages Personal toolsLog in / create accountNamespacesProject pageDiscussionVariantsViewsReadView sourceView historyActionsSearchNavigationMain pageContentsFeatured contentCurrent eventsRandom articleDonate to WikipediaInteractionHelpAbout WikipediaCommunity portalRecent changesContact WikipediaToolboxWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPrint/exportCreate a bookDownload as PDFPrintable version LanguagesAfrikaansAkanAlemannischngliscAragonsArpetanAsturianuAymar aruAzrbaycancaBamanankanBn-lm-gBasa Banyumasan ()BoarischBosanskiBrezhonegCatalCebuanoeskyChavacano de ZamboangaChi-ChewachiTumbukaCymraegDanskDeitschDeutschDolnoserbskiEestiEmilin e rumagnlEspaolEsperantoEuskaraEegbeFroysktFranaisFryskFulfuldeFurlanGaeilgeGaelgGidhligGalegoGkyHak-k-faHawai`iHornjoserbsceHrvatskiIdoIgboIlokano / Bahasa IndonesiaInterlinguaInterlingue/inuktitutIupiakisiZuluslenskaItalianoBasa JawaKalaallisutKapampangan - ()KaszbscziKernewekKinyarwandaKiswahiliKongoKurdLadinoLatinaLatvieuLtzebuergeschLietuviLguruLimburgsLinglaLugandaLumbaartMagyarMalagasyMaltiMoriBahasa MelayuMng-dng-ngMirandsNhuatlDorerin NaoeroNa Vosa VakavitiNederlandsNedersaksischNnapulitanoNorfuk / PitkernNorsk (bokml)Norsk (nynorsk)NouormandOccitan O'zbekPangasinanPiemontisPlattdtschPolskiPortugusQaraqalpaqshaQrmtatarcaRipoarischRomnRomaniRuna Simi SmegiellaGagana SamoaSngSarduScotsSeelterskShqipSicilianuSimple EnglishSiSwatiSloveninaSloveninalnski / SrpskiSrpskohrvatski / Basa SundaSuomiSvenskaTagalogTarandne/TataraTetunlea faka-TongaTshivendaTrkeTrkmeneTwi  / UyghurcheVnetoTing VitVolapkVroWalonWest-VlamsWinarayWolofXitsongaYorbZazakiemaitka This page was last modified on 6 January 2011 at 09:32.Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;additional terms may apply.See Terms of Use for details.Wikipedia is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization.Contact usPrivacy policyAbout WikipediaDisclaimers
