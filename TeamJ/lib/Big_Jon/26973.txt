I struggled for a bit, gained about 15 pounds back and now have moved on to a new goal of losing 50 pounds by my brother's wedding on June 12. You can read more about that here.One of my favorite movies is "When Harry Met Sally..." and one of my favorite bits is when Sally is crying about turning 40:Sally: And I'm gonna be forty.Harry: When?Sally: Someday.Harry: In eight years.Sally: But it's there. It's just sitting there like this big dead end.She is, of course, sobbing as she says this.When I first saw that movie I was 20 years old and 40 seemed so far away. Twice my age! Now it feels like I've barely blinked and my own "someday" is right around the corner. Just 18 months away -- and it's freaking me out!I had been feeling this compulsion to do something to mark the milestone, especially since I have the very cool birthday of 09/09/09 to countdown to! I think wanting to do something special for a milestone is fairly common. One of my girlfriends is hiking the Appalachian Trail to mark 40. Another is determined to go to Australia.So I found my own personal mission--to lose at least 100 pounds.It came to me a couple of months ago. When I left work to get lunch I started to follow the same path as always: down the elevator, out the loading dock, right turn to the cafe for whatever hot entree they've got featured-chicken parmesan or spaghetti and meatballs or roast beef and mashed potatoes.And then I stopped. It would be just as easy to go left to the nearby Subway sandwich shop instead. I've always liked Subway... lots of choices on the "healthy" section of their menu. And as silly as it may sound, I knew if I made that turn, I'd be taking a strong first step toward making significant changes in my life.And I needed to make those changes... because I'dseen a number on the scale that morning that I'd never wanted to see.Just one step would be a start...I knew it would be start that I needed because I'm a creature of habit and every new habit starts with that first change. I'd been following the same lunch routine for a good 6 months. And I knew it could be just as simple to establish a new and healthier routine. If I just made that turn and took that step.So I did!That night I told Mark, the personal trainer I'd been working with (to little avail since I hadn't made any significant changes to my eating), that I wanted to spend the last 10 minutes of our session talking about how I was going to lose 100 pounds. We came up with a plan and starting that day, I felt a brand new focus.I've struggled with my weight virtually my whole life. It's a familiar story--I've tried every diet and lost 20 pounds here, gained 30 there. Lost another 50. Gained another 60. And so on. Since I was 12 years old. And now I'm 38. I can't bring myself to admit in public how much I weigh, though I'll put out there that I can definitely stand to lose more than 100 pounds.One thing I've realized is that a huge part of losing weight is being in the right state of mind to do it. Anyone can eat right and exercise and make the necessary changes to lose weight--if they set their mind to it. But there are a million reasons that we don't set our minds to it.Luckily for me, on that particular Monday, I felt like I had a million reasons to go ahead and do it. And two months later, I've lost 28 pounds and it feels really, really great. And while in a lot of ways, it's a lot of hard work, in a lot of other ways, it's so much easier than I imagined.I'm going to write here about my journey over the next year and a half for a few reasons:In the past, I've tried to keep my dieting efforts to myself. That has clearly not worked for me! So, I'm going in the opposite direction and telling EVERYONE!I think the extra accountability will really help me. Will I want to binge on all the ice cream in my freezer if I know I'll have to come clean about it here?If I'm writing every week, it will help me to really focus on what I'm doing. If I binge on all that ice cream, at least I'll be thinking about it and trying to figure out why as I write about it.I hope this will be a resource for other people. So many of us have the same problems and issues; we should be sharing the same solutions! I'm confident that I'm going to be successful this time... but, I don't want to be just an "after" story. I want to tell my story "in progress" so we can learn from all this together. I'm no expert, but, I have a lot of resources and know a lot of smart people-and I want to share.I kind of stalled writing this first entry. I wanted to make sure I was in for the long haul before I ended up humiliating myself by starting with a bang and giving up in a few weeks. Now that I've committed with these words on the screen, I'll be back to write more every week!You can read all of my stories, from the beginning, below!Week 10Lisa's Plan There's no single way to lose weight that works for everybody.

With a little bit of planning and the right attitude, a buffet or all-you-can-eat dinner doesn't have to derail your healthy eating habits.Weeks 13 and 14After a Holiday Weekend -- Getting Your Diet Plan Back on Track I had the best intentions going into the Memorial Dayweekend, but never quite felt like I was hitting my stride and keeping strong. A cookie here... some chips there... too much cheese a little later. I was sureI'd record a gain at my weigh-in --And I did. Now what?Week 15Lisa's Bookshelf:  "Hungry Girl" and "Eat This, Not That!" This week was about re-evaluating, re-focusing, and re-thinking my weight loss plan.I even bought a couple of new diet books to help me along the way!

How did this happen??Weeks 18 and 19Factoring in a vacation when you're watching your weight A vacation is supposed to relax you... but if you're watching your weight, how do you make sure you don't sabotage your efforts as soon as you jet away?Week 20When the Diet Panic Strikes I had a bit of the scale panics this week...

Now that I'm losing weight, I talked to my trainer about the ways we can, and can't, target specific problem areas with exercise.Week 25When a Diet Becomes a Lifestyle Change My 25th weekwas a good week. No highs. No lows. No real struggles. Just a good, solid, run-of-the-mill week, ending in an incremental loss. So... what to write about? Week 266 Months In... and 54.5 Pounds Down! Yesterday was a big day for me - six months to the day since I signed up for Weight Watchers and really started focusing on exercise. So now is a good time to talk about goals, rewards and support.Week 275 Tips for Maintaining Weight Loss What if, worst case scenario, I don't lose another pound? I feel great. I look better than I did six months ago. I'm making healthy choices. But, how do I make sure that, no matter what, I don't go back to where I was?Week 28Recognizing Your Triggers and Avoiding Old Habits I've been feeling a bit stressed lately - and I'm determined to make sure it doesn't affect my eating habits. Week 30Taking a Break and Re-Evaluating Goals Last week I gave myself a birthday present -- a break from my efforts to watch my food and exercise. I indulged and enjoyed myself and, at the end of the week, I was more than ready to get back to my improved habits and focus again on my goals.Week 31Shopping While You Shrink If I buy clothes that fit me now, they'll be too big in a month. If I buy clothes that are too small, I'll have nothing to wear now. What to do? Here are some suggestions.Week 33A Picture is Worth... 60 or 100 or 150 Pounds! Nothing helps motivate during weight loss like before and after photos!Week 35An Old Dress Gives New Motivation Anyslowing down of your weight loss can be frustrating, but Ihad an experience this weekend that made me feel so good that I don't really care that I haven't lost anything new as long as I'm maintaining at this low (for now!) point.Week 369 Tips for Keeping Your Diet Intact Through the Holidays This is a scary time of the year - and I don't mean just because of Halloween! After Halloween, there's Thanksgiving... and then all sorts of parties in December for Christmas and Hanukkah... and then New Year's. So, how to get through? Weeks 37 & 38Exercising while youre traveling for the holidays Since I'll be staying with friends and family during the holidays and won't have access to a gym like I'm used to, I asked one of my personal trainers to give me some tips for exercising effectively without special equipment.Week 39Snack tips to help you get through the day Snacking doesn't have to derail your dieting efforts. In fact, if you do it right, snacking is an important part of a successful weight loss program. Click through for suggestions on how to get from meal to meal with the help of tasty and healthy snacks.Week 41What to do when you hit a plateau Plateaus are a normal part of weight loss. And while they're seemingly unavoidable and sometimes feel insurmountable, we can get through them!Week 43Sticking to your healthy habits through the holiday season When I first emailed Laura and Danny to ask them for their tips for staying focused through the holiday season, they both responded with a version of "eat now and worry about it later!" But then, after a guilty laugh, they came through with more specific help.Week 44Dressing to fit the new you This may sound like the most obvious observation in the world, but it bears notice: Wearing clothes that actually fit will make you look thinner!Week 46Getting past your biggest weight gain A weight gain after the holiday season wasn't totally unexpected though it was dissapointing. It did, however, bring into focus an important lesson about the right way to get back on track.Week 47The good, the bad and the ugly -- a peek inside Lisa's food diary I'm not any kind of expert and I certainly can't promise that anyone who was to follow my meal plan would necessarily lose weight, but I thought it might be interesting to see and might also give you some ideas regarding your own plans.Week 48Beyond the calories -- why we eat is as important as what we eat One of the things we need tokeep in mind as we struggle with weight loss efforts is that if it were simply a matter of discipline and burning more calories than we eat, so many fewer people would be overweight.Week 49A little time in the kitchen after grocery shopping  makes dieting easier Spending a little time thinking about and preparing food for the week makes daily decisionseasier and ensures that snacks are healthy and cost effective.Week 5070 pounds down!  What made this time different? What a difference 43 weeks makes!Looking backat the flat line in my weight tracker for the past 2 months, I'm pleasantly surprised by my success insticking to my program and not giving up. After countless tries, this is absolutely the longest time I've ever stuck to a weight loss program: 50 weeks!Week 51Like Boy Scouts, dieters have to be prepared I'm definitely a big snacker. I probably eat something every 2-3 hours every day so if I don't plan and count, it's very easy to overeat without even realizing it. My main work strategy is to keep a fully stocked snack drawer so I have good choices within reach. Week 52One year down:  sticking to a diet for the long haul I've now been at this a full year -- and I've never stuck to a weight loss program for this long. At the risk of sounding repetitive, I'm going to talk about the two things that I think have made this attempt to lose weight different from the countless other attempts I've made throughout my life: making a lifestyle change and seeking out support. Week 53It's only fitting:  A new outfit for a new outlook When your comfort zone isn't changing as quickly as your weight, something as simple as choosing an outfit for the gym can make you stop and think.Week 54Lisa tries it for a week:  Amy's Diet Plan As I try to change things up in my weight loss program and also try to keep things interesting in this blog, I thought I might spend some time periodically reviewing different meal plans or food delivery programs. Here is my first experiment!Week 55Money saving tips for your diet One of the things I'm grappling with is how to lose weight on a budget. It's easy to ignore mounting bills and waning bank accounts when you rationalize that you can't put a cost on being healthy. But they are ways to make a healthy lifestyle more cost effective.Week 56When dieting becomes a group effort When I started writing this, I was disappointed in myself. But now that I've thought about my friends and talked to them about their progress, I'm inspired and ready to get back in gear. If I can do this, anybody can do this. We can all do this.Week 60Bring a bit of home along on vacation to stick to your diet plan I've written about sticking to a diet on vacation before, but I'm going to do it again - because I had a markedly different experience this time and learned some new strategies.Week 61Easy portion-controlled snack ideas This week has been all about new snack ideas for me. And it's because of one simple purchase.Week 62Recovering from a diet challenge is a mind game This week was probably one of the hardest I've had in respect to eating since starting my healthier lifestyle - and the fact that I feel like I've "beaten" it means it's also one of my best.Week 63Differences between a diet and a lifestyle change Almost every time I've posted a weight gain for a week, it's been followed by a loss, and often a significant one. What's it mean? I can't really take much away except "Stick to it!" Week 64Spring makes dieting easier The changing weather can be a mixed blessing when it comes to weight loss. On the one hand, the prospect of shorts and bathing suits can cause stress and panic - but on the other, fresh fruits and vegetables are bountiful and exercise always seems more fun when it's outside!Week 65Sometimes you have to focus on the little things in your diet Usually I'm all about the big picture and lifestyle changes and putting things in perspective. But right now that is sort of overwhelming me and I think I need to actually just focus on some very simple things that will make me feel in control again.Week 66Enjoying a holiday weekend without derailing your diet A holiday weekend can be a challenge when you're watching what you eat. Here are some tips on getting through a barbecue with your plan unscathed.Week 67The first step to weight loss  putting yourself first I realized this week that the biggest differencemaking my weight loss effort successfulright now is mymindset- I decided last February that losing weight was the most important thing in my life.Week 68When the dieting gets tough, go back to basics It's hard sometimes to stick to something for the long haul and not get a little sloppy and unfocused. I want to get back into my official gung-ho mindsetand power through to my 100-pound milestone!Week 70Remembering you cant control everything helps you control what you can As I work toward making permanent changes and try to focus on the big picture, I try to take setbacks for what they are -- temporary limitations. Week 71Lessons learned from an overeating binge This was a good week, even though it started with one of the biggest eatingbinges I've had in a very long time. I don't even really remember what set me off. But I do remember a few important things.Week 72Busting through a weight loss plateau I think plateaus are probably among the most frustrating obstacles for dieters. You feel like you're doing everything right and trying your hardest and the scale just won't budge.Week 75The scale isnt your only measure of success Even though I wasn't writing the past few weeks,I was thinking a lot about my weight loss journey over the past 18 months and how my life has changed since I started.Week 77Losing weight can be a mind game This is a treacherous part of my weight loss journey -- when I get close to a goal and the work becomeabout more than just calories-in and calories-out.Week 78Joining a gym can be a crucial part of your weight loss program I'm still struggling with sticking to my program right now. But I did lose weight this week! I think the big difference is that no matter what I'm doing as far as eating, I've been consistently very good about sticking to my gym regimen. Here aresome tips for finding and going to a gym.Week 79How important is that last 1.5 pounds? I've never want to get so caught up in the numbers on the scale and trying to reach certain goals that I sacrifice to the point that I'm resentful, so there was no good reason to change my behavior drastically just to make a goal this week.Week 81Staying motivated when weight loss progress isn't as obvious I've been trying to lose weight for a lot of reasons - for better health, for comfort and, admittedly, for how I look. And suddenly it felt like I had been working so hard and making so many sacrifices for so little return.Week 82What's next after losing 100 pounds? I spent so much time (18 months!) focused on this 100-pounds-by-my-40th goal that I didn't really spend a lot of time considering the next step.Week 83Abandoning a diet plan  and then picking it up again I gave myself a week to indulge -- and my week to get back on track starts now. Week 84When hitting a goal is the worst thing to happen to your weight loss In a weird way, hitting my birthday goal was the worst thing to happen to my weight loss plan.Week 85Getting through a rough patch in your weight loss I didn't want to write this week. And once I decided to go ahead and write, I didn't want to report my weight gain. And then I decided it was okay to admit it... everybody has rough patches... even me.Week 86Turning the tide after a weight gain Getting back on track this week was all about setting new goals. I realized that I don't do well with "negative goals": ie, "I don't want to gain this week." I really need forward moving goals, such as "I want to lose 10 pounds by October 31st " or "I want to lose 25 pounds by the end of the year."Week 87Learning to deal with deviations from the diet routine I really need to work on keeping focused on my goals and remembering that my body doesn't know when there is a special event or other excuse to eat something extravagant - it only knows calories-in and calories-out.Week 885 tips for smart snacking on a diet As I tried to get back on track this week,one thing it helped to focus on was smart snacking.Week 89Struggling with moderation in your diet I'm trying something a little different this week -- setting goals in moderation instead of perfection.Week 90Learning moderation is (almost) harder than dieting! Last week I set some goalsin moderation instead of perfection. This week I'm taking a look at how I did.Week 91Is it a plateau or is it maintenance? As far as I'm concerned, the difference between a plateau and maintenance is all mental. To me, a plateau is frustrating and feels a little like a failure, while maintenance is its own kind of struggle, but ultimately isa success.*DISCLAIMER*: THE INFORMATION CONTAINED ON OR PROVIDED THROUGH THIS SITE IS INTENDED FOR GENERAL CONSUMER UNDERSTANDING AND EDUCATION ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE.
