A Pentagon spokesperson has confirmed the deployment of the relatively small number of troops. The spokesperson indicated that it was safe to say that these troops would be on the ground this month. The troops are to be deployed in the South in Kandahar province ahead of the Taliban's anticipated spring offensive. The troops surge announced by President Obama in November 2009, has been concentrated in the Southern Provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, the Talibans homeland. The Pentagon has indicated that there will be another 1500 troops deployed during the winter making the total of an additional 3000 troops. While CBS and others have pointed to the difficulty encountered in the South, these troops could also be a replacement for 2800 Canadian troops operating in Kandahar province, Panjwaii District. Canadians will end their combat mission in July 2011. They will, however, remain in Afghanistan with 1000 troops in a training role. NATO and the Obama Administration have pointed to a commencement of a transition phase in July this year, with some withdrawals taking place. The deployment of additional Marines seems to contradict any sign of of any troops exiting. The Wallstreet Journal reported yesterday that there also seemed to be a shift of American forces on the ground, with some in a training role converting to a combat role.  The deployment of additional troops does not require Congressional approval, however it may raise some eybrowes of Obama's among Obama critics. The 112th Congress, which was sworn in yesterday, has promised to cut spending. The new House leadership said that everything was on the table, including defence spending. This new deployment is likely to renew the debate on the war in Afghanistan and the effectiveness of the surge.        1 of 3         Troops involved in Combat in Afghanistan      Karl Gotthardt is based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (66.9%) United Kingdom (5.3%) Canada (5.0%) Saudi Arabia (2.9%) 47 other countries (17.4%)           READ MORE: Afghanistan, Marines, troop deployment, Training Task, canadian troops, Withdrawal, exit strategy, Taliban Spring Offensive, Obama Administration, Pentagon, war in Afghanistan, US Marines, military history, Southern Provinces of Helmand, War Conflict, spring offensive, Obama, political-news, Washington, Human Rights Abuses, Iraq War troop surge, Helmand province campaign, Barack Obama, Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan, Taliban, political-news, Kandahar, 3rd millennium   More News From: Washington :  DC :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 11            Reply  Posted By     Benjamin Burton Jr.|3 daysagoThanks for the update. I'd heard about the initial 1400 to be deployed shortly but nothing about this. Guess that troop drawdown isn't going as scheduled.            Reply  Posted By     BorderExplorer|3 daysagoAgree with previous poster. Your report brings a new clarity to the issue.            Reply  Reply By     Karl Gotthardt|3 daysagoThanks for your comments Billie and Benjamin Burton Jr. It would appear they are shifting some troops around and sending 3000 more. How that affects the exit scheduled for July remains to be seen, however, it would appear that it will be symbolic if anything.            Reply  Posted By     Dava Castillo|3 daysagoThanks for the report Karl.I guess this means the draw down will not start in July. I wonder if there will be any new revelations in the State of Union address later this month--and I hope we don't hear "it's based on conditions on the ground" yet again. This phrase is used so much, it is losing meaning for me.            Reply  Reply By     Karl Gotthardt|3 daysagoIt seems to me if this deployment, according to the Pentagon, is to be ready for the Taliban spring offensive, then a draw down would be symbolic only.            Reply  Posted By     northsunm32|3 daysagoMaybe the 1400 troops are the ones to be drawn down in July! The U.S. shifting some troops to a combat role from training is made possible by the generosity of our Conservative government which is leaving 1000 Canadian troops to engage in training and other non-combat roles. Will the Republicans hold up the deployment until they are sure the Democrats have financing for it!            Reply  Reply By     Karl Gotthardt|3 daysagoWe have a 2800 strong contingent in Kandahar Province, Panjwaii District. It seems to me that 3000 US troops would replace these troops. The surprising part is the reshifting of US troops from training roles.            Reply  Posted By     RaulDeSouza|3 daysagoWhat is this? I thought they were thinking of bring the troops back. This is not the ending I was looking for.            Reply  Posted By     ethelsmith|3 daysagoSo much for gradually withdrawing.            Reply  Posted By     adnansaghir|3 daysagoits no use to deploy more .... instead US have to draw back all as soon as possibel            Reply  Posted By     Karl Gotthardt|3 daysagoThanks everyone for commenting. The sentiment seems to be the same for everyone, which is questioning where the draw back for next year is.
