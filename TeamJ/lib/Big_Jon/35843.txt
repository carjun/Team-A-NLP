The US is not pleased with the actions of the Pakistani military. With the countrys Intelligence service divided and helping both the US effort and seeking to work with and control part of the Taliban effort there is a problemThe US has been steadily pushing the Pakistani government for more action to take away its refuge for Taliban action s in Afghanistan ..The administration has decided to ramp up military aid to Pakistan in order for them to assume a more active role ..Vice President Biden will bring this message and ask for a wish list next week in a trip to the country..Several things come to this Dogs mind upon hearing this.I am not surprised by this action.Which reinforces my preaching that the US isnt leaving the region anytime soon.In fact as I have pointed out things are escalating in the war.While Pakistan has had to divert attention from the war to handle the recent floodsThe US/NATO effort presses on.Remember that $30 Billion Gates said was chopped of the war effort that I posted yesterday?Ill bet it ends up going to the Pakistani military.Either the whole thingOra good part of itNowhere is India mentioned in the linked Washington Post piece..Hummm?I dont suppose India is gonna be very happy with the US rearming Indias nuclear traditional adversary..Oh, yea Budget cuts and debt ceilings?You ARE joking right?Pakistan has complained in the past that promised U.S. aid, currently projected to total more than $3 billion in 2011, has been slow to arrive and that requests for helicopters and other military equipment have remained unfulfilled.Beginning with Bidens visit, the time may be ripe for a frank exchange of views and priorities between the two sides, another administration official said. The Pakistanis understand that Afghanistan-Pakistan has become the single most important foreign policy issue to the United States, and their cachet has gone up. But they also realize that they may have reached the point of maximum leverage, this official said, and things about their region are going to change one way or the other in the near future, as Congress and the American public grow increasingly disillusioned with the war and a timeline for military withdrawal is set.Something is going to give, he said. There is going to be an end-game scenario and theyre trying to guess where were heading.On intelligence, the administration plans to address Pakistans complaints that the Americans have not established enough outposts on the Afghan side of the border to stop insurgent infiltration, while pressing the Pakistanis to allow U.S. and Afghan officials to staff border coordination centers inside Pakistan itself.The intelligence coordination is part of an effort to build political, trade and security links between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a way of assuaging Pakistans fears thatIndia, its traditional adversary, is building its own influence in Afghanistan. We think theres a lot of room for improvement on that front, the senior official said..MoreObama and his senior staff have had to beat down numerous requests by in-theater military staff to take the war on to Pakistan itself in cross border raids.. I would NOT be surprised in the least bit if US Special Ops actions have already been running in and out of Pakistan.The Pakistanis are begiing to understand that although they dont think of the Afghan problem as theirs.The US impatience is..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Military, Politics, UpdatesBoots on the ground, budget cuts, Cross border US Actions, Indian Concerns, Pakistani flood action, President Obama, Taliban, US Military aid to Pakistan, VP Biden trip to PakistanRead moreThe Pentagon will be asking Congress for around $120 Billion for war fighting.January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsHummm.$535 BILLION for general Defense operations..$120 BILLION for the wars..=s $655 Billion in totalDamn. Thats a lot of MONEY!I see they are mentioning a first thought figure of $159 Billion that they say is now the $120 BillionI wouldnt count on the savings of $39 Billion.Somehow I think that money will end up back in the budget some way..For the current fiscal year, the Obama administration has assumed about $159 billion in costs for military operations, chiefly in Afghanistan and Iraq. The new estimates now appear to reflect the double impact of pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq and also getting a better handle on stepped-up operations in Afghanistan.Nonetheless it is a very different picture than President Barack Obama had once hoped for as a candidate backed by anti-war forces in his party. In contrast with the Bush-era budgets, Obama has made a point of including some place-holder for war costs in his spending plans, but these have proven more of a gesture than any accurate forecast of the dollars needed.For example, Obamas 2011 budgetjust a year ago at this time assumed $50 billion as a placeholder for contingency war funds in 2012, less than half of what now is expected to be needed.Given the nature of war and the changing tempo of operations, even detailed, timely estimates are vulnerable to the same short-comings. In some respects, the $159 billion request for 2011 may have proven too high and the extra contingency funds became an escape valve of sorts for House and Senate Appropriations looking for ways to buy new military equipment and still cope with proposed cuts from the core defense budget.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Military, Politics, The Economy, Updates$120 Billion vs $159 Billion final number, The War budget request to CongressRead moreThey are laying the groundwork for WikileaksJanuary 6, 2011jamesb101No commentsFrom the New York Times.Ex-C.I.A.

Mr. Gates was also able to persuade the White House to reduce its demands for cuts over the next five years to $78 billion from $150 billion.But even so, Mr. Adams said, I think the floor under defense spending has now gone soft But given the Congress authorizes government spending a year at a time, he said, the projected numbers beyond 2012 are up for grabs. Dont count on any of it.Once Mr. Obama releases his budget proposals in February, the battle will shift to Capitol Hill, where it is hard to predict how the cross-currents will shake out now that the Republicans control the House..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Military, Politics, The Economy, Updates$553 Billion figure, Congress, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Gates wanted more money, Program cuts, The Defense Budget, The White House, Winners/LosersRead moreCan the Defense Budget EVER be cut?.Discussion of the DayJanuary 6, 2011jamesb1017 commentsFrom the Washington Post.Gates to outline $100B in military savingsA long-troubled $14 billion program to build a landing craft for the Marine Corps is destined for the chopping block, defense officials and analysts said Wednesday, part of $100 billion in savings that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has pledged to squeeze from the Pentagons budget.Gates is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders Thursday to outline how he intends to save the $100 billion over the next five years by cutting weapons programs, Pentagon overhead costs and other portions of the Defense Departments massive bureaucracy. Gatesannounced in June that he would press the military services to find the savings with the incentive that they would be able to reinvest the money in programs essential to the current war effort and military modernization.The secretary will not only announce how much money we have saved and where we have saved it, but what new investments this will allow us to make, said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagons spokesman. This will be as much about investments as cuts.The headline of this piece is misleading.Defense Secretary Gates isnt looking to save a nickel.If you read the part from Pentagon spokesmen Morrell he clearly indicates that Gates is gonna take the saved money and use it someplace else..AndHell only be able to do that ifCongress lets him do that..So far just about every time Gates tries to kill a program.It pops back up from CongressOh, yea .Then there is this..U.S., NATO to spend $11.6B in Afghanistan The United States and its NATO allies plan to spend $11.6 billion this year buildingAfghanistans security forces, the largest yearly sum to date, as pressure mounts to shift responsibility for fighting the Taliban from the U.S.-led force toward local troops.The new funding pushes the total for 2010 and 2011 to nearly $20 billion, as much as in the seven previous years combined, said Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell, the commander of NATOs training mission in Afghanistan. Funds already spent have purchased, among other things, 24,000 Ford Rangers, 108,000 9mm pistols, 74,000 handheld radios, 44 helicopters and four bomb-sniffing robots.Its an enormous undertaking that we do, Caldwell said.NATOs decision to offer details Wednesday about the vast quantity of equipment provided and the steep cost to foreign taxpayers follows public criticism by Afghan officials that the West has not given Afghan troops and police officers adequate weaponry.I submit to you that the US and NATO cannot and will not be leaving Afghanistan anytime soonAs part of that.I also submit that the Defense budget has TONS of waste in it..Just waste that can be cut without affecting the countries overall defense.Will those cuts affect jobs?SureWill those cuts have political ramifications?AbsolutelyThe question isCan cuts ever be done?Thats the Discussion of the Day..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Military, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesCan the Defense Budget EVER be cut?, Congress, Defense Sec Gates, Discussion of the Day, The Afgahn WarRead moreAustralian Rain and Floods Updates.DSDJanuary 5, 2011jamesb1015 comments[Floodwaters have peaked in Rockhampton but more rain is already filling the Fitzroy river...]From ABC, the Australian Broadcasting CorporationMore rain on the way as flood crisis continuesMore rain is falling on flooded areas of central and southern Queensland this morning, sparking fears that the flood crisis will be prolonged and adding to the worries of locals whose homes and businesses are already under water.The rains could put pressure on the Fitzroy River in the central Queensland city of Rockhampton, where 500 homes have been evacuated and the Fitzroy has peaked at 9.2 metres.The bureau says an upper level low could dump as much as 50 millimetres of rain a day, producing totals of around 200mm in some regions by the end of the weekend.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/06/3107208.htmMore from the BBC.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Military, Other Things, UpdatesDSD @PoliticalDog101, Floods in Australia, WeatherRead moreThe Chinese have a new Stealth Fighter..January 5, 2011jamesb1011 commentThis from the New York Times on the Chinese new J-20 Stealth Fighter..Andrei Chang, the editor of Kanwa Defense Weekly in Hong Kong, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that he had been authoritatively told that the jet will make its first test flight on Thursday, weather permitting.He said Chinese officials appeared to have deliberately allowed word of the tests to become public, even to the point of bringing the jet to a Chengdu airfield, Factory 132 of the citys aircraft design institute, which is commonly watched by military hobbyists, in a bid to display the nations growing military sophistication.Defense SecretaryRobert M.

Ahmadinejad, discussing how to deal with the opposition protests, said that the Iranian people feel suffocated and said to calm the tensions it may be necessary to allow more personal and social freedoms, including more freedom of the press, the cable said. This statement incensed Revolutionary Guard Chief of Staff Mohammed Ali Jafari, who screamed back You are wrong! (In fact) it is YOU who created this mess!

The commission also called for cancellation of the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) and the F-35B version of the Joint Strike Fighter, all of which would add up to almost $43 billion in savings, but at severe emotional cost to the Corps, which has long held the Osprey and EFV as centerpieces of its modernization strategy.While no one expects all of the suggestions to be adopted, the report is a good indication of the level of congressional frustration with long-term, expensive Pentagon projects.The Bell/Boeing MV-22 Osprey is in many ways the Marines flagship program. Only the Marines and Air Force special operations selected the tiltrotor to meet their needs for lift.The V-22 has been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and took part in the assault on Marja in Afghanistans Helmand Province in 2009, ferrying Marines to the battlefield. A second squadron is deployed in Afghanistan, and another is making the types third at-sea cruise with a Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Corps has 130 aircraft and is progressing toward a goal of a 330-aircraft fleet..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Media, Military, Other Things, Politics, The Economy, Updatesbudget cuts, F-35B, President Commission on Budget Reform, US Marines Aviation/Helo's, V-22 - OspreyRead morePage 1 of 65123...65Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
