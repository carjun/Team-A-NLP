A bombkilled21people outside a Christian church intheEgyptiancityof Alexandria yesterday, and the interior ministry said a foreign-backed suicide bomber may have been responsible.The blast did not originate in any of the cars that were destroyed, a ministry statement said. It is likely that the device which exploded was carried by a suicide bomber who died among others, it added.The circumstances of this and other recent attacks clearly indicates that foreign elements undertook planning and execution, said the statement.The ministry said the blast, which wounded 70 people as worshippers left the church, had apparently been caused by a bomb in a car parked nearby.Hundreds of Christians, who make up about 10% of Egypts mainly Muslim 79 million people, took to the streets in protest. Some Christians and Muslims pelted each other with rocks, a witness said, and cars were set on fire.http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/world-news/blast-outside-christian-church-kil...                                                                                                                       A Doorbell Rings, A New Attack On Iraqi ChristiansThe latest bloody attack on Iraq's Christians was brutal in its simplicity. Militants left a bomb on the doorstep of the home of an elderly Christian couple and rang the doorbell.When Fawzi Rahim, 76, and his 78-year-old wife Janet Mekha answered the doorbell Thursday night, the bomb exploded, killing them, Mekha's brother told The Associated Press on Friday. Three other people, apparently passers-by, were wounded."When I went there, I found both of them cut to pieces near the gate of their house," said the brother, Falah al-Tabbakh, 47, who had been at a funeral nearby in the eastern Baghdad district of Ghadir. He rushed to his sister's house after neighbors called him, and they told him what happened, he said.http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101795064 groups:News, World Politics tags:Terrorism,Islam,Christians,Bombings,Muslim Violence 1 more|105 comments// Merry Christmas!

Also don't feed the troll. 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  Ryuu88:the news comes from a legitimate source. perhaps my headline is a bit slanted but i learned that method from dan rather and the other fine folks in the left wing media. peace 7 days agoflag  reply0Prijedor  congoboy:Its nice to know that the left influence you so much 7 days agoflag  reply0Ryuu88  congoboy:I don't give a rats ass about which side you learned it from it is disgraceful to constantly present only the facts that support your own irrational argument and focus only on the aspects of the story which support your own twisted view of what is happening. And then to attempt to pass it off as actually journalism is disgusting. That is all that I will say about the matter, enjoy your Faux news and Glenn Beck you ignorant fool. 6 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  Ryuu88:wow, youre so right on! but those are the exact thoughts i had about you, except i'd have said wolf blitzer and cnn instead. eerie huh? 3 days agoflag  reply+1Mikey_PogoloffRobert Gates was/is Secretary of Defense for both GWB and Obama.  Gates was Zbigniew Brzezinski's side kick way back when Zbigniew thought it was a good idea to fund, train, equip, and covertly direct the mujahadeen in Afghanistan, a precursor to Al Qaeda.  When asked whether he regrets this decision Brzezinski flatly states:"What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war?"http://www.counterpunch.org/brzezinski.htmlhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaiJtLrEwVU&feature=relatedThis support did not end after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  In fact it continued through from the conflict in Yugoslavia all the way up to the day of 9/11.  We supported Saddam, We supported Iran, we supported Ho Chi Minh, Castro, many American companies were even complicit in aiding the Nazis. 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  Mikey_Pogoloff:and many of them were democrats. i'm not sure i get your point 7 days agoflag  reply+2Mikey_Pogoloff  congoboy:I know that's because you are too stupid and too partisan.  plenty of others will get it so that's fine. 7 days agoflag  reply+1Prijedor  Mikey_Pogoloff:I think that cleared it up for him 7 days agoflag  reply+6The_PharaohI am from Egypt btw, no one claimed this operation yet!! nor have our police figured out who did it yet!! so blame it on Muslims, its easier that way!you should search for Egyptian people nowadays, Christians and Muslims, on Facebook for example and see their DPs, all you'll see is a black image with a crescent and a cross (representing Islam and Christianity) together as one! we are sending the world a message here, we are Egyptians, and we among each other DO NOT care about some one's religion!if you guys can read Arabic, search Facebook for MUSLIM groups organizing events to attend the 7th of January ceremonies with Egyptian CHRISTIANS to either PROTECT THEM if another terrorist attack happens or DIE WITH THEM if they have too...But of course, "liberal west media" won't cover anything like this, it's boring with no crazy terrorists claiming they're Muslims 7 days agoflag  reply-3congoboy  The_Pharaoh:i am not blaming egyptians my friend. but it is most likely the efforts of islamo-facism from outside of egypt. egypt has become a great friend of the west and has also been very supportive of israel. you are a progressive country in the middle of an unfortunate war zone of destructive fundamentalists. and youre right, western liberal media rarely focuses on reality, they make it their job to misinform an ignorant public for their own political desires. peace 7 days agoflag  reply0of10rot10  The_Pharaoh:I blame idiots!  Idiots for the bombings and them more idiots who write stories that are slanted.  YOU keep setting the record straight.  There are many of us who aren't buying into all the hate crap.  I'm not a fan of religion, any, but I hate scapgoating even more.Egypt has enjoyed a long peace and it's immoral that there are those who wish to end that peace.  I hope you all catch these idiots SOON. 6 days agoflag  reply+1The_Pharaoh  congoboy:so support for Israel is what makes Egypt "a good friend of the west"? and not an "Islamo-Facist"?I am not only talking about merely Egyptians here, nor am I talking about views of Israel, or anything to do with the west. I am talking about Egyptian that are (Arabs) and (Muslims), the same Arabs, Muslims who keep being called terrorists in every thing that happens, just because Al-Qaeda claim they're Arabs and Muslims too, so we're all taken as a whole lot.This support for their fellow christian brothers, that's their true religion, the one you sarcastically called "religion of peace". 6 days agoflag  reply0The_Pharaoh  of10rot10:we all hope they will soon, sadly not betting on it though! we have a retarded Interior Affairs minister who couldn't care less, yet they won't kick him off because he is helping Mubarak stay in throne... political rottenness in its finest. 6 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  The_Pharaoh:just trying to be friendly, guess maybe youre not one of the friends of the west i was referring to. while it may be true that not all muslims are terrorists, most terrorists are muslim. its not your fault or mine, it is the fault of the extremists who have high jacked a religion. shalom 6 days agoflag  reply0of10rot10  The_Pharaoh:Then let us hope for a positive change in your Government very soon.  As someone who just barely survive 8 years of Bush I can understand a corrupt Government all too well.You will be in my thoughts. 6 days agoflag  reply+4randallr01Just another atrocity committed in the name of Religion. 7 days agoflag  reply-4Sparky2UMuslims don't have a Santaallah's lap to sit on and ask for M-16's under their allah tree? No ? No wonder they are jealous what better way to display it than to blow up some Christians! 7 days agoflag  reply+4jubalWe can thank Greedy American Corporations and their complicit partners in crime in Washington for this. The real terrorists are in Washington DC elected by us under lies and false pretenses...They are on both sides of the so called "aisle". 7 days agoflag  reply-3congoboy  jubal:and i am sure that is exactly what was on the minds of the islamo-facists that planned and implemented this horrific murderous inhumanity against those innocent peace loving  christians 7 days agoflag  reply+3Itsbatman_Durr  congoboy:it may be true that the terrorists are terrorists because they are muslims, and they attacked the victims because they are christians. but that is not the same as saying they are terrorists because of islam, or the victims were victims because of christianity. its a fine distinction that the media and other biased people seem to forget or ignore. It is like saying we bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki because they were japanese, as opposed to we bombed them because we were at war with japan. 7 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  Itsbatman_Durr:huh? 7 days agoflag  reply0Prijedor  congoboy:you would be too stupid to understand what he wrote 6 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  Prijedor:if you followed that dialog than you are more stupid than i and if you understood it than you are worse off than he. typical leftylib 6 days agoflag  reply+1Yasmancarslut is a cocksucker. Congoboy -  so the english, french and other EUROPEANS were protecting THEIR homeland in Jerusalem and the muslims (arabs, turks) were the marauding hordes! I think you need a lesson in geography first before we get to the history lesson. What an ignorant muppet!! 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  Yasman:back in the day as usual, the muslims couldnt get along with their neighbors and ran amok. killing, murdering and raping everything in their path. jerusalem belonged to the christians as ins their nature muslims took away what didnt belong to them.think you need to do some more research fool 7 days agoflag  reply+1coxian_armada  congoboy:ahh Christians did the same thing, with the order from the Vatican 7 days agoflag  reply-3congoboy  coxian_armada:sure, and it was inexcusable then, and even more so now by the islamo-facists. but the mind set is a little different theses days. the intent of the islamo-faciists is to take out innocent victims and intentionally terrorize people and nations. their a bit ahead of the curve of the christians of yesteryear. 7 days agoflag  reply+1of10rot10  congoboy:I don't know where you got that verson of history, a comic book or dime-store preacher but it couldn't be more WRONG if you tried!Jerusalem NEVER "belonged" to the xians!!!

So paybacks are inevitable. Do you report on the abuse they cause? the violence they condone? No. I rarely see them. 7 days agoflag  reply+3jubal  Peacey:Indeed the so called Christian Religion of Peace are the first ones to call for punishment and execution of dissidents and social outcasts. 7 days agoflag  reply0Aaron_Brutus  Peacey:I never see them. 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  Peacey:great research peacey, now pull your head out of your ignorant christophobic ass and catch the train to reality 7 days agoflag  reply+5TypeMemeHereIt's a shame extremists use such cowardly devices like terrorism. It's a greater shame that people see this as one religion vs. another. 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  TypeMemeHere:the sad thing is that essentially it is one religion against another. you think its some other social stigma thats causing islam-facists to murder everyone who disagrees with their way of thought? its not just christians though, theyre just one of the latest minority groups these 7th century cut throat throw backs have attacked 7 days agoflag  reply0TypeMemeHere  congoboy:It is NOT 'essentially one religion versus another"That oversimplification is one of the root causes of extremisms far reach. 7 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  TypeMemeHere:sometimes the best answers are found in the simplest of examples. but essentially youre right. its a group of rampaging murderous jerk wads who happen to be mostly of one particular faith preying on idividuals and groups of innocent victims who many times happen to coincidentally be of a different faith. 6 days agoflag  reply+8ozoneoceanFuck off you racist cockmonkey.This is an act of terrorism, not "religion".

I am going to try and use it as many times as possible today.  I love it.  And thanks for the graphic, Bales. 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  ozoneocean:youre half right, it is terrorism. terrorism in the name of one religion against another they disagree with. its called uber intolerance. i think they already started stirring the pot of hatred themselves a long long time ago. i'm just reporting the facts so if you dont like it you can go ahead and rebury your head in the sands of ignorance. 7 days agoflag  reply0congoboy  jubal:i was gonna, but never mind. 7 days agoflag  reply+1maasanovaNow this time I agree that Christians are often targeted by Muslims in Egypt, but it's general discrimination, raping of females ect, but not suicide bombers.Still we should always check these reports for accuracy in reporting, and any bias that might come as a result of the reporting.The devil is in the details:"A bombkilled21people outside a Christian church intheEgyptiancityof Alexandria yesterday, and the interior ministry said a foreign-backed suicide bomber MAY have been responsible."What this means is that they don't know with certainty who carried out the attack, but the suicide bomber is the working THEORY."The circumstances of this and other recent attacks clearly indicates that FOREIGN ELEMENTS undertook planning and execution, said the statement."So just who are these FOREIGN ELEMENTS?Since this report is blaming Al Qaeda, and we know thatt Al Qaeda is nothing more than a US intelligence database, we can also posit the theory that these FOREIGN ELEMENTS could actually be foreign Western intelligence assets (ie: US/Britain/Israeli) who stage terror in order to pit Christians against Muslims as the president so clearly stated:"Wicked terrorists targeted the nation, Copts and Muslims, he said, adding that the terrorists would fail in any plans to destabilise Egypt or divide Muslims and Christians."Interesting that these Muslim "fanatics" choose the sucide bomb instead of simply placing a bomb somewhere and igniting it with a cell phone, like other foreign intelligence assets do. Also interesting that the Iraq-linked terrorists didn't even exist in Iraq until the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. 7 days agoflag  reply+3bailey78  maasanova:News alert  Christian bombs have killed thousands in a country that it's only crime is it has the oil our GOVERMENT wants. 7 days agoflag  reply-1jubal  bailey78:Religion has everything to do with this because it is religion that has pushed people to these extremes. Death to all religions everywhere. 7 days agoflag  reply+1bailey78  jubal:well you have the right to say that just as much as they have the right to be religious nuts. 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  maasanova:might want to double check your own sources 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  bailey78:that wasnt religion, that was justifiable intolerance. although i believe the crimes were a bit deeper than that. but if you wanna talk about obamas quagmire in afghanistan, now thats an unjust war. 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  jubal:you dont love the baby jesus? 7 days agoflag  reply0bailey78  congoboy:You mean the war that bush started? 7 days agoflag  reply0jubal  congoboy:What baby jesus?

They DO happen to be Muslim unless it is your contention that Muslims only do the fanaticism and hatred thing and there is none of that found in any other people of a differing religion.  No, it's religion. 7 days agoflag  reply0Itsbatman_Durr  Paratus:when the lutherans have their homeland stolen at tank point and are forced to live among peoples whose cultures have experienced hatred for each other for centuries, give me a call.its situational not religion 7 days agoflag  reply-1congoboy  Itsbatman_Durr:try telling that to the islamo-facists 7 days agoflag  reply-1congoboy  Itsbatman_Durr:not stolen, legally acquired thorough a war fought in 1967 when israel was unjustifiably attacked by heathens 7 days agoflag  reply0of10rot10  congoboy:http://www.mideastweb.org/briefhistory.htmCan't stress that web site enough with somebody so misinformed as you!That land was stolen LONG before 1967.

We went to their land and started killing them. Remember GHW Bush went over there and caused them to want to kill us. Then His no account son went back over there to start some more shit with them. They have a right to be pissed off at us Thanks to the bush family and their cronies. they were happy fighting amongst themselves. Then bush and his friends desided they wanted the oil for themselves so they desided to cut the middle man out. We have been hated by the rest of the world ever sense. How kind are the christians? go ask a native American. 7 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  bailey78:those fuckers have been killing and or attempting to kill us long before gwb's justifiable shock and awe. i like your attempt at history revision though, a+ 7 days agoflag  reply0bailey78  congoboy:I just know thay I saw it after Bush Sr started the war with saddam hussein.
