User:Yellow Evan/sandbox 2005 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaUser:Yellow Evan/sandbox 2005From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia< User:Yellow EvanJump to: navigation,searchThis article documents a current event. Information may change rapidly as the event progresses.The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season officially began June 1, 2005, and will last through November 30, 2005. These dates conventionally delimit the period when most tropical cyclones are expected to form in the Atlantic Ocean.The season began quickly, with tropical storms and major hurricanes forming unusually early. Two tropical storms formed in June and three formed in early July. When Dennis formed on July 5, it was the earliest date on record for four named storms to have formed in the Atlantic basin. The previous record for earliest storm formation was in the 1959 season, when Hurricane Cindy was designated a tropical storm on July 7 (because 1959's third storm was not named, the fourth storm that year was given the "C" name). On July 11, with the designation of Tropical Storm Emily, 2005 also claimed 1959's record (Debra on July 23) for the earliest formation of a season's fifth named system.When its sustained winds reached 150 mph on July 8, Hurricane Dennis also became the strongest storm to form before August; and when Emily strengthened this became successively the only year on record apart from 1916 to have two major hurricanes before the end of July, and then the only year at all to have two at category 4 (only 1999 and 2004 achieved this by the end of August).Atlantic hurricane seasons2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008Wikinews has news related to:Hurricane season, 2005SaffirSimpson Hurricane ScaleCategoryWind speedStorm surgemph(km/h)ft(m)Five 156( 250)> 18(> 5.5)Four131155(210249)1318(4.05.5)Three111130(178209)912(2.73.7)Two96110(154177)68(1.82.4)One7495(119153)45(1.21.5)Additional classificationsTropicalstorm3973(63117)03(00.9)Tropicaldepression038(062)0(0)Contents1 Pre-season forecasts2 Storms2.1 Tropical Storm Arlene2.2 Tropical Storm Bret2.3 Tropical Storm Cindy2.4 Hurricane Dennis2.5 Hurricane Emily2.6 Tropical Storm Franklin2.7 Tropical Storm Gert2.8 Tropical Storm Harvey2.9 Tropical Storm Irene2.10 Tropical Deppresion Ten2.11 Tropical Storm Jose2.12 Hurricane Katrina2.13 Tropical Depression Thirteen2.14 Tropical Storm Lee2.15 Hurricane Maria2.16 Hurricane Nate2.17 Hurricane Ophelia2.18 Hurricane Philippe2.19 Tropical Storm Rita3 2005 storm names4 See also5 External links[edit] Pre-season forecastsForecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William Gray and his associates at Colorado State University, and separately by NOAA forecasters.Dr. Gray's team defines the average number of storms per season (19502000) as 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, and 2.3 hurricanes reaching or exceeding Category 3 strength. A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6 to 14 named storms, with 4 to 8 of those reaching hurricane strength, and 1 to 3 reaching or exceeding Category 3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale.On December 3, 2004, Dr. Gray's team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average season (11 named storms, 6 hurricanes, 3 of Category 3 or higher). Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States and the Florida peninsula. Though the forecast predicts above-normal activity, the level predicted is less than in the 2004 season.In its April 1, 2005 update, Dr. Gray's team revised the December forecast upward. The updated forecast predicted 13 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and three of Category 3 or greater strength. The chance of a storm striking the U.S. was also raised slightly.On May 16, 2005, NOAA issued its outlook for the 2005 season, forecasting a 70% chance of above-normal activity, with 12-15 named storms, 7-9 hurricanes, and 3-5 hurricanes reaching Category 3 intensity. The Accumulated Cyclone Energy value for the season is expected to be 120-190 percent of the median.On May 31, Dr. Gray's team revised its April forecast upwards. The updated forecast predicted 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 hurricanes greater than Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[edit] Storms[edit] Tropical Storm ArleneMain article: Tropical Storm Arlene (2005)Arlene image and trackEarly in the seasonnearly two months earlier than first-storm formation in 2004a low-pressure area formed and persisted north of Honduras. Significant shear from the southwest pushed the convective storms away from the low-pressure center. However, the low managed to organize, and was designated Tropical Depression One on June 8. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene the next day.Arlene began heading slowly north toward western Cuba. Arlene was a large but poorly organized and relatively weak storm; the shear that had slowed its initial development continued to push most of the storm's activity to the northeast. It produced precipitation over a very wide area; the Cayman Islands reported tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain over 150 miles (240 km) east of the center.As it crossed the western tip of Cuba on the morning of June 10, the storm began gaining strength. Since most of the precipitation was north and east of the center of circulation, Florida was drenched by the storm over a day before actual landfall, and far east and well ahead of landfall, tornado watches were issued for the Florida peninsula [1]. With the storm now in the Gulf of Mexico, the shear relaxed somewhat and Arlene's winds increased to just under Category 1 hurricane strength.While the reduction in shear had allowed for strengthening, the bulk of the storm was still located to the northeast of the center. The only death attributed to Arlene was a woman caught in riptide in Miami Beach, Florida, far from the center of circulation.[2]Arlene made landfall just west of Pensacola, Florida around 2 pm CDT (1900 UTC) on June 11, though most of its effects were onshore long before the center. Arlene was the most intense landfalling June storm since Hurricane Allison in the 1995 season.Though weakened heavily by landfall, Arlene persisted as a dissipating tropical depression, passing into Indiana on June 12 and Michigan on June 13, dropping several inches of rain along its path.The NHC's archive on Tropical Storm Arlene.The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center's archive on Arlene.[edit] Tropical Storm BretBret image and trackLate in June, an area of disturbed weather formed in the Bay of Campeche. A Hurricane Hunter flight was dispatched #, and on arrival found a closed circulation [3]. This observation caused the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Two in the evening of June 28. Two hours later, observations from the same aircraft indicated that it had reached tropical storm strength, and it was named Tropical Storm Bret.This was the first time two tropical storms had formed in June since the 1986 season, and only the thirteenth time since 1851. (Two tropical depressions formed in June in the 2003 season, but only one developed into a tropical storm.)The storm moved west-northwest, making landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico around 7 AM CDT (1200 UTC) on June 29 as a weak tropical storm. It continued inland, producing heavy rain over the state of Veracruz, until dissipating over the mountains of San Luis Potosi late on June 29.Hundreds of homes were damaged, and several towns, including Naranjos and Chinampa, about 60 miles south of Tampico, were severely flooded ([4]). The only reported casualties are the occupants of a car swept away by flood waters in Naranjos, who are still missing ([5]).The NHC's archive on Tropical Storm Bret.[edit] Tropical Storm CindyMain article: Tropical Storm Cindy (2005)Tropical Storm Cindy just before landfall on July 6, 2005 at 0245 UTC.Early season activity continued in July, with a vigorous tropical wave strengthening into Tropical Depression Three in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on July 3. While it began organizing quickly, it did not reach tropical storm strength before striking the Yucatn Peninsula early on July 4. Once over land, the organizing trend stopped, and the depression began losing its circulation.Later on July 4, a new center of circulation began forming to the north of the original center over the Gulf of Mexico. Early the next day it strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Cindy. The storm began heading north across the Gulf towards Louisiana and made landfall near Grand Isle late on July 5, and started losing strength over Mississippi and Alabama. It lost tropical characteristics over the Carolinas on July 7.Even though it had weakened to a depression and was well inland, Cindy's effects were still felt; some parts of Atlanta Motor Speedway and Tara Field airport in Hampton, Georgia suffered severe damage from an F2 tornado spawned by the storm ([6]). Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta had over 5 inches (130 mm) of rain on July 6, its sixth-highest one day rainfall ever (since 1878). Most of that fell during just two hours (8 to 10 pm EDT). This is more rain than it normally gets in all of July. Many other places, such as Slidell, Louisiana, Gulfport, Mississippi, Mobile, Alabama, and Salisbury, Maryland also saw over 5 inches.Three deaths were attributed to Cindy - two in Georgia and another in Alabama.The NHC's archive on Tropical Storm Cindy.The HPC's archive on Tropical Storm Cindy[edit] Hurricane DennisMain article: Hurricane DennisHurricane Dennis on July 10 as the storm made landfall at 1915 UTC.Tropical Depression Four formed in the southeastern Caribbean on the evening of July 4, the first storm of the season to form away from Mexico and Central America. On the morning of July 5, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dennis in the eastern Caribbean. The newly named storm began moving rapidly to the west-northwest.It reached hurricane strength on the afternoon of July 6 while approaching the southern coast of Hispaniola as a strong and well-organized Category 1 storm. The next day it strengthened rapidly to become a Category 4 major hurricane, the earliest in the season that a storm reached this strength since Hurricane Audrey in 1957. The track then turned slightly more to the north, bringing Dennis between Jamaica and Haiti on July 7.Just south of Cuba, Dennis intensified into the strongest storm on record to form before August in the Atlantic basin. On July 8, Dennis passed over Cuba close to the capital, Havana. After moving over Cuba, it dropped to Category 1 intensity. However, it rapidly strengthened as it moved north toward the Gulf Coast of the United States, reaching Category 4 again before passing over cooler water along the coast and weaking to Category 3 intensity. Dennis made landfall on July 10 on Santa Rosa Island southeast of Pensacola, Florida.Dennis claimed at least 70 lives: 44 in Haiti, 16 in Cuba, and 10 in the US. Also, more than 100 people have been reported missing in Haiti.The NHC's archive on Hurricane Dennis.The HPC's archive on Hurricane Dennis[edit] Hurricane EmilySatellite imageEmily image and trackMain article: Hurricane Emily (2005)Tropical Depression Five formed in the central tropical Atlantic the evening of July 10. Late on July 11, it strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Emily.Initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the Greater Antilles, Emily instead moved almost due west toward the Windward Islands, remaining a moderate tropical storm.The storm languished while moving quickly west, and struggled with maintaining its form. Contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind, Hurricane Dennis made portions of the Caribbean Sea warmer, and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development. Late on July 13, it strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing Tobago and entering the western Caribbean.The intensification trend picked up again the next day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm's central pressure. Hurricane Emily's winds increased in reaction, bringing the storm to Category 4 strength early on July 15. Emily became a Category 5 hurricane a few days later before rapidly weakened to a tropical depression. It was a depression for 6 hours before it regained tropical storm status. Emily reached winds of 70 mph but shear wakened Emily to a TD by the time it made landfall in MexicoA fatality is reported in Grenada.[edit] Tropical Storm FranklinMain article: Tropical Storm Franklin (2005)A tropical wave off the Bahamas organized into the sixth tropical depression of the 2005 season on the afternoon of July 21. The depression became the sixth named storm of the season twelve hours later. Franklin was a weak tropical storm as it brought heavy rain to the Bahamas, with twevle deaths reported. Nussa was also decalred a distaer area. The storm headed northwards from the Bahamas, then northeast over the Atlantic, becoming disorganised by July 24 under the effects of shear and dryer air. This caused Franklin to weaken to a 40 mph Tropical Storm. Franklin soon merged with a cold front.[edit] Tropical Storm GertTropical Storm Gert taken July 24, 2005, making landfall in Mexico.A tropical wave, which had earlier crossed the Yucatn peninsula, organized into the seventh tropical depression of the 2005 season on the afternoon of July 23 in the Bay of Campeche, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert early the next day. Gert move inland and dissipated that day.[edit] Tropical Storm HarveyAfter lingering off the east coast of the U.S. for several days, a tropical wave finally strengthened into the eighth depression of the season due southwest of Bermuda on August 2. Due to its proximity and projected path towards Bermuda, a tropical storm warning was issued for the island. It became a tropical storm the next day. harvey gradly became a 65 mph Tropical storm. Harvey went extratropical on August 8[edit] Tropical Storm IreneTropical Storm Irene , with 60 mph windsTropical Depression Nine formed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on the afternoon of August 4, the second Cape Verde-type hurricane of the season. Despite poor organization and shearing winds, it slowly strengthened, and was classified as Tropical Storm Irene on August 7. Irene became a 50 mph Tropical Storm. Then Irene weakend back to a deppresion. Irene did restrenthinged to a tropical storm. Irene rapidly weakend back to a deppresion, shortly after that. Irene soon disspated to disorgastion. The Rements of Irene contuied east-norteast. Convection flared up August 11 and on August 14 Irene regrentated. Irene maniged to strenthing into a 60 mph Tropical Storm. Despite that fact, it disspated the next day. Irene's remins merged with an extratropical cyclone a few days later[edit] Tropical Deppresion TenTropical Depression Ten formed 1000 miles (1610 km) east of the Lesser Antilles on August 11. Conditions were not favorable for development, as strong vertical shear literally ripped the system apart, and advisories were discontinued August 14 when it showed no organized or deep convection.[edit] Tropical Storm JoseTropical Depression Eleven formed in the Bay of Campeche on August 22. Later in the day it strengthened into Tropical Storm Jose over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. It strengthened to 50 mph winds, possibly higher, before making landfall in the state of Veracruz early on August 23.[edit] Hurricane KatrinaKatrina at peak intesityMain article: Hurricane KatrinaAt 2:35 PM EDT on August 23, a tropical depression formed over the Southeastern Bahamas. The depression was over the same areas that Franklin deviated a month earlier. The system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Katrina on the morning of August 24. Katrina became the fourth hurricane of the 2005 season on August 25.Katrina made landfall on the afternoon of August 25. Katrina then began to rapidly dissipate. However, the remains of Katrina passed through the Florida Panhandle and became extratropical over the the moutains of Ohio a week after it made landfall.Damage to a mobile home in Davie, Florida following Hurricane Katrina.So far, seven fatalities have been reported in southern Florida. Two of the deaths were from falling trees, one man crashed into a tree, one person died when their boat capsized, one when waves battered their boat, and one man was found floating in the water around Florida City. A family of five out over the southwestern coast of Florida was suspected dead, but found later alive and rescued by the Coast Guard.Katrina's landfall was in South Florida, where it hit as a Category 1 hurricane. The damage was fairly minimal, and 11 fatalities were reported.[1] More than 1million customers were left without electricity, and damage in Florida was estimated at between $1 and $2billion (with most of the damage coming from flooding and overturned trees). Rainfall was heavy in places and exceeded 14 inches (350 mm) in Homestead, Florida,and a storm surge of 3  5 feet (1.5 m) was measured in parts of Monroe County.In Virginia, a tornado related to Katrina's outer bands touched down in Marshall, damaging at least 13 homes. In addition, electricity was cut for about 4,000 customers. No deaths or injuries were reported.Significant flooding has been reported in several communities in West Virginia, including Sissonville, forcing some local evacuations.Damage to an Exxon gas station in Pensacola, Florida during Hurricane Katrina.Two traffic fatalities related to Katrina were also reported and moderate to locally heavy damage was reported in Florida.Arkansas avoided damage from Katrina, as the storm passed to the east. The state established KARE (Katrina Assistance Relief Effort), a toll free telephone number and website for evacuees seeking assistance.[2], and provided deep discounts on spaces at its state parks, waiving pet restrictions, and allowing evacuees to stay even if other travelers have confirmed reservations (bumped travelers were offered either space at another state park or a gift certificate for future use). The governor instructed state agencies to take care of human needs first and worry about paperwork later.Western Kentucky was already suffering flooding from storms that had passed through during the weekend prior to Katrina's arrival. Part of Christian County High School, located just outside Hopkinsville, collapsed during the weekend. Significant flooding has been reported in the Hopkinsville area, and many homes were flooded. One person was also killed in flood waters during Katrina that had already been high from the previous storm.[3]Governor Ernie Fletcher, declared Christian, Todd and Trigg counties disaster areas due to flooding,[4] and declared a statewide state of emergency.[5]Western New York had many reports of flooding, as well as damage caused by fallen trees as a result of Katrina. At least 4,500 customers were left without power in the Buffalo and Rochester areas.[6][7]Damage (primarily to trees which knocked into some neighborhoods) and flooding was also reported in the northern part of the state, near the Ontario border. About 1,100 customers lost power in that area.In Ohio, some flooding and power outages were reported (including about 2,500 in the easternmost part of the state alone), and several areas were evacuated throughout the state. One hospital had to be evacuated as it lost power and its generator failed in Dennison, but it was restored later in the day. Two deaths were blamed on the storm in Ohio, both indirect deaths from an automobile accident caused by Katrina's rains in Huron County north of the village of Monroeville.A force F-0 tornado hit Warren County on August 30, causing minor damage in Morrow and Salem Township. Three houses were damaged but no injuries were reported.[8]On August 30 heavy rain and tropical storm force wind gusts were reported in Southern Ontario as Katrina passed over the area before dissipating into a remnant low in the east. Port Colborne and Brockville appeared to receive the most rain, both with over 4inches (10.2cm).[9] Other regions in the province reported 1-2inches (2.5-5cm) of rain, except near the New York border where up to 3inches (7.6cm) was reported. There were also some spotty reports of flooding and damage due to fallen trees.In Pennsylvania, at least two tornadoes spawned from Katrina's outer bands and touched down in south-central part of the state south of Harrisburg. Numerous trees were brought down and several roofs damaged.[10]On August 31, the storm system previously known as Katrina was partially absorbed by a front and continued to produce heavy rainfall down the St. Lawrence River Valley. Several villages in the northeastern part of Quebec have been isolated due to multiple washouts. Sections of roads were destroyed, effectively cutting these villages off via land travel. Affected areas were supplied by boats normally supplying the Magdalen Islands.[11] The system crossed over uninhabited areas of Labrador before completely dissipating.At least 80,000 customers were without power, primarily in the Memphis and Nashville areas.Some damage has been reported, primarily due to fallen trees. However, there have been no deaths or injuries reported in Tennessee as a result of Katrina.Tennessee was also being used as a staging area for Gulf Coast evacuees, particularly in and around Memphis.[edit] Tropical Depression ThirteenTropical Depression Thirteen formed from a Tropical Wave about 960 miles east of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. It did not become a Tropical Storm and dissipated the next day.[edit] Tropical Storm LeeMain article: Tropical Storm Lee (2005)Storm pathTropical Depression Fourteen formed from a tropical wave August 31. It became Tropical Storm Lee that day. Early the next morning Lee went extratropical.[edit] Hurricane MariaTropical Depression 15 formed from a tropical wave 1100 statute miles (1,770 km) east of the Leeward Islands on September 1, and strengthened to Tropical Storm Maria the next day. On early September 4, Maria became the fifth hurricane of the season. On September 5 it briefly strengthened to category 3 intensity, making it the fourth major hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened, though, and was thought to have dropped to tropical storm strength late on September 6. Later measurements showed it was still a hurricane with a large radius, and it remained so until late on September 8.Advisories ceased on September 10 as Maria became extratropical mid-way between Cape Race and the Azores. It never threatened land as a hurricane, but Maria became a strong extratropical storm, and actually strengthened while moving towards Iceland. Measurements taken of the storm on September 11 showed it had deepened dramatically to 970 mbar - much stronger than the 989 mbar it had when the NHC issued their last advisory.The remnants of Maria buffeted Iceland with gusty winds and heavy rains on September 13.The NHC's archive on Hurricane Maria.[edit] Hurricane NateHurricane Nate just south of Bermuda.A well-defined low pressure system located about 350 statute miles (560 km) south-southwest of Bermuda was determined to be a tropical depression on September 5. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Nate that evening and continued to strengthen with little change in position, becoming the sixth hurricane of the season on September 7.As Nate moved towards Bermuda a hurricane watch was issued, Nate seemed to spare the island from a direct hit, and just barely brushed it. A tropical storm warning was issued for the island instead. Hurricane Nate passed 125 statute miles (200 km) south of Bermuda on September 8. It became extratropical over the central Atlantic Ocean on September 10.Canadian Navy ships headed to the US Gulf Coast to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina were slowed down trying to avoid Nate and Ophelia. The ships were loaded with relief supplies including lumber, thousands of diapers, blankets and cots along with its crew sent to assist in the situation. [7]The NHC's archive on Hurricane Nate.[edit] Hurricane OpheliaMain article: Hurricane Ophelia (2005)Hurricane Ophelia on September 15, 2005.Tropical Depression Seventeen formed from an area of disturbed weather over the northern Bahamas on September 6. Early on September 7 it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Ophelia, and it became the seventh Atlantic hurricane of the season the next day. It churned nearly stationary for two days off the coast of Florida, causing warnings to be raised for the state and fears of heavy, prolonged rainfall. On September 9 to September 11, Ophelia fluctuated in strength, being twice downgraded to a tropical storm only to regain hurricane intensity, while still moving only very slowly and erratically in a northeasterly direction. Through September 12 the storm completed a clockwise loop, then adopted a more north-westerly motion towards North Carolina, while still moving only slowly and fitfully. It dropped again just below hurricane strength, the inner-core of convection collapsed. It regained hurricane strength over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Due to the collapse of the inner core of convection, it gave the hurricane an unusually large eye over 100 nautical miles (175 km) across. The eye has stayed offshore, although the western eyewall has been reaching the coastal areas of North Carolina, and damage has been extensive in the Outer Banks and other coastal areas due to the slow movement and storm surge. It then began to dissipate and it remains brought rain to Canada.[edit] Hurricane PhilippeA vigorous tropical wave that moved off the African coast on September 9 showed increasing signs of organization for at least four days before being recognized as Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17. By this time it had moved across the Atlantic Ocean, about 370 miles (600 km) from Barbados. It was upgraded to a tropical storm late that evening. On September 18, Philippe was upgraded to a hurricane. Then it merged with an extratropical low.[edit] Tropical Storm RitaAt the tail end of an old frontal boundary, convection and low level circulation around an upper level low steadily developed for over two days. A surface low formed near it, and the season's 18th tropical depression formed soon thereafter east of the Turks and Caicos Islands. It became the 17th tropical storm of the season on September 18, less than a day after forming. This marks only the second time that the 'R' name has been used to name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1953. The other time was for Roxanne in 1995. Rita made landfall on the keys with peak winds of 50 mph. Rita rapidly weakened over the keys.[edit] 2005 storm namesThe following names will be used for tropical storms and hurricanes that form in the North Atlantic in 2005. This is the same list used for the 1999 season, with the exceptions of Franklin and Lee, which replace Floyd and Lenny. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. Names not yet assigned are marked in gray. Bold names are currently active.ArleneBretCindyDennisEmilyFranklinGertHarveyIreneJoseKatrinaLeeMariaNateOpheliaPhilippe (unused)Rita (unused)Stan (unused)Tammy (unused)Vince (unused)Wilma (unused)[edit] See alsoList of Atlantic hurricane seasonsTropical cycloneSaffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale2005 Pacific hurricane season[edit] External linksNational Hurricane Center's Atlantic Tropical Weather Outlook - updated four times dailyNational Hurricane CenterWilliam Gray's 2005 Extended Range Forecast (issued December 3, 2004)Cite error: There are <ref> tags on this page, but the references will not show without a {{Reflist}} template or a <references/> tag; see the help page.Retrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Yellow_Evan/sandbox_2005"Personal toolsLog in / create accountNamespacesUser pageDiscussionVariantsViewsReadEditView historyActionsSearchNavigationMain pageContentsFeatured contentCurrent eventsRandom articleDonate to WikipediaInteractionHelpAbout WikipediaCommunity portalRecent changesContact WikipediaToolboxWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPrint/exportCreate a bookDownload as PDFPrintable version  This page was last modified on 29 October 2009 at 22:43.Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;additional terms may apply.See Terms of Use for details.Wikipedia is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization.Contact usPrivacy policyAbout WikipediaDisclaimers
