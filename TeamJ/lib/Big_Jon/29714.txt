Later, he ran Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign and the historic recount effort that ended with Gore conceding the race to George W. Bush.Daley went into business after that race, and is now Midwest chairman of JPMorgan Chase.The Daleys have a reputation in Illinois as the "Chicago Mob" of politics.  They are to Democratic politics what the Bush family is to Republican politics.Add to that background William Daley's efforts to get NAFTA passed and his current connections to foreclosure-gate Chase...  could Obama have made a more revealing choice?

And looking specifically at the career of William Daley, I think it's a little tin-eared to put a career banker in as the White House chief of staff at a time when bankers are one of the few professions more loathed than politicians.Of course, that's just the political aspect of it. (Also with regard to politics, this will provide ammo to the "OMG, Obama is part of the corrupt, Chicago political system" subgenre of conservative criticism.) But casting aside the political spin on this, which only seems to work in favor of Obama's critics, there's the meat of the argument -- namely, how good a chief of staff will William Daley be? And in that sense, as a former corporate president and COO, cabinet secretary and presidential campaign chairman, he's probably well-suited to the duties of the job. As an occasional critic of the president from the left, I myself am skeptical of Daley's ability to advise the president given his former role in high finance, but I'm largely agnostic on this, and would prefer to see how he pans out over the coming months.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHistoric NY      (1000+ posts)Thu Jan-06-11 12:29 PMResponse to Original message9.I'd bet he can be the GOP's nightmare.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbvar22      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 12:37 PMResponse to Original message10.Why not just give the Chamber of Commerce.......their own wing at the White House?  Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPDittie      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 12:41 PMResponse to Original message11.'Unsavory":Much discussed has been Daley's fairly public disapproval of the president's health care reform package, which he castigated as either an overreach or a miscalculation. "The election of '08 sent a message that after 30 years of center-right governing, we had moved to center left -- not left," he told The New York Times.Equally illuminating, however, is the stance Daley took on the other major piece of domestic legislation passed during the past two years: financial regulatory reform. Daley, reportedly, was not exactly enamored with a new consumer financial protection agency, a key element of the plan and one of the president's most cherished provisions, going so far as to lobby White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to drop the idea. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/04/william-daley-... Thinks healthcare reform was a bad idea because it was 'too left'. One of the top guys at JPM Chase -- they took bailout money, didn't they? -- and then decried financial reform, and pulled strings with Rahm to get the administration to shitcan it.I think the world of Dean -- as indicated in my sig line -- but I can't line up with him on Daley. He's an enemy of the middle class, the working class, and a heavyweight hippie-puncher. CoS is the president's gatekeeper. Someone wrote the other day that Obama has nearly no progressives advising him as it is. Daley is much less coarse than Rahm, but has the same mentality and is probably even worse when it comes to progressive interests.BOHICAPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topfrylock      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 12:44 PMResponse to Original message13.gee just the other day we were all assured by the usual suspects that this was a BS rumorPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopFiveGoodMen      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 12:50 PMResponse to Reply #1315.The usual suspects are out of their god-damned minds.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topfrylock      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 01:04 PMResponse to Reply #1520.well now they're trying to convince everyone what a great decision this was..howard dean is cools with it.

We must steer a more moderate course.Obama names William Daley as new chief of staff, January 6, 2011All that is required for the Democratic Party to recover its political footing is to acknowledge that the agenda of the party's most liberal supporters has not won the support of a majority of Americans -- and, based on that recognition, to steer a more moderate course on the key issues of the day, from health care to the economy to the environment to Afghanistan. .....----William Daley, in an op-ed in the Washington Post, December 24, 2009But when White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel called a top J.P. Morgan executive to ask for the bank's support in creating a new consumer-protection agency, the executive--former Commerce Secretary William Daley--said no, according to people familiar with the conversation. His boss believed that sufficient consumer safeguards were already on the books.----Wall Street Journal, April 7, 2010, via Sam Stein at HuffingtonPostMr. Daley, who has not responded to requests for comment, is also known to offer blunt advice and criticism. He thought the president and Democratic leaders in Congress overreached on some of their priorities in the last two years.They miscalculated on health care, Mr. Daley said in an interview last year with The New York Times. The election of 08 sent a message that after 30 years of center-right governing, we had moved to center left  not left.A decision to bring Mr. Daley into the heart of the administration could further annoy Mr. Obamas liberal base, who frequently accused Mr. Emanuel of encouraging the president to compromise on liberal principles to achieve legislative goals.Mr. Daley, who was chairman of Vice President Al Gores 2000 presidential campaign, helped Mr. Clinton pass the North America Free Trade Agreement, which is blamed by many union workers and liberals for helping to move jobs overseas.Mr. Daley is also the Midwest chairman of JPMorgan Chase & Co., who also serves as the banks head of corporate responsibility. If selected to join the Obama administration, his ties to Wall Street are among the elements of his background that would likely be criticized by left-leaning groups......NYTimes, January 3, 2011To recap, William Daley opposed the creation of a consumer protection agency; opposed health care reform with a public option; helped Clinton pass free trade agreements; is a Wall Street bankster; is pushing a "more moderate course" on the environment and Afghanistan; pointedly marginalizes liberal voices.  This is much more than we need to know to assess this appointment. So he deserves to have the constant ear of the president?  Obama thinks so. There is no misreading this appointment.  Nor any credible defense of it.We should just simply clap more loudly, fellow liberals.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmvd      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 09:19 PMResponse to Reply #3344.Seeming "moderate" may help win a campaign, but..governing like you care about everyone but your base will not keep the momentum going.
