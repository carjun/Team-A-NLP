Importantly, we also wanted to provide some kind of web platform for the Ocean Beach community.A year after we started publishing, we decided to focus more of our attention and energies on OB itself. By October 2009, we were taking advertisements and sponsorships and selling hot-looking T-shirts. Our stats just continue to rise dramatically over the months. Last March 2010 we had over 26,000 visitors, by June we had 34 visitors short of 40,000, then in October 43,000 visitors, and our very best month  November 2010, with 51,000 visitors. We also reached another milestone, we had our one-millionth page hit in mid-December.We have a plethora of writers, bloggers, contributors, photographers, and close supporters who in 2010, included Brittany Bailey, Jon Carr,  Kristin Condon, Anna Daniels, Shane Finneran,   Gary Gilmore, Rich Kacmar, Steven Kindrick, Sarah Little, Ernie McCray, Brenda McFarlane, Danny Morales, Abby Normal, OB Cindi, Doug Porter, Bill Ray, Dave Rice, Sunshine, Genie Sapienza, Wireless  Mike Williams, John Williams, and independent photographer Jim Grant.At our beginning, we had a number of progressive writers who contributed to our blog, in particular Jon Christensen, Michael Steinberg, and Gregg Robinson. Rick Nadeau, who also blogged with for us from the beginning,  passed away in November 2008, after a long bout with cancer. Our good friend and photographer, Jeff Stone, was also one of our main photographer contributors.In the Fall of 2008, we were joined by Doug Porter, who now writes on a regular basis and who wrote for the original OB Rag back in the seventies, and by Anna Daniels, who is active on city-wide issues. We also have a lively facebook page that Doug Porter coordinates and administers.When we started this blog, we were disgusted with the state of things: the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a bellicose and war-mongering President Bush, a Constitutional crisis, the environmental and global meltdown, as well as local corruption and government incompetence on all levels. We believed then and still believe now that things can and should be a whole lot better.Things have changed since we first started blogging. We initially supported the candidacy of Barack Obama for President, and we celebrated with champagne and tears the night he was elected. But our eyes are not shut. We remain critical  and hopeful  of our political environment. We have come to deeply understand that progressives need to keep pressure on the White House, no matter who is in it. And its important to develop broad coalitions of activists and like-minded people, to not be hampered by some restrictions of our political traditions, and be willing to work across different parties and communities.We have become very disappointed in what President Obama has achieved and not achieved during his first two years in office. We oppose the continuation of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (and Pakistan), and have been disheartened by the so-called compromises his administration has made with those who have vowed to destroy the American social networks established over the last century. This president seems to have sacrificed his message of change and hope to the expediencies of Washington, DC. We remain critical  and hopeful.This website attempts to keep OBcians, other San Diegans, and readers from across the country and from across the oceans informed on issues and changes around us. We try to share all news and reports about the village of Ocean Beach, from other sources, but primarily from our in-house bloggers, and we try to publish news and perspectives about activists and grassroots goings-on within San Diego County. Views and news of Ocean Beach and beyond.When we first started this blog, we felt that we needed to rebuild a sense of community, not only on the neighborhood level, but also amongst those of a kindred spirit. We have expanded our circle of friends and readers, as we have a solid base of Ocean Beach readers, a San Diego, national and even international audience.Our staff and those who have blogged with us has grown and changed. Others who have contributed to the OB Rag over the last three years include: Lane Tobias,  Stu Seymour, Mary E. Mann, Nate Hipple,  Jim Noble, and  Dave Gilbert.We have nearly 1,400 names on our email news and support list. At our year anniversary  late October 2008  we had a daily visitor average of over 250. By October 2009 we had a daily visitor count somewhere between 500 to 900. By Spring 2010, we are averaging between 750 and 1,000 visitors a day. By that Fall it was 1,200 to 1,400. To get a sense of our expansion, in July 2008, we had 3,000 visitors; in July 2009 we had 23,000.Its ever-so clear to us that, as we originally stated at the beginning:With mainstream media becoming more and more monopolized and centralized, there is a need for information and opinion outside the corporate media monolith. Blogs are helping to fill this role. Like during an earlier day, when underground newspapers filled the void, blogs today enable grassroots journalists and commentators to counter mainstream propaganda.OB Rag  March 1972, Vol. 2, No. 8The First OB RagThe first OB Rag, actually the OB Peoples Rag, was an alternative grassroots newspaper for the Ocean Beach neighborhood of San Diego during the first half of the 1970s, with its first publisher, editor and writer Frank Gormlie. It published from late Summer 1970 to early Fall 1975. The Rags volunteer and dedicated activist staff succeeded in fueling the community organizing in Ocean Beach during those years with their underground publication, taking on the establishment while giving voice to the burgeoning counter-culture.The OB Rag was once described by Art Kunkin, the then-publisher of the LA Free Press  the grandparent of alternative newspapers  as the best alternative grassroots community newspaper in the country. [See our page "1st OB Rag" for more complete history of the first OB Rag.]  Plus, many of the original OB Rags are now available for donations. [Go here for those Rags that are available.]Much later, in the early years of this century, folks associated with the Ocean Beach Grassroots Organization (OBGO) and the Save Ocean Beach Coalition published several editions of a new version of the OB Rag (see below for a sample front cover of this version). There are at least two issues of that version of the OB Rag scanned here in our blog.So, here we are, with a third version of the OB Rag. Please peruse our posts, comments, and satire and join in. (For information of another San Diego progressive publication put out by some of the same writers of the current OB Rag, see below for the Pie Shop.OB Rag  October 2002, Vol. 7, No. 2 This version of the OB Rag, was published by members of the OB Grassroots Organization and Coalition to Save OBThe Whole Damn Pie ShopA number of the current writers for this OB Rag published a left-wing magazine in San Diego during the first half of the eighties. Called the whole damn pie shop the magazine proudly announced on each front cover:Our name is from a quote of a Brixton, England demonstrator who when asked in 1981 if he wanted a larger share of the pie, replied, No, we want the whole damn pie shop!Describing itself as an independent left and progressive newsletter, the Pie Shop was initially sponsored by the Borderlands Education Committee  itself a creation of an Ocean Beach political collective.  Current and occasional writers for the OB Rag, Frank Gormlie, Rick Nadeau, Michael Steinberg and Gregg Robinson all wrote for the Pie Shop from its inception in 1981 through the end sometime in 1986.Issue Number 10 has been scanned and added to the site.

ReplyFrank GormlieFebruary 2, 2008 at 3:49 pmTed  yes the OB Rag thrived for a good five years, 1970  75, and became quite well-known. Every two weeks, from 5000 to 10,000 issues went out, mainly in OB but also across the beach area, some of the college campuses, and even (gasp!) on a few military bases. OB was also home to many sailors as well as hippies and surfers. It still is. Thank you for sharing, and youre welcome to post any other comments or memories (well, just the good memories).ReplyLilyOctober 6, 2010 at 8:22 pmHey Frank,I used to carry the OB rag as far north as Leucada  back in the day. I was also carrying oooo  Off Our Backs  I then too I think.  Hope you are well.the wild science girlMarcienow of MontanaReplyFrank GormlieOctober 7, 2010 at 8:10 amHi Marcie of Montana  welcome back! Do you have any memories of the 70s that you can share with us?ReplyJudy BurzellMay 3, 2008 at 11:11 pmHi Frank,I got such a kick out of seeing the OB Rag online after 30-some years!  I worked on the paper, the OB Childcare Center, and a few other great endeavors in the 70sthe paper looks greathaving kept in touch with a lot of the old guard there are so many people who feel the same way around todaythey are now grandparents but no less passionate about current issuesgood job, its so great to see people beginning to do something after a period where not a lot went on.ReplyTR @ WSBSeptember 1, 2008 at 3:17 amJust a shout-out from a former OB resident, and San Diego native, now running a neighborhood-news site, in blog format, in West Seattle, a hood that has a bit of that funky OB-esque flavor. Glad to find this, so we can keep up with whats happening, even though were long gone.Replyjeannie reevesOctober 6, 2008 at 7:46 amThanks for the OB blog. I lived on Bacon and Longbranch for 10 years. In 2003 I moved back to Montana where I grew up. I think about OB everyday and miss my old life there!

I grew up in OB from 1973 through 1985, lived across the street from Peoples Foods, went to the Free School (and spent many a summer with them at the Plunge, Camping, Blacks Beach, etc.).  Its great to see the old pictures  would love to see more!  Living in OB really did leave a lasting impression, and I often look back at the path it set me on with a sense of gratitude for the unique life and experiences I had during that time.ReplyFrank GormlieOctober 21, 2008 at 9:09 pmDawn  welcome back. Hopefully your comments will be seen by other Free Schoolers. Please peruse our other posts and leave as many comments as youd like. We love it when people contact us for the first time like you just did. And go ahead and share any stories  go to the part of the First OB Rag story that is noteworthy for you and make a comment there as well.ReplyDawn Parker-WaitesOctober 30, 2008 at 11:41 amI was searching online about the desalination issue and ran across your article written last November, and was wondering if there is any way we could re-post it on our site and give full author credit and link to your blog?  I loved the coverage of the issues!  Great job!ReplyFrank GormlieOctober 30, 2008 at 2:39 pmDawn  I decided to contact you this way versus your email; yes, yes, go ahead, the writer is Jon E.

Im frankly pissed over the whole affair, and so sad that this poor child has barely a glimmer of a chance at being a normal human being with parents and a public safety team like this. well, maybe the dad is half sane and ought to have custody,. but even tough I usually oppose adoption as a tool of class repression, i;d sure like to see this child placed in a home with some forward thinking people nwho know how to defuse a stupid argument over taking a shower rather than escalate it.makes me rather *like *my life as a single mother in California despite its challenges. and, again, glad you are keeping the lower portion of the state a little more hospitable.ReplyCurtis FlemingMay 22, 2010 at 5:25 amI  just discovered your site when looking for mre info on this poor kid in Arkansas tasered by the police at her mothers request.  good to hear a progressive voice out of San Diego.

Im actually not in Ocean beach, nor in SD County at all; Ive lived in the Bay Area fort many years, with occasional trvel trips out of the country or across the continent. but I too as happy to find that Frank and the OB Ragers 2.0 or whatever you want to call them cared about this absurdity in Arkansas. wonder if there;s been any update on that cute little pixie. did you see the photo? she looks like aoperfectly adorable, not so scary kid to me and weighed about 65 pounds when it happened. her mother is the one with the problem!maybe sometime we out of towners can all get together and enjoy the OB life. I have family in and north of Los Angeles, not sure when Im getting to SD area butwell, lets stay in touch through this site. OB denizens, any of you whod be willing to provide hospitality for some pilgrims maybe in the late summer?Replytim ludwigJune 19, 2010 at 6:25 amIt` about time more of us are taking issue over the homeless/panhandling in OB.The bumpersticker from The Black just keeps the lights on about this annoying problem.Let`s keep the lights on  and try and solve the issue as a community that does care about people.Just a few tips we should practice..Don`t allow people to go thru your trash.Don`t give money/ food out.Don`t allow campers/cars to park longer than 3 daysReplyRobert "Bob" SorbenNovember 9, 2010 at 2:02 pmHow to advertise on blog?
