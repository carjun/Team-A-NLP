The new GOP majority in the House of Representatives will wage a campaign to disable health reform, financial regulation, and the EPA; stonewall executive and judicial appointments; slash nondefense discretionary spending (thus undermining the economic recovery); gut Social Security and Medicare; and launch investigations into every possible White House indiscretionpotentially leading to a vote for impeachment. Democrats only recourse will be to practice what Howard Dean famously derided as damage controlto abandon hope for big progressive accomplishments and hunker down until 2012, like the Clinton administration did after the Gingrich Revolution, defending government from the worst excesses of those who would like to eliminate it altogether.Theres only one problem with this scenario: the time-frame. Politicos and pundits are used to thinking in two-year cycles, and its easy to convince oneself that, in 2012, Obama will be able to capitalize on an improved economy, favorable voter-turnout patterns, and aweak GOP presidential field in order to sweep into office with a renewed mandate. But that misses a big part of the picture. Even if Obama wins reelection by a comfortable margin, its most likely that the House will remain in Republican hands and Democrats will lose seats in, and perhaps control of, the Senateand beyond that, Republicans will probably do fairly well in 2014. In other words, we could be looking not at two years of damage control, but sixMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesDemocrats, Democrats regaining control of Congress, House reapportionment of seats, The House, The SenateRead moreToday in Congress1/7/11.January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsBy David Waldman @Dailykos..I have something special for you to see today.

If you thoughtreading the Constitution out loud in the House of Representatives was all the founding document-y goodness there was contained in the Republican changes to the House Rules, dont worry!Theres more!And then they will require that every new bill contain a statement by the lawmaker who wrote it citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation.This is far more awesome, obviously, than the existing House Rule XIII (d)(1):(d) Each report of a committee on a public bill or public joint resolution shall contain the following:(1) A statement citing the specific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution to enact the law proposed by the bill or joint resolution.The statement of constitutional authority is being moved from the committee report, which is written after a bill is refined and amended in committee, to a slip of paper that accompanies the bill as its introduced,before all the changes are made.That should be pretty awesome right there! (Hey, I wonder what they would have put on that slip of paper for the 1996line-item veto legislation they passed, and that was later struck down by the Supreme Court. Im sure they can totally show the Court the piece of paper next time. Thatll learn em, the sociamalists!)There are also a couple ofsomewhat less exciting changesbeing made, too:Committee name changes: The Committee on Education and Labor will become the Committee on Education and Workforce, and the Committee on Science and Technology will become the Committee on Science, Space and Technology.The Committee on Education and Workforce, of course, is what Republicans used to call the same committee the last time they had the majority, enshrining their hatred for even thewordlabor. Actually, at first  in 1995  they called it the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, but I guess that was a little too dumb sounding even for them, and they switched it in 1997.The Committee on Science and Technology, of course, used to be called the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, only that was under the Democrats, who added Space to the name in 1987. In 1995, when Republicans took over, they deleted both Spaceand Technology, going with just the Committee on Science. Democrats re-added Technology in 2007. And now, Republicans will show how awesome they are by re-adding Space. (Dont tell them that Democrats were the ones who added Space the first time, or they might not do it!)The grown-ups are back in charge at last!Yes, there are more changes. And more serious ones at that. Well get to them. For right now, I just wanted you to know that U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! Number one! Wooooooo! America!!!! F yeah!!!!Heres the 411 on the SenateBy now youre aware that the effort to reform Senate rules kicks off, thanks to the efforts of Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) and his supporters, on the first day of the new Congress  this Wednesday, January 5th.Much has been made of the connection between Senate rules reform and that first day, but there are a few finer points that deserve discussion, and that might help you make sense of events as they unfold.First of all, we should get some sense of where the significance of the first day comes from. Weve discussed before how the Senate has in the past reconciled its constitutional right to adopt its own rules of procedure with its tradition as a continuing body. And perhaps the most comprehensive statement of how this paradox has been viewed comes from a 1957 advisory opinion delivered from the chair by then-Vice President (and President of the Senate) Richard Nixon, during a similar effort to reform Senate rules.Just to set this up for you, at the time he delivered this opinion, a motion to adopt new rules changes was the pending business, and reform opponents had moved to table the proposal, prompting one Senator to ask just what rules the Senate was then proceeding under:The constitutional provision under which only one-third of the Senate membership is changed by election in each Congress can only be construed to indicate the intent of the framers that the Senate should be a continuing parliamentary body for at least some purposes. By practice for 167 years the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another.The Constitution also provides that each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. This constitutional right is lodged in the membership of the Senate and it may be exercised by a majority of the Senate at any time. When the membership of the Senate changes, as it does upon the election of each Congress, it is the Chairs opinion that there can be no question that the majority of the new existing membership of the Senate, under the Constitution, have the power to determine the rules under which the Senate will proceed.The question, therefore, is, How can these two constitutional mandates be reconciled?It is the opinion of the Chair that while the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another, the right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming as it does from the Constitution itself, cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a majority of the Senate in a previous Congress.Any provision of Senate rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it desires to proceed is, in the opinion of the Chair, unconstitutional. It is also the opinion of the Chair that Section 3 of Rule 22 in practice has such an effect.The Chair emphasizes that this is only his own opinion, because under Senate precedents, a question of constitutionality can only be decided by the Senate itself, and not by the Chair.At the beginning of a session in a newly elected Congress, the Senate can indicate its will in regard to its rules in one of three ways:First. It can proceed to conduct its business under the Senate rules which were in effect in the previous Congress and thereby indicate by acquiescence that those rules continue in effect. This has been the practice in the past.Second. It can vote negatively when a motion is made to adopt new rules and by such action indicate approval of the previous rule.Third. It can vote affirmatively to proceed with the adoption of new rules.Turning to the parliamentary situation in which the Senate now finds itself, if the motion to table should prevail, a majority of the Senate by such action would have indicated its approval of the previous rules of the Senate, and those rules would be binding on the Senate for the remainder of this Congress unless subsequently changed under those rules.If, on the other hand, the motion to lay on the table shall fail, the Senate can proceed with the adoption of rules under whatever procedures the majority of the Senate approves.In summary, until the Senate at the initiation of a new Congress expresses its will otherwise, the rules in effect in the previous Congress in the opinion of the Chair remain in effect, with the exception that the Senate should not be bound by any provision in those previous rules which denies the membership of the Senate the power to exercise its constitutional right to make its own rules. (Congressional Record, 85th Congress, 1st Session, January 4, 1957, pp. 178-179.)So what does that mean in terms of the importance of the first day? What it really means is that at some point before the Senate begins conducting its substantive business, there needs to be some clear and early objection to the continuance of the old rules. Its really about heading into the business of the new Congress with a clear definition of what rules will and will not be continuing in force, rather than being anything magical about the first day. The first day is just the best opportunity to guarantee that you can get that rules discussion started before any substantive business is conducted.Thats the key.During the last successful fight to change cloture rules, in 1975, that key objection was indeed made on the first day of the 94th Congress, but rather than have it out right then and there, the Senate agreed to a unanimous consent request to lock in all the rights Senators had to object to the rules on the first day, but postpone the actual debate until later that month:Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, in order to nail down doubly the protection accorded to the Senator and his cosponsors, I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding any delay in the consideration of the resolution, all proceedings, rights and privileges, concerning the efforts to change rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate be reserved, so that proponents of such a change not be prejudiced in any way in the actual commencement of the consideration of this resolution.As a result of the agreement, the 1975 rules reform debate actually stretched into early March of that year. Theoretically, the same could happen today.But youre probably already thinking that getting unanimous consent on this issue in the 112th Congress is probably about as close to impossible as anything can be.So what might happen instead? Well, the reform-minded Senators might have to stay there and fight  something that would have to start on Wednesday, but might actually continue for quite some time  all the while objecting to the conduct of substantive business under the old rules.The situation is somewhat complicated by Senate rules and practices (what a surprise!) such as, well, the definition of what constitutes the first day as well as how to define substantive business. Yes, even the definition of a day is like something out of Wonderland in the Senate. Because a legislative dayisnt the same thing as a calendar day:legislative day  A day that starts when the Senate meets after an adjournment and ends when the Senate next adjourns. Hence, a legislative day may extend over several calendar days or even weeks and months.If the Senate breaks in its proceedings with a recess rather than deciding to adjourn, the next calendar day is still a part of the same legislative day. So if theres no adjournment, the first day of the new Congress could  by this definition  last for days, weeks, or even months.As for what constitutes the kind of substantive business that could signal the acquiescence of the Senate to the old rules, nobodys sure exactly what that could mean, either. Most assume its the consideration of bills, resolutions, nominations and the like. But others say its any business, perhaps as routine as having the Senate chaplain offer an opening prayer. The definitive word will come from the Senate Parliamentarians office, and as usual, theyre not talking to the public, and neither is anyone whos talking to them.Well have to wait and see to find out whose definitions theyre working with, and what that might require reform leaders to do.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Other Things, Politics, Updates112th Congress, Congress, Democrats in the Senate, Filibuster Rule change, House AND Senate are trying for Operating Rules Changes, Republicans/GOP, Rule changes, The House, The SenateRead moreThe Lame Duck 111th Congress was busy..December 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsThe Capitol building stands in Washington, D.C.(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)While the US Congress took almost all of its last year wrestling with HealthcareThe last few days have been feverishThe list of accomplishments have been surprisingly goodHeres the few I can remember.Feel free to add more to my list which I will update..The Stimulus.The Wall Street Economic Reform BillThe Healthcare BillThe Obama Tax Deal ..Dont AskDont Tell Repeal.The Defense Budget.The 9/11 Healthcare BillThe START Treaty ratificationTwo Supreme Court Justices The Food Inspection Bill.The College Education BillThe Pay Equity Bill***However history judges the 535 men and women in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate the past two years, one thing is certain: The 111th Congress made more law affecting more Americans since the Great Society legislation of the 1960s.For the first time since PresidentTheodore Roosevelt began the quest for a national health-care system more than 100 years ago, the Democrat-led House and Senate took the biggest step toward achieving that goal by giving 32 million Americans access to insurance. Congress rewrote the rules for Wall Street in the most comprehensive way since the Great Depression. It spent more than $1.67 trillion to revive an economy on the verge of a depression, including tax cuts for most Americans, jobs for more than 3 million, construction of roads and bridges and investment in alternative energy; ended an almost two-decade ban against openly gay men and women serving in the military, and today ratified a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia.Before adjournment today, Congress approved legislation to help rescuers and clean-up crews suffering from illnesses linked to the wreckage caused by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. The Senate approved it on a voice vote, the House by a vote of 206-60. New York SenatorsCharles Schumer andKirsten Gillibrand, in a statement, called it a Christmas miracle.For all of its ambitious achievement, the 111th Congress, which may adjourn this week, also witnessed a voter-backlash driven by a 9.6 percentunemployment rate that cost Democrats control of the House and diminished their Senate majority.This is probably the most productive session of Congress since at least the 60s, saidAlan Brinkley, a historian at New Yorks Columbia University.

By a vote of 63 to 33, the Senate voted to end debate on a bill repealing the militarys Dont Ask, Dont Tell policy, opening the door for a final Senate vote on the standalone repeal bill passed by the House Tuesday. That means a simple majority of 51 Senators can now bring the legislative fight on repealing DADT to an end. That vote is expected to come  and expected to succeed  by the end of the weekend.Voting with the majority of Democrats were Republicans Scott Brown (MA), Mark Kirk (IL) George Voinovich (OH), Lisa Murkowski (AK), Susan Collins (ME), and Olympia Snowe (ME). Jim Bunning (R-KY), Judd Gregg (R-NH), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and Joe Manchin (D-WV) were absent.The vote will likely be seen as a major political victory for President Obama, who pushed repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell on the campaign trail and set a year-long timetable for a legislative repeal of the policy in hisState Of The Union back in January.

But, with no votes scheduled for Friday, leaders simply ran out of time, pushing consideration of the bill to next week, according to Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.).We are still on track to pass the DREAM Act in the House, but we ran out of time to have a vote this week, so it looks like we will have it next week, Gutierrez said in a statement. We have to follow certain rules in the House and do things in a certain order to call bills to the floor and we ran out of time for the DREAM Act this week.A House aide familiar with the debate floated another reason for the delay: A handful of CBO hangups led Democrats to scrap their plan to consider the bill this week, the aide said, referring to the Congressional Budget Office.On Thursday, CBO estimated the bill would reduce the deficit by $1.4 billion over the next decade. The figure reflects a $1.4 billion increase in on-budget deficits, and a $2.8 billion decrease in off-budget deficits, CBO noted. Only on-budget figures are considered under pay-as-you-go budget rules adopted by the House.Earlier in the day, Gutierrez indicated the bill has enough support to pass through the lower chamber.Im encouraged, he told The Hill, because the obstacles appear procedural in nature  its not the votes.More from the Hill.Heres the story in the Senate.DREAM Act gets watered down, and latest whip countbykosThe GOP has sent out marching orders to its members  vote no on everything. But a handful have to deal with a growing Latino population in their states or districts. Others want to do the right thing. Thus the DREAM Act is a dilemma for several of them. The act would legalize the children of undocumented immigrants who either complete two years of college or serve in the military.Thus in a bid to bring aboard the 7-9 Republicans necessary to pass, thefollowing changes have been made to DREAM Act:The latest version, filed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) late Tuesday night, would bar illegal immigrants from receiving in-state college tuition; drops the age of eligibility to 29 from 34; would not grant permanent legal status to anyone for at least 10 years; would restrict eligibility for those who commit certain misdemeanor crimes; and would limit individuals from being able to sponsor family members for U.S. citizenship, among other changes.Those who receive conditional legal status under the DREAM Act also would be ineligible for Medicaid, food stamps and other government-funded benefits.These changes are designed to appease Republicans who want to prove to everyone that theyre big assholes. No in-state tuition? If anything, why not allow the states to make that decision? Instead, Republicans seek to put up further roadblocks for those kids getting educated and trying to live the American dream. These changes universally scream, were going to be assholes simply because thats what we are  assholes.Mission accomplished. Theyre a bunch of assholes. Thank heavens, too, because Im sure the DREAM kids didnt have enough assholes to deal with already.That said, this thing is still worth passing, because itll still be a lifesaver for many undocumented youngsters who are in America by no fault of their own, yet are American in every possible way. Penalizing children for something that isnt their fault is about as low as an elected official can go.Heres the whip count as of early this morning, apparently before these changes were introduced:GOP probably voting yes:Bennett (UT)Lugar (IN)Murkowski (AK)DEMS probably voting no:Baucus (MT)Conrad (ND)Manchin (WV)Nelson (NE)Pryor (AR)Tester (MT)Now we have a poll in the field in Montana, last calls are being done right now, to see how Montanans view the issue. One thing is for sure, if Tester votes no on this bill, then this site wont lift a finger to help him in his 2012 reelection bid. We dont help people who are assholes to innocent kids.Conrad, Manchin, Nelson, and Tester all face tough reelections in 2012. Baucus, Manchin, Nelson and Pryor are members in good standing of the asshole caucus.GOPers who might vote yesBrownback (KS)Brown (MA)Collins (ME)Gregg (NH)Hutchison (TX)Kirk (IL)LeMieux (FL)Snowe (ME)Ensign (NV)Voinovich (OH)Hutchison and LeMieux (who was a placeholder appointee) are both under particularly intense pressure from home state Latino Republicans, faith groups, university presidents, etc. Hutchison is going to get teabagged, so her vote may be an indication of how she plans to proceed  if she votes no, itll likely be because she still thinks she can win a Republican primary. If she votes yes, consider it the first sign that shell run as an independent. LeMieux represents a state with a large Latino population (and a significantly Republican one, too). But he seems to have caught the Senate bug and rumors are that hell be back for another shot at the seat. If so, he might figure a yes vote will kill him with the teabaggers in a primary.The Maine twins would normally be good possibilities for yes votes, but with the teabaggers rising in their homestate and a 2012 election looming, I wouldnt hold my breath on Snowe. Brown has to be reelected in 2012 in liberal Massachusetts. Voinovich has retired and has nothing to lose. Kirk has said he thinks this is not the time for this bill, but hedoes represent liberal Illinois. Hell have to start voting accordingly at some point.Democrats who might vote noLandrieu (LA)McCaskill (MO)Hagan (NC)Dorgan (ND)Im surprised Landrieu is even in play. Shes a member of the asshole caucus. Dorgan has retired and has nothing to lose. Hagan is in a tough state, but with a growing Latino population. She wouldnt be Senator without their vote. Hagan lost the white vote 57-39, yet won the state 53-44. Given that whites were 75 percent of the vote, you can do the math. It was a dominant black and brown vote that won her the seat. McCaskill wont survive 2012, but if she still thinks she can, shell vote no to try and keep the hounds at bay. Wont work.Bottom line?DREAM Act supporters need to pick up 7-9 Republicans, and then limit loses among Democrats to no more than 5-7.
