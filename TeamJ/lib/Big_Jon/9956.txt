To constitute depraved indifference, the defendant's conduct must be 'so wanton, so deficient in a moral sense of concern, so lacking in regard for the life or lives of others, and so blameworthy as to warrant the same criminal liability as that which the law imposes upon a person who intentionally causes a crime. Depraved indifference focuses on the risk created by the defendants conduct, not the injuries actually resulting.In one case, People v Register, 60 NY2d 273, 469 NYS2d 599 (1983),while exploring the meaning of "depraved indifference recklessness" the Court of Appeals ruled that intoxication is not a defense or excuse to "depraved mind murder," although it may be to intentional murder. Its analysis started with distinguishing reckless manslaughter from the "depraved indifference recklessness" necessary for murder:"to bring defendants conduct within the murder statute, the People were required to establish also that defendants act was imminently dangerous and presented a very high risk of death to others and that it was committed under circumstances which evidenced a wanton indifference to human life or a depravity of mind. . . . . The crime differs from intentional murder in that it results not from a specific, conscious intent to cause death, but from an indifference to or disregard of the risks attending defendants conduct."But the only thing that is going to result from this is no one will do anything about the hate speech and gun "metaphors" and it will get worse.

Followed by this quote: In the battle, set your sights on next seasons targets! From the shot across the bow  the first seconds tip-off  your leaders will be in the enemys crosshairs , so you must execute strong defensive tactics. You wont win only playing defense, so get on offense! The crossfire is intense, so penetrate through enemy territory by bombing through the press, and use your strong weapons  your Big Guns  to drive to the hole. Shoot with accuracy; aim high and remember it takes blood, sweat and tears to win.But hey I concede I guess that's the same as using the phrase "in my sights". On edit: If you believe this was all just an innocent "mistake" then tell me why they chose war, guns and violence as their metaphors?  Were sports metaphors taken?  Academic metaphors?

Why do you think Rimjob and Kelly took their websites down last night?Look, all you need to prove depraved indifference is that the person accused of it acted with such a reckless disregard for human life or safety that they could carry the same liability as the person who actually committed the murder.From Uslegal.com: "Depraved indifference focuses on the risk created by the defendants conduct, not the injuries actually resulting."Risk from Palin's conduct:  inserting gun-related language and implying that a Congresswoman was to be "targeted" through crosshairs, even if just politically.  A fair number of Palin's constituents have demonstrated intent or potential to act violently even before that image came out, and I strongly doubt Palin didn't know about that.There you go.  Guilty of depraved indifference murder.

Why condemn Palin if she did nothing wrong?And if she DID do something wrong, what would that be if you are so sure she bares no responsibility in the murder?Hm?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topjillan      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 09:48 PMResponse to Reply #6271.Exactly what charges should she be arrested on?  She's not the one that committed or plotted thiscrime.Did she stir up emotions in crazy people?  Most likely, but I don't believe she can get arrested for that.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNRaleighLiberal      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 09:05 PMResponse to Original message59.She needs a national "ignore", not arrest.  Any publicity, any mention is too much.She certainly incites hatred.  And likely violence.

Tiger Woods had an affair (affairs) and look what happened to him. She needs to be shunned and if enough complain to TLC maybe they will no longer show that bitch on TV every week. She still gets money for reruns. This bitch needs to be shut up forever. Sure wish some hacker would hack tonights show.

I catch it by her voice. LOL! Like fingernails on a chalkboard. And from the TLC line up, it seems to be one more than once in a day. Just because of this tragedy in Az they shouldn't show tonights show. It's a 2 hour show. I guess the last for the season. Well I wrote to them. Look at all the endorsements Tiger Woods lost over his sex life. This deserves that and more. Granted TLC should have known better. The map with sights on them have been there for a long time.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptnvoter      (36 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 09:43 PMResponse to Original message68.agree.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopKievan Rus      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 09:46 PMResponse to Original message70.+10000.
