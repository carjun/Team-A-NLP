Their forecasts have been quite reliable in the past as well, which is why we incorporate them  along with forecasts from Cook Political, CQ Politics and Mr. Sabato  into our own House race projections.Much earlier in the political cycle, however, Mr. Rothenberg had made a very silly forecast.Read moreNote .Stu Rothenberg is already out with a caution that Democrats have a better chance of retaking the House back than keep the Senate come the 2012 Elections.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Polls, UpdatesApril 23rd /2009 Rothenberg call, Macro vs Micro forcasts, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polling giants, Predictions vs Forcasts, Stu Rothenberg political reportRead moreGood Mid-Term Poll numbers dont get you re-elected President.Nate Silver.January 5, 2011jamesb101No commentsWhile the President does have Gallup Poll numbers at 50%.He also knows thats no guarantee hes gonna have easy time getting to keep his job after 2012Nate Silver over @Fivethirtyeight supplies the numbers for his theory.Barack Obama got some good news to start his new year: hisGallup approval rating ticked up to 50 percent yesterday, against 42 percent disapproval. Thats the first time it has been at the 50 percent threshold since early June.Mr. Obama had some successes to point to in December, like the accomplishments of the lame-duck session of Congress, and somemoderately encouraging economic numbers.Still, itsunclear whether the movement is real or reflects statistical noise; most polls still have Mr. Obama slightly below 50 percent. And it probably isnt worth going through very much effort to find out, provided that our focus is on 2012.Historically, there has been almost no relationship between a Presidents approval rating following the midterms and how he eventually fared at the next presidential election. Ivealluded to this in the past, but the data illustrate the point a little bit more forcefully.Below are the Gallup approval ratings at a comparable point in time  early January just after the midterms  for the 11 prior incumbent presidents who stood for election (notre-election, technically speaking, in cases like Gerald Ford).

Karl Rove, meanwhile, recently madecomments to Fox News about Hillary Rodham Clintons electoral future, which seemed to imply that he expected Mr. Obama would still be president in 2016.There are a lot of things that casual attempts at political science tend to get wrong, but one thing that observers seem to understand relatively well is that a poor performance by the presidents party at his first midterm election hardly dooms him. That is no doubt because of the recent experience with Bill Clinton as well as Ronald Reagan, both of whom witnessed their parties lose badly at the midterms and both of whom eventually won re-election by wide margins. Mr. Obamas Democrats lost a few more seats in Congress than Mr. Clintons Democrats did  and more than twice as many as Mr. Reagans Republicans. On the other hand, Mr. Obamas approval ratings areslightly better than Mr. Clintons or Mr. Reagans were at a comparable point in time, being in the mid-to-high 40s rather than in the low 40s.There may be some risk in over-learning these lessons, however: Mr. Clinton and Mr. Reagan, though they are two recent examples, are nevertheless just two examples, and they were both once-in-a-generation political talents.Still, its worth reflecting on what, if anything, we might have learned about Mr. Obamas re-election chances during the past couple of months  both based on what happened on Nov. 2 and what has happened sinceMore..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, Polls, Updates2012 re-Election chances, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, President ObamaRead moreNate Silver on Oabamas Throw Down PresserDecember 8, 2010jamesb101No commentsNate runs thru the premise of the President gripes with liberals and their breakdown in relationto the 2012 Elections.Like all of us.. He asks the question.What are the Dems gonna do come next month?What kinda deal could he..or the Dems get after the GOP controls the House?Obamas Tough Words for Liberals: Truth or Dare?ByNATE SILVERPresident Obama, already under scrutiny from some liberal groups for having agreed with Republicans to extend the Bush-era tax cuts across all income brackets, would seem have invited additional criticism from the left with hisunforgiving rhetoric toward them in his press conference this afternoon.In response to a question from theWall Street Journals Jonathan Weisman, Mr. Obama likened the debate over tax policy to the one that took place earlier in his term over his health care bill, which dissatisfied some liberals because it did not include a public health insurance option.Im not sure that Mr. Obamas comparison quite holds. The public option  though advocated for enthusiastically by liberal bloggers and interest groups  was by and large a boutique issue thatranked low on the priority list for most voters. And the health care bill wasquite popular among liberals by the time it eventually passed.Tax policy, on the other hand, is a little more central to the liberal worldview.At the same time, Mr. Obamas compromise with the Republicans  which has yet to pass the Congress  also contains some provisions that liberals might be pleased with, like extending unemployment benefits and reducing the rate of the payroll tax, which has a proportionately larger effect on low- and middle-income earners. The relatively poor reviews that Mr. Obama has received from some liberal groups so far underscores how his messaging on the tax cutscould become complicated along a number of dimensions.But if Mr. Obamashand was somewhat forced in acceding to a compromise with the G.O.P.  which on Saturday voted unanimously to block a Senate proposal to extend the tax cuts only at incomes below $250,000  his relatively combative attitude toward his liberal critics at his press conference today would seem to be entirely discretionary.What Mr. Obama may be banking on is not necessarily that some liberal groups wont be annoyed with him, but that they may have nowhere else to turn. Essentially, it amounts to a dareMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesAnalysis, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, The Obama Tax Deal Press ConferenceRead moreNate Silver on the Obama and GOP Deal.December 6, 2010jamesb1013 commentsThe interesting thing in Nates piece is the Prediction that the 2012 GOP Presidential field will probably run against the Presidents Healthcare Bill AND the fact if the economy does pick up.Tax cuts where the reason for it.Even though the Deal is gonna add almost a$900 BILLION in fresh debt.So much for the less spending Tea Party stuff..Previewing the G.O.P.s 2012 Argument on Tax CutsByNATE SILVERThe White House and Congressional Republicans reacheda tentative deal in which all of the Bush-era tax cuts  including those on the highest incomes  would be extended for two years. In exchange, Democrats will receive an extension of unemployment benefits, and a one-year cut in the payroll tax, which  because it is capped at $106,800  has its largest impact on middle-income workers.The timing of the extension ensures that tax policy will be the subject of a vigorous debate during the 2012 presidential election. President Obama, presumably, will argue as he did in 2008 that tax cuts on high incomes should be allowed to lapse. Republicans instead will suggest that they should be extended again, and probably be made permanent.Since most polls suggest that allowing the tax cuts to expire on the wealthiest earners is a popular position, some people have argued that Mr. Obama could be on solid footing in this debate. I am not quite so sure.Read moreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesNate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Obama nd the GOP tax dealRead moreThe Tax cut Dilemma for the DemocratsNate Silver..December 5, 2010jamesb1016 commentsNate. your FOURTH choice is gospel in Congress.You nailed that oneThe RICH win.AGAIN.As Always..***The Democrats Tax Cut DilemmaByNATE SILVERSaturday afternoon, the Senatefailed to achieve cloture on a proposal to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for family incomes below $250,000 but end them for incomes above this threshold.Perhaps the most likely outcome, according to reporting by The Times and other news organizations, is that the tax cuts  which expire at the end of the year if Congress takes no action  will eventually be extended at least temporarily for everyone, including high-income earners, as the White House seeks to cut its losses.Theres been quite a bit of debate in the blogosphere about how Democrats have handled the negotiations. Some liberal-leaning writers, in particular, have suggested that Democrats have played a poor game of poker, having folded their hand before they really needed to.Im more inclined toagree with my colleague David Leonhardt, however: the Democrats position  while perhaps not backing them all the way into a corner  is not very strong.There are essentially three possible outcomes in the debate: first, that the tax cuts are extended for everyone; second, that they are extended for no one; and third, that they are extended only below some threshold, most likely $250,000 for couples (although alternatives like $500,000 and $1 million have been proposed).The way in which Republicans would rank these outcomes is clear. Their first preference would be to extend the tax cuts for everyone. But presumably, when push comes to shove, theyd prefer to extend some of the tax cuts  on incomes below $250,000  instead of ending all of them.Its a little bit more difficult to identify the preferences of Democrats, because there are more divisions within the party: between the president and Congress, between moderate Democrats and liberal ones, between Democrats who are electorally vulnerable and those who arent. It is safe to say, however, that on balance, the Democrats would prefer to extend the tax cuts only below the $250,000 threshold, and not above it.This is also the most popular choice among the general public.Four recent polls  from CBS News, Gallup, The Associated Press, and CNN  find an average of 49 percent of Americans preferring this position, versus 33 percent who would rather see all of the tax cuts extended and 14 percent who would like to see all of them expire. (Another 4 percent are undecided.)So, the theory goes, if Democrats would prefer extending the tax cuts for incomes below $250,000 to letting all of them expire, and so would Republicans  and so, for that matter, would the general public  then what, exactly, is the rub? Not that victories in Congress ever come easily, but shouldnt this be a fight that the Democrats can win?The problem with this theory is that it relies, implicitly, on the assumption that the Democrats can take the third option  extending the tax cuts for everyone  off the table. If the Democrats could do this, then they would be in a very strong position. But this is not so easy to do.Read moreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Politics, The Economy, Updates2010 Midterm Election results, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Politics, Polls, President Obama, Republicans/GOP, The House, The Tax cut Dilemma for the DemocratsRead moreNate Silver on the Qatar World Cup Soccer choice for 2022December 2, 2010jamesb101No commentsQatar a Questionable World Cup HostByNATE SILVERThis years soccer World Cup in South Africa, in the end, yielded relatively few surprises. Seven of the eight quarterfinalists hailed from either Europe or South America, soccers traditional power continents. The tournament was won by Spain, which was ranked as one of the two strongest teams heading into the competition. Sure, the 2006 finalists, Italy and France, performed poorly. But that should not have shocked anyone who watched these countries tepid performances in the qualifying stages.Todays announcement on the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, on the other hand, was astonishing.Russia was granted the 2018 tournament ahead of England, and joint bids by Spain and Portugal, and Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively. This was, at most, a modest upset. Although Russia had failed to qualify for this years tournament,it plays fairly strong football  it is currently ranked 13th in the world, according to FIFAs official rankings  and it is the largest country outside Asia never to have hosted the tournament before.The decision that is harder to fathom, on the other hand, was the one to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, which has never qualified for the tournament and which has a population about the size of greater Las Vegas. Qatar was given the 2022 tournament ahead of the United States  which finished with the second-most votes  and also ahead of Australia, South Korea and Japan.In contrast to the decision to award the 2016 Summer Olympics to Rio de Janeiro ahead of Chicago, Madrid, and Tokyo  the four cities were scored similarly on technical merits, and South America had never hosted either the summer or winter Olympics before  this one is much harder to explain.Of the countries in the running for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, Qatar was the only onedesignated as high-risk by FIFA, which expressed concern about its weather (summer temperatures can reach 110 there, although Qatar says it has developed technology to air-condition its stadiums), and its logistics (all 12 of its stadiums, none of which are fully constructed, are in a 20-mile radius encompassing its capital, Doha).And if the downside to the Qatari bid was high, its upside is also questionable. The country has only 1.5 million people, according to the World Bank, but most are expatriates or migrant workers: the citizen population is closer to 200,000. Although Qatar might be thought of as staging the tournament on behalf of the Middle East in general, the region itself also has a fairly small population  about 350 million as the area is traditionally defined. And much of the infrastructure that Qatar develops for the tournament will be superfluous: all 12 of the stadiums that it constructs will be partially dismantled after the tournament (their spare parts, Qatar says, will be shipped off to developing countries after the World Cup).So what explains the decision?Click the titlte for the whole piece.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Politics, Sports, UpdatesNate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Qatar 2022 World Soccer Cup choice...Read moreNate Silver looks at the Early Forcast shown Obama headed for a win.November 22, 2010jamesb1011 commentOn November 21st, 2010 I did a post on a piece based on Yale economist Ray C.

We can only guess on the 2012 elections.But this from the New York Times works with a Dog post on the same thingObama winning re-election and the EconomyWell.

Fair, a Yale economist who has designed a model to predict the outcomes of presidential elections based on a series of economic variables.According to Mr. Fairs model, President Obama could be in surprisingly good shape in 2012. Based on Mr. Fairs assumptions about economic growth (he expects gross domestic product to improve at an annualized rate of about 3.7 points in the first three quarters of 2012) and inflation (which he expects to remain fairly low), Mr. Obama would be expected to receive about 56 percent of the vote in 2012 and the Republican candidate 44 percent (excluding any votes for third parties). By modern standards, that would constitute a landslide, with Mr. Obama probably winning in the neighborhood of 400 electoral votes.Needless to say, there are a couple of issues with this, many of which Mr. Fair is quite happy to acknowledge, once one reads the fine print behind his forecasts.First, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the economy will look like two years from now. Forecasting the economy even one year in advance is quite tricky. A series of expert forecasterssurveyed by The Wall Street Journal, trying to anticipate the state of the economy in December 2011, predicted that the unemployment rate would be from 7.6 percent to 10 percent, that G.D.P. would grow from 1.8 percent to 5.5 percent, and that inflation would run 0.6 percent to 3.8 percent. And that only gets us through next year, to say nothing of what could happen in 2012.Read moreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, Updatesan article by Jeff Sommer that highlighted the work of Ray C.

Andthe same goes for every other Republican candidate:Ms. Palins search traffic, since the start of 2010, is roughly 16 times that of Mitt Romney, 14 times that of Newt Gingrich, 38 times that of Mike Huckabee, and 87 times that of Mr. Pawlenty. (It is about six times greater than these other four candidates combined.)Ms. Palin, in fact, drawsalmost as much search traffic worldwide as the man she would face if she wins the Republican nomination: Barack Obama. And her name is searched for about30 percent more often than the Presidents among Google users in the United States.Some members of Ms. Palins family also draw as much attention has the other Presidential contenders. Todd Palin, her husband, getsabout as much search traffic as Mr. Pawlenty.

A firm that conducts surveys by Internet, YouGov, also performed relatively well.What follows is a preliminary analysis of polls released to the public in the final 21 days of the campaign. Our process here is quite simple: weve taken all such polls in our database, and assessed how accurate they were, on average, in predicting the margin separating the two leading candidates in each race. For instance, a poll that had the Democrat winning by 2 percentage points in a race where the Republican actually won by 4 would have an error of 6 points.Weve also assessed whether a companys polls consistently missed in either a Democratic or Republican direction  that is, whether they were biased. The hypothetical poll I just described would have had a 6 point Democratic bias, for instance.The analysis covers all polls issued by firms in the final three weeks of the campaign, even if a company surveyed a particular state multiple times. In our view, this provides for a more comprehensive analysis than focusing solely on a firms final poll in each state, since pollingRead moreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Polls, UpdatesNate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polls, Polls Rasmussen Republicans and GOP lean, Q Polls, Survey USA PollingRead morePage 1 of 5123...5Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (145) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on Will the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..Scott P on Will the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?Scott P on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSD Your Ad Here 2011 Politicaldog101.ComDesign by SRS Solutions
