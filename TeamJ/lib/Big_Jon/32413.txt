But there are still passengers stuck at NYC airports,perhaps through New Years, and the West Coast will get hit again.EJ Dionne:In New Jersey, the interesting story is that Gov. Chris Christie and his lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, were both out of state. Worse, Christies actual vacation location allowed Ben Smith of Politico to run his item under the headline: Christie at Disney World. As Smith wrote: Political lore holds that snow storms are iconic tests for executives, and one famously helped turn John Lindsays mayoralty sour. So it is, at least, notable that Chris Christie didnt fly back from his Disney World vacation for this weeks blizzard. Hes thrived on the image of a take-charge executive; natural disasters are the sort of moment when an executive is supposed to take charge. Christie is now a big deal in national Republican politics, and the fact that Smith took notice of Christies absence for his national audience of political junkies is significant.EJ wrote this yesterday, and NBC covered the very same story last night. Barbara Morrill covered the opposite extreme inCory Bookers blizzard good works.Added:Christies political snowpocalypse?NY Times:Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Tuesday that New York City was doing all it could to clear streets of snow and abandoned vehicles two days after being hit by a major blizzard. But while the citys response to the storm has drawn withering criticism from residents who live outside Manhattan, Mr. Bloomberg said he did not know when all of the citys streets might be plowed.In my day they were the OBs (outer boroughs) and never got the attention Manhattan got from utility and sanitation. This is nothing new, though it might be new to Bloomberg.Gene Robinson:It was a capitulation . . . of dramatic proportions, [Sen. Lindsay] Graham said in a radio interview last week. I can understand the Democrats being afraid of the new Republicans. I cant understand Republicans being afraid of the new Republicans.Oh, but theres reason to be very afraid.I dont want to overstate the Republicans predicament. They did, after all, take control of the House and win six more seats in the Senate. But during the lame-duck session, it seemed to dawn on GOP leaders that they begin the new Congress burdened with great expectations  but lacking commensurate power. Its going to be a challenge for Republicans just to maintain party unity, much less to enact the kind of conservative agenda they promised to their enthusiastic, impatient voters.What? Responsibility and governance? Whats that got to do with the tea party? they are already gunning forScott Brown.Ezra Klein:That Obama would think it important that an NFL team made a major statement about the employability of ex-convicts makes sense. That hed want to take a risk and throw his weight behind the decision by making that call is admirable. But for the White House to now say that the call was really about energy efficiency in stadium design both makes Obama look a bit Carteresque  does he really have time to be worrying about the energy efficiency of football stadiums?  and blunts whatever impact the call itself could have had. That was a call either worth making or not worth making, but it definitely wasnt worth making if the president wasnt willing to stand behind it.Update: On Twitter, Ana Marie Coxnotesthat all commentary on this question should link to the Second Chances Act, and shes right.WaPo: Hey, hows your bank doing?Amid high unemployment, a struggling economy, and a still devastated real estate market, the nation is closing out the year with 157 bank failures, up from 140 in 2009.

Right now about 110 million acres are so protected, and only Congress can add new areas. But designating lands as wilderness study areas  as the Utah lands would have been before the 2003 deal  gives them provisional protections until Congress has a chance to act.The question now  and its a big one  is whether the bureau will exercise its restored authorityMichael P. McDonald on AZ and the census:The federal government uses these population counts to distribute federal dollars to the states.According to Andrew Reamer at the Brookings Institution, in 2008 the federal government distributed $866.5 billion in funds to the states based on the census population counts. Your state gets its share of the federal pie based on the number of people that are counted by the census. If there were $866.5 billion in funds to disperse in 2010, each person would be worth $2,807 in federal money to your state.Note that I say people not citizens. This is where Arizona may have lost as much as three-quarters of a billion dollars annually in federal funding. The Arizona state government could have easily put this money to good use, asaccording to theNew York Times, the state faced a $2.6 billion shortfall in fiscal year 2011.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesAbbreviated Pundit Round-up.....12/29/10, banks, Blogs, NJ Gov/Lt Gov, NYC, Obama & Vick, Public land and Census based $$$, WeatherRead moreIts ColderWould you believe this IS global warming?December 26, 2010jamesb10119 commentsOn its face value I dont.Right now its snowing like the dickens..But this piece in the New York Times explains that because of global warming.We actually get MORE mositure from ice melt (In cloder areas) that covers largeer areas .Which covers MORE land which results in LOWER temperturesGot it?Read the pieceIt took me several times to understand the cycle[Eleven-year-old twins, Cameron and Danielle Whitlock, make a snowman in their front yard in Decatur, Ala. on an unusually snowy Christmas morning, Saturday, Dec. 25, 2010. After blanketing parts of the Midwest and hampering motorists there on Christmas Eve, the storm dipped south late Friday. Winter weather advisories were in effect Saturday morning from Arkansas to the Carolinas and from West Virginia to central Alabama. Much of North Carolina was under a winter storm warning. (AP Photo/The Decatur Daily, John Godbey)]THE earth continues to get warmer, yet its feeling a lot colder outside. Over the past few weeks, subzero temperatures in Poland claimed 66 lives; snow arrived in Seattle well before the winter solstice, and fell heavily enough in Minneapolis to make the roof of the Metrodome collapse; and last weekblizzards closed Europes busiest airports in London and Frankfurt for days, stranding holiday travelers. The snow and record cold have invaded the Eastern United States, with more bad weather predicted.All of this cold was met with perfect comic timing by the release ofa World Meteorological Organization report showing that 2010 will probably be among the three warmest years on record, and 2001 through 2010 the warmest decade on record.How can we reconcile this? The not-so-obvious short answer is that the overall warming of the atmosphere is actually creating cold-weather extremes. Last winter, too, was exceptionally snowy and cold across the Eastern United States and Eurasia, as were seven of the previous nine winters.For a more detailed explanation, we must turn our attention to the snow in SiberiaMore..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Media, Other Things, UpdatesGlobal Warming, warming of the atmosphere is actually creating cold-weather extremes, WeatherRead moreThe Northeast is going to get some snowFlights are being cancelled..December 26, 2010jamesb101No commentsHere we go!..More than 800 cancellations hit NYC airports as storm approachesNew York City-area airports have canceled more than 800 flights because of a massive snowstorm thats on its way up the East Coast.

Airlines said more cancellations were likely as the storm progressed. Travel misery began a day earlier in parts of the South, where a rare white Christmas came with reports of dozens of car crashes.In Washington transportation officials pretreated roads and readied 200 salt trucks, plows and other pieces of equipment to fight the 6 inches or more expected to fall in the Mid-Atlantic region.The Northeast is expected to get the brunt of the storm. Forecasters issued a blizzard warning for New York City for Sunday and Monday, with a forecast of 11 to 16 inches of snow and strong winds that will reduce visibility to near zero at times. A blizzard warning was also in effect for Rhode Island and most of eastern Massachusetts including Boston, with forecasters predicting 15 to 20 inches of snow.

The center of the hurricane should pass near Southeastern New England on Friday night, with the eye of the storm closest to Nantucket, forecasters said.Hurricane warnings mean hurricane conditionssustained winds of 74 miles per hour or higherare expected.

Football players moved practice sessions to evening hours and election officials in Tennessee touted air conditioned polling places to lure voters.At least 13 deaths in Tennessee and Mississippi have been related to the recent stretch of steamy weather.Heat advisories or warnings were in effect in 18 states Thursday, with temperatures in the mid to upper 90s and high humidity driving the heat index to more than 100.The hottest air of the summer has moved into the mid-South, theNational Weather Service said. Forecasters called the heat wave dangerous and urged people to avoid outdoor work, drink lots of liquids and stay cool.Tennessee is holding state primary and local general elections, with highs forecast at 101 degrees in Memphis and 98 in Nashville. Election officials encouraged voters to turn out by stressing that ballot stations are air conditioned.In Memphis, Mayor A C Wharton has urged people to be nosy and check in on their neighbors during the heat wave. The city has set up four community centers as cooling centers for people without air conditioners, and the Shelby County Community Services Agency was to hand out 300 air conditioners.This hasnt been the hottest summer on record for Washington, D.C., but its been far more harsh than 2009, said weather service meteorologist Heather Sheffield. Last year, there were 22 days where temperatures hit 90 or higher. There already have been 45 days where temperatures hit at least 90 degrees this year, Sheffield said.However, Sayed Arngbar said the heat doesnt bother him. He has operated a food cart on the corner of 14th and L streets in northwest Washington for 23 years.For me, its not a problem.

Washington in June recorded the highest average temperature for the month since record keeping began in 1871  including 18 days of 90 degrees or more. July is on its way to a similar unwelcome record.In New York City, temperatures in July have averaged 5.5 degrees above normal, according to the private weather service AccuWeather.Standing in Kansas Citys scorching sun, motorcycle police officers holding radar guns bemoaned polyester pants that cannot breathe, and said they were stuffing cooling packs inside their bullet-proof vests. Zoo officials fed ice cubes to otters and asked visitors to come early in the day, when the animals were more active.Some people were determined to maintain their routines no matter what. Ted Iobst, 24, an analyst at the Atlantic Media Company in Washington, has been arriving at work two hours early recently, largely to beat the heat. But even in early morning, the cyclists coming over the bridge have looked like theyve just finished a stage in theTour de France, he said.Perhaps no one is more acutely aware of the weather than the homeless.A few men stood beneath a tree outside Washingtons largest shelter, sipping cold, cold, cold Slurpees, in the words of Anthony Davis, 53, a resident. He had ventured outside to stretch his legs.Ordinarily, the 1,300 residents of his shelter, the Community for Creative Nonviolence, must leave the building in the morning, returning at night. But on Friday, like most of the days this month, the city declared a red alert, permitting residents to stay inside the air-conditioned facility, to prevent heat-related deaths. The city declared nine red alerts in June and 15 so far in July. In 2009, there were two for the same period.Many cities and towns, including New York, Washington and Las Vegas, have set up cooling centers, air-conditioned public spaces where people can go to cool off and drink some cold water. Washington has also distributed hundreds of free electric fans to the poor, but had run out of them by mid-July.Defining heat-related deaths is difficult, and most locations could not provide current numbers, but Maryland officials have blamed the heat for causing the deaths of 16 people so far this year.In Richmond, Va., where people jump into the James River for relief, two of them drowned during the last month.Since temperatures began their spiral in June, Washingtons emergency medical services have received 30 percent more calls than usual, many of them related to the heat, said Peter Piringer, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services.Between the extra trips and hotter weather, air-conditioners in the ambulances have been failing, with nearly one in five vehicles out of commission each day.The stifling heat blanketing the mid-Atlantic this summer seems to be part of a global trend. So far, 2010 is on track to overtake 2005 as the warmest year ever recorded for the planet, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.In Germany, a French fry crisis is looming: the length of fries may decline by nearly half an inch because heat and drought have cut the harvest of larger potatoes, Reuters reported.But even the endless summer of 2010 cannot compare to the hottest year of all, said Stephen Fybish, a weather historian in New York. In a class by itself, he said, was the Dust Bowl summer of 1936, when 15 states set records for heat that stand to this day.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Health, Other Things, UpdatesHeatwave, It's Hot, The temperature, WeatherRead moreIt was 103 Degrees yesterday in NYCJuly 7, 2010jamesb1018 comments[ The mercury hit 102 degrees in Central Park about 2:20 p.m., shattering the record set back in 1999 by a single degree. ]It was hot yesterdayMan Im glad I work in a air conditioned buildingIm going x=crazy at home though.Trying to keep my wife comfortable and not getting 1,000 electric bill next month..With the temperature reaching 103 degrees in Central Park at 3:11 p.m., breaking the former record high of 101 degrees for the day set in 1999, Con Edison officials braced for the greatest demand for power they had ever had to supply. The long red arrow on the dial projected on a screen in the utility companys command center in Manhattan hovered at the threshold of uncharted territory  13,141 megawatts consumed at one time  for most of the afternoon.The heat broke several records in the Northeast, as Boston, Providence and Philadelphia all saw temperatures in the 100s that eclipsed previous highs. In Philadelphia, a 92-year-old woman was found dead in her home on the second floor. The medical examiner ruled that extreme heat was a factor in her death.TheNational Weather Service blamed a high-pressure system along the East Coast that drew hot, humid air from the south and will probably stay put until late this week.In New York, the heats effects were unsparing: Some city pools were filled to capacity within an hour or so of opening, sending seekers of respite to libraries, cooling centers and other public havens from the heat. Hospitals set out jars of ice water as their waiting rooms filled with wheezing elderly patients and exhausted firefighters.Police CommissionerRaymond W. Kelly said that the Police Department was mindful that crime sometimes increased in the extreme heat of night, and was also prepared to send extra officers to places that had lost power.But even as Con Edison officials were optimistic that the city would survive the day without widespread power failures, they acknowledged that the intensity and duration of the heat wave could have a cumulative effect on the cables and transformers. In short, they said, the worst may be yet to come. Its Round 1 in a prizefight, said John Miksad, Con Edisons senior vice president of electric operations. Round 1 looks O.K., but the bell hasnt rung yet.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Health, Media, UpdatesHeat Wave in NYC and the NorthEast, Hot, WeatherRead morePage 1 of 41234Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
