See all 13 photosWe are always very quick to judge others and always believe that we know our children; when factually we don't and as such; should never judge them. The parents here missed seeing how brave and insightful their son really was, in giving hope.They knew he wouldn't survive when at the scene of the crash: a shape moved away from the wreck and rejoined him to become one again, in the ambulance.Hope In the Power of Giving:"Just hope," a mother said; consoling her sonHe was broken; in hospital after the crashHis friend; the driver lay hung over and dying In slow motion hope disappeared; lost in a flash.=+=And hope; this powerful, often bottled emotion Provides a bridge between facts and dreamsThe lost and dying drunk didnt feel their painHis sad death a selfish, hopeless act; it seems.=+=We had hoped that hed make it throughBut all his life we hoped hed show us moreThis distraught family of a hopeless soulDying; betrayed by the hopelessness he saw.=+=A surgeon came over and said; "Sorry for your loss"Yes our only son; I dont know how we will copeJust a waste; he took our hopes and dreams"Oh No!" said the surgeon; "Your brave son donated his heart; to give another hope!"=+=Sometimes untimely death provides a hope of lifeIf we care to look beyond our own anger and painWe may see that life hopes are very precious thingsA little hope can help us face our lives; or learn to live again. oo0oo Copyright 2010 Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rights reserved.It's a long road to find perfect. Live to Hope Again.She had hoped to find the perfect man She told her friends that hes the one We havent met; just talked on the net But hes nice and we have such fun.  =+= When they met; he charmed her over coffee She hoped that hed become her love In a violent night he broke her heart And then broke her nose, with that shove. =+= What if I had done everything he asked me to? What if I had laughed at his sick joke yesterday? Why did he hurt me; she sobbed from within her pain Be sad; but be brave: Be strong enough; to always walk away. oo0oo Always Remember:That YOU Have the Right to Be Happy! Never give up that right! Copyright 2010 Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rights reserved. Hope warms you through the chill before the sunrise. Hoping To Catch the Big Fish.We cast our lines at the evening sunsetOut into the gentle swells of our favorite seaWe hoped to catch more than our breakfastOn a magic night we set a fire, fished and talkedAgreeing that on nights like this; fishing was meant to be. =+=Throughout the night we caught a feedIn this great place, was good company and funAnd now with an early morning rising tideEqual parts of anticipation, hope and burley ruledInwardly, each of us now focused on hooking the big one.=+=In the change of light just before the sunriseWe cast fresh baits; I just knew they'd hit mineThat's the time when you can taste hopeThe hope that warms you through that chillAnd tells you "Strike that 20 pounder tugging on your line!"=+=There's something about fishingMaybe it's just relaxing with a beerMaybe it's quality time spent with matesBut I know on nights and mornings like thisIt's just about fishing and just about being here.oo0oo Copyright 2010 Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rights reserved. So Many People all the Same. Hope Lost on the Crowd.People are too busy today: And they just dont care Hurriedly they jostle and push; their noses in the air So many people moving; yet each alone in the crowd Wise words fall unheard; lost to people far too loud. =+= So many people shut their eyes and just refuse to see So many blind, busy people: Deafened by their apathy So many apathetic people; they'll never change their ways But if they don't talk or listen: How will they learn; the hopes of yesterday? oo0oo Copyright 2010 Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rights reserved.  What's the Weather Like There? But we always try to get it right! The Cost of Hoping For Sunny Days.=+=Yes I have recovered from most of the painYou know its been over a year since that stormToday I try not to think about the weather anymoreBut it just seems to always hurt on rainy days.=+=I have learned that if I keep my head down; it helps me To see those puddles that precede the flash floodsAnd I dont see those black clouds that carry bad luckOh yes, Im also happy to say that; my wind has gone.=+=People always tell me; there is light at the end of the tunnelBut I dont know what they mean; if they pat me as wellTheres a rainbow coming tomorrow; maybe hail; I cant tellI wonder why it seems to always hurt more on rainy days.=+=Yes I feel that I have recovered; from most of the painSince I planted cabbages the UV rays only go next doorAnd it doesnt snow anymore since my prayers came trueI must tell you the good news; I found my remote on the floor.=+=Will it be an avalanche, an eruption, a dust storm or fire That will determine the final future of this cruel worldIf I open my door; the sun shines up my back passageI suppose youve guessed; that I dont chase; tornadoes anymore.=+=Well I must say that its been nice to catch up with you And to hear all the news without a weather reportTime flies now that we are counting down to the endNow it seems everyone is an expert today; yep thats the trend.=+=Give my love to everyone at the met office; I hope that Ill be back on deck again when its finally warmBut all the pressure, those critic complaints take their tollTry as we may; it seems we cant always bring the sun out NormSo I guess thats why forecasters seem to hurt on rainy days For us: With critics and no sun; theres no shelter from the storm.oo0oo Copyright 2010 Pearldiver @ Poems of Hope.com with all rights reserved.Hope: A reason to be your best.

Most of the picures are of New Zealand, where many great actors have come from. But I don't think Pearldiver needs a Holly or Bollywood Agent yet! I'm pleased that you enjoyed this work.

I'm glad that you took the time to think about some of the poems here, as that is the key to understanding the message in the poem's bottle. You be well and Take Care.Nellieanna5 months ago I laughed till I cried reading your profile; then I cried till I smiled reading your wonderful poetry and seeing the most incredible photoart I've seen in awhile.  Somehow, I feel such a kinship.  I had a similar youth, not on an island with a lighthouse and passing ships and a gollywog as a friend but on a very remote west Texas ranch with a black sambo doll as a friend and lots of sheep and goats as population.Anyway, I felt your spirit reading you and was so happy to discover you here, thanks to your visit to my hub!Thank you!Pearldiver5 months ago Hi... you are most welcome Nellieanna, thank you for taking the time to read my newest collection of shuffled words. Well, I guess if I made you laugh then I'm responsible for improving your day and for that I'm pleased.It's funny that you had goats surrounding you.. so did I and I found them a complete waste of time for trying to have an intelligent conversation with. Once again thanks for your kind words.. Be Well and Take Care.SilverGenes5 months ago The strength, humour and beauty in these poems came shining through so loud and clear it may have changed the weather here. The photography just enhanced the mood even more - thank you. I should be used to it here on Hubpages, but finding talent like this as I'm cruising around on a Sunday morning, drinking coffee, always leaves me feeling like I've found treasure. And indeed I have :)SilverGenes5 months ago Uh, make that Saturday morning. More coffee is in order! LOLPearldiver5 months ago Hi SilverGenes, what a Golden review, thank you very much for your comments and for taking the time to read this collection of poems of hope. If my work has changed the weather then I hope that it wasn't from sunny to rainy days. I'm glad you enjoyed this work, be well and take care.VAMPGYRL4205 months ago Beautiful work, Pearldiver!!! :)AEvans5 months ago Each poem has such beautiful meaning( Hope) and they have touched my inner soul.

Well I guess I'm very lucky if what you are telling me is true Kim; I was only looking to write thought provoking poems. Once again, thanks mate, you be well and take care.Pearldiver5 months ago Hello Maita, Thanks for reading this and catching up. I'm glad you liked these poems... I have aong way to go before I can take on Pablo Neruda of course.. but maybe next year I'll get him. I have an advantage as he can't critique my works lol. A drunk guy, who had lost both his arms once told me that I was responsible for raising his spirits too.... but he was drunk before I even opened my mouth. Take Care and Be Well.equealla5 months ago The judo mouse made it for me. Then you fold a love blanket knitted in words around a baby. You just keep on to amaze me with your talent.Thank you for sharing these extraordinary play with words. I always enjoy reading it.Pearldiver5 months ago Hi equealla, awesome thanks for reading them. That was a good interview done on you and it was good to see that you look as though you've hit your stride (sorri, a kiwi horse racing term). I'm just lucky that I have some old wisdom to draw on when I need it mate.. no more than that. Sorry that NZ nailed Sth Africa again in the rugby cup.

Really good hub.Pearldiver5 months ago Hi Zac, thanks for reading this collection and your kind comments. I really appreciate it and I'm glad you enjoyed it. Take Care and Be Well.Steele Fields5 months ago I especially liked "Hope in the Power of Giving."  Sad and beautiful.  A  tough subject to explore and you did it without being overly sentimental.  I'm new to hub pages, just getting my feet wet, and I was wondering about something I've noticed:  why do so many hubbers, yourself included, put more than one poem in a hub, when there's a chance they might become lost in the pile?  It seems to me that publishing them separately would get readers to give each individual poem more careful consideration.  That being said, you are obviously keeping their attention!  Thanks for the beautiful hub.Pearldiver5 months ago Hi Steele Fields, welcome to HP and to my collection of randomly shuffled words; Thank you for readng them and for your compliments. The reason that I put more than one poem in my hubs, has to do with my preferred word count and hubbing style. The other thing is that my works generally score well as opposed to individual pages that tend to score lower.I've looked at some of your work... you write well, nice to meet you; I spent some good time in Penn State (not in B&W striped PJs) Still follow the Phillies even though I'm a kiwi. Take Care and be well.epigramman5 months ago ...well I came here to dive for pearls - and I found plenty of them ... pearls of poetic wisdom, profound thoughts and a deep soulful meditation on life and living which makes us rich - when we read someone like you!she5 months ago your poems remind me of so much, of the days i used to hope and dream, before reality struck.Thanks for reminding me that i should not be afraid to dream anymore!Pearldiver5 months ago Hi epigramman, thanks for calling by; even if was to cart off my pearls and thanks for your compliments. I guess I'm quite lucky as I found this very fertile bed of oysters and most of them contain good random shufflings of poetry. Cheers for your support. Take Care and be well.Pearldiver5 months ago Hello She, thank you for reading this collection and your kind compliment. I am glad that you enjoyed the poems. You stopped dreaming? You can make reality out of a dream She. Don't ever be afraid to hope and dream... it is when you believe that you make something positive happen. Don't give up on that. You Take Care and be well.maven1015 months ago Rob...Thank you for these sage and compelling observations so poetically presented...Lots of wisdom and inspiration there...I have never viewed Hope as a positive attribute to find success in life...Hope to me has been a weakness to face reality with determination...Hoping for the best does not trump doing your best, or accepting life on its terms...Saying I hope the world will come together in peace and cooperation is a pale shadow to doing something to make that happen...I guess I have a Sisyphean view of the world in that I have forsaken all hope and replaced it with an inner strength that is untouchable, a sure confidence that I will prevail...low expectations provide a safe haven for dashed dreams...As always, your haiku inspires and delights...I have always read haiku out loud, sometimes to myself, and sometimes to my woman...your haiku is the sort that needs to be shared, discussed, and applauded...Thank you my friend for another poetic journey punctuated with wonderful pictures accentuating each poem's theme or message...LarryPearldiver5 months ago Hi Larry, Thanks for reading this collection and as always your objective and positive comments. I have also always viewed hope in the same regard as you, but then I considered the many aspects of Hope in their standalone form; positively. I found that hope is not, when used positively, a negative in any respect; in fact in some forms, Hope in itself is the motivation to succeed. I believe that many, as you state; don't drive it or use it as the base for making that event materialise. I believe that I have described this point within one of my poems of hope.I have worked with people who have only had two things in their lives that they were able to rely on (beyond family) and found that what has driven them to succeed has always been that inner strength that is untouchable and the hope that using it positively and objectively; will equate to achieving the dream. Take Care and Be Well my friend.DevinCo4 months ago These poems are full of all the things you said in your introduction.  I like all of them alot.  Good works.Pearldiver4 months ago Hi Devin, thank you for taking the time to read these works and your kind comment.

Even the drunk can be sober at one point, your friend is only half drunk. My I always thought you're good at writing poetry.

For a newbie like me, it's inspiring. Also love the subtle injection of humor: e.g. when the television remote is found on the floor. That had me laughing abruptly. You now have an apple in your fanpile (I'm not sure what fruit represents N. Americans).Pearldiver7 weeks ago Hi DTjnr, thanks for reading this collection of poems and for your awesome comment. Glad you like that poem about the weather man who no longer chases tornadoes.. that is one of the funniest poems that I have written.... as I was laughing throughout, thinking how can I take them on a journey in which they think I'm crazy, but in reality I'm describing something that they see everyday, yet don't realize? Had to to be either the news or the weather. Oh yeah... people from NZ are called Kiwis... It wasn't a reference to the fruit.. If you've left an apple in my fanpile.. an aussi is likely to munch it! Let me know if you suffer any sharp pain on ya.. you know!  Take Care.Eiddwen4 weeks ago Hi you have a great hub here and so well thought out.The finished product is brilliant.
