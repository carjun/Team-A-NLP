Gabrielle Giffords was critically shot.. "Back in March 2010, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) responded to the use of violent imagery and heated political rhetoric from conservative activists -- mentioning Sarah Palin's use of crosshairson a map over Democratic-held districts such as hers. At the time, Giffords said that people should realize such rhetoric has consequences. Giffords was shot today at a meet-and-greet with constituents in Tucson. In March, Giffords appeared on MSNBC to talk about the then-recent vandalism of her office, which followed her vote for health care reform. During the interview, she said that political leaders had a responsibility to say they would not stand for violence." How eerie is this. Pima County SheriffSheriff Clarence Dupnik also said the following in his news conference, "I think, yes, she was the target,"  He also spent time venting his anger at the "vitriol" he said comes from radio and television personalities. he said "That may be free speech, but its not without consequences," & "I hope that are all Americans are as saddened and as shocked as we are," he said. "We need to do a little soul searching." Arizona in particular, he said, has "become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry."  I could not agree more as this is a sentiment I have always expressed that Politicians and Media pundits who are far removed from the masses or extremists spew vitriol for their benefits without thinking of the lives of the people they expose. This is a very sad day. Our sympathies and prayers to all those who have been affected and we hope this is a wake up call for all. |        1 of 39              Rep.Gabrielle Giffords speaking of Political violence and its implications      mrspleats is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (61.9%) Canada (21.9%) Czech Republic (3.8%) China (2.9%) 7 other countries (6.7%)           READ MORE: Eerily Ironic.TPM Flashback: Giffords Warned Of 'Consequences' To Palins Target Imagery (VIDEO), Arizona, Rep.Gabrielle Gifford, Washington, Sarah Palin, tucson, Gabrielle Giffords, Joe Arpaio, Geography of the United States, United States, Clarence Dupnik, Eric Kleefeldof Talking Points Memo, disasters-news   More News From: Tucson :  AZ :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 8            Reply  Posted By     dhreff|1 dayagomrspleats, yes your news report attests to the fact that, politics is a dirty game played anywhere, be it in developed and developing countries. If Senator McCain was then, the elected US President, do you think image of Arizona as "mecca of prejudice and bigotry" would be projected in media?Yes, I read news about Congresswoman Gifford's death an that was a big blow against President Obama in McCain country. I will be glad to hear from you. Rate You Up.            Reply  Reply By     mrspleats|1 dayagoThe Congresswoman is still alive though critical in hospital. A federal Judge ,her aide and others have died though.Perhaps if Mccain were elected it would not have been so as the political motivation would have been different.The problems would still be there I am sure.To me it is important that people learn to think for themselves. It is a sad day. We wish the people affected our deepest sympathies.Take care            Reply  Posted By     Veronica P Roberts |1 dayagoI wrote a little commentary to get people's feedback on this very subject:whether Palin and some on the Right, are responsible for this tragedy today. All the irrational rage on the Right was ratcheted up by those pundits screaming on the podiums and airwaves nationwide and no one spoke out about it.            Reply  Reply By     mrspleats|about 14 hoursagoYou are so right.This is so true,if when we write here there is so much rage,you can just imagine the rage people who are low information types,disenfranchised etc will get when all they hear on the radio stations etc are words of hate. The sherrif was right in calling it out and now people are mad at him. Do you see what I mean,there is none to support the right thing.It has been reported that Gifford's opponent offered a prize to the constituents to go shooting with him to use his M16,if they could get her out. Now can you imagine someone who is mental hearing this.?Everybody is acting all innocent now,politicians and their media pundits are equally to blame. America needs to end the useless war in Afghanistan and use the fund to provide security for their leaders etc.I hope the people see and now get it.I am glad Canadian politicians and media pundits are more objective and know they can win an election without spewing hate. As a matter of fact if that were attempted,that person would certainly lose.Another thing our safety net provides for the needy so that too helps to reduce the anger against government etc.Have a safe and beautiful love filled day!            Reply  Posted By     Andy Mathisen|about 23 hoursagoMy first comment got lost in a Google "crash" so I must reiterate the angst and flavour of my first post. Arghhh.The irony of this video news snippet only adds grim ammo to the "political" nature of the madness today. Words like Target..and Crosshairs..and Violence shows the tinderbox crucible today's events were inflamed by. Somewhere in the rhetoric someone snapped and let loose their madness and anger. Misguided..misdirected and maladjusted first come to mind. Kids with guns..Pundits fueling passions and the politics of polarity fill in the rest of this menu of mayhem.As ye sow; Ye shall reap. Discord leads to Danger.The media is just as much at fault for fanning the flames..and fueling the fires of discontent.            Reply  Posted By     mrspleats|about 14 hoursagoAndy,Well said,there seems to be no objectivity in that country regarding guns ,vitriol and its evils,politicians and media that fan the flames as it were.That is sad indeed. The sherrif is now being attacked by some as he spoke truth to power regarding too much vitriol ,media's responsibility etc. it is time everyone sees the woods and not the trees.Have fun and keep on being bold.!            Reply  Posted By     Adrian Holman|about 9 hoursagoThese Tea Party scrubs need to stop listening to Sarah Palin.            Reply  Reply By     mrspleats|about 9 hoursagoPeople willnot stop listening if that is where their hearts are. They only stop if they change their thinking. Low information people seldom change,they do not see a need and are so bigotted intheir thinking. If someone like Sarah Palin would shut up or change her rhetoric,these same teapartiers would turn on her.
