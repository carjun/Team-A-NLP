Relatives say Mohammed Bouazizi died Tuesday after he attempted suicide last month by setting himself on fire in front a government building. He took the action after authorities seized his produce. The 26-year old university graduate said he could only find work as a street merchant. His actions sparked a wave of protests against rising joblessness in Tunisia. Police killed two people during one demonstration while protesters set fire to a local headquarters of President Zine El Abidine Ben AliZine El Abidine Ben Ali's ruling party in another incident. Protests are rare in Tunisia, whose government tolerates little dissent. The unrest led President Ben Ali to name a new youth minister and appoint a new governor for Sidi Bouzid, the city where the unrest began. Official media said the president also launched a program to create jobs for Tunisians with university diplomas.        1 of 20         Tunisian President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali (C) waves to his supporters      mfaisalrafique is based in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (60.8%) Tunisia (13.5%) Pakistan (4.7%) Netherlands (3.4%) 14 other countries (13.5%)           READ MORE: Tunisia, Tunis, Unrest (band), Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Ben Ali, Sidi Bou Zid, Tarak Mekki, geography, political-news, War Conflict, Africa, Mohammed Bouazizi, political-news   More News From: Tunis :  Tunisia     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 28            Reply  Posted By     mfaisalrafique|4 daysagothats great news keep rating up...............
