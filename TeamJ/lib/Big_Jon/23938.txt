The site has issued its "State of the States" rankings and Arizona has been ranked 48th on its list of well-run states.The rankings are based on analysis of each state's financial situation, so if you're shocked Arizona ranked so poorly, you shouldn't be. This is the same state that was nearly forced to sell its state capitol because its budget was so out of whack.

Let us know in our morning poll.Today's the day for the public to decide on Governor Jan Brewer's miracle cure for the state budget: Proposition 100.Brewer's been pushing for the one-percent sales-tax increase since the doom and gloom of Arizona's finances set in last summer.Brewer's beentugging on the heartstrings of thepublic in her campaign to passProp. 100, saying it's neededto protect funding for things likeeducation, public safety, and health and human services.Opponents of the measure, mainly Republicans,say it's absurd to tax people more when the economy is in the tank.People are heading to the polls right now to weigh in, and we want to know what you think: Will Brewer's plan get the public nod of approval?Let us know what you think -- and see the results of yesterday's poll -- after the jump.

Of course you don't, but that didn't stop legislators from taking time out of their day to pass a bill that asks taxpayers to do exactly that.The "I-didn't-pay-enough fund" is the creation of numbSkull Valley Representative Judy Burges. It asks taxpayers to voluntarily donate money to the state government to help chip away at the state's $2.6 billion budget shortfall.You may remember Burges from one of the other -- even more embarrassing -- bills she sponsored this session, the infamous "birther" bill,also making strides in the Arizona Legislature.Burges' "I-didn't-pay-enough"bill passed the Arizona Senate on Monday and now awaits the signature or veto of Governor Jan Brewer.We've been laughing about this bill since we first caught wind of it last December, If history tells us anything, in about 10 years, the measure will reap about $2,500 for the state.

Those to be released are inmates that have been convicted of non-violent crimes like DUI or low-level drug offenses.The plan isn't exactly a get-out-of-jail-free card, either. Those released would be turned over to ICE officials and eventually sent back to their native countries.
