Had the evacuees been allowed to cross the bridge, they would have been in a far worse situation without any transportation to bring them anywhere," Lawson said. "If I were I faced with the same situation today, I would make the same decision."Adele Owen, a Baton Rouge attorney for the plaintiffs, did not immediately return a call seeking comment Tuesday afternoon.http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-16/129360781314920.xml&coll=1groups:News, Law and Justice, Actual News, Exposing the Wrongs tags:Law,Justice,Katrina,Gretna,U.S. District Judge Mary Ann Vial Lemmon 1 more|72 comments// Judge scraps Katrina bridge lawsuit - She calls blockade reasonable actionhide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

I find injustice tragic. 7 days agoflag  reply+1KSirysSo much for America the Great....  Now the population is last on the food chain, first the government, than the corporations, than the rich and lastly, from their golden shower of "help", the people that pay their salaries...  how sad. 7 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruthHere is one Romanian man stands up for his beliefs.http://current.com/news/92886952_romanian-man-jumps-from-balcony-as-protest.htm 7 days agoflag  reply+1treewolf39  MotherForTruth:Well that was painful. More of a face-plant for a belief. 7 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruth  treewolf39:Yes it is quite radical but I bet he got a message across. 7 days agoflag  reply+2KSirys  MotherForTruth:If that would have happened here, he would have been shot and then helped... 7 days agoflag  reply+1treewolf39  MotherForTruth:I did not get WHY he jumped. 7 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruth  treewolf39:According to the article he was protesting the government's austerity measures. He was wearing a shirt which read "You've pierced us. You've killed our children's future. Freedom." 7 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruth  KSirys:No he would have been called a terrorist. 7 days agoflag  reply+1treewolf39  MotherForTruth:Goodness! And they are not done by a long shot. 7 days agoflag  reply+4bailey78I find it to be a real shame when we treat those in a foreign land such as haiti better during and after a natural disaster than we do our own people. I believe it is time to hold our Goverment accountable for their actions. 7 days agoflag  reply+5MotherForTruth  bailey78:I believe you are right it is time to hold our Goverment accountable. 7 days agoflag  reply+4bailey78  MotherForTruth:Just where to start is another problem. We can Vote all we want but that does not mean we will get the change we want. We can see that with who is in office now. He ran on the presumption  of change. The only change I see is who is in office. So what are we to do pick up arms and get mowed down like grass by an army of our brothers and sisters?  Do we start a letter writing campaign just to add to the governments waste bins? 7 days agoflag  reply+4MotherForTruth  bailey78:You raise great questions. I sure struggle with the same. One thing for sure being idle will make our lives even worse. If each and everyone put the actions where their mouth is we would make changes. Write, call, oppose, protest. As far as voting goes, we are constantly manipulated by the media. Those who should be voted in do not get the needed attention or getting measured against irrelevant criteria. 7 days agoflag  reply+3bailey78  MotherForTruth:If we try to put into action what our mouths are saying we will be held as terrorist. That means we will be held without bail in a jail that nobody has ever heard of in a place that no one has heard of. Don't believe me go fourth and give it a try. 7 days agoflag  reply+1MotherForTruth  bailey78:I completely agree with you. We need to work within the law, one injustice at at time. 7 days agoflag  reply+2bailey78  MotherForTruth:If It will take a life time of fighting one injustice at a time to get the Goverment to change.  Then so be it where do we start? Monosonto? The banks? 7 days agoflag  reply+3MotherForTruth  bailey78:We have to stay awake and respond to each and every issue close to your heart. Stand for your beliefs. It will take a lifetime but what choice do we have? 7 days agoflag  reply+2bailey78  MotherForTruth:We always have a choice to stand for something or fall for everything.. 7 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruth  bailey78:I can not agree more! 7 days agoflag  reply+2treewolf39  bailey78:You bring up a good point. To change the current situation many have to be willing to stand firm and tell the truth and then be tortured and renditioned and, You said it "Reeducated." This fact sucks but those in power ARE killers and liars. 7 days agoflag  reply+2bailey78  treewolf39:I believe it is time to take away that power. just how to do so is the real question. 7 days agoflag  reply0bailey78  MotherForTruth:Thank You :) 7 days agoflag  replytreewolf39  treewolf39:This comment was removed by its owner.+2MotherForTruth  treewolf39:That's true. Nothing can be accomplished sitting on the couch. 7 days agoflag  reply+2treewolf39  bailey78:We must fill up there prisons and refuse the lies through civil disobedience. It will not be nice or easy and many will be beaten and killed just like every other time the people have stood for freedom against fascism and dictators. Civil rights claimed many lives but slowly conciseness is changing and the old racists are dying off. 7 days agoflag  reply+2bailey78  treewolf39:The prisons are full but with the wrong people. Nothing worth having is ever easy. When we make a stand againest them We will not only be fighting the Goverment but our brothers and sisters that have sworn to protect them. I do not blame them they are only doing what they have been programed to do. To fight them on their terms is to lose. When the time comes we will know to make a stand if not for our freedom then for our future and the future of our children. 7 days agoflag  reply+1artemis6  bailey78:I think we should start by giving time limits on the life of corporations , they need to die , BEFORE they take over the world . They are immortal now , so they can spend generations sucking power from the masses . They are like a cancer cell , that does not die as it should . 7 days agoflag  reply+1bailey78  artemis6:that would be a good start. Now how do we get that started?? 7 days agoflag  reply+1artemis6  bailey78:Massive protesting and boycotts of one corporation at a time . Focus like a lazer ...... And boycott till it is dead . 6 days agoflag  reply0bailey78  artemis6:Kind of like me boycotting Wal-Mart it don't do much good but it makes me feel better about myself. So who is next on the list to Boycott? 6 days agoflag  reply+4MotherForTruthWhere is the equal protection under the law? Where is impartial media? Where is America I love? 7 days agoflag  reply+2bailey78  MotherForTruth:cowering in the shadows in fear of being sent to guantanamo bay for reeducation. 7 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruth  bailey78:I sure am in fear of my government. 7 days agoflag  reply+2bailey78  MotherForTruth:as we all are. Those that say they are not in fear of our goverment either they are lieing or they are fools. 7 days agoflag  reply+4MotherForTruth  bailey78:So true, and we have many fools in America. 7 days agoflag  reply+5lifestudentno83Outrageous. Justice was not served here, but rather serviced to an inhumane action. You don't turn away people back into a flood, you welcome them with open arms whether or not you have the food or shelter to give. I thought that's what American people were about- brotherhood and neighborly good will for all men. The police officers stifled that notion, and the courts justified it. Both are wrong and we should be up in arms about it. 7 days agoflag  reply+1CitizenHillIt does depend on how reasonable is defined and who is making that "judge"ment doesn't it? 8 days agoflag  reply+4MotherForTruth  CitizenHill:Here is how I define it, would the judge call it reasonable to send her own family back to flooded area? 7 days agoflag  reply+2CitizenHill  MotherForTruth:Yes, that does give pause to wonder, doesn't it? 7 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruth  CitizenHill:Sure does. 7 days agoflag  reply+2artemis6This is an outrage !

I think that is a lame excuse as to me it appears their lives were in imminent danger where they were where I am sure they also had no food, water or shelter. What a disgrace. 8 days agoflag  reply0gepma44RACISM LIVES .....justifiable homocide look at the preponderous amount of killings of black people by law enforcement ....GOD dont like ugly one day white america will be brought to her knees and made to pay......dearly.....ps this has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with right and wrong....the chickens will come home to roost 8 days agoflag  reply+7regjoeschmothis is what a police state looks like..... 8 days agoflag  reply+4MotherForTruth  regjoeschmo:Sure does. Now what? 8 days agoflag  reply+5Increduloushttp://timespicayune.comPage 2 of the article:In addition to rejecting the claims of constitutional violations, Lemmon dismissed several alleged violations of state law, including false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault and battery. The plaintiffs can refile those claims in state court. The ruling comes in the last of four cases filed in federal court that stem from the Sept. 1, 2005, decision by Gretna, Jefferson Parish and Crescent City Connection police to prevent pedestrians from using the bridge. The other cases were dismissed, and the Sheriffs' Office settled with an Algiers family for $10,000. At least one lawsuit related to the bridge blockade remains in New Orleans Civil District Court. The plaintiffs in the case Lemmon dismissed alleged that law enforcement officers used racial slurs, fired warning shots over their heads, pressed loaded guns against their bodies and placed them in headlocks and chokeholds, violating multiple constitutional rights. Lemmon threw out the vast majority of the claims Sept. 17. Her latest ruling dismissed alleged violations of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, concluding the blockade did not amount to an "unreasonable restraint of liberty." . . . . . . .

I guess without being there and knowing the full circumstances, i really don't know what to feel. 8 days agoflag  reply+2treewolf39  Itsbatman_Durr:Solid comment! +^'d 8 days agoflag  reply+2Incredulous  Itsbatman_Durr:yes you do...you are supposed to be pissed off and produce a credible rant...this is current! ;-) 8 days agoflag  reply+5Itsbatman_Durr  Incredulous:lol ok then! those dirty so and so's need to do more of (fill in the blank) while not taking my (insert generic thing here)!

The people who were blocked from crossing that bridge were screwed, royally screwed. 8 days agoflag  reply+5Incredulous  Itsbatman_Durr:I knew you had it in you! 8 days agoflag  reply+3treewolf39  Incredulous:Why I agree with and stand by my comment is, "We weren't there."
