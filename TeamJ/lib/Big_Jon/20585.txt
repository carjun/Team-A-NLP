It is the date that all of Hollywood willassemble and unveil the crme de la crme of films of 2010, and the entireworld will be watching.  2010 has been anotherroller coaster year for Hollywood, with some big money spinners and loathsomeduds. As always, little known indies creep in and challenge big studio effortsin the race to win that coveted Golden statue. So what are the contenders that may steal away a few awards?What are the early bets? In order to prepare yourself for the Oscar race, youcould grab yourself some popcorn ( or some cheesy nachos  with jalapenos and salsa if youre that wayinclined ), a big, cool slurpy drink and settle on your comfiest sofa to watch myselection box for possible Oscar glory. I will talk about the films that are creating the biggestbuzz so far. There may be commissions and omissions, but it is only one mansopinion. Although, the said man has a lifelong passion for a good film, a devotion to the big screen and a nose for a good story. The man, as you may have guessed, is yourstruly.  So sit back and relax. The show is on. Feature Attractions: 2010 Film Director Inception Christopher Nolan The King's Speech Tom Hooper Social Network David Fincher Toy story 3 Lee Unkrich The Fighter David O Russell True Grit Coen Brothers Black Swan Darren Aronofsky Never Let Me Go Mark Romanek 127 Hours Danny Boyle The Kids are All Right Lisa Chodolenko Winter's Bone Debra Granik Another Year Mike Leigh The Town Ben AffleckInceptioninceptionInception (Two-Disc Edition) [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $17.37List Price: $35.99INCEPTION Over 280 million dollars in the US box office alone andcounting. Christopher Nolan has a habit of making obscene amounts of cashfrom the discerning movie fan. We dont complain. For he makes movies that areworth talking about. From the crazilyconvoluted Memento to the insanely superior Dark Knight he has shown as he has the brain to concoct great scripts and the cojones  to producetall spectacle. Inception doesnt make it easy. It needs a lot of attention,and then some. The script has more hidden elements than a Russian matryoshkadoll. But it is the kind of film Hollywood loves. Intellectually demanding yetmounted on a scale that is pure big screen magic. The cinematography and theediting are stunning. The crazy dream within a dream within a dream are layeredin different palettes and different landscapes. The action is superior. It hasgot superb cast of Leonardo Di caprio, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon levitt, MichaelCaine and Juno herself  Ellen Page.Will Hollywood Crown its golden boy as best director?  Willit give him the gong for best screenplay? ( Nolan wrote it himself)  Come February,well know. Meanwhile if you havent seen it, grab it on bluray and spin it in yourbiggest TV screen. Sheer magic. Unmissable.  The King's SpeechThe Damned UnitedAmazon Price: $15.49List Price: $28.96The Damned United [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $20.72List Price: $34.95The KING'S SPEECH  If there was a template for winning at the Oscars, try this: a lead with a disability, a mentor who pushes all the buttons,  the disability is both physical and mental-the therapist/mentor helps the lead to overcome his /her hurdles and triumph ina tear jerking final scene.  You just canthave it better. Templates are only as good as their execution. Bring ondirector Tom Hooper who has honed his skills on the epic TV series John Adamsand the football film The Damned United; assemble a cast of A list Britishtalent: Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter and Geoffrey Rush ( ok, ok! he is an aussie).   This is the story of King George VI and his ascensionto throne after the abdication of his brother and his secret agony of a speechimpediment. This has been getting some insane press and has just been nominatedfor 7 Golden Globes. The omens are very good indeed. I think Colin Firth and Tom Hooper should get their acceptance speeches ready!  Social NetworkA Few Good Men (Special Edition)Amazon Price: $6.30List Price: $14.94SOCIAL NETWORK Everybody has been talking about this sparkling film aboutthe trials and tribulations of the youngest billionaire in the world - facebookfounder, Mark Zukenberg. This semi-fictionalised account has a razor sharpscript by Aaron Sorkin ( West Wing, The American President, Charlie Wilson's War, A Few Good Men)) and brilliant casting in the formof Jesse Eisenberg. Andrew Garfield ( the new Spiderman), Rooney Mara ( the new Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in the Hollywoodversion)  and Justin Timberlake offer sterlingsupport.Director David Fincher has been stacking up some great filmographyand this may be his chance at best director. The film is brilliantly mounted despite the limitations of the script- no big action sequences, no CGI, no dances or bloodshed. Just a good ol' fashioned battle of the wits with wry humour and scintillating performances.  Like? Then post on the wall.  Toy Story 3Toy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)Amazon Price: $17.94List Price: $45.99TOY STORY 3  Could Pixar do anything wrong?  Toy Story 3 represents the epitome of allthat is good with their films. Adult themes in a childrens film,  insanely good animation, fantasic charactersand voice actring, and heart rending emotion for adults ..  this is the cartoon that made everyone cry (they did it with the first five minutes of UP as well or it may just me being asoftie. My children are getting embarrassed!) Do I need to say that Woody ( Tom Hanks)  and Buzz ( Tim Allen)  are back doing what they do best. And this time, it is the Great Escape! with Barbie. And Ken ( Michael Keaton)It will be a travesty if Toy story 3 doesn't get nominated forbest picture not just best animation, as it can stand on its own among theother behemoths. You have to have seen it. Or else, watch it now.  The FighterTHE FIGHTER Boxing movies always do well at Oscars. Think Rocky, RagingBull, Ali, The Cinderella Man etc. This film is directed by talented iftempestuous helmer David O. Russell and features sterling talent. Mark Wahlberg( The Departed) plays Irish boxer Micky Ward and  TheDark Knight himself, Christian Bale, plays his brother who trains him throughthick and thin. Amy Adams ( Enchanted) his love. There will be adversity, There will be family honour, there will be gut wrenching fightscenes, there will be conflict and redemption and the love of a good woman. them Irish, they know how to love, drink and to fight.A few nominations are on the books, but a win may be asurprise.

That mean and moody film featured outstanding turns by Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin.  The Brothers are back in the old west, with its dusty ranches, loose morals, whisky soaked villains and saddle sore. Featuring the a grizzly turn by last years best actor winner Jeff Bridgesas Rooster Cockburn and  Matt Damon as a US marshall both helping a young girl track down her fathersmurderer.A remake of the 1969 film, with Bridges channelling thespirit of John Wayne, this also has Matt Damon & Josh Brolin along for theride.  One to watch out for, Pilgrim.  Black SwanBLACK SWANBallet Dancing has always lent itself to the magic of moviesvery well. There is something about the grace and elegance, the soft lighting , and the music that always is captured beautifully on film. There is  thetalented cast of Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis  as rival dancers vying for the role of prima ballerina and throw in the demented talent that is the Directorialbrain of Darren Aronofsky ( The Wrestler) and you have the usual suspects for superb psychological thriller. Alreadygenerating a great buzz among critics and filmgoers from Cannes to California, this is one to watch for.  Never Let Me GoNEVER LET ME GOBased on a brilliant story by Kazuo Ishigaro ( who also wrote Remains of the Day  ) this filmstars two of the hottest British Actresses of the recent years. Keira Knighley (Pirates of the Caribbean) and CareyMulligan ( Wall Street- Money neversleeps, An Education) along with Andrew Garfield ( the Social Network - he seemstobe cropping up everywhere. Must have a great agent as he is the next Spiderman in the reboot) Three youngfriends, Ruth,Kathy and Tommy, spend memorable times at an idyllic English boarding school.As they grow into adulthood, they have to contend with the love they feel foreach other and the harsh realities of life and the future. This film isdirected by Mark Romanek ( One hour photo)  127 HoursSlumdog Millionaire [Blu-ray]Amazon Price: $8.66List Price: $29.99127 HOURS  127 Hours is the true story of mountainclimber Aron Ralston's stunning adventure. On a solitary climbing expedition to a canyon in Utah,Ralston is trapped by a fallen boulder that reaps his arm. Stuck to the canyon, his energy and life running out, he faces some incredible choices and overcomes desperate adversity. The hours spent trapped make him re-examine his life and relationships. Starring James Franco and Directed by Danny Boyle ( 28 days,Slumdog millionaire ) this has the potential to be an agonising tale ofsurvival, bravery and determination. Early word is that this is an unrelenting study of endurance that Oscar voters love. Can Danny Boyle score a double after his Slum dog Millionaire success?  The Kids are all rightThe KIDS ARE ALL RIGHTArtificial insemination has been a boon to millions who couldn't conceive. It has also raised the ethical debate of  surrogacy and the confused morality of sperm donation and fatherhood. Trust a women to write a direct this brilliant tale of morality and mischief where two young children who are products of artificail insemiantion attempt to bring their hapless father into the mix of a happy family.Expect cutting dialogue, great comedy and soul searching questions. Starring the dual talents of Annette Bening and Julianne Moore, ably supported by Mark Ruffalo and Mia Wasikowska ( Alice), this film is written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko.

This little indie has got bigstudio collars twitching and has garnered rave reviews. One to sneak in throughthe side doors!  Featuring great cinematography, superb acting and a tight script, this film was probably made with the kinda money big budgetfilmsspend on one scene. Deserves accolades.  Another YearANOTHER YEARA beautiful portrait of life, love and friendship and loss this was an official selection for the Cannes film festival this year and narrowly missed out on the Golden Palm. Mike Leigh ( Secret's & Lies, Abigail's Party), with his unassuming British reserve, extracts truly sterling performance from his cast. Features the peerless Jim Broadbent ( Borrowers, Harry Potter) and Lesley Manville.Makes you laugh and cry at the same time, this film has a very strong emotional core ass with all Leigh's films. Small and unassuming in production, yet dramatic and elegant in its execution, this one's a keeper.Secrets & Lies [VHS]Amazon Price: $2.57List Price: $9.98 The TownTHE TOWNBen Affleck had  previous Oscar Glory with his Boston set Good Will hunting. Will history repeat itself? The Town is a gripping, heart rending thrill ride of Charlestown bank robbers. The screenplay is razor sharp with some of the most exciting robbery sequences this side of Michael Mann's Heat. The cast which includes Jeremy Renner ( Hurt Locker), John Hamm ( Mad Men) and Rebecca Hall ( Vicky Cristina Barcelona) and Blake Lively is exquisite. But kudos to late lamented Pete Postlethwaite for stealing the scenes as the florist/crime boss, oozing menace and evil without ever lifting his voice. A master class in film making. Affleck has been a revelation as director especially after the critical and commercial success of Gone baby Gone. Here he proves he is no one trick pony. Highly watchable.That's All Folks! Thank you for your patience and kindness. Hope you enjoyed the show and my predictions. I think you can expect to see a few awards collectively from these brilliant screen efforts. There will always be surprises. Support your local cinema and watch these gems on the big screen whenever possible. There are a lot of people doing a lot of hard work to get these 120 odd minutes of magic. They need our support. See you all at the Oscars! Thanksfor dropping by and do live some comments below.

Shame i haven't seen any of them. Don't get to cinemas theses days. I have to wait for DVD or Sky.I can't believe they remade True Grit, a John Wayne classic. But with the Coen Brothers, it should be good. I loved No Country for Old Men. Javier Barden was great - psychotic but great. LOLDocmo2 weeks ago Thanks! most of them haven't been released in UK yet and only on limited release in Us - kind of December Oscar rush to qualify. So there is plenty of time to catch up. I loved No country.. too and Javier Bardem was phenomenal in his role. I also liked him in the Woody Allen film with Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Penelope Cruz- Vivky Christina Barcelona.Germaine Reilly12 days ago interesting assortment across the genre board. I love Nolan and Boyle, two clear favourites for me. Caught Prestige recently, it kept me guessing and there were genuine aha moments. Thanks for compiling some must sees!Docmo12 days ago Thanks for your comments Germaine. I'm also a big fan of Nolan and Boyle - Prestige is a very underrated brilliance. I have read the original book by Christopher Priest - Nolan's film did a great job of capturing the plot with a pared down and dazzling script. I've been a fan of Boyle since Trainspotting. They both have always favoured excellent scripts - a good lesson for many vacuous directors!joleenruffin11 days ago Great hub. I love keeping track of the Oscar buzz. I have only seen two movies on your list -- Toy Story 3 (what self-respecting mother of small children hasn't. We own the movie and tons of Buzz Lightyear stuff). My husband and I went to see The Fighter on Sunday. I thought it was fantastic. Christian Bale was amazing and I hope he will be in the running for an Oscar for his role.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites94DocmoFrom UK94 Followers50 HubsJoined 6 weeks agoRead more hubs by DocmoFollow DocmoSubscribe to Docmo's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk Docmo a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsDid James Cameron deserve the awards for Best Director and Best Picture for Avatar?asked by hfc7036 11 months ago3 answersAnswer this questionMovie about magic desserts or something?asked by Skraemer14 9 months ago0 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsOscar's Original Song Hopefuls: Who Sounds the Best?by mandawg9Gojira: Japan's First Giant Monster Filmby jellydonut25A Brief Comparison of "The Super Mario Christmas Special"...by S.
