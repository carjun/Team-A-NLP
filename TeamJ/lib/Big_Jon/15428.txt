He began acting professionally in the early 2000s, and became known to young audiences after his roles in the Disney Channel Original Movie High School Musical, the WB series Summerland, and the 2007 film version of the Broadway musical Hairspray.[1][2] In 2007, before the release of High School Musical 2, Rolling Stone declared him the "poster boy for tweenyboppers" and featured him in their late August 2007 issue.[3] Efron has since starred in the films 17 Again, Me and Orson Welles, and Charlie St. Cloud.Contents1 Early life and background1.1 Education2 Career2.1 Early work2.2 Breakthrough2.3 2007 - present3 Personal life4 Filmography5 Other awards6 Discography6.1 Soundtracks6.2 Charted songs7 References8 External linksEarly life and backgroundEfron was born in San Luis Obispo, California, and later moved to Arroyo Grande, California. His father, David Efron, is an engineer at a power plant, and his mother, Starla Baskett, is a former secretary who worked at the same power plant.[4][5] Efron has a younger brother, Dylan, and had a self-described "normal childhood" in a middle class family.[1] He is of Jewish ancestry and is an agnostic, having never been religious.[3][5][6][7] His surname, "Efron", means "lark" in Hebrew.[8]Efron has said that he would "flip out" if he got a "B" and not an "A" in school, and has also described himself as having been a class clown.[9] Efron's father encouraged him to begin acting when Efron was 11 years old.[4] He subsequently appeared in theater productions at his high school,[10] worked in a theater called The Great American Melodrama and Vaudeville,[1] and began taking singing lessons.[4] Efron performed in plays such as Gypsy; Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up; Little Shop of Horrors; and The Music Man. He was recommended to an agent in Los Angeles by his drama teacher, Robyn Metchik (the mother of actors Aaron Michael Metchik and Asher Metchik).[11][12] Efron was later signed to the Creative Artists Agency.[13]EducationEfron graduated from Arroyo Grande High School in 2006,[14] and was then accepted into the University of Southern California, but has deferred his enrollment to work on film projects. Efron also attended Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts, a community college located in Santa Maria, California, which provided him with the opportunity to perform as a "young player" during the years of 2000 and 2001.[15]CareerEarly workIn 2002, Efron began to appear in guest roles on several television series, including Firefly, ER, and The Guardian. He portrayed Cameron Bale on the now-cancelled WB series Summerland. Originally introduced as a recurring character, Efron became a regular cast member on the show in the second season in 2004, starring opposite the likes of Kay Panabaker, Lori Loughlin and Jesse McCartney. Since appearing in Summerland, he has also had guest roles on the shows CSI: Miami, NCIS, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and The Replacements. In 2003, Efron starred in the Lifetime original television movie Miracle Run. He played Steven Morgan, one of two autistic twins. For his performance, he was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Movie, Mini-series or Special Supporting Young Actor.[16] In 2005, he played a main character in Hope Partlow's music video for her song "Sick Inside." Also in 2005, he played horse-loving Patrick McCardle in The Derby Stallion, where his character wants to beat the town bully at the steeple chase race.BreakthroughEfron at the TIFF premiere of Me and Orson Welles, September 2008In 2006, Efron starred in the Disney Channel original movie High School Musical as Troy Bolton, the popular student and captain of the basketball team. The film, which he initially made with "low expectations",[1] helped Efron gain recognition among teenage audiences as both an actor and a singer, even though his singing voice was overdubbed. As a result, he placed as high as #4 on the IMDBPro's STARMeter for the week of January 29, 2006.[17] In August 2006, Efron won a Teen Choice Award in the Breakout Star and the TV Choice Chemistry categories, shared with Vanessa Hudgens. The film's cast, along with Efron, toured Sydney, Australia, London, England, and other locations to promote the film.Shortly after High School Musical aired, Efron debuted with two simultaneous charted songs on Billboard Hot 100 on February 4, 2006, with "Get'cha Head in the Game" and "Breaking Free", a duet with Vanessa Hudgens from the film. On the following week's chart, Efron had five simultaneous song credits from High School Musical: "Get'cha Head in the Game", "Start of Something New", "What I've Been Looking For: Reprise", "We're All in This Together" and "Breaking Free." "We're All in This Together" was credited to the whole High School Musical cast. "Breaking Free", at the time, made the fastest climb in the history of the Billboard charts, from #86 to #4 between the two weeks; the record was beaten by Beyonc and Shakira's "Beautiful Liar".[18] Efron also appeared in the 2006 Disney Channel Games as captain of the Red Team.Efron's singing talents were disputed when it was revealed that Drew Seeley's voice was blended with his on the soundtrack of High School Musical.[19] An August 23, 2007 interview in Rolling Stone magazine revealed that he had been cast in High School Musical after the songs were written, and the songs (written for a tenor) were somewhat out of his baritone vocal range.2007 - presentOn April 7, 2007, Efron appeared in an episode of Punk'd. Efron also starred in the music video for Vanessa Hudgens's single "Say OK", where he played her love interest. The video aired on March 16, 2007 on Disney Channel. That year, he was named one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People in 2007. A picture and short profile of him was in the section "Coming of Age". In it, he related how he was always the shortest kid in school (he is now[when?] 5'8")[5] and was teased for the "huge gap" in his teeth.[20]In 2006, Efron was cast as Link Larkin in a film version of Hairspray released on July 20, 2007. Efron performed all of his own vocals in the role,[21] which was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, from September 5 to December 2, 2006. He cut and dyed his hair dark brown and gained about 15 pounds for the role.[22] Efron's performance and the film received positive reviews.[11] Efron was not able to perform with his fellow castmates in High School Musical: The Concert because of commitments on the film Hairspray. Drew Seeley took over for him.Efron with Vanessa Hudgens at the 81st Academy Awards.High School Musical 2 was released in August 2007. Additionally, Lycos reported searches for Efron surged by 81%.[23] The film set a new record, becoming the most watched basic cable program in U.S. history, with 17.2 million viewers.[24] Efron also appeared on the cover of the August 2007 edition of Rolling Stone.[3] The article about him revealed that he hoped to someday play an action hero. Efron presented the 2007 Teen Choice Award for "Favorite Movie" along with Queen Latifah, and later that year, he co-hosted the Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards with The Veronicas on October 10 in Sydney.[25]Efron reprised his role in High School Musical 3: Senior Year, which was theatrically released on October 24, 2008. His next role was in 17 Again, a high school-set comedy-drama produced by Adam Shankman and based on a pitch by Jason Filardi;[26] the plot involved an adult who is transformed into a 17-year old (played by Efron).[27] 17 Again was released in 2009.[17]In early 2008, Efron was cast in the lead role in the film Me and Orson Welles. Based on Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name, the story, set in 1937 New York, tells of a teenager hired to star in Orson Welles' production of Julius Caesar, where he becomes attracted to a career-driven production assistant. The film was shot in the Isle of Man, London and New York, during February April 2008. It was introduced to North America via the Toronto Film Festival on September 5, 6, and 11, 2008[28] and was released in 2009. Efron was also scheduled to star in Paramount's musical remake of the film Footloose,[29] and has said that he would like to add his "own little bit of flair" to the role originated by Kevin Bacon.[5] In March 2009 he dropped out of the film.[30] Efron was quoted as saying that while it was a promising gig, he left the project because he "was looking for a new challenge, and this was another musical."[31]On April 8, 2009, Efron's participation in a comedic short video entitled "Zac Efron's Pool Party" for the website Funny Or Die was released for public viewing.[32] On April 11, 2009, Efron hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live.[33] In early June 2009 it was confirmed that Efron would be making a guest appearance during the sixth season of HBO's comedy series Entourage.[34]Efron starred in a series of advertisements along with Kristen Bell and Sean Combs promoting the 2010 MTV Movie Awards and the host, Aziz Ansari. In 2009, Efron signed on to play title character in the movie Charlie St. Cloud.[35] The film was released on July 30, 2010.In 2009, Efron was revealed to be connected to the live action rendition of the Japanese anime Full Metal Panic, simply entitled Panic.[36] He is also slated to star in the title role of the live-action adaptation of the Jonny Quest cartoons.[37] Additional projects include Einstein Theory[38] and an adaptation of Fire, by Image Comics.Personal lifeEfron in June 2010Efron owns an apartment in Los Angeles, California. On January 15, 2008, Efron was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for an emergency appendectomy.[39] Efron was also on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list in 2008, as number 92 with an estimated earning of $5.8 million from June 2007 to June 2008. As of April 5, 2009, his personal wealth equaled about $10 million.[40] People magazine said in 2007 that Efron and Vanessa Hudgens began dating in 2005 during the filming of High School Musical,[41][42][43] although Us magazine said, after the two broke up in December 2010, that the two "met in 2005 while making the first High School Musical flick, and became a romantic item about two years later."[44]FilmographyFilmsYearFilmRoleNotes2003Melinda's WorldStuart Wasser2003Big Wide World of Carl Laemke, TheThe Big Wide World of Carl LaemkePete Laemke2004Miracle RunSteven MorganNominatedYoung Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Movie, Miniseries or Special by a Supporting Actor2004Triple PlayHarry Fuller2005Derby Stallion, TheThe Derby StallionPatrick McCardle2006If You Lived Here, You'd be Home NowCody2006High School MusicalTroy BoltonDisney Channel Original MovieTeen Choice Award for Choice Chemistry (shared with Vanessa Hudgens)NominatedYoung Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Movie, Miniseries or Special by a Lead Actor2007HairsprayLink LarkinHollywood Film Award for Ensemble of the Year (shared with Hairspray cast)MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance - MaleYoung Hollywood Award for One to WatchNominatedBroadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best SongNominatedScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture2007High School Musical 2Troy BoltonDisney Channel Original Movie2008High School Musical 3: Senior YearTroy BoltonMTV Movie Award for Best Performance - MaleTeen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor - Music/DanceNominatedMTV Movie Award for Best Kiss (shared with Vanessa Hudgens)200917 AgainMike O'Donnell (teen)Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor - ComedyTeen Choice Award for Choice Rockstar MomentNominatedMTV Movie Award for Best Performance - Male2009Me and Orson WellesRichard Samuels2010Charlie St. CloudCharlie St. CloudTelevisionYearTitleRoleNotes2002FireflyYoung Simon TamEpisode "Safe"2003Guardian, TheThe GuardianLuke TomelloEpisode "Without Consent"2003ERBobby NevilleEpisode "Dear Abby"2005SummerlandCameron Bale16 episodes2005CSI: MiamiSeth DawsonEpisode "Sex & Taxes"2005Replacements, TheThe ReplacementsDavey HunkerhoffEpisode "Davey Hunkerhoff / Ratted Out"2006HeistPizza Delivery GuyEpisode "Pilot"2006Suite Life of Zack & Cody, TheThe Suite Life of Zack & CodyTrevorEpisode "Odd Couples"2006NCISDannyEpisode "Deception"2008Robot ChickenBilly JoelEpisode "Tell My Mom"2009Robot ChickenHarry PotterEpisode "I Love Her"2009Saturday Night LiveHimself2 episodes2009Entourage[45]HimselfEpisode "Security Briefs"Other awards2006 - Teen Choice Award: Choice Breakout Star2007 - Teen Choice Award: Best Male Actor2007 - Teen Choice Award: Choice Male Hottie2011 - Favorite Movie Star Under 25DiscographySoundtracksHairspray (2007)High School Musical 2 (2007)High School Musical 3: Senior Year (2008)Charted songsYearSinglePeak chart positionsAlbumUSUS PopUKAUS2007"Ladies Choice"96[46]Hairspray"What Time Is It?"662020High School Musical 2"Bet on It"463565"You Are the Music in Me" (with Vanessa Hudgens and Olesya Rulin)31282686"You Are the Music in Me (Sharpay Version)" (with Ashley Tisdale)9589"Gotta Go My Own Way" (with Vanessa Hudgens)343140"Everyday" (with Vanessa Hudgens)6546552008"Now or Never" (with High School Musical 3 cast)68414192High School Musical 3: Senior Year"A Night to Remember" (with High School Musical 3 cast)10896"Right Here, Right Now" (with Vanessa Hudgens)119"Can I Have This Dance" (with Vanessa Hudgens)9884"The Boys Are Back" (with Corbin Bleu)10172"" denotes releases that did not chartReferences^ a b c d Ouzounian, Richard (2007-08-04).
