foreign correspondentMarch 12, 2000E-mailPrintText Sizechi-060826salopek4-storyMGAHINGA GORILLA NATIONAL PARK, Uganda                      Like any other park warden in Africa, Klaus-Jurgen Sucker had enemies, although maybe more than most. When it came to defending his park's endangered mountain gorillas, Sucker knocked heads hard.A strapping, 37-year-old German biologist, Sucker infuriated the local Bakiga and Bafumbira hunters whose snares he ripped up, some 7,000 wire traps in all. He earned the wrath of illegal loggers by erecting steel barriers along the park's boundaries. Five years of angry clashes with encroaching farmers had turned his mop of blond hair prematurely white-- much like the hulking, silver-backed gorillas he so admired.Sucker's most formidable foes, however, came from far beyond Mgahinga's bamboo forests and watercolor-blue volcanoes.In a backlash as old as African conservation itself, powerful interest groups objected to the warden's gung-ho methods.Critics said that Sucker put the needs of animals above those of thousands of impoverished Africans living around his park. When Sucker refused to bend, they quietly lobbied the Ugandan National Parks Service for his transfer.Chicago Shopping Overwhelming Offers: Always 50% off or more from your favorite brands >>                                    "Klaus was a strong man, but when they ordered him to go it affected his heart," said Sunday Nyakunze, an AK-47-toting park ranger trained by Sucker. "That's the only way we can explain the bad thing he did at the end."Apparently distraught over abandoning his beloved gorillas, Sucker hanged himself in his nearby village home without leaving a note.Sucker's obscure 1994 death might seem like just another case of environmental martyrdom in Africa; inevitably, his tragedy has been compared to the murder of Dian Fossey of "Gorillas in the Mist" fame.But Sucker's story is different, because his most powerful opponents weren't the usual rogue's gallery of xenophobic politicians or greedy wildlife dealers, but competing environmentalists who have launched what is, in effect, a sweeping, last-ditch battle for the soul of wild Africa.Organizations such as the International Gorilla Conservation Program, the World Bank and CARE have chosen the misty jungles and crowded villages of southwestern Uganda as a vast and controversial testing ground for the theory of "community conservation." The idea is simple: To save what's left of Africa's fading wildlife, experts say, the animals must in essence be given back to the Africans, so the Africans will feel more of a kinship with them and feel the need to protect them.Lucrative gorilla tourism profits, for example, are being shunted toward building local schools. Villagers who were once evicted from the gorilla parks are being invited back in to harvest forest products, a heresy unthinkable in Sucker's day. And dozens of technical consultants, wheeling their shiny four-wheel-drive vehicles through the farmlands that ring gorilla habitat, are pushing million-dollar projects in crop improvement, family planning, agroforestry and micro-enterprise--all to minimize human conflict with some 300 reclusive apes.Remote, hauntingly beautiful and dirt poor, Uganda's version of Appalachia has thus become the world's boldest experiment in social engineering for the sake of the environment. It is a corner of Africa where pygmies are now required to carry "utilization permits" to use their own forests. Where the gorillas' long-term fortunes depend on the vagaries of the London stock exchange. And where a gentler, kinder vision of conservation, advocates say, might rescue a continent's wildlife from an otherwise bleak future."Sucker would never compromise for his gorillas," said Jaap Schoorl, a Dutch environmental consultant who worked in Uganda when the German was still booting villagers out of Mgahinga. "But we have to face the reality that Africa's wild places are shrinking islands surrounded by a growing sea of people. Unless we do something drastic, we're lost."Few experts dispute the fact that Africa's pageant of wildlife is in drastic shape. After more than a century of Western-style management, the iconic animals that have come to symbolize wild nature to millions of people around the world are more threatened than ever. Fabled wildlife parks have become dog-eared meccas of industrial tourism. And biologists warn that the Earth's richest assemblage of large mammals--a unique remnant of the fauna that roamed the continents during the Pleistocene Epoch--is slipping inexorably toward oblivion.Consider these trends:- With Africa's human population expected to rocket from 650 million to 1.1 billion over the next 25 years, hundreds if not thousands of animal and plant species will be crowded out of existence. The biggest fight ahead, conservationists say, won't be on Africa's famed savannas, but in besieged forests like those at Mgahinga and its sister gorilla park, the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Today, efforts are under way to safeguard small patches of the species-rich Congo Basin, a vast rain forest a third the size of the continental United States that is under assault by European logging firms.- The environmental coups scored against the international wildlife trade in the 1990s-- particularly the ivory ban that helped save Africa's elephants--are being undone by new, homegrown threats. Urban migration of rural people has created a faddish appetite for wild animal meat among Africa's millions of city dwellers. This bush-meat trade has funneled tons of dead antelopes, elephants, bush pigs, monkeys and snakes-- trussed in bloody burlap sacks-- into the booming city markets of central and West Africa every year.- Africa's latest cycle of wars, meanwhile, is gutting the continent's premier wildlife habitats. The Congo's Virunga National Park, a UN-designated World Heritage Site where Africa's oldest rain forests grow, has turned into a killing zone for animals. Armed factions in Congo's civil war have gunned down 10,000 hippos, 6,000 buffaloes and more than 3,000 elephants since 1994, biologists say. Desperate refugees have razed more than 20 square miles of the forest for firewood.Yet the most disturbing trend of all, experts warn, is that Africa's wildlife is becoming increasingly irrelevant to Africans themselves. Swelling armies of rural peasants see wild animals as little more than crop pests--or dinner. And among the continent's exploding urban populations, the plight of such animals as black rhinos, whose numbers have crashed disastrously from 100,000 to just 3,000 in 25 years, is an eccentric concern at best."The average American or European has seen more African species in zoos than your typical modern African has seen in the wild," said Elias Maluleke, a South African journalist who has written on the subject. "Wildlife parks are seen as white peoples' enclaves. How many blacks do you see wandering around Kruger National Park (in South Africa)? How many big game hunters are black? Africans get nothing out of their own wildlife."123next|  single pageGet the Chicago Tribune delivered to your home for only $1 a week >Copyright  2011, Chicago Tribune E-mail PrintReprint Digg Twitter Facebook Home deliveryComments (0)Add comments | Discussion FAQCurrently there are no comments.
