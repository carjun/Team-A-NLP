Gabrielle Giffords' congressional race - as Sarah Palin did - was an explicit or intentional invitation to violence.  Nor am I saying that the "Get on Target for Victory" events held by the guy Giffords beat - "Help remove Gabrielle Giffords from office Shoot a fully automatic M16 with Jesse Kelly" - was the reason her assassin went after her.  This tragedy is still unfolding, and the questions of motive and incitement will be argued about for a long time to come.But I am saying that the "lock and load"/"take up your arms" rhetoric of American politics isn't just an overheated metaphor.  For years, the language of sports has dominated political journalism, and discourse about hardball and the horserace and the rest of the macho athletic lexicon has been a factor in the trivialization of our public sphere.  This has helped dumb down democracy, making a serious national discussion about anything important too wonky for words. The "second amendment solution," though, does something worse than make politics a branch of entertainment.  It makes it a blood sport.  I know politics ain't beanbag.  But words have consequences, rhetoric shapes reality, and much as we like to believe that we are creatures of reason, there is something about our species' limbic system and lizard brainstems that makes us susceptible to irrational fantasies.  If you're worried that violent video games may make kids prone to bad behavior; if you think that misogynic and homophobic rap lyrics are dangerous to society; if you believe that a nipple in a Superbowl halftime show is a threat to our moral fabric - then surely you should also fear that the way public and media figures have framed political participation with shooting gallery imagery is just as potentially lethal.

I don't fear video games much, and I certainly don't fear a nipple at the super bowl. But I do think that the metaphors used in politics dumb down the discourse and that in and of itself is a good reason not to do it. The whole sound bite rhythm, everything that distracts from facing real problems and finding real solutions, comparing notes and trading ideas, mutating them rather than 'staying on message' - all the over simplifications keep us from meeting our needs, and take away our dignity.

You complained when the republicans blamed obama for everything wrong in america and yet you do the same thing the moment presents itself.  Stop blaming other people for the kids actions.  Part of being a man is taking responsibility for your actions.  Meaning the blame falls on the man or men who pulled the trigger.  Just because someone yells a hateful message doesn't mean you have to listen.  It is a choice that kid and anyone who helped him made. There are plenty of reasons to dislike Sarah Palin.  This isn't one of them.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ6b6C2SKEg single_malt: It is really sad that people are using the arizonahttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/single_malt/gabrielle-giffords-shooting_b_806232_73330839.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itgodipo                                                    2 hours ago (9:04 PM)                        31 Fans                If you read what is being written about including in this article, it is simply the fact that this tragedy draws our national attention to the style of politics; it's neither likable nor constructive. Exploiting polarization even if you don't become so vulgar as to bring guns into it is bad for the country. That's the point. You are an example of someone who throws criticisms back at the person who offered them instead of looking at the issue being addressed. No one is interested in finding reasons to dislike or blame Palin. As you point out, those are out there. But to not see an opportunity to address the tone of rhetoric in our country on this occasion would be wrong. Even if the shooter was a space alien sent on a mission from Mars...we need to look at ourselves! And Palin's style is among the most incendiary, the most exclusionary, the most reductive, the least likely to help us work together to solve problems.            godipo: If you read what is being written about including inhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/godipo/gabrielle-giffords-shooting_b_806232_73332123.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itTheKurgan9                                                    3 hours ago (8:00 PM)                        57 Fans                If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun, Obama said in Philadelphia last night. Because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl. Ive seen Eagles fans.So did Obama actually say he was going to bring a gun? Yes...did he mean it? No! So you let Obama off the hook for saying we will pack heat...but you guys are all over Sarah Palin and linking this sh00ting to her....those cross hairs were from 10 months ago...give me a break. Any sane person knows that Palin wasn't talking about sh00ting the politicians she wanted out of office. Same with Obama...no sane conservative, myself included is going to accuse Obama of trying start a gun fight. Can we get rational here. The guy who did this horrific act was CRAZY.Anthony Weiner said "Every single moment that we are stroking our beards and gazing at our navel and thinking about the world wed like to be and singing Kumbaya is another day were not punching Bill OReilly in the nose. So is Weiner actually endorsing an assault on Bill O'Reilly? I personally think no and that it was more of a metaphor....but by every libs standard here on violent rhetoric, both Obama and Weiner MUST be reprimanded correct?Joe Madison says they should jump Republicans in the street - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEPYiieK_ps&feature=relatedSo where's the rage            TheKurgan9: If they bring a knife to the fight, we bringhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/TheKurgan9/gabrielle-giffords-shooting_b_806232_73325127.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itVerizonCells                                                    2 hours ago (9:08 PM)                        58 FansFollow                not even close            VerizonCells: not even closehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/VerizonCells/gabrielle-giffords-shooting_b_806232_73332581.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itHUFFPOST SUPER USERpkafin                                                    1 hour ago (9:36 PM)                        109 Fans                You've missed the point by a mile.            pkafin: You've missed the point by a mile.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/pkafin/gabrielle-giffords-shooting_b_806232_73335656.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itHUFFPOST SUPER USERSkyWolf                                                    4 hours ago (6:51 PM)                        15 Fans                Lets get this straight. The killer is responsible for his actions. Period.That said, we collectively are responsible for allowing the cauldron of rhetorical hate and violence to slowly come to a rolling boil. When the rhetoric evoking violence is ratcheted up a notch at a time, and all parties on all sides of the debate shrug and accept the new normal  we are collectively responsible for the inevitable results.The lexicon of hate and violence would vanish if it didnt work. And it will continue to work as long as the faithful on both sides of the issue accept such thoughtless words without protest. If a republican suggests violence against the other side and the only voice of protest comes from democrats  nothing will change. The call for reason and responsibility must come from fellow republicans. The same is also true of misguided democrats.Those of us who engage in political debate need to act as watchdogs for our own spokespeople and ourselves.            SkyWolf: Lets get this straight.

The problem isn't so much the guns as the lunatics with guns funding the gun lobby who think that logical legislation about background checks, gun locks, mandatory safety training, registrations, limits on high-powered weaponry never intended for hunting, etc. is the worst evil that our government can act upon.Never mind that all that legislation is only intended to protect innocent people, not limit the rights of citizens to own a gun. The problem is that the rhetoric is phrased as "You'll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hand before I give it up" and not, "well, ok -- they make me pass a test to drive a car, I suppose I should be willing to do the same to own and operate an equally capable life-taking device."            barnacle: "If you make guns illegal, then only the criminals willhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/barnacle/gabrielle-giffords-shooting_b_806232_73333434.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itLiza Bakewell                                                    5 hours ago (6:20 PM)                        0 Fans                Fighting words are not just words. Hate language is not just language. Violent language is itself a form of violence. Thankfully the opposite of this is true, as well. Thankfully my children know this. Thankfully many, many good people know this. Unfortunately, they have to be living in a country with public officials and public personalities who go for the violence. These public people who go for the "lock and load," you mention, use it precisely to excite their followers. They know their language incites others into action. They use these words knowingly. They are not ignorant of their power. They know words are more than "only words," "only metaphors." They are pros of the gun-slinging rhetoric and its ballistic powers.

Or if there was one perhaps he or she was a Conservative who could have cared less if a bunch of Democrats got shot to pieces. let me ask you, had you been there and had a concealed weapon, as a Conservative would you have done anything knowing full well that those being shot were Democrats? That is a good question. You should think on that. The fact remains that in a state that allows concealed weapons, all of those there were liberals or at the very least Democrats. Why didn't they have concealed weapons? Probably because Liberals are less likely to have them than Conservatives, and they surely don't believe in carrying them to Political meetings. On the other hand Conservative do and have. This tell me a lot about the different natures of Conservatives versus Liberals, and that is that more than likely 9 out of ten Gun toters who kill people will be a person with a conservative ideology. They tend not to shoot their own kind, rather they tend to shoot at those who are helpless, just as they usually have very little feeling for anyone who is helpless. That's why when you run the gamut of most of the Governments policies of Social Programs, it is always the Conservative who will choose to destroy it,. Because they just don't give a damn about anybody but themselves. One thing follows another just like ants proceeding to and from a picnic.

That is a fact.But then again shooting 20 people including at least one child is hardly sane. The dirty secret in the United States is that by our practices and policies we really do not care about the mentally ill. It is much more cost effective to actually treat them than it is to do what we do most often here in the land of the "free," that is incarcerate them. We have replaced the living hells of yesterdays asylums with the living hells of todays prisons (often privately operated for profit). The tragedy is that their only real "crime" was having a sickness that we can most often successfully treat, if we just spend the relative pittance that treatment costs.
