He prepared a series of Internet videos in which he posted odd statements about the gold standard, the community college he attended and SWAT teams. Jared Lee Loughner, in these few public hints, offered a sense of his alienation from society, confusion, anger as well as foreboding that his life could soon come to an end. Friends talked of how he had become reclusive in recent years, and his public postings raised questions, in retrospect at least, about his mental state. -----There was evidence of recent trouble, though. Mr. Loughner, 22, was suspended in late September from Pima Community College, where he had been attending classes, because the school became aware of a disturbing YouTube video. Mr. Loughner voluntarily withdrew from the College on Oct. 4. -----Another former high school classmate said that Mr. Loughners politics were left of center, and that he may have met Representative Giffords, who was shot in the head outside the Safeway supermarket, sometime before the attack. As I knew him he was left wing, quite liberal. & oddly obsessed with the 2012 prophecy, the former classmate, Caitie Parker, wrote in a series of Twitter feeds Saturday. I havent seen him since 07 though. He became very reclusive.

Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 04:52 AM by No ElephantsRight-leaning libertarians oppose legalizing pot, reprodutive choice, etc., just as do all other RWers, including RW Dems (aka Blue Dogs, DINOs, etc.)  "Liberal" is about ideas and principles, not formal political party lines. I am sure many Republicans favor legalizing pot, especially if they or a loved one have a medical need for it, much as many Republicans voted, under Dummya, for expanding stem cell research.  And, you can have a liberal position on one or more issues while being RW in many other respects."Name one person in this current Administration who openly favors legalization/decriminalization."With all due respect, this Administration is no litmus test of liberal positions.  This Administration is oveall, at most, moderate.  Its members curse and scold liberals publicly, inc. Obama ("to my friends on the left, I say....."). And they are pols, always courting right-leaning indies for the next election.  MAYBE some liberals may disagree about growing and selling pot, esp. to minors, for recreational purposes.  However, I do not know a single liberal (who is not looking for elective office) who opposes legalization of possessing pot for personal use or growing, selling and using it for medicinal purposes.  If I ran across one, I would consider him or her a liberal who did not hold a liberal position on pot.(Like Bubba, I smoked pot one night in my life, though I did inhale.  i just never got high, though my fae and head hurt like anything the next day.  So, this is not about my own use. ) Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopSemperEadem      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 08:08 AMResponse to Reply #3158.I'll bet you that's what this classmate meant to say but is too dull to know the difference.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNo Elephants      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 04:11 AMResponse to Reply #1644.But this clown said "left wing," not "liberal."

If she is a teabagger far rightwinger type then the killer could be very right wing but to her he would seem 'very liberal'. I think the bigger point here is that maybe this guy had mental problems but with pundits and politicians using violent rhetoric and intimating that violence is a valid solution to your problems they can be pushing guys like this over the edge. I believe in free speech but with free speech comes at least some responsibility for what your 'free speech' may engender in others. I am not saying people shouldn't speak their minds, I know I do,  but they should do it in a constructive not destructive way.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopIgel      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 04:17 PMResponse to Reply #6077.The first thing I would ask is, "What does the person actually mean?"She used a label and meant something by it. There's no official definition of "left wing". There's a list of things, some of which many people assume are present, some of which may be present, but the details are usually left up for grabs. And since it's a free language used by a variety of groups of people, all of which get to assign their own variant meanings to words (because words are all about communicating meanings and emotions between people in a community) even that list is up for grabs. So rather than assume that a string of sounds must bear a very narrow and specific meaning, that we get to define, once and for all times and all peoples what a word or expression means, I have to wonder what she meant by the use of that phrase. People have stopped worrying about the killer and his views and started to worry about whether or not a label they use for themselves was properly used to label somebody else. That makes it not about the killer, not about the victims, not even about understanding what happened, but does make it about who people that call themselves "left wing" or "liberal" will tolerate sharing their preferred label with, and therefore about those calling themselves "left wing" or "liberal". Six killed by Loughner, a dozen more wounded, and the really, really essential thing is all about us--whether we have to share a label with him or whether he gets labelled with the words associated with our political opponents, as though as soon as we "properly" label him "teabagger" or "right wing" it makes sense and we understand his essense simply because all of the millions of "teabaggers" and "rightwingers" go around killing half a dozen people at a time, or could for no other reason than the label used.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmimitabby      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 10:23 PMResponse to Original message3.twilight zone strangePrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBarack_America      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 10:24 PMResponse to Original message4.It has been noted that Ms. Parker is a conservative......and has not, to my knowledge, described any of Mr. Loughner's political views that she considers "liberal".Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopRoland99      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 10:29 PMResponse to Reply #47.Wonder if she'd engrave a backward letter in *her* face....Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmrcheerful      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 10:34 PMResponse to Reply #49.That was what I thought myself and we know how conservatives labelanyone who doesn't share their exact views on any given subject is labeled Liberal.

"On September 29, 2010, college police discovered on YouTube a Loughner-filmed video made at Northwest Campus.  In the video, he claims that the College is illegal according to the U.S. Constitution, and makes other claims."The college said it told Loughner that if he wanted to come back to school, he must "must resolve his Code of Conduct violations and obtain a mental health clearance indicating, in the opinion of a mental health professional, his presence at the College does not present a danger to himself or others."The college said it had no further contact with him after that.http://www.kgun9.com/global/story.asp?s=13809065 Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOhioChick      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:16 AMResponse to Original message27.I don't buy this "he was a liberal 4 years ago" BSEdited on Sun Jan-09-11 12:16 AM by OhioChickEspecially coming from only one or two people.

And maybe his atrocity had no political motivation at all, or at least no motivation that a sane person could honestly label as political.The really interesting question is "Who is the other person of interest?"  Police are looking for a suspected accomplice.  If this is correct, it could be that someone with a "sane" motive used a deluded wacko as a tool.   A right wing nut who wanted to kill her for her left-wing politics.  Or a left-wing nut would wanted to kill her for her right-wing (blue dog) politics.  Or a cartelista who blamed her as a representative of the government that made a big drug bust that caused him grief.  These are all "rational" reasons within a twisted, but not psychotic, world view.  In a world where a vulture can be arrested as Israeli spy because it is tagged with a wildlife-tracking GPS system the Saudis may be twisted and irrational by our standards, but still not psychotic.  The boy who did the shooting does appear to be psychotic (detached from any semblance to reality) from what has been published, but if he had a handler the underlying motivation may be grounded in something else.However, at this point there is no evidence in favor of any conspiracy or sane political motivation on the part of Loughner.  And remember that just over 30 years ago John Lennon was murdered by an insane person.  I remember the shock of that clearly, wondering "Why would anyone do that?"  My question today as well.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJDPriestly      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 11:32 AMResponse to Reply #3073.What left-wing nut wants to kill anyone for their blue dog politics?I have never heard of such a thing.  It just doesn't happen.Why?Because by definition, the so-called "left" embraces the non-violent philosophies of its heroes and philosophical leaders -- Ghandi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and, although not a religious movement and some may not believe it, Jesus, whose violence was pretty much limited to throwing the moneylenders out of the temple.  The philosophies and lives of those men are the inspiration for liberals in the US.  Other than the Founding Fathers of the US, our heroes are all leaders of nonviolent movements.

Some had leanings to ELF and PETA, neither of which were entirely pacifist, and would probably like the Sea Shepherd's activities, not what you'd typically call "nonviolent." Some liked that arch-conservative Republican Malcolm X. Others like the PLO, which is a group that typically gets more liberal than conservative support.And so it goes.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJDPriestly      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 11:36 AMResponse to Reply #3074.The actual shooter is usually psychotic.
