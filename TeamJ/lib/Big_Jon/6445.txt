Anthony Holmes [5]The United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM or AFRICOM) is a Unified Combatant Command of the United States Department of Defense that is responsible for U.S. military operations and military relations with 53 African nations - an area of responsibility covering all of Africa except Egypt. Africa Command was established October 1, 2007 as a temporary sub-unified command under U.S. European Command, which for more than two decades was responsible for U.S. military relations with more than 40 African nations. Africa Command was formally activated October 1, 2008, during a public ceremony at the Pentagon attended by representatives of African nations posted in Washington, D.C.Contents1 Headquarters2 Geopolitical background (2000-2006)3 Creation of AFRICOM (2006-2008)3.1 Authorization3.2 Selecting a headquarters3.3 Components4 Scope of proposed operations4.1 Official goals4.2 Geographic scope5 Chain of Command6 Further reading7 External links8 References[edit] HeadquartersOfficials from Africa Command have repeatedly stressed that they are not seeking headquarters or basing locations in Africa. In June 2007 early plans, predating the establishment of the command, discussed the possibility of a "distributed command" that would be networked across several countries rather than a single combatant command headquarters. However, following wide-ranging international consultations, leaders of the new command said they chose to focus on building programs and partnerships while suspending discussions about possible locations until after the command was well established. In February 2008 a spokesman for AFRICOM stated that its headquarters will be located in Stuttgart for the foreseeable future.[6][edit] Geopolitical background (2000-2006)Prior to the creation of AFRICOM, three Unified Commands had divided responsibility for U.S. military operations in Africa. The United States Navys Naval Postgraduate School noted in January 2007 that U.S. policy towards Africa, at least in the medium-term, looks to be largely defined by international terrorism, the increasing importance of African oil to American energy needs, and the dramatic expansion and improvement of Sino-African relations since the turn of the century.[7]A U.S. military officer wrote the first public article calling for the formation of an African Command published in November 2000.[8] A January 2002 report from the African Oil Policy Initiative Group played a role in getting discussions about such a command started within the U.S. national security community, though their specific recommendation was to create a subcommand for the Gulf of Guinea.[9] The AOPIG report emphasised that the U.S. National Intelligence Council has estimated that the United States will buy 25 percent of its oil from Africa by 2015. In general, areas of increasing interest to the United States in Africa include the Sahara/Sahel region,[10] over which Joint Task Force Aztec Silence is conducting anti-terrorist operations (known as Operation Enduring Freedom - Trans Sahara), the Horn of Africa, where Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa is located in Djibouti (conducting operations which have been called Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa), and the Gulf of Guinea, whose oil resources are expected to gain in importance.The U.S. Congress has approved US$500 million for the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative (TSCTI) over six years to support countries involved in counterterrorism against alleged threats of Al Qaeda operating in African countries, primarily Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Nigeria, and Morocco.[11] This program builds upon the former Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI), which concluded in December 2004[12] and focused on weapon and drug trafficking, as well as counterterrorism.[13] Previous U.S. military activities in sub-Saharan Africa have included Special Forces associated Joint Combined Exchange Training.As a result of the 2004 global posture review, the Pentagon began implementing a number of Cooperative Security Locations (CSLs) and Forward Operating Sites (FOSs) across the African continent, through USEUCOM. These locations, along with Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, would form the basis of AFRICOM facilities on the continent.[edit] Creation of AFRICOM (2006-2008)[edit] AuthorizationIn mid 2006, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld formed a planning team to advise on requirements for establishing a new Unified Command for the African continent. In early December, he made his recommendations to President George W. Bush.[14][15]On February 6, 2007, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced to the Senate Armed Services Committee that President George W. Bush had given authority to create the new African Command and[16]U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Robert Moeller, the director of the AFRICOM transition team, arrived in Stuttgart Germany to begin creating the logistical framework for the command.[17][18] On September 28 the U.S. Senate confirmed General William E. "Kip" Ward as AFRICOM's first commander and AFRICOM officially became operational as a sub-unified command of EUCOM with a separate headquarters.[19] On October 1, 2008, the command separated from USEUCOM and began operating on its own as a full fledged Command.[edit] Selecting a headquartersThe 1,300 person command will be headquartered at Kelley Barracks in Stuttgart, Germany for the foreseeable future and a further administrative presence on the continent will only occur via "full diplomatic consultation and agreement with potential host nations".[1][20]It was reported in June 2007 that African countries were competing to host the headquarters because it would bring money for the recipient country.[21][22] However, of all the African nations, only Liberia has publicly expressed a willingness to host AFRICOM's headquarters. The U.S. declared in February 2008 that Africa Command would be headquartered in Stuttgart for the "foreseeable future". In August 2007, Dr. Wafula Okumu, a research fellow at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa, testified before congress about the growing resistance and hostility on the African continent[23] Nigeria, has announced it will not allow his country to host a base and opposed the creation of a base on the continent. South Africa and Libya have also expressed reservations of the establishment of a headquarters in Africa.[24]The Sudan Tribune considers it likely that Ethiopia, considered to be one of the US' strongest allies in the region, will house USAFRICOM's headquarters due to the collocation of AFRICOM with the African Union's developing peace and security apparatus.[25] Prime Minister Meles Zenawi stated in early November that Ethiopia would be willing to work together closely with USAFRICOM.[26] This was further reinforced when a U.S. Air Force official said on December 5, 2007, that Addis Ababa was likely to be the headquarters.[27]On February 18, 2008 General Ward told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute in London that some portion of that staff headquarters being on the continent at some point in time would be "a positive factor in helping us better deliver programs."[28] General Ward also told the BBC the same day in an interview that there are no definite plans to take the headquarters or a portion of it to any particular location on the continent.[29]President Bush has denied that the United States was contemplating the construction of new bases on the African continent.[30] US plans include no large installations such as Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo, but rather a network of facilities - the so-called 'cooperative security locations,' etc., mentioned above, at which temporary activities will be conducted. There is one established, large US base on the continent, Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti with over 2300 troops stationed there that was inherited from USCENTCOM upon standup of the command.[2]However, Basil Ibebunjo tells us that there are some contradictions on the issue of the establishment of a Headquarters for AFRICOM on the African soil. According to him, "during his official announcement of the establishment of AFRICOM on February 6, 2007, the last paragraph of President Bush's press release read"[31]: "We will be consulting with African leaders to seek their thoughts on how Africa Command can respond to security challenges and opportunities in Africa. We will also work closely with our African partners to determine an appropriate location for the new command in Africa."[32] This change of policy must have been occasioned by the rejection of the planned establishment of AFRICOM's Headquarters in Africa by Africa's politico-military leadership. It was purported that AFRICOM was expected to reach full operational capability on October 1, 2008; including the establishment of a headquarters in Africa.In general, U.S. Unified Combatant Commands have an HQ of their own in one location, subordinate service component HQs, sometimes one or two co-located with the main HQ or sometimes spread widely, and a wide range of operating locations, main bases, forward detachments, etc. USAFRICOM initially appears to be considering something slightly different; spreading the actually COCOM HQ over several locations, rather than having the COCOM HQ in one place and the putative 'U.S. Army Forces, Africa', its air component, and 'U.S. Naval Forces, Africa' in one to four separate locations. AFRICOM will not have the traditional J-type staff divisions, instead having outreach, plans and programs, knowledge development, operations and logistics, and resources branches.[33][edit] ComponentsOn October 1, 2008 the Seventeenth Air Force was established at Ramstein Air Base, Germany as the United States Air Force component of the Africa Command.[34] Brig. Gen. Tracey Garrett was named as commander of the new USMC component, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Africa (MARFORAF), in November 2008.[35] MARFORAF is a dual-hatting arrangement for United States Marine Corps Forces, Europe.On December 3, 2008 the US announced that US Army and Navy headquarters units of AFRICOM would be hosted in Italy. The AFRICOM section of the Armys Southern European Task Force would be located in Vicenza and Naval Forces Europe in Naples would expand to include the Navy's AFRICOM component.[36] Special Operations Command, Africa (SOCAFRICA) is also being established, which will gain control over Joint Special Operations Task Force-Trans Sahara (JSOTF-TS) and Special Operations Command and Control Element - Horn of Africa (SOCCE-HOA).[37][edit] Scope of proposed operationsMilitary of the United States portalThe focus of USAFRICOM's missions will be diplomatic, economic and humanitarian aid, aimed at prevention of conflict, rather than at military intervention, according to Theresa Whelan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for African Affairs.[38] This is, to an extent, a misnomer. All United States combatant commands have the same responsibilities in general: to plan, direct and execute U.S. military operations in their assigned area of responsibility. AFRICOM is only different in that the situation on the continent, U.S. officials believe, would be better served by the military, in many cases, playing a secondary role to other efforts. Steven Morrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies agrees that the new command holds potential well beyond military oversight. Rather, its mission could be defined by an interagency mix, focusing the efforts of intelligence, diplomatic, health and aid experts.[14][edit] Official goalsU.S. Africa Command's formal mission statement, approved in May 2008, says:"United States Africa Command, in concert with other U.S. government agencies and international partners, conducts sustained security engagement through military-to-military programs, military-sponsored activities, and other military operations as directed to promote a stable and secure African environment in support of U.S. foreign policy."[39]The White House stated that:"[AFRICOM] will strengthen our security cooperation with Africa and create new opportunities to bolster the capabilities of our partners in Africa. Africa Command will enhance our efforts to bring peace and security to the people of Africa and promote our common goals of development, health, education, democracy, and economic growth in Africa."[40]February 2007 Draft Map of the United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM) showing its creation from parts of USEUCOM, USCENTCOM and USPACOM.

An updated definitive map from the Unified Command Plan 2008, signed by the President on December 17, 2008 can be found at http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/unifiedcommand/The U.S. Department of State stated of AFRICOM that:"The U.S. militarys new command center for Africa, Africa Command (AFRICOM), will play a supportive role as Africans continue to build democratic institutions and establish good governance across the continent. AFRICOMS foremost mission is to help Africans achieve their own security, and to support African leadership efforts."[41][edit] Geographic scopeThe territory of the command consists of all of the African continent except for Egypt, which remains under the direct responsibility of USCENTCOM, as it closely relates to the Middle East.[38] USAFRICOM also covers island countries commonly associated with Africa;Cape VerdeSo Tom and PrncipeComorosMadagascarMauritiusSeychelles[17][42]The U.S. military areas of responsibility involved were transferred from three separate U.S. unified combatant commands. Most of Africa was transferred from the United States European Command with the Horn of Africa and Sudan transferred from the United States Central Command. Responsibility for U.S. military operations in the islands of Madagascar, the Comoros, the Seychelles and Mauritius was transferred from the United States Pacific Command.[edit] Chain of CommandThe Commander of Africa Command reports to the U.S. Secretary of Defense, who reports to the President of the United States. In individual countries, U.S. Ambassadors continue to be the President's personal representatives in diplomatic relations with host nations.[43][edit] Further reading'AFRICOM Arrives,' Jane's Defence Weekly, 1 October 2008McFate, Sean (January 2008).
