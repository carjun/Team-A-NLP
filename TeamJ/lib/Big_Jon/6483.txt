The 54 decision, in favor of Citizens United, resulted from a dispute over whether the non-profit corporation Citizens United could air a film critical of Hillary Clinton, and whether the group could advertise the film in broadcast ads featuring Clinton's image, in apparent violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, commonly known as the McCainFeingold Act.[2]The decision reached the Supreme Court on appeal from a January 2008 decision by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The lower court decision upheld provisions of the McCainFeingold Act which prevented the film Hillary: The Movie from being shown on television within 30days of 2008 Democratic primaries.[1][3]The Court struck down a provision of the McCainFeingold Act that prohibited all corporations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and unions from broadcasting electioneering communications. [2] An "electioneering communication" was defined in McCainFeingold as a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that mentioned a candidate within 60days of a general election or thirty days of a primary. The decision overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990) and partially overruled McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003).[4] McCainFeingold had previously been weakened, without overruling McConnell, in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (2007). The Court did uphold requirements for disclaimer and disclosure by sponsors of advertisements. The case did not involve the federal ban on direct contributions from corporations or unions to candidate campaigns or political parties.[5]Contents1 Background2 Opinion of the Court2.1 Concurrences2.2 Dissents3 Subsequent developments3.1 Support3.1.1 Politicians3.1.2 Advocacy groups3.1.3 Academics and attorneys3.1.4 Journalists3.2 Criticism3.2.1 Politicians and political parties3.2.2 International3.2.3 Advocacy groups3.2.4 Academics and attorneys3.2.5 Journalists3.3 Media coverage3.3.1 Political blogs3.3.2 Election law blogs3.4 Opinion polls4 Legislative responses4.1 Legislative impact5 See also6 Notes7 References8 External links[edit] BackgroundThe Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) (akaMcCainFeingold), 2 U.S.C.441b, prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make an "electioneering communication" or for "independent expenditures," defined as speech that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate and that is made independently of a candidate's campaign. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Citizens United, a conservative nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization, filed a complaint before the Federal Election Commission charging that ads for Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11, which was critical of the Bush administration's response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, constituted political advertising and thus may not be aired 60 days before an election or 30 days before a party convention. On August 5, the FEC dismissed the complaint finding no evidence that the movie's ads had broken the law.[6] The FEC dismissed a further complaint filed in 2005, holding:The complainant alleged that the release and distribution of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 constituted an independent expenditure because the film expressly advocated the defeat of President Bush and that by being fully or partially responsible for the films release, Michael Moore and other entities associated with the film made excessive and/or prohibited contributions to unidentified candidates. The Commission found no reason to believe the respondents violated the Act because the film, associated trailers and website represented bona fide commercial activity, not contributions or expenditures as defined by the Federal Election Campaign Act.[7]In the wake of these decisions allowing the promotion of Fahrenheit 9/11 during the 2004 campaign, Citizens United sought to run television commercials during the 2008 campaign promoting its film Hillary: The Movie, a documentary critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and to show the movie on DirecTV.[8] In January 2008, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the commercials violated provisions in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (McCainFeingold) restricting "electioneering communications" 30days before primaries. Though Citizens United argued that the film was fact-based and nonpartisan, the lower Court found that the film had no purpose other than to discredit Clinton's candidacy for President.[9] As a consequence, the promotion of Fahrenheit 9/11 was allowed during the 2004 campaign, but the promotion of Hillary: The Movie was not allowed during the 2008 campaign.The Supreme Court docketed the case on August 18, 2008,[10] and heard oral argument on March24, 2009.[8][11][12] In the course of the original oral argument, then-Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L. Stewart, representing the FEC, claimed that under the Austin decision, the government would have the power to ban books, if those books contained even one sentence expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, and were published or distributed by a corporation or union.[13] Under intense questioning from the Court, Stewart further argued that under "Austin" the government could ban the distribution of political books over Amazon's Kindle, or prevent a union from hiring a writer to author a political book.[14]On June 29, 2009, the Supreme Court issued an order directing the parties to reargue the case on September9 after briefing whether it might be necessary to overrule Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce to decide the case.[15] At oral argument, Citizens United was to address the following question: "For the disposition of this case, should the Court overrule either or both Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce and the part of McConnell v. FEC which addresses the facial validity of Section203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002?"[16] Justice Stevens noted in his dissent that in its prior motion for summary judgment Citizens United had abandoned its facial challenge to Section203, with the parties agreeing to the dismissal of the claim. Stevens argued that the Court chose to hear argument on issues the parties had agreed were not to be presented to the Court and that it reached a decision on constitutionality when it could have found for the plaintiffs on narrower grounds.[17]The case, on reargument, was the first to be heard by Justice Sotomayor and the first case to be argued in the Supreme Court by Solicitor General Elena Kagan. Also arguing before the Court were former Bush solicitor general Ted Olson and First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams for Citizens United, and former Clinton solicitor general Seth Waxman defending the statute on behalf of various intervenors that supported the law.[18] Legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky called it "one of the most important First Amendment cases in years."[19][edit] Opinion of the CourtThe majority opinion,[20] delivered by Justice Kennedy, found that 2 U.S.C.  441(b)'s prohibition of all independent expenditures by corporations and unions was invalid and could not be applied to spending such as that in Hillary: The Movie. Kennedy wrote: "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." He also noted that since there was no way to distinguish between media and other corporations, these restrictions would allow Congress to suppress political speech in newspapers, books, television and blogs.[2] The Court overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, which had previously held that a Michigan campaign finance act that prohibited corporations from using treasury money to support or oppose candidates in elections did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court also overruled the part of McConnell v. Federal Election Commission that upheld BCRA203's extension of 441b's restrictions on independent corporate expenditures.The Court found that BCRA 201 and 311 (provisions requiring disclosure of the funder) were valid as applied to the ads for Hillary and to the movie itself.[20][edit] ConcurrencesChief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Alito joined, wrote separately "to address the important principles of judicial restraint and stare decisis implicated in this case."[21]Chief Justice Roberts wrote to further explicate and defend the court's statement that "there is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial abdication." The Chief Justice argued that there are times during which overruling prior decisions is necessary. Had the courts never gone against stare decisis, "segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants." Roberts' concurrence recited a plethora of case law in which the court had ruled against jurisprudence. Ultimately, however, Roberts argued that "stare decisis is a doctrine of preservation, not transformation. It counsels deference to make past mistakes, but provides no justification for making new ones".Justice Scalia joined the opinion of the Court, but wrote a separate concurrence, joined by Justice Alito and by Justice Thomas in part.[22] Scalia addressed Justice Stevens's dissent, specifically with regard to the notion that the court's decision was not supported by the original understanding of the First Amendment. Scalia stated that Stevens dissent was "in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment. It never shows why "the freedom of speech" that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form." He further considered the dissents exploration of the Framers views about the "role of corporations in society" to be misleading, and even if valid, irrelevant to the text. Scalia principally argued that the first amendment was written in "terms of speech, not speakers" and that "Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker".[edit] DissentsA dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens[23] was joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor. It concurred in the Court's decision to sustain BCRA's disclosure provisions, but dissented from the principal holding of the majority opinion. The 90-page dissent held that the Court's ruling "threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution." The dissent also argued that the Court's holding that BCRA203 was facially unconstitutional was ruling on a question not brought before them by the litigants, and so they "changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law." Stevens concluded his dissent with:At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.Justice Thomas wrote a separate opinion concurring in all but part IV of the Court's decision (upholding the disclosure provisions). In order to protect the anonymity of contributors to organizations exercising free speech, Thomas would have struck down the reporting requirements of BCRA201 and 311 as well, rather than allowing them to be challenged only on a case-specific basis. Thomas's primary argument was that anonymous free speech is protected and that making contributor lists public makes the contributors vulnerable to retaliation, citing instances of retaliation against contributors to both sides of a then recent California voter initiative. Thomas also expressed concern that such retaliation could extend to retaliation by elected officials. Thomas did not consider "as applied exceptions" to be sufficient to protect against the threat of retaliation.[24][edit] Subsequent developmentsThere was a wide range of reactions to Citizens United v. FEC from politicians, advocacy groups, academics, attorneys and journalists.[edit] Support[edit] PoliticiansSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who attended the announcement of the ruling, said the court "struck a blow for the First Amendment."[25]Republican campaign consultant Ed Rollins opined that the decision adds transparency to the election process and will make it more competitive.[26][edit] Advocacy groupsCitizens United, the group filing the lawsuit said, "Today's U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing Citizens United to air its documentary films and advertisements is a tremendous victory, not only for Citizens United but for every American who desires to participate in the political process."[27] During litigation, Citizens United had support from the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association.[25]Campaign finance attorney Cleta Mitchell, who had filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of two advocacy organizations opposing the ban, wrote that "The Supreme Court has correctly eliminated a constitutionally flawed system that allowed media corporations (e.g., The Washington Post Co.) to freely disseminate their opinions about candidates using corporate treasury funds, while denying that constitutional privilege to Susie's Flower Shop Inc.... The real victims of the corporate expenditure ban have been nonprofit advocacy organizations across the political spectrum."[28]Heritage Foundation fellow Hans A. von Spakovsky, a former Republican member of the Federal Election Commission, said "The Supreme Court has restored a part of the First Amendment that had been unfortunately stolen by Congress and a previously wrongly-decided ruling of the court."[29]Cato Institute researchers John Samples and Ilya Shapiro wrote that restrictions on advertising were based on the idea that corporations had so much money that their spending would create vast inequalities in speech that would undermine democracy. However, to make campaign spending equal or nearly so, the government would have to force some people or groups to spend less than they wished. And equality of speech is inherently contrary to protecting speech from government restraint, which is ultimately the heart of American conceptions of free speech.[30][edit] Academics and attorneysBradley A. Smith, a professor at Capital University Law School, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, and Chairman of the Center for Competitive Politics, wrote that the major opponents of political free speech are "incumbent politicians" who "are keen to maintain a chokehold on such speech." Empowering "small and midsize corporationsand every incorporated mom-and-pop falafel joint, local firefighters union, and environmental groupto make its voice heard" frightens them.[31] In response to statements by President Obama and others that the ruling would allow foreign entities to gain political influence through U.S. subsidiaries, Smith pointed out that the decision did not overturn the ban on political donations by foreign corporations and the prohibition on any involvement by foreign nationals in decisions regarding political spending by U.S. subsidiaries, which are covered by other parts of the law.[32]Campaign finance expert Jan Baran, a member of the Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform agreed, writing that "The history of campaign finance reform is the history of incumbent politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation. It is a lot easier to legislate against unions, gun owners, 'fat cat' bankers, health insurance companies and any other industry or 'special interest' group when they cant talk back." Baran further noted that in general conservatives and libertarians praised the ruling's preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but that liberals and campaign finance reformers criticized it as greatly expanding the role of corporate money in politics.[33]Attorney Kenneth Gross, former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, wrote that corporations relied more on the development of long-term relationships, political action committees and personal contributions, which were not affected by the decision. He held that while trade associations might seek to raise funds and support candidates, corporations which have signed on to transparency agreements regarding political spending may not be eager to give.[28]The New York Times asked seven academics to opine on how corporate money will reshape politics as a result of the court's decision.[34] Three of these wrote that the effects would be minimal or positive: Christopher Cotton, a University of Miami School of Business assistant professor of economics, wrote that There may be very little difference between seeing eight ads or seeing nine ads (compared to seeing one ad or two). And, voters recognize that richer candidates are not necessarily the better candidates, and in some cases, the benefit of running more ads is offset by the negative signal that spending a lot of money creates.[34] University of California professor of law Eugene Volokh held that the most influential actors in most political campaigns are media corporations which overtly editorialize for and against candidates, and also influence elections by choosing what to cover and how to cover it. Holding that corporations like Exxon would fear alienating voters by supporting candidates, the decision really meant that voters would hear more messages from more sources.[34] Joel Gora, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who had previously argued the case of Buckley v. Valeo on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the decision represented "a great day for the First Amendment" writing that the Court had "dismantled the First Amendment 'caste system' in election speech."[34][edit] JournalistsThe Editorial Board of the San Antonio Express-News criticized McCainFeingold's exception for media corporations to its ban on corporate electioneering, writing that it makes no sense that the paper could make endorsements up until the day of the election but advocacy groups could not. "While the influence of money on the political process is troubling and sometimes corrupting, abridging political speech is the wrong way to counterbalance that influence.[35]Anthony Dick in National Review countered a number of arguments against the decision, asking rhetorically, "is there something uniquely harmful and/or unworthy of protection about political messages that come from corporations and unions, as opposed to, say, rich individuals, persuasive writers, or charismatic demagogues?" He noted that a recent Gallup poll shows that a majority of the public actually agrees with the Court that corporations and unions should be treated just like individuals in terms of their political-expenditure rights."[36] A Gallup poll taken in October 2009 and released soon after the decision showed 57percent of those surveyed agreed that contributions to political candidates are a form of free speech and 55percent agreed that the same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions. Sixty-four percent of Democrats and Republicans believed campaign donations are a form of free speech.[37]Chicago Tribune editorial board member Steve Chapman wrote "If corporate advocacy may be forbidden as it was under the law in question, it's not just Exxon Mobil and Citigroup that are rendered mute. Nonprofit corporations set up merely to advance goals shared by citizens, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association, also have to put a sock in it. So much for the First Amendment goal of fostering debate about public policy."[38][edit] Criticism[edit] Politicians and political partiesPresident Barack Obama stated that the decision "gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates."[39] Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, "this ruling strikes at our democracy itself" and "I can't think of anything more devastating to the public interest".[40] On January27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, "Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law[41] to open the floodgates for special interests including foreign corporations to spend without limit in our elections. Well I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities."Democratic senator Russ Feingold, a lead sponsor of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, stated "This decision was a terrible mistake. Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue, the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president."[42] Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat, stated that it was "the worst Supreme Court decision since the Dred Scott case" and accused the court of opening the door to political bribery and corruption.[43] Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards, along with constitutional law professor and Maryland Democratic State Senator Jamie Raskin, have advocated petitions to reverse the decision by means of constitutional amendment.[44] Rep. Leonard Boswell introduced legislation to amend the constitution.[45] Senator John Kerry also called for an Amendment to overrule the decision.[46]Republican presidential candidate and Senator John McCain, co-crafter of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, said "there's going to be, over time, a backlash ... when you see the amounts of union and corporate money that's going to go into political campaigns".[47] McCain was "disappointed by the decision of the Supreme Court and the lifting of the limits on corporate and union contributions" but not surprised by the decision, saying that "It was clear that Justice Roberts, Alito and Scalia, by their very skeptical and even sarcastic comments, were very much opposed to BCRA."[42] He pointed out that "Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor, who had taken a different position on this issue, both had significant political experience, while Justices Roberts, Alito and Scalia have none."[47] (In fact, Rehnquist had joined Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Kennedy in dissenting in McConnell v. FEC). Republican Senator Olympia Snowe opined that "Today's decision was a serious disservice to our country."[48]Sanda Everette, co-chair of the Green Party, stated that "The ruling especially hurts the ability of parties that don't accept corporate contributions, like the Green Party, to compete." (In fact, 2U.S.C.441i, which was not altered by the decision in Citizens United, prohibits all parties from accepting corporate contributions). Another Green Party officer, Rich Whitney, stated "In a transparently political decision, a majority of the US Supreme Court overturned its own recent precedent and paid tribute to the giant corporate interests that already wield tremendous power over our political process and political speech."Ralph Nader, a lawyer who placed third in the popular vote in the last three presidential elections, condemned the ruling,[49] saying that "With this decision, corporations can now directly pour vast amounts of corporate money, through independent expenditures, into the electoral swamp already flooded with corporate campaign PAC contribution dollars." He called for shareholder resolutions asking company directors to pledge not to use company money to favor or oppose electoral candidates.[50] Pat Choate, Reform Party candidate stated, "The court has, in effect, legalized foreign governments and foreign corporations to participate in our electoral politics."[51][edit] InternationalAmbassador Janez Lenari, speaking for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's election body, which has overseen over 150elections, stated that the ruling may adversely affect the organization's two commitments of "giving voters a genuine choice and giving candidates a fair chance" in that "it threatens to further marginalize candidates without strong financial backing or extensive personal resources, thereby in effect narrowing the political arena."[52][edit] Advocacy groupsThe American Civil Liberties Union membership was split over the implications of the ruling and its board sent the issue to its special committee on campaign finance for further consideration.[53]In response to the court's decision, two nongovernmental campaigns have emerged to petition for an amendment to the United States Constitution.[54] Organizations advocating the campaigns include Voter Action, Public Citizen, the Center for Corporate Policy, and the American Independent Business Alliance.[55]Campaign reform groups Common Cause and Public Campaign issued a joint press release denouncing the opinion as "judicial activism and arrogance at its worst," and calling for new legislation to mitigate some of the potential effects of the ruling.[56]US PIRG, a federation of statewide non-profit, non-partisan public interest advocacy organizations, opposed the Court's decision.[57][edit] Academics and attorneysThe constitutional law scholar Laurence H. Tribe wrote that the decision "marks a major upheaval in First Amendment law and signals the end of whatever legitimate claim could otherwise have been made by the Roberts Court to an incremental and minimalist approach to constitutional adjudication, to a modest view of the judicial role vis--vis the political branches, or to a genuine concern with adherence to precedent" and pointed out that "Talking about a business corporation as merely another way that individuals might choose to organize their association with one another to pursue their common expressive aims is worse than unrealistic; it obscures the very real injustice and distortion entailed in the phenomenon of some people using other peoples money to support candidates they have made no decision to support, or to oppose candidates they have made no decision to oppose."[58]Former supreme court Justice Sandra Day OConnor criticized the decision only obliquely, but warned that In invalidating some of the existing checks on campaign spending, the majority in Citizens United has signaled that the problem of campaign contributions in judicial elections might get considerably worse and quite soon.[59]Four other academics writing in the aforementioned New York Times article were critical.[34] Heather K. Gerken, Professor of Law at Yale Law School wrote that "The court has done real damage to the cause of reform, but that damage mostly came earlier, with decisions that made less of a splash." Richard L. Hasen, Professor of Law at Loyola Law School, found that the ruling "is activist, it increases the dangers of corruption in our political system and it ignores the strong tradition of American political equality". Michael Waldman, director of the Brennan Center for Justice at N.Y.U. School of Law, opined that the decision "matches or exceeds Bush v. Gore in ideological or partisan overreaching by the court" and Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of Democracy 21 considered it "a disaster for the American people".[34]Subsequent research by John Coates, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, has shown that corporations with weaker, less shareholder-friendly corporate governance have been more likely to engage in corporate political activity, and spend more when they do.[60] Professors Lucian Bebchuk at Harvard Law School and Richard Squire Columbia Law School argue that the interests of directors and executives may significantly diverge from those of shareholders with respect to political speech decisions, that these decisions may carry special expressive significance from shareholders, and that as a result of the Citizens United decision, new laws providing shareholders with a greater role in determining how corporate money is spent on political activity would be beneficial to shareholders.[61][edit] JournalistsThe New York Times stated in an editorial, "The Supreme Court has handed lobbyists a new weapon. A lobbyist can now tell any elected official: if you vote wrong, my company, labor union or interest group will spend unlimited sums explicitly advertising against your re-election."[62] Jonathan Alter called it the "most serious threat to American democracy in a generation."[63] The Christian Science Monitor wrote that the Court had declared outright that corporate expenditures cannot corrupt elected officials, that influence over lawmakers is not corruption, and that appearance of influence will not undermine public faith in our democracy.[64]Some journalists and politicians reacted strongly to the decision with online media journal Veterans Today calling for the "immediate arrest" of the justices voting in the majority for treason.[65] Keith Olbermann of MSNBC said that with this decision "within ten years every politician in this country will be a prostitute" and compared it to the case Dred Scott v. Sandford, an 1857 case that held that African-Americans could not be citizens.[66][edit] Media coverage[edit] Political blogsPolitical blogs with the most authority (in early 2010, the top five political blogs, as rated by Technorati, were The Huffington Post, CNNs Political Ticker, The Corner on National Review Online, Think Progress, and Hot Air) and with more compelling ideological motives to cover the Citizens United v.FEC ruling reported on it more than other blogs (in the two weeks following the ruling, liberal blogs posted about the ruling twice as much as their conservative or non-ideologically marked competitors). Most blogs, however, avoided the theoretical aspects of the decision and focused on more personal and dramatic elements, like the Barack Obama-Samuel Alito face-off; while President Obama was reprimanding the Court for a decision he strongly opposes, Justice Alito perceivably mouthed the words not true. This event was extensively commented by most political bloggers, while another big chunk of the coverage concentrated on whether or not foreign corporations would be able to make substantial political contributions in US elections, another claim by President Obama.[edit] Election law blogsOn specialized blogs, the Citizens United v. FEC ruling increased traffic by about tenfold for a few days. Traffic also change in quality terms; a disproportionately large and diverse set of websites linked to their posts about the ruling, when compared to other topics addressed by these specialized blogs.[edit] Opinion pollsABC-Washington Post poll results.An ABC-Washington Post poll conducted February 4 to 8, 2010, showed that 80% of those surveyed opposed (and 65% strongly opposed) the Citizens United ruling which the poll described as saying "corporations and unions can spend as much money as they want to help political candidates win elections." Additionally, 72% supported "an effort by Congress to reinstate limits on corporate and union spending on election campaigns".[67][68][69]A Gallup Poll conducted in October 2009 but released after the Supreme Court decision showed that at that time 57percent of those surveyed agreed that money given to political candidates is a form of free speech and 55percent agreed that the same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions. However, in the same poll 52% to 41% prioritized limits on campaign contributions over protecting rights to support campaigns and 76% thought the government should be able to place limits on corporation or union donations.[70][71]The plaintiff, Citizens United, and the Center for Competitive Politics reported to find support for the decision in their polls.[72] In particular, the Center for Competitive Politics poll[73] found that by a 51% to 17% margin respondents agreed that Citizens United should have a right to air Hillary: The Movie.[edit] Legislative responses[edit] Legislative impactThe New York Times reported that 24 states with laws prohibiting independent expenditures by unions and corporations will have to change their campaign finance laws because of the ruling. It also will affect pending trials under those laws.[74]Dick Durbin has proposed that candidates who sign up small donors receive $900,000 in public money. Further, laws that govern corporate governance can be amended to assure that shareholders vote on political expenditures as is the case in the United Kingdom.[63]In February 2010, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, immediate past Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, outlined legislation aimed at undoing the decision.[75] In April 2010, they introduced such legislation in the Senate and House, respectively.[76] On June 24, 2010, H.R.5175 (The DISCLOSE Act) passed in the House of Representatives to require additional disclosure by corporations of their campaign expenditures. The law, if passed, would also prohibit some political spending by U.S. companies with twenty percent or more foreign ownership, and some government contractors.[77]The DISCLOSE Act includes exemptions to its rules given to certain special interests such as the National Rifle Association and the American Association of Retired Persons. These gaps within the proposal have attracted criticism from lawmakers on both political parties. "They are auctioning off pieces of the First Amendment in this bill... The bigger you are, the stronger you are, the less disclosure you have," said Republican Congressman Dan Lungren of California. Demoratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California commented, "I wish there had been no carve-outs".[78]Due to unified Republican opposition, the DISCLOSE Act twice failed to pass the U.S. Senate in the 111th Congress, reaching both times 59 of the 60 votes required to overcome a Republican filibuster.[79][80][edit] See also2009 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United StatesCorporate personhood debateDavid BossieMurray Hill IncorporatedDISCLOSE ActSimonds v Heffer [1983] BCLC 298, a UK company law case holding that political donations were ultra vires the company.Historical backgroundTillman Act of 1907, banned corporations' contributions to political parties or candidates for any federal election campaignsTaft Hartley Act of 1947, banned expenditures by corporations and unions in connection with general and primary federal electionsFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971 put $1000 limits on expenditure by people, including candidates for electionBuckley v.
