Thirty-three states have laws on the books requiring employers to give workers time off to cast a vote. The District of Columbia and 17statesdo not.With so much at stake in Tuesdays election, working families are mobilizing to get out every vote. So, it is important to know if you can get time off to vote or if you have to go before or after work. To find out what the law is in your state, visit the website www.CanMyBossDoThat.com.The new siteoffers an interactive list of laws in each state and Washington, D.C. The site also provides links to the specific laws, which differ from state to state. For example, in Minnesota, workers can take time in the morning on Election Day, but not the afternoon. In Massachusetts, only mechanical, retail and manufacturing workers can take time off. The law in North Dakota doesnt require employers to let employees off to vote, it only suggests that they do it.The site also provides information on which states protect workers from retaliation based on how they vote or because of political activity outside of work. As many people learned when a woman was fired for her John Kerry bumper sticker in Alabama in 2004, without state protection, workers are not protected from retaliation for their political views or how they vote.Says Anne Janks, director of the site:These new resources will help workers understand if they have any rights and how to get the time off to vote. We also hope that states which do not give these most basic rights to ensure a vibrant democracy will consider passing protections for their citizens.So check the site to see what your rights are, but, by all means, make sure to vote Nov. 2.CanMyBossDoThat.com is a non-profit website with more than 750 pages educating workersabout their rights. Many employment rights are based on state laws. Topics also outline federal and state-specific protections. The site was started in 2009 by Interfaith Worker Justice (IWJ) to provide clear, usable, specific information for workers and their advocates.Posted:        October 31st, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .

But for workers and their unions, its always been about people power, says Gerry Kelly, business manager of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 22 in Omaha, Neb. (see video).Its the time to rally our members, get them to the polls to continue to send a message that we can make a difference. We have phone banking.We also do canvassing of neighborhoods. Its our members contacting our members.Union activists and leaders around the nation are doing the same thing in these last few days before Nov. 2 to mobilize union family voters in vital races across the nation.They are knocking on doors for Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate Joe Sestak and for Jerry Brown in his California governors race against Meg Whitman, who has dumped more than $140 million of her billionaires fortune into the race. Union activists are making another round of phone calls for working family-backed House members like Nick Joe Rahall in West Virginia and Suzan DelBene in Washington State.Union leaders are on the road, too. Yesterday, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn led a press conference on proposals to create jobs and later joined an Operating Engineers (IUOE) phone get-out-the-vote (GOTV) bank. Between now and Election Day, Trumka is scheduled for rallies, walks and phone banks in Pennsylvania and Ohio.This weekend,AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler will rally with young workers to get out the votein Los Angeles and in Denver, and on Monday and Tuesday she will be getting out the vote in Chicago. AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Arlene Holt Baker is mobilizing union voters in Philadelphia, Cincinnati andaround Connecticut.The union members on the phones and in the neighborhoods and those in this IBEW video exemplify the union commitment that drew praise from President Obama Wednesday when he told thousands of union political activists we are the backbone of the ground campaign.Its the edge you have when you walk up to a door or make a phone call and say, Im from the union and it matters whether you vote.Kelly reaffirms Obamas assessment of the effectiveness of union member-to-union member contact.Its important that they hear from the local union. That they hear from a member of Local 22. Its not some random campaign worker.He acknowledgesthere is frustration that change isnt coming fast enough.But weve got a great opportunity to put some friends not only in Washington, D.C., but here locally, as well, that will continue on this path to recovery.Be sure to check out the full video.Posted:        October 30th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .

We do not believe that coal dust was a meaningful factor.Among the six who took the Fifth were Elizabeth Chamberlin, Masseys vice president for safety, and Gary May, a foreman who worked at the Upper Big Branch mine before the explosion.Davitt McAteer, who is leading an independent investigative team appointed by West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin, told NPR:The primary driving force of this investigation is to learn what happened so we can prevent more disasters from occurring. [Refusing to testify in the investigation] is a disservice to these 29 [deceased] miners and to finding out what went wrong.Chamberlins and Mays testimony could have been significant.MSHA records showthe Upper Big Branch mine had a significant history of safety issues.Even more amazing, Massey revealed that it wants to resume mining at Upper Big Branchan idea the federal government squelched. The area Massey wants to mine is in the same seam where the explosion occurred, MSHA spokeswoman Amy Louviere said.Given the events surrounding this disaster, our first concern must be the safety of the miners. Massey needs to address these concerns in their plan before MSHA will grant approval.Posted:        October 29th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .

They will work together across industries to ensure that jobs in these industries are good jobs and workers are represented by unions and to coordinate bargaining across borders.Mexican unions and U.S. unions have worked closely for years. Most recently, the AFL-CIO and the United Steelworkers (USW) backed strikers at Grupo Mexicos Cananea and Pasta de Conchos mines.The Communications Workers of America (CWA), led by President Larry Cohen, has had a long working relationship with STRM, the independent union of telephone workers, defending worker and union rights and supporting each other in bargaining, organizing and mobilization.In 2007, Santiago Rafael Cruz, an organizer for the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC), was murdered in Monterrey where he was helping farmworkersspeak out and fight corruption in the recruitment of workers to migrate to America. The Solidarity Center also works with Mexican workers to build an independent trade union movement there.CWAs Cohen says:The working people of Mexico need an independent trade union movement to be able to bargain fairly and make economic gains for themselves and their families. The UNT is a dynamic organization with members like STRM that are committed to ending the Mexican governments assault on workers rights. This plan will help bring economic justice to workers in both Mexico and the United StatesAFL-CIO International Affairs Director Cathy Feingold adds:The agreement reached with the UNT represents an important step forward towards realizing a shared prosperity agenda for workers struggling in both Mexico and the United States.The union leaders also agreed to work together to oppose any further weakening of labor laws and to work jointly to strengthen labor laws through the International Labor Organization (ILO) and other global groups.One of the major labor-law problems in Mexico is the so-called protection contracts collective agreements negotiated between employers and official company or government-appointed union leaderswhich protect the employer from having to deal with representative and democratic trade unions. Protection contracts are negotiated without the knowledge or consent of workers. Such contracts often are in place in a factory even before workers are hired. Experts estimate that the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements in the country are in fact protection contracts.The agreement also calls for:Developing a plan for immigration that protects, promotes and respects immigrant rights.Working together to combat unscrupulous labor recruiters and end labor abuses in both countries.Pushing for changes in both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the labor side agreements.Using the existing systems in trade agreements to push for enforcement of worker rights in each country.Conducting joint corporate campaigns to build authentic representation for workers.Posted:        October 29th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .

USAS International Campaigns Coordinator Teresa Cheng says students are especially concerned about employee abuse at Rite Aids massive Southwest Regional Distribution Center in Lancaster, Calif., where 550 workers are in the sixth year of a struggle to join union and bargain a contract.Student activists will hold actions today outside Rite Aid stores in State College, Pa; Palo Alto, Calif.; Boston; Los Angeles; Ithaca, N.Y.; Seattle; Chapel Hill, N.C.; and Washington, D.C.You can take action now. Click here to tell Rite Aid CEO John Standley to stop cheating its workers on health care and to negotiate a fair first contract with its warehouse workers.After the workers in Lancaster voted to join the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) two years ago, the union says the company retaliated with illegal layoffs and has refused to negotiate a reasonable first contract with these workers. Now Rite Aid wants to overcharge its workers by nearly 3,000 percent on their health insurance plan, workers say.Rite Aids directors earn up to $100 million a year and pour money into busting unions, and yet they insist on ripping off workers by overcharging them on the health care they and their families need.Last June, hundreds of Rite Aid workers and supporters from Pennsylvania, New York and California rallied outside the companys annual shareholder meeting in Harrisburg, Pa., to demand good jobs and a voice at work.During that rally, Sylvia Estrada and Angel Warner, two workers from the distribution center in Lancaster,described their five-year struggle to form a union.We want to work with Rite Aid and grow this company. These jobs pay our bills. But we also want to be paid fairly and treated with respect. For that, we need Rite Aid to reach an agreement with our union.Posted:        October 29th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .
