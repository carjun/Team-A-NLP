On Politics: Covering the US Congress, Governors, and the 2012 Election - USATODAY.comHomeNewsTravelMoneySportsLifeTechWeatherOn Politics: The news, the people, the strategiesHomeArchivesRelated topicsForumAboutJan 14, 2011Michael Steele fights for new term as GOP chairman07:01 AMCommentRecommendThe Republican National Committee today will select a new chairman to shepherd the party as it tries to win back the White House and expand its ranks in Congress and among governors.Reince Priebus, the Wisconsin GOP chairman, has emerged as the front-runner to replace Michael Steele, whose tenure has been marked by high spending, financial debt and verbal gaffes.The RNC will play a crucial role in the 2012 presidential election, using its resources to help get out the vote and to complement the campaign of the party's standard-bearer against President Obama.Steele, a former Maryland lieutenant governor, made a surprise decision to run for a second term. While acknowledging his mistakes, Steele emphasized at a recent debate that "we won" in November and pointed to the GOP takeover of the House, victories in 10 governorships including key states such as Ohio, and wins in six Senate seats.Even though the party took in more than $80 million before the November elections, it had to take out a $15 million loan. A debt payment of $5 million is due next month, according to the Associated Press.A high-profile chairman who traveled a lot and made frequent TV appearances, Steele was criticized for some of his remarks, such as saying Afghanistan was a "war of Obama's choosing."Going into Friday's election, whip counts by National Journal's Hotline, The Washington Post and Politico showed Priebus had the broadest support of the committee's 168 members. On Thursday, Priebus picked up the endorsement of former White House chief of staff John Sununu, who will soon retire as New Hampshire GOP chairman.Priebus, the RNC's former general counsel, played up his fundraising prowess and ballot box success in usually blue Wisconsin, which voted for Obama in the 2008 presidential election and Democrat John Kerry in 2004.In 2010, Republicans won majorities in both houses of the Wisconsin Legislature and also won the governor's race. The GOP now has 5-3 advantage in the state's congressional delegation.Maria Cino, a former Bush administration official who had the support of House Speaker John Boehner; Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman; and Ann Wagner, a former RNC co-chairwoman, are also running for the job.(Posted by Catalina Camia)Tags:Michael SteeleSaul AnuzisMaria CinoReince PriebusAnn WagnerJan 13, 2011Getting the names right for 112th Congress 05:57 PMCommentRecommendTry to say the names of these new members of Congress three times:David Cicilline. Quico Canseco. Kelly Ayotte.No, this is not an exercise from The King's Speech, the movie in theaters now about British monarch King George VI and his stammer.This is about pronouncing names correctly and The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, has published a helpful guide that's a fun read to boot.Stuck on whether the Rhode Island Democrat, listed first in our list above, is Chick-uh-LEEN or CHICK-uh-LEEN-ee?Guess again. Cicilline, the former mayor of Providence, who succeeds Democrat Patrick Kennedy in the House, pronounces his last name Sis-uh-LEEN-ee.The name of the new senator from New Hampshire, Republican Kelly Ayotte, is two syllables:  the first rhymes with "day" and the second is -ottAnd the Texas Republican in the middle of the list? He is KEE-Ko Cahn-SEH-ko, according to The Hill. But for the House clerk, the official keeper of the House roll, the Texan is listed on the roster as Francisco R. Canseco -- and given names are a whole other matter.(Posted by Catalina Camia)Tags:Kelly AyotteDavid CicillineRomney adds to political team 04:59 PMCommentRecommendMitt Romney has sent his strongest signal to date that he intends to try again for the White House, a new report says.The website RealClearPolitics reports that the former Massachusetts governor has added a political director and pollster for a possible 2012 bid for the Republican nomination.Romney's hires come as a recent Public Policy Polling survey in Iowa shows that he and Mike Huckabee would be competitive against President Obama. But if the election were held today, Obama would still lead both ex-governors.(Posted by Catalina Camia)Tags:Mitt RomneyHouse to vote next week on health care repeal 03:14 PMCommentRecommendAfter a week of grieving, the House plans next week to vote on the politically charged issue of repealing the health care law.Laena Fallon, a spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, said a detailed schedule will be released tomorrow."As the White House noted, it is important for Congress to get back to work," Fallon told USA TODAY's Kelly Kennedy. "We will resume thoughtful consideration of the health care bill next week."Debate on the measure, which is expected to easily pass the GOP-led House, was postponed in the wake of the Arizona shooting rampage that gravely wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.The vote on health care repeal was supposed to take place yesterday. Instead, the House debated and passed a resolution paying tribute to Giffords -- the Arizona Democrat who, the FBI says, was the target of the shooting spree -- and the six people who died in the attack and the heroes at the scene.At a memorial service last night in Tucson, President Obama urged the nation to ensure "we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds."That may not be easy on a measure the GOP has entitled "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Act."Last year's health care debate was emotional and at times raw, helping to contribute to some angry town hall meetings and noisy protests. Repealing health care was also a top priority of the small-government Tea Party, whose supporters helped the GOP take control of the House after four years of Democratic rule.Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, told the Los Angeles Times that lawmakers still have PTSD -- post-traumatic stress disorder -- from the last health care debate.In the same story, a Maine Tea Party leader said he was disappointed with the delay. "It's a mistake. It shows sort of a lack of spine and will," said Andrew Ian Dodge.Fallon said GOP leaders will focus the debate on "substantive policy differences" surrounding the law, which mandates that all Americans obtain health insurance.(Posted by Catalina Camia)Tags:Eric CantorGabrielle GiffordsChellie PingreeKay Bailey Hutchison to retire from Senate 01:52 PMCommentRecommendUpdated at 4:43 p.m.  ETTexas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison announced today she won't seek re-election next year.Hutchison, first elected in June 1993, lost the Republican nomination for governor last year to Rick Perry. Hutchison had indicated she would leave office to run full time for governor, but then decided to stay in the Senate.In a letter to supporters, Hutchison said the timing of her retirement announcement was aimed at giving "the people of Texas ample time to consider who my successor will be.""I intended to leave this office long before now, but I was persuaded to continue in order to avoid disadvantage to our state," she said.Hutchison also acknowledged the toll the past two years, devoted to both the Senate and her gubernatorial campaign, have taken on her family. She and her husband, Ray, adopted two children in 2001.Perry rode a wave of anti-incumbent anger to easily defeat Hutchison in the GOP gubernatorial primary, which also featured a candidate with Tea Party support.Perry made an issue of Hutchison's time in Washington and said Texas Republicans "said no to Washington bureaucrats" by renominating him. He defeated Democrat Bill White in November.Hutchison, a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, has been a player on defense issues and served stints in the GOP leadership. Her Texas and Senate colleague John Cornyn called Hutchison a woman of vision and energy, "someone who represents the very best of the state of Texas."Former President George W. Bush thanked Hutchison for her service to Texas, as a former state treasurer and now U.S. senator. "Kay has been an effective leader who has served her fellow citizens with honor and dignity," Bush said in a statement.Democrats have 23 Senate seats to defend in 2012, including those of two independents who vote with them, compared with 10 for Republicans. The Lone Star state is considered GOP territory, but Democrats vowed to fight."We look forward to running a competitive race in Texas," said Eric Schultz of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, calling Texas "one of several Democratic pick-up opportunities" in November 2012.Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, said he intends to explore running for the Senate.(Posted by Catalina Camia)Tags:Rick PerryKay Bailey HutchisonGOP's Mitch Daniels gets turn as Gridiron speaker12:33 PMCommentRecommendForget the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries.Presidential hopefuls putting on a charm offensive for voters and journalists alike also schedule podium time at Washington's annual Gridiron Club dinner, a tradition of music and satire going back to 1885.Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels has been tapped as the Republican speaker for the March 12 dinner. He'll try to get a few laughs and gig politicos -- "we singe but we never burn," as the Gridiron motto says -- and share speaking duties with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the Democratic speaker.Gridiron President Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA TODAY, announced today that Daniels has joined the Gridiron lineup.Daniels, a former White House budget director for President George W. Bush, has been making the rounds of talk shows and doing other public appearances as he tries to decide whether to jump into the Republican field trying to defeat President Obama. All the while, Daniels has been trying to dispel the notion that he's a "cerebral but boring" policy wonk.There is a tradition of speaking at the Gridiron dinner and then later finding your way on the campaign trail. Obama did a turn as Democratic speaker at the 2006 dinner and is scheduled to attend this year's festivities.Daniels follows GOP presidential contenders Bob Dole, John McCain, George H.W. Bush, Mitt Romney, Lamar Alexander, Elizabeth Dole, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson as Gridiron speakers, according to Page.(Posted by Catalina Camia)See photos of: Barack ObamaTags:Barack ObamaKathleen SebeliusMitch DanielsBoehner skips memorial for Ariz. shooting victims10:40 AMCommentRecommendHouse Speaker John Boehner did not attend last night's Tucson memorial service for victims of the Arizona shooting rampage.Politico reports Boehner was at a Washington reception for Maria Cino, who is running for chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.An unnamed Democratic aide, speaking to Politico,  said it was "disrespectful" for Boehner to skip the memorial.A Democrat identified as a senior congressional aide criticized Boehner in story by The Daily Caller for declining President Obama's invitation to fly on Air Force One with a bipartisan group of lawmakers.  "As speaker, he could have taken a delegation to Arizona on military air," this aide said.Aboard Air Force One, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs declined to comment about Boehner not attending the service and declining a plane ride to Tucson."I don't think that's appropriate for me to get into," Gibbs told reporters on the flight back to Washington.On Wednesday, Boehner opened the House debate on a resolution honoring Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat gravely wounded in the shooting spree,  the six people who died and other individuals who tried to save lives in the attempt on Giffords' life. The resolution condemned the attack in strong terms.In his remarks, Boehner said the House needs "holy, uplifting strength" and urged the House to "not let this inhuman act frighten us."Boehner also attended a private, bipartisan prayer service at the U.S. Capitol for the Arizona shooting victims."Yesterday, Rep. Giffords' colleagues on both sides of the aisle honored her and mourned those who were lost. The speaker felt his place was here in the House, with them," said Michael Steel, a Boehner spokesman.(Posted by Catalina Camia)Tags:John BoehnerGabrielle GiffordsMaria CinoDid 'blood libel' hurt Palin for president?09:15 AMCommentRecommendUpdated at 12:10 p.m. ET Will Sarah Palin's use of the term "blood libel" hurt her chances if she decides to run for president in 2012?That is the question being debated in political circles and the answers are mixed.Palin attracted controversy by accusing her critics, particularly in the news media, of committing "blood libel" by blaming incendiary political rhetoric by her and other conservatives for the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.The term "blood libel" has been used to blame Jews for the death of Jesus.A new USA TODAY/Gallup Poll finds a majority of those surveyed say the idea that political rhetoric is to blame for the rampage is an attempt to make conservatives look bad."The strongest way to rise above would have been to talk about suffering, tragedy, hope, strength and recovery," former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told Politico. "But instead she (Palin) followed the more conventional political route and made it about herself rather than the victims."Palin's effectiveness at grabbing headlines is unparalleled, one GOP strategist says. The former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee "is now the dominant media presence on the Republican/Tea Party front," GOP strategist John Feehery told the Associated Press. "She can make news quicker and more effectively than any other conservative Republican."But the format in which she makes news is an issue. Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who says he's not interested in running for president next year, told The New York Times that Palin's venue for communicating her thoughts about the Arizona rampage -- through a scripted video released on her Facebook page -- won't stand with voters who want to see politicians for themselves and the way they act in the public arena."People need to be judged by the way they conduct themselves in the public arena, in a way that is as minimally staged as possible," Christie said. "If Gov. Palin never does any of those things, she'll never be president, because people in America won't countenance that. They just won't."On the Democratic side, political consultant Jim Jordan told the AP that Palin's comments on Wednesday help her with the GOP political base but turn off a broader electorate."Every time she pops off, she excites her narrowing band of partisans and probably makes herself more money, but she further alienates everyone else," Jordan said to AP.USA TODAY's David Jackson reports in The Oval that White House spokesman Robert Gibbs would not get himself drawn into the debate about Palin and her remarks.A recent Gallup Poll shows Palin is the best known of any potential GOP presidential candidate for 2012, but lags behind Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney in terms of image.(Posted by Catalina Camia)See photos of: Sarah PalinTags:Sarah PalinGabrielle GiffordsChristopher J. ChristieFriends: 'Watching a miracle' as Giffords opens eye 07:34 AMCommentRecommendThe scene inside Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' hospital room yesterday was  like "watching a miracle,"  one of her closest friends in Congress says.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., recounted for journalists aboard Air Force One early this morning the emotional scene as they watched their friend respond to them during their visit."It felt like we were watching a miracle," said Wasserman Schultz, who helped recruit Giffords to run for Congress in 2006.The announcement by President Obama that Giffords opened an eye for the first time since being shot in the head last Saturday brought thunderous cheers at a memorial service for the victims of the Arizona shooting rampage.But for Giffords' friends, being at the hospital as the congresswoman opened her eye and lifted an arm to show response was both exciting and deeply personal.Gillibrand and Wasserman Schultz talked at length with reporters as they flew back from Tucson and their quotes come from pool report distributed to all news media. (The pool report is time stamped 12:14 a.m. ET Thursday.)"It's like she wanted to tell us, 'I'm here, I can hear you, I'm with you, and I appreciate everything you're doing," said Gillibrand, who was elected to the House in 2006 the same year as Giffords.Giffords, the lawmakers said, struggled to completely open her eye and moved as as she heard her husband, Mark Kelly, call out to her. "She (Giffords) reaches out and starts grabbing Mark and is touching him ... she was clearly trying to hug him," the senator said.USA TODAY's David Jackson has more on Obama's speech in The Oval.(Posted by Catalina Camia)Tags:Gabrielle GiffordsKirsten GillibrandDebbie Wasserman SchultzJan 12, 2011Report: Company sells rifle part inscribed 'you lie' 06:08 PMCommentRecommendUpdated at 8:45 p.m. ETCNN reports that Rep. Joe Wilson has been told by a South Carolina gun company that it is discontinuing the sale of a rifle part engraved with the words "you lie."Wilson, R-S.C., attracted national attention for screaming out "you lie" during a speech by President Obama in 2009.CNN quotes a letter from Wilson, forwarded to the network by the congressman's staff, thanking Palmetto State Armory for discontinuing sales of the rifle part."I thank you for quickly suspending sales of the product that uses my words," Wilson wrote.Our original post begins here:A South Carolina gun company is reportedly selling a rifle component inscribed with the words "you lie" in tribute to Rep. Joe Wilson's outburst at President Obama.The Palmetto State Armory is selling a commemorative part for an AR-15 in honor of Wilson, who shouted "you lie" as Obama addressed Congress about health care.The news was reported by The Free Times, an alternative news weekly in Columbia, S.C.The news weekly says a web page for the rifle component is no longer on the gun company's website.The gun product has not been endorsed by Wilson, who was formally admonished by the House for yelling "you lie" during Obama's 2009 address to a joint session of Congress.The rifle component, known as a lower receiver, is being sold as the nation is trying to absorb the shock of an Arizona shooting rampage that left six people dead and Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., fighting for her life.Company president Jamin McCallum expressed sorrow for the Arizona shooting victims in an e-mail to The Free Times on Tuesday. "The only reaction I have to the Arizona shooting is sorrow for the victims and their families and a disbelief that a human being could carry out an act like this," McCallum wrote. "... The loss of life is a tragic event and we should do our best to support those who are grieving."(Posted by Catalina Camia)See photos of: Barack ObamaTags:Barack ObamaGabrielle GiffordsJoe WilsonBoehner talks democracy with leader of Georgia 05:17 PMCommentRecommendHouse Speaker John Boehner tried his hand at diplomacy today, meeting with the leader of a former Soviet bloc country.Boehner sat down with Mikheil Saakashvili, president of Georgia. The Obama administration has been trying to encourage Georgia's democratic efforts as it also tries to improve relations with Russia.Russia and Georgia clashed in 2008 over South Ossetia, a breakaway regon.Boehner said that he, Saakashvili and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairwoman Ileana R0s-Lehtinen had a "constructive conversation about the importance of ensuring Georgia's commitment to freedom and democracy is not undermined."The speaker, the top Republican in Congress, thanked the Georgian leader for committing troops to help U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan."The American people will continue to stand with others struggling for democracy over the forces of despotism," Boehner said about U.S. relations with Georgia.(Posted by Catalina Camia)Tags:John BoehnerMikheil SaakashviliEx-senator to write book about post-9/11 world  04:35 PMCommentRecommendHalf of the legislative duo known for revamping the nation's campaign finance laws is going to write a book about foreign policy since the 9/11 attacks.Democrat Russ Feingold, who was defeated for re-election in November, told a Wisconsin newspaper that his life after the U.S. Senate will include teaching law at Marquette University and writing a book about America's relationship with the rest of the world.Feingold is best known for co-authoring legislation in 2002 with Republican Sen. John McCain that reshaped the way political campaigns are financed.Feingold told The Capital Times that his course at Marquette would be divided into three parts: a look at the Senate as an institution, the relationship between the Senate and the Constitution, and the interactions between the Senate and the White House.While in the Senate, Feingold was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations, Judiciary and Intelligence committees. He said he'll draw on his experiences on all three panels to write about the United States in the post-9/11 era.(Posted by Catalina Camia)See photos of: John McCainTags:John McCainRuss FeingoldRon JohnsonAriz.

Gabrielle Giffords was shot out of concern for his and his family's safety.Anthony Miller, a GOP district chairman and former campaign aide to Sen. John McCain, told The Arizona Republic: I don't want to take a bullet for anyone."Miller, the first African American to hold the post, was recently re-elected to a one-year term as chairman of the Legislative District 20 Republicans.He told the newspaper that verbal abuse after his election and Internet postings by Tea Party supporters had him concerned for his safety.Miller resigned in an e-mail to Arizona GOP Chairman Randy Pullen just hours after Giffords was shot in the head in a Tucson shooting rampage that left six dead.Supporters of the small-government Tea Party movement had backed former congressman J.D.

Mitch Daniels: D'oh!Daniels, a Republican who is thinking about running for president, compared his neighboring state of Illinois to The Simpsons, from Fox's animated TV show."Oh, you guys are nothing if not entertaining over there," Daniels said in an interview this morning with Chicago's WLS-AM. "It's like living next door to 'The Simpsons,' you know, the dysfunctional family down the block?"Daniels was making a point about Illinois' tax increase, which is aimed at helping make up for a $15 billion budget shortfall. The Illinois Legislature has approved a 66% increase in the state's income tax rate.Daniels, a former White House budget director for President George W.

The video can now be viewed above.Our original post is here:Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin accused the news media of "blood libel" by focusing on the role of heated political rhetoric since Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in a Tucson rampage.Palin now is getting criticism from people of Jewish faith, such as the J Street Project, for use of the term "blood libel," which has at times been used by Christians to persecute Jews.Palin has been under fire for her political rhetoric and her use of cross hairs on a map of 2010 election targets -- including the district of Giffords, an Arizona Democrat. Giffords was gravely wounded in a Tucson shooting spree this weekend that left six people dead.In her first statement since expressing her concern for the victims on Saturday, Palin posted a video and lengthy message today on her Facebook page entitled "America's Enduring Strength."Palin, who is considering a bid for the White House next year, said she was "puzzled" then concerned and then finally saddened when she heard "irresponsible statements from people attempting to apportion blame for this event."The 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee continued: "Within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible.""Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own," Palin said.Palin quoted former president Ronald Reagan, who once said that Americans should reject the notion that society is to blame when laws are broken."It's time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions," she said, quoting Reagan.J Street, a political organization for Jews and supporters of Israel, criticized Palin's statement."The term 'blood libel' brings back painful echoes of a very dark time in our communal history when Jews were falsely accused of committing heinous deeds," said Jeremy Ben-Ami, J Street president. "When Governor Palin learns that many Jews are pained by and take offense at the  use of the term, we are sure that she will choose to retract her comment,  apologize and make a less inflammatory choice of words."USA TODAY's Cathy Lynn Grossman has more in the Faith & Reason blog about the meaning of "blood libel" and reaction to Palin's statement in the religious community.Rep. James Clyburn, a member of the House Democratic leadership, said Palin "just can't seem to get it."Clyburn, interviewed on the Bill Press radio show, said: "You know, Sarah Palin just can't seem to get it, on any front. I think she's an attractive person, she is articulate. But I think intellectually, she seems not to be able to understand what's going on here."Clyburn's comments were first reported by The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress.(Posted by Catalina Camia)See photos of: Sarah PalinTags:Sarah PalinGabrielle GiffordsContinue reading older posts About Catalina CamiaCatalina Camia anchors the On Politics community.
