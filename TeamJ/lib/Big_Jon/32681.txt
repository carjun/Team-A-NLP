Ergenekon (organization) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaErgenekon (organization)From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation,searchFor other uses, see Ergenekon.Ergenekon is the name given to an alleged clandestine, ultra-nationalist[1] organization in Turkey with ties to members of the country's military and security forces.[2] The group, named after Ergenekon, a mythical place located in the inaccessible valleys of the Altay Mountains, is accused of terrorism in Turkey.[3]Its agenda has variously been described as Eurasianist[4][5][6] and isolationist.[7] The defendants portray themselves as defenders of secularism, and national sovereignty. According to the indictment, the group's claim to legitimacy is that it allegedly protects national interests, which the defendants believe are incompatible with the rule of the democratically elected government of Justice and Development Party and are harmed by Turkey's alleged concessions to the West.[8][9] In Turkey, the extensions of the statethe establishmentthat are considered responsible for this are referred to as the "deep state".[10] The existence of the "deep state" was affirmed in Turkish opinion after the Susurluk scandal in 1996.[11] Alleged members have been indicted on charges of plotting to foment unrest, among other things by assassinating intellectuals, politicians, judges, military staff, and religious leaders, with the ultimate goal of toppling the incumbent government[12][13][14] in a coup that was planned to take place in 2009.[15][16] This follows allegations published in Nokta that several abortive coups with the same intent were planned a few years ago. The proximate motive behind these false flag activities is said to be to discredit the incumbent Justice and Development Party and derail Turkey's accession process to the European Union.[17][18]Turkey has already been through four "successful" military coups since democratic elections were first held in 1950. At the first coup d'tat in 1960, the junta executed the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the country, Adnan Menderes and two of his ministers. There were more coups in 1971, in 1980 and in 1997, with additional numerous attempted "un-successful" coups all through these years.Ergenekon's modus operandi has been compared to Operation Gladio's Turkish branch, the Counter-Guerrilla. It has been said that the people who constitute the "deep state" are members of, or make use of, this covert organization, which was established at the beginning of the Cold War to "contain" communism.[19][20][21] Furthermore, Ergenekon is allegedly a derivative of the Counter-Guerrilla.Over a hundred people, including several generals, party officials, and a former secretary general of the National Security Council, have been detained or questioned since July 2008.[11][22] Hearings began on 20 October 2008, and are expected to continue for over a year.[23]Commentators in the Turkish press have called Ergenekon "the case of the century".[24]Contents1 What is Ergenekon?1.1 Structure1.2 Name2 Discovery2.1 Tuncay Gney's testimony (2001)2.2 Engin Babars' testimony (2006)2.3 Grenades in mraniye (2007)2.4 Operation Cage Action Plan3 Investigation3.1 Judiciary3.2 Allegations3.2.1 Militant links3.2.2 2009 coup plan3.3 Suspects3.4 Munitions3.5 Response4 Trial hearings5 See also6 References7 External links7.1 Official7.2 Ancillary[edit] What is Ergenekon?An organization named "Ergenekon" has been talked about since the Susurluk scandal, which exposed a similar gang. However, it is said that Ergenekon has undergone serious changes since then. The first person to publicly talk about the organization was retired naval officer Erol Mtercimler, who said in 1997:[25][26]It is above the General Staff, the MT and the Prime Minister. There are generals, heads of police departments, and businessmen in this organization.Defining it as a gang is an oversimplification. What is a gang? It is the engagement of a number of people in illegal affairs. You can not define Ergenekon as a gang. It is part of a big organization. Alparslan Trke and [retired general] Turgut Sunalp were members of Ergenekon.As I have worked for the state for many years, I know that forming such an organization necessitates a big budget. It is not easy to establish such an organization as Ergenekon. First of all, it requires a great staff. It needs businessmen, and perhaps drug traffickers.Mtercimler said he heard of the original organization's existence from retired general Memduh nltrk, who was involved in the anti-communist Ziverbey interrogations following the 1971 coup.[27] Major general nltrk told Mtercimler that Ergenekon was founded with the support of the CIA and the Pentagon.[28] Mtercimler was detained during the Ergenekon investigation for questioning before being released.[25]Mtercimler and others, however, draw a distinction between the Ergenekon of today and the original one, which they equate with the Counter-Guerrilla; Operation Gladio's Turkish branch.[5][29][30] Today's Ergenekon is said to be a "splinter" off the old one.[31][32] The person whose testimony contributed most to the indictment, Tuncay Gney, described Ergenekon as a junta related to the Turkish Resistance Organization (Turkish: Trk Mukavemet Tekilat, TMT) operating in North Cyprus; the TMT was established by founding members of the Counter-Guerrilla.[33] Former North Cyprus President Rauf Denkta denied any connection of the TMT to Ergenekon.[34]Another position is that while some of the suspects may be guilty of something, there is no organization to which they are all party, and that the only thing they have in common is opposition to the AKP.[35] There are also allegations that Ergenekon's agenda is in line with the policies of the NSC, elaborated in the top-secret "Red Book" (the National Security Policy Document).[36]Mtercimler's account was also cited in the first book on the subject, Can Dndar and Celal Kazdal's Ergenekon (1997). In an article for Milliyet, Dndar compares Ergenekon with the Susurluk gang, and the Counter-Guerrilla; two other clandestine groups.[5] He says that the Susurluk gang had more funding and that its investigation had more popular support. Dndar also says that Ergenekon differs from the Counter-Guerrilla in that the former leans towards Russia, while the latter leans towards the United States. Claims of Ergenekon's Eurasian affinity are supported by the statements of the movement's chief advocate, Aleksandr Dugin, who called Ergenekon a "pro-Russian group". He said that he knew almost all of the suspects, and praised them for rallying the right and the left (i.e., the opponents of the pro-Western incumbent party, AKP) under the banner of neo-Kemalism[citation needed]. A salient manifestation of these anti-AKP efforts are the Republic Protests of 2007, under the leadership of ener Eruygur.[37] The coalition between the left and right (wherein the nominally leftist CHP gravitated to the MHP) was noted by certain observers in the Turkish press in advance of the investigation.[38]The chairman of the Susurluk commission, Mehmet Elkatm, said that the Susurluk and Ergenekon gangs are identical except in name. He said that the left is not supportive of the Ergenekon investigation because of revelations that many crimes formerly thought to have been carried out by religious fundamentalists are now claimed to be false flag operations.[39] A noted retired intelligence agent, Mahir Kaynak, says that on the contrary Ergenekon is the antithesis of Susurluk; the former is predominantly military, while the latter was a paramilitary gang that was erected in opposition to the military.[40] amil Tayyar of the newspaper Star, who has written books on Ergenekon, says that Ergenekon is not a continuation of Susurluk, but the 9 March junta of the 1971 coup.[41]The former director of the stanbul Police Department's Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crime Department (Turkish: Organize Sular ubesi) said that today's Ergenekon is a military wing of the Susurluk gang.[42]When the Russian newspaper Kommersant declared Dugin to be the brains behind Ergenekon,[4] Dugin responded that he had no part in illegal activities, but that he saw no crime in sharing their vision of Turkey's futurefree from the influence of NATO and the United States.[43]Perinek had been participating in the conferences of Dugin's Eurasia Party since 1996 (before Dugin joined). Perinek claims to be the ideologue of the party,[44] and to have influenced the Eurasia Party, rather than being under its influence.[45][edit] StructureBased on documents prepared by one of the prosecutors, an article in Sabah says that the alleged organization consists of six cells with the following personnel:[46]Secret and civil cells liaisons: Veli Kk and Muzaffer Tekin.Lobbyists: M. Zekeriya ztrk, Kemal Kerinsiz, smail Yldz, and Erkut Ersoy.NGO head: Sevgi Erenerol. Kemal Kerinsiz (assistant).Theory, Propaganda, and Disinformation Department head: Dou Perinek.Mafia structuring head: Veli Kk. Muzaffer Tekin (assistant).Underground contacts: Ali Yasak, Sami Hotan, Semih Tufan Glaltay, and Sedat Peker.Terrorist organizations heads: Veli Kk and Dou Perinek.University structuring: Kemal Yaln Alemdarolu, Emin Grses, Habib mit Sayn.Research and information gathering head: Mehmet Zekeriya ztrk.Judicial branch heads: Kemal Kerinsiz, Fuat Turgut, and Nusret Senem.Of those, the structure of only the "Theory" department has been revealed as of September 2008.[47][48]Despite the seemingly high status of Veli Kk in the organizationsome have even called him the leader[49]amil Tayyar of the Star daily says that Kk is not "even among the top ten".[50] The identity of the "number one" member has been revealed by the MT to the prosecutors, but will not be made public.[51] Some journalists have offered conflicting hints on who it might be, but do not openly name anyone due to a lack of concrete evidence. It is said that the top position is held for a six month term by an active army officer. By selecting active officers, the group maintains connections with the establishment.[52] Suspect-at-large Tuncay Gney says that the identity of the leader can be found by tracing the network's (as yet unknown) financier.[53][edit] NameTwo explanations have been put forth regarding the genesis of the organization's name, which is used by alleged members and mentioned in several of its documents.[54][55] The first is that the name derives from the Ergenekon myth; a place in Eurasia of mythological significance, esp. among nationalists (see Agartha).[56] Another hypothesis is that organization is named after retired coloneland Veli Kk's mentorNecabettin Ergenekon.[57] Ergenekon distances himself from the group, saying that his name has been tarnished by association with "terrorists". Born in 1926, Erzurum as Necabettin Baltac, he was suspected by later-assassinated state prosecutor Cevat Yurdakul as being behind a string of mysterious deaths in the 70s. Baltac had his surname changed "some time in the '60s" to avoid confusion with another person by the same name, before retiring in 1982, says Zaman.[58][59][edit] DiscoveryAlthough the investigation was officially launched in 2007, the existence of the organization was known beforehand. The files on Ergenekon were discovered after a spy called Tuncay Gney got detained in March 2001 for petty fraud. Some say the crime was a ploy to set the investigation in motion. A police search of his house turned up the six sacks of evidence on which the indictment is based.One month later, a columnist on good terms with the government, Fehmi Koru, was the first to break the news,[60] under his usual pen name, Taha Kvan.[61] His article was based on a key Ergenekon report dated 29 October 1999 and titled "Ergenekon: Analysis, Structuring, Management, and Development Project".[62][63][edit] Tuncay Gney's testimony (2001)Main article: Tuncay GneyThe person whose statements to the police in 2001 formed "the backbone of the indictment"[64] was a spy named Tuncay Gney, alias "pek". Gney is believed to be subordinate to Mehmet Eymr, formerly of the National Intelligence Organization (MT)'s Counterterrorism Department. Eymr was discharged and his department disbanded in 1997. Gney's relationship to the MT has been a matter of confusion; his boss was once a MT employee, while the MT says Gney was not (specifically, he was not a "registered informant") and that the MT considered him a suspicious person.[65][66][67][68]He had allegedly been tasked with infiltrating the gendarmerie's intelligence agency, JITEM, and Ergenekon in 1992.[69] Gney was apprehended in 2001 for issuing fake licenses and plates for luxury cars. He is still sentenced in absentia for this offense.[70] No charges have been brought against him in the frame of the Ergenekon investigation, some say as a result of a bargain struck with the authorities.[71] However, he is currently under investigation,[72] and State Prosecutor Ziya Hurit Karayurt has proposed that he be subpoenaed.[73] The court is deliberating whether to consolidate his earlier case with the Ergenekon one.[74] In addition, legal proceedings have been initiated to obtain his testimony from abroad using Interpol.[75] Prosecutor z has prepared a list of 37 questions for Gney, who says he will co-operate if the questioning is done by the Canadian police.[76]Gney has been said to conflate fact and fiction,[77][78] casting doubt over the indictment, which names him a "fugitive suspect" (Turkish: firari pheli).[79] Gney is seen as such an important figure that rival press groups have exchanged columns accusing one another of attempting to influence public opinion by questioning his credibility.[80][81][82] It is alleged that one the parties, Aydn Doan, was asked not to publish material about Ergenekon, by Veli Kk through Dou Perinek.[83] In December 2008, Gney said that a Hrriyet reporter offered him a bribe not to talk about the newspaper, one of whose senior members is allegedly in Ergenekon.[84] Hrriyet denied the allegations.[85][86][edit] Engin Babars' testimony (2006)The convicted leader of a twenty-person narcotics gang, Engin Babars, gave a 10.5 hour testimony to the police about Ergenekon on 27 September 2006. He met Ergenekon suspect Muzaffer Tekin in 2005 through a person named Gkhan Baolu, who told him that the gang had infiltrated the intelligence agency and the military, and that they had their sights on heading the police force. Baolu also proposed to induct Babars into the Kuvay Milliye Dernei. Babars says he was being groomed to carry out a disruptive act similar to Hrant Dink's assassination; he was given a Kalashnikov.[87]Babars claims credit for uncovering Ergenekon. Intelligence analysts set to work after his testimony. Other sources say that this occurred on 24 May, at the Tekirda State Prosecutor's office.[88] Babars was present as a witness in the Ergenekon trial.[edit] Grenades in mraniye (2007)The investigation officially began after the Trabzon Gendarmerie Headquarters' tip-off line received an anonymous call on 12 June 2007 saying that grenades and C-4 explosives were to be found at Gngr Sokak  2, akmak Mahallesi, mraniye (41113.69N 29710.21E / 41.0204694N 29.1195028E / 41.0204694; 29.1195028 (Site of the arms cache that started the Ergenekon investigation)Coordinates: 41113.69N 29710.21E / 41.0204694N 29.1195028E / 41.0204694; 29.1195028 (Site of the arms cache that started the Ergenekon investigation)). A search warrant was immediately obtained from the mraniye 2. Peace Penal Court. 27 hand grenades (but no C-4) were found in a nylon-covered wooden chest on the roof of a slum at the stated address. According to the indictment, the caller was evki Yiit, the father of the building's tenant, Ali Yiit. evki found the bomb-filled chest by accident and asked his son about them. Ali then asked the owner of the house, his uncle Mehmet Demirta about it. According to Yiit, Demirta responded that there was a chest with military equipment on the roof belonging to HD NCO Oktay Yldrm, and instructed him to keep quiet about it. Ali Yiit added that retired captain Muzaffer Tekin and retired NCO Mahmut ztrk, both of the special forces, once stopped by his grocery store (adjacent to the slum, and owned by Demirta) in a black Mercedes while Yldrm was present, that Yldrm left only to return with ztrk 1520 minutes later in a yellow Opel Corsa, and that his father found the bombs 34 months later. Yiit said that his father, who lives in Trabzon, might have placed the call since he was not on good terms with Demirta.[89][90]The grenades were found to bear the same serial number as those used in 14 incidents throughout the country.[91][92][93] They were disposed of two weeks after their discovery on account of their not being preservable.[94]A search of Yldrm's office in Reina[95] and Muzaffer Tekin's house revealed a secret document titled "Ergenekon Lobi" about the group's plans. The information in the documents led the authorities to revisit the Tuncay Gney case.Yldrm later denied the charges, though his fingerprints were found on the chest. During his trial, he referred to Demirta as a former subordinate soldier of his, and said that the four reports about his fingerprints contradicted one another. Yldrm also alleged that Ali Yiit failed to distinguish Tekin from ztrk when brought to Bayrampaa Prison.[96] Cross-examining Yiit, Yldrm asked him if Demirta was present when the police searched for the grenades. Yiit said "no", contradicting his earlier statement that Demirta had arrived after a phone call by the police. (Demirta said he was personally not present.)[97]At the thirteenth hearing, Ali Yiit said that he mistook someone for Muzaffer Tekin, with whom he shared a cell in Bayrampaa prison and bonded well enough to look up to as a father figure. He also stated that he had moved out of the building twenty days before they were found. After learning about the grenades, he left his job at the grocery, and became a taxi driver. He was allegedly driving by the house when the police came, and told them that the place was his so that they would not break down the door. However, his uncle Demirta did not trust Yiit and left the keys to Yiit's brother. They fetched the keys, searched the house, had Yiit confirm that the grenades had been found and that the house had not been harmed, then took him to the station to obtain his statement, described above. After being detained, Yiit says he was intimidated by Demirta, Kerinsiz, Yldrm, and his lawyer. Yldrm allegedly pressured Yiit to incriminate his father (evki) by calling him a weapons smuggler.[97][98]Demirta strongly denied having made the explanation about the origin of the chest, as alleged by Yiit. Demirta alleged that Yiit confided to him that he had only seen pictures of Tekin at the police station.[97] According to Radikal, the police threatened him with 39 years in jail if he did not blame Oktay Yldrm.[99][edit] Operation Cage Action PlanOperation Cage Action Plan is the name given to an alleged plot by radical fringes of the Turkish left-wing secular movement created in order to destabilize the governing Justice and Development Party by pitting political and religious minorities against them.[100][edit] InvestigationThe investigation was officially launched after an anonymous call in June 2007 to the Trabzon Gendarmerie turned up a chest of grenades belonging to members of the Special Forces Command (Turkish: zel Harekt Dairesi, HD). An investigation of the network of acquaintances of the suspects turned up more information and snowballed into the present situation. Members of the HD were notably implicated in the covered-up Susurluk scandal from ten years earlier.The bulk of the Ergenekon indictment was drawn from documents found in 2001 when a former National Intelligence Organization agent named Tuncay Gney got detained (his identity unknown to the police) for a minor offense. Some say this was deliberate, as he provided detailed information to the police about Ergenekon while in detention for an unrelated felony. The Istanbul police force closed the investigation by 2002 citing a lack of incriminating evidence.Another significant development was the abortive coups of 2004. When the intelligence agencies got wind of an assassination threat towards Chief of Staff Yaar Bykant and yet another coup planned for 2009 (under Bykant's successor, lker Babu), the investigation was kick-started. Around the same time, the dissolution of the incumbent Justice and Development Party was proposed.Trial hearings began on 20 October 2008. Retired public prosecutor Mete Gktrk has estimated that they will last at least one year.[23][edit] JudiciarySee also: Legal system of the Republic of TurkeyThe Istanbul Court of Assize for Organised- and Terror Crimes is handling the case, officially numbered 2007/1536 and sometimes referred to by the name of the location where a cache of weapons was found in 2007, mraniye.[101] The indictment number is 2008/623 and the base number (Turkish: esas numarasi) is 2008/968.The original three prosecutors are Zekeriya z (prosecutor-in-chief), Mehmet Ali Pekgzel and Nihat Takn.[102] The judge is Kksal engn.[103] z rides an armored Mercedes,[104] and is protected by a team of fifteen people.[105]In September 2008, suspects Muzaffer Tekin, Ergn Poyraz, Kemal Kerinsiz, Dou Perinek and Colonel Erdal Sarzeybek filed a criminal report against the prosecutors, citing conducting a biased investigation, gross misconduct and exercises not fit to a prosecutor.[106][107][108] The Minister of Justice, Mehmet Ali ahin, rejected the inquiry,[109] finding no wrongdoing.[110][111]In November 2008, the newspaper Cumhuriyet and its publisher, Yeni Gn Haber Ajans Basn ve Yaynclk A.., launched a libel suit for 100,000 Lira against the three prosecutors. One of its leading columnists, lhan Seluk, is a defendant in the Ergenekon case.[112] Two more prosecutors have been assigned to the case to ensure the trial proceeds without delay.[113][edit] AllegationsThe investigation exposed alleged links between an armed attack on the Turkish Council of State in 2006 that left a judge dead,[114] a bombing of a secularist newspaper,[114] threats and attacks against people accused of being unpatriotic and the 1996 Susurluk incident, as well as links to the plans of some groups in the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) to overthrow the present government. According to the investigation, Ergenekon had a role in the murder of Hrant Dink, a prominent journalist of Armenian descent[13][115][116] Italian priest Father Andrea Santoro in February 2006 and the brutal murders of three Christians, one a German national, killed in the province of Malatya in April 2007.[117] Furthermore, files about JTEM related the assassination of former JTEM commander Cem Ersever, killed in November 1993, to Ergenekon.[117] A former JTEM member, Abdlkadir Aygan, said that JTEM is the military wing of Ergenekon.[118]Documents seized in the investigation if authentic would show that the group planned a bomb attack in stanbul's Taksim Square, triggering chaos that would be used as a pretext for military intervention. It is also alleged that those detained were involved in provocation and agitation during the Gazi incidents of 1995, when tens of people died in clashes with the police in demonstrations after an attack at an Alevi coffeehouse in the neighborhood.[119]Recently uncovered evidence suggests that the 1993 death of General Eref Bitlis, and that of journalist Uur Mumcu may be related to Ergenekon.[120] Both Bitlis and Mumcu were investigating how Jalal Talabani, one of the Kurdish leaders of northern Iraq and, as of 2008, president of Iraq, came into possession of 100,000 firearms belonging to the Turkish Armed Forces.[121]In March, a journal allegedly written by former Naval Forces Commander retired Adm. zden rnek referred to as the "coup diaries" was included in the second indictment prepared by the prosecution.[122] rnek, former Land Forces Commander Gen. Ayta Yalman and Retired Former Air Forces Commander Gen. brahim Frtna, testified to the prosecutors in January, 2010.[123][124] These generals are mentioned in the diaries as having devised military coup plans titled Ay (Moonlight) and Sarkz (Blonde Girl) between the years 2001 and 2004 when they still served in the military.According to the Turkish daily Today's Zaman, Ergenekon was involved in assassinations of Iranian reformist leader Dariush Forouhar and his wife Parvaneh Eskandari Forouhar.[125][edit] Militant linksAccording to Zaman, there are links between Ergenekon and numerous militant organizations, such as the "Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the extreme-left Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C), the Islamist organization Hizbullah, the ultranationalist Turkish Revenge Brigades (TT), the Turkish Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army (TKKO), the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party(MLKP) and the Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), an extreme group wishing to reinstate the Islamic Caliphate".[48]Zaman quoted a senior intelligence officer, Blent Orakolu, as having said that the PKK, Dev Sol, Hezbollah, and Hizb ut-Tahrir are artificial organizations set up by the network, and that Abdullah calan himself is an Ergenekon member.[126] Zaman also writes that the former PKK leader, emdin Sakk, said in his testimony that the Ergenekon network was in close contact with the group and even co-operated with it on several occasions. According to Sakk, he was brought to Turkey by a group of men led by Mahmut Yldrm, also known as Yeil (Green)a convicted mafia leader whose name had surfaced in the report on the Susurluk scandal.[127] He is believed to have been killed shortly after the Susurluk scandal.[128]Sakk said the Ergenekon gang planned to co-operate with a number of terrorist organizations, including the PKK, to achieve its objectives. "This cooperation was realized with Dou Perinek (the leader of the Workers' Party) and several other figures. Cemil Bayk (a senior PKK leader) was also among these figures," he remarked.[129] In another Zaman article, JITEM informant Abdulkadir Aygan made a similar remark.[130]Zaman's claims have been disputed.[131] The testimony of Sakk was not released to the press, hence it is not official. PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah calan, declared before court that Sakk had killed 33 people on Ergenekon's orders.[132]calan dismissed allegations made by intelligence officer Blent Orakolu concerning himself, but he did say that a group inside the PKK, which he called the Zaza Group, had links with Ergenekon. He said that this group was led by Sait rkkaya and tried to seize control of the PKK, adding "Particularly in the Diyarbakr-Mu-Bingl triangle, they have staged intensive and bloody attacks."[133]Kurdish Democrat Ahmet Acar alleged that calan instructed the PKK-friendly Democratic Society Party (DTP) to remain silent about Ergenekon.[134]Lieutenant Mehmet Ali elebi, detained in the Ergenekon investigations, allegedly had links with the extreme Islamist group Hizb-ut Tahrir.[135] elebi was allegedly the key which made possible the arrest of five Hizb-ut-Tahrir members in September 2008.[133] Hizb-ut Tahrir refutes the allegations.[136]Responding to allegations in Taraf, DHKP/C issued a press release ridiculing claims of its connection to Ergenekon.[137][edit] 2009 coup planOne of the most persistent allegations is that the organization has been planning to execute a coup in 2009. The alleged masterminds behind this coup plot are generals Kemal Yavuz and Tuncer Kln; Yavuz co-ordinating the Ankara troops, and Kln the Istanbul troops. Both generals were detained in January 2009. The co-ordination is allegedly done through grass roots headquarters (Turkish: Karargh evleri).[138] The Turkish police said the round-up was triggered by orders Ibrahim Sahin gave to assassinate 12 Armenian leaders in Sivas.[139][edit] SuspectsMain article: List of suspects in the Ergenekon investigation86 people were indicted in July 2008, 48 of whom were detained.[114][140] Journalist Claire Berlinksi writes "Many of the accused are, if not guilty as charged, guilty of somethingIf you put all the defendants in a room together, theyd kill each other".[35]Kuddusi Okkr, detained for allegedly being the financial supplier of the Ergenekon network, died from cancer only a few days after he was released. According to his wife, Sabriye Okkr, he was in stable condition prior to his arrest on 23 June 2007. She claims that the authorities have done nothing to save her husband's life and filed a complaint to the Ministry of Justice.[141] Shortly after that the ministry opened an investigation to determine the accuracy of those claims.[142][143]High-ranking generals (Hurit Tolon and ener Eruygur), for whom a separate indictment is being prepared,[144] are for the first time being tried in a civilian court. Tolon disavows any relationship to the organization and says that he was scapegoated.[145] Retired military judge mit Karda said that the detainment of Tolon and Eruygur was done with the consent of the high command, reflecting its disowning of neonationalism (Turkish: ulusalclk).[146]A fresh wave of detentions in January 2009 netted 37 more people, including some generals, after consulting the high command, which swiftly gave permission.[147] (The Minister of Defense, Vecdi Gnl, was not consulted.[148]) One of them, Tuncer Kln, is the former secretary general of the National Security Council (formerly a military institution). Immediately before the arrests, well-connected journalist amil Tayyar speculated on whether Kln is the leader. (Tayyar is coincidentally promoting his new book on Ergenekon, Kta Dur.)[149][150][151] Twelve of the arrests took place in Sivas, where weapons were also found. According to Zaman, the Sivas raid is connected to numerous plots mentioned in the indictment.[152] Police chief brahim ahin allegedly made phone calls to order the attack.[153][154] Two of the twelve were released the next day.[155] A map indicating the location of arms caches was found on detainee brahim ahin; the former chief of the police force's Special Operations Department (Turkish: zel Harekat Dairesi). Excavations are underway; numerous weapons have been found.[156] This wave was particularly divisive, as it included numerous senior military officials. There is a concern that the move was politically motivated, and will affect the direction of the investigation.[157]Most suspects face at least ten years in prison. The suspected ringleaders, Dou Perinek, Mehmet Fikri Karada, Veli Kk, lhan Seluk and Muzaffer Tekin will be held responsible for criminal acts perpetrated by subordinates, and receive life sentences.[158][edit] MunitionsA common objection raised by detractors of the investigation is that the group does not have the wherewithal to carry out large-scale militant acts. This section aims to clarify what is known about the munitions presented as evidence. This is also of relevance to linking acts allegedly carried out by the organization, as it has been alleged that weapons of the same type and serial number were found in several locations. Debate has focused in particular on the grenades, which can be uniquely identified by the fuse type (Turkish: fnye grubu) and batch number (Turkish: kafile numaras).[159]According to police officials, "HGR DM 41" indicates German origin, SPLITTER denotes a fragmentation grenade, "COMP-B" means composition B, "LOS" indicates European production up to NATO standards, while the number following "FMP" indicates the batch.[160]Akhisar and EypOne of the two grenades recovered in Akhisar, Manisa had the serial number HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 24. Another grenade from Eyp, stanbul had the serial number HGR DM 41 COMP-B LOS FMR-24.[160]Urla, zmir (1999)One of the ten grenades had the serial number HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 16.[160]emdinli (2005)Two grenades used in the emdinli incident on 9 November 2005 were found to bear the serial number HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 134.[161]Cumhuriyet (2006)Alparslan bombed the offices of the newspaper Cumhuriyet in May 2006. The grenades did not go off in his first two attempts; he succeeded on his third. The NATO standard, Makine ve Kimya Endstrisi Kurumu (MKE) model 44 grenades had the following serial numbers:[159]TAPA M 204 A 2/KF-MKE-91 12-77 (5 May 2006)TAPA M 204 A 2/KF-MKE-173 9-85 (10 May 2006)TAPA M 204 A 2/KF-MKE-91 12-77 (11 May 2006)The part before the slash denotes the fuse type, while the part after it denotes the batch number. For example, the batch number of the first entry means 'batch 91, December 1977'. The army bought 8800 such grenades from the MKE in 1978.[94]mraniye, stanbul (12 June 2007)The serial numbers of some of the 27 grenades found in mraniye are:[161]HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 16HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 24HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 22TAPA M 204 A2/KF-MKE-169 5-85[159]These grenades are registered to the Hasdal barracks in Istanbul.[162]Fikret Emek (26 June 2007)The recovered materiel included 11kg of C-3, a telescopic rifle, a Kalashnikov, a shotgun, M-16 shells, 12 grenades (10 from the MKE), smoke bombs, 12 210g TNT setups, 6 500g TNT moulds, a 1.5kg TNT mould, a 1kg demolition block, ignition munitions. This is sufficient to flatten a twelve-floor reinforced concrete structure, with each floor over 400 m2.[163] The grenades have serial number TAPA M204 A2/KF-MKE-91 12-77, matching the ones from the Cumhuriyet attack.[104][159]Trabzon (13 December 2008)With the help of a tip-off on 3 December 2008,[164] the Trabzon police found nine grenades of the same batch number as those in mraniye. In nearby Yomra, the police seized a gun and eight 7.65mm bullets for it, a Kalashnikov rifle and three chargers, a total of 420 7.62mm Kalashnikov bullets and a grenade. In the city, eight grenades were found; seven hidden inside a washing machine, and another in an oven. Trabzon governor Nuri Okutan said that none of the suspects were public officials or members of the military.[165] The serial numbers of the Trabzon grenades are:[161]HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 143HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 197HGR DM 41 SPLITTER COMP-B LOS FMP 125The grenades in mraniye had also been found following a tip-off in Trabzon. However, the former tip-off was to the gendarmerie rather than the police.[164]Mustafa Dnmez (7 January 2009)22 grenades, over 100 bullets, 1 Kalashnikov, and 4 pistols were found in Dnmez's vacation house in Sakarya.[104]brahim ahin (7 January 2009)Three drawings and 9 unlicensed Glock pistols were found in the home of special forces police chief brahim ahin. The drawings led to the excavation of 8000 bullets (mostly Uzi), 2 light-weight anti-tank weapons, 1kg of plastic explosives, 10 hand grenades whose serial numbers had been removed and 10 smoke bombs. The recovered weapons were determined to be buried in July 2008 (the month generals Eruygur and Tolon were detained). They are reported to be different from the ones that were entrusted to ahin's department and went missing after Susurluk scandal.[166][edit] ResponseMany people have criticized the manner in which the Ergenekon investigation is being conducted, citing in particular the length of the indictment,[167] wiretapping in breach of privacy laws,[168][169] illegal collection of evidence,[170] and political motivations.[131][171] The media's coverage of the investigation has also been criticizedfor bombarding readers with speculations,[172] and releasing misinformation outright.[173][174]Some have said that the investigation is intended to clamp down on the incumbent party's secular opposition, pointing to the coincident timing of the dissolution case against the AKP and the Ergenekon probe.[175] Superficially, the chronology surrounding the two events would seem to suggest otherwise, as the AKP dissolution case was started on 14 March 2008,[176] whereas the bombs in mraniye which exposed the network were discovered nine months earlier, on 13 June 2007.[177] However, the National Intelligence Organization (MT) had presented a diagram of the network to prime minister Erdogan and the chief of staff in 2003well before the investigation.[178] Furthermore, the government had the Ergenekon files since 2001.[179] Ankara University's Baskn Oran sees such reactions as indicative of the left's inability to accurately assess the situation, and says that the state is simply purging itself of undemocratic elements.[180] Murat Belge of Istanbul Bilgi University thinks there is a connection between the dissolution case against the AKP and the Ergenekon investigation, and says the Minister of Culture and Tourism Erturul Gnay admits as much.[181] Belge was tortured in 1972 by Veli Kk at the infamous Ziverbey villa; a Counter-Guerrilla intimidation operation.[17]Former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Mark Parris, said that one of the most important actors in the current crisis in Turkey are the unknown third forces behind the Ergenekon probe that may be acting on behalf of the prime minister, or that the prime minister may or may not know about. The alleged unknown forces, organized in the Police Intelligence department and has prosecutors, seem to be united against the front that want to topple Erdogan and are determined to stop them.[182][183]In August 2008, 300 intellectuals from Turkey declared their support for the investigation and called upon all civil and military institutions to deepen the investigation in order to reveal the rest of the people tied to Ergenekon.[184]In September 2008, the Justice and Development Party became mired in a corruption scandal related to the Deniz Feneri ("Lighthouse") charity based in Germany. The Doan Media Group, in particular, jumped on the scandal, leading to a public feud between its owner, Aydn Doan, and the prime minister, Erdoan.[185] The former chief of the MT's defunct Counter-Terrorism Department, Mehmet Eymr, described the affair as a retaliation by Ergenekon.[186][187][edit] Trial hearingsFor high security reasons, the suspects were detained in the newly built prison complex in Silivri. Since the courtroom inside the prison campus was not big enough to accommodate the trial hearings, the prison's sports hall was converted into a maxi courtroom.The trials were held up when some of the suspects' lawyers exercised their right to have the indictmentall 2,455 pages of itread out loud.[188] Most of the time from the third hearing on 27 October to the eleventh on 10 November was devoted to reading it.[189]In a separate trial, the ili Second Criminal Court concluded that the organization does not exist and sentenced author Zihni akr to 18 months in prison for "violating the secrecy of an ongoing legal investigation"[190] and chided him libeling the Turkish Armed Forces.[191] The judge who penned the verdict, Hakk Yalnkaya, was shown to have a suspicious relationship with Kemal Kerinsiz, according to a phone conversation from December 2007, recorded under warrant. Yalnkaya was one of the judges on the case of Hrant Dink; a person Kerinsiz was particularly critical of.[192]Suspect Ali Yiit, whose uncle owned the house in mraniye, testified at the thirteenth hearing that the bombs in the house belonged to Oktay Yldrm.[193]At the twenty third hearing, defendants Mehmet Zekeriya ztrk and Vatan Blkbaolu were questioned about their alleged possession of pornography. ztrk said the laptop in which the images were found was not his. Blkbaolu said the images attributed to him may have been planted by the police.[194] Fikret Emek, who retired from the Special Forces Command (Turkish: zel Kuvvetler Komutanl) in 2004, was questioned about explosives and guns he had allegedly captured from the PKK and entrusted to his mother in Eskiehir. Emek said that the weapons were with his mother for fifteen years, and no longer functional. The TNT was allegedly from 1950, and the grenades from 197778 and 1984. Judge Kksal engn questioned Emek over why he did not turn over the capture weapons to the military, and Emek condeded that he had made a mistake.[163]At the twenty sixth hearing on December 15, Veli Kk's lawyer, his daughter Zeynep, pointed out discrepancies between statements attributed to his father mentioned in different parts of the indictment and its annexes.[195] The lawyer also pointed out contradictions in the statements of Osman Yldrm (convicted of bombing Cumhuriyet).[196] Veli Kk said he was bewildered that the "state" had framed him. Former JITEM operative Abdlkadir Aygan and Susurluk Commission member Fikri Salar both interpreted this as a message from Kk to his peers in the deep state ("the Establishment") that he would confess unless they soon come to his rescue.[197][198][edit] See also"Sledgehammer" plotCoup diaryOperation Cage Action Plan[edit] References^ State connections to murder of journalist Hrant Dink being ignored, warns BIANET, IPS Communication Foundation (BIANET), 2008^ Acar, Erkan (2008-09-06).
