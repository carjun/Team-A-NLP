And it's just a coincidence that every time someone goes off and kills a guard at the Holocaust museum, or shoots up a bunch of cops, or murders someone in a church, it's a right-winger. I'm sure George Tiller would affirm that it's just a coincidence, even though nobody's tried to knife Randall Terry. I bet all those folks who got killed at the Unitarian Church in Tennessee, or the builders of the mosque in Tennessee that had an arson attack, would agree. And so would the Democratic officials and "liberal media" figures targeted by the anthrax terrorist in 2001. The black Congressman who was spit on and slurred by the Teabaggers during HCR? The rocks through the windows of the Monroe County Democratic Committee headquarters, less than an hour drive from my house? Coincidence. The guy who flew an airplane into the IRS building? Accident. The vandalism of Louise Slaughter's office? The liberal activist who got curb-stomped by Tea Partiers? No big deal. It must be, if as people say, "both sides do it," because I haven't heard one single instance of some disgruntled MoveOn member trying to shank John Boehner, or an activist driving their Prius straight through a crowd of Tea Partiers trying to run them down. From Glenn Beck's follower wanting to wipe out the Tides Center, to the would-be assassination of Representative Giffords, from mail-bombs to Janet Napolitano to the guy in Pittsburgh who murdered three cops with a shotgun because he hated Obama, every single case of domestic political violence in recent years has come from the extreme right, directed either at the left, people thought to be on the left, or mainstream America. You cannot find one single Republican congressperson who has been letterbombed, or powder-mailed, or shot at, because it hasn't happened. So don't tell me that it's a universal problem. Don't give me false equivalences. Don't try to tell me I'm paranoid when I say that the people controlling the right wing want to encourage violence, or that our people need to protect ourselves. A few months ago, I became part of a fairly high profile effort to support the Park 51 mosque project in New York City. Since that day, my 12 gauge shotgun and about two dozen shells for it have never been far from my bed when I go to sleep, because I am acutely aware that the level of hate, bigotry, and violence that the right wing is intent on inflaming towards liberals doesn't have an "off" button, and that this sort of fringe extremism can spiral out of control quickly. It's this sort of witch's brew of xenophobia, hatred, and desire for control that brought the Brownshirts to Germany, or the genocide to Rwanda. Political violence isn't exclusively an "over there" problem--we've been lucky enough to have a civil, nonviolent political process for the last hundred years.So don't tell me "it can't happen here." Because it already has.

It isn't a problem on both sides.  I may call Palin the 'c' word here (no one else gets that particular distinction), but I'm not going to fucking shoot her.  Liberals tend to have more self awareness and understand ethics more than right wingers.  We get frustrated, but tend to be satisfied with the fact that we are more intelligent (and smarmily so) than the neanderthals who tend to flock to the right wing.  I mean, we don't give a shit about a mansion in the sky or a crown of jewels for simply treating people the way we'd like to be treated.

Wanting a gold standard is more common among people on the right, but some on the left favor a gold standard.  I doubt that anyone on the left would would care enough about the Fed or the gold standard to resort to violence.The real difference at this time between the left and the right in our country is the extent of the patience with the slow process of change in the system.  Everybody wants change.  We don't agree on what kind of change we should have.  That is a matter of course.But we on the left, although impatient for the changes we want, and although quick to gripe and fuss and argue and needle each other about the issues, really don't threaten, or even talk or think about using force to get change.  The most violence you will get out of people on the left is a peaceful march.On the right, however, some individuals carry guns to political rallies.  They wear tee-shirts with violent slogans (sometimes in gest), they use a lot of violent metaphors and slurs.  Rarely if ever do you see that kind of post on DU or by liberals on any websites.

That's right, they think that peace activists are a threat, but somehow the right-wing, gun-toting religion inspired nuts who really do attack and assassinate people every few years aren't on their most-wanted list.  They aren't rounding up the right to lifers, the militia secessionists, the tea-baggers who loaded weapons to political events with printed threats announcing the intention to use them "next time," et al.  They think vegans are a threat.  They think liberals who want free speech are a threat.  They think advocates for the poor are a threat.  The government is happy to spy on, infiltrate, and try to disrupt any lefty activist group because trying to help people is seen as terrorist.  But these people who openly talk about wanting to hunt and kill people on the left, they aren't seen as terrorists, and even when they do hurt and kill people, it gets minimized as just some lone wacko who went nuts.

And it was bloody. And not all that long ago.Every party has its' flaws.But this guy that tried to kill Gabby --- he's mental. I wouldn't blame him on any party.

As for the Obama reference, I'm just trying to figure out how Democrats get the blame for the LA riots, in your mind.

The riots in LA were not incited by the comments of Democratic leaders.  No Democratic leaders were inciting violence in LA.  The 1992 Los Angeles Riots, also known as the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest and Rodney King Uprising, were sparked on April 29, 1992, when a jury acquitted four white Los Angeles Police Department officers accused in the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King following a high-speed pursuit. Thousands of people in the Los Angeles area rioted over the six days following the verdict. At that time, similar, smaller riots and anti-police actions took place in other locations in the United States and Canada. Widespread looting, assault, arson and murder occurred, and property damages topped roughly US$1 billion. In all, 53 people died during the riots and thousands more were injured.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots Mayor Tom Bradley (African-American if you recall), the governor (Wilson at the time) and President George H.W. Bush along with all kinds of leaders from both parties urged calm.  The riots had nothing to do with political language.  They were simply a reaction to poverty and injustice.

There was nothing left or right about those riots.  The rioters were hungry folks tired of sleeping on the floor when others were sleeping on mattresses.  Lots of immigrants and people who felt they had been victimized by racism all their lives.  Those riots were not due to rhetoric on the left.  They were set off by the Rodney King verdicts and the reports in the mainstream news about the Rodney King verdicts.  The community leaders and political leaders on left and right tried to discourage the rioting.  Meanwhile certain elements in our police force -- led by a man who was most definitely not left-wing, sat on their hands until the riots got out of hand.I remember standing in my office in downtown LA watching the smoke from the first of the fires in the impoverished areas of South LA.  Those were pretty much race riots.  They were not in any way fostered or encouraged or incited by the rhetoric of LA politicians on the left.

The riots were triggered by massive group anger at a very visible perceived injustice, that was seen as one more in a long string of injustices.VERY different than a buildup of suggestive rhetoric that triggers an unstable person to go on a rampage.

The facts are that Ayers and that group did not target people and it was not proven that they killed anyone but a few of their own bomb makers by accident. Their purpose was to target structures and symbols representing the Viet Nam War. Of course, I don't support this action in the slightest (had to state this explicitly to not confuse certain members). But wikipedia and two minutes should be all you need to completely counter this bogus argument with facts. This leftist group did not target people.

One is for peace and theother for imperialism. They want to hold onto the "Empire" in their perverted way instead of realizing we can't and will not be ableto sustain our role as #1 anymore and they and their ilk must come to terms with this so we get past the mindset that led to thistragedy in AZ.However I feel we have let them get to the point of no return and control our destiny now which is why you see more and more of thisplayed out in this nation. We allow criminals to go free when they lay waste to our land (BP) and when we lose our homes.

Courtesy of the Daily Kos:I want people in Minnesota armed and dangerous on this issue of the energy tax because we need to fight back. Thomas Jefferson told us 'having a revolution every now and then is a good thing,' and the people -- we the people -- are going to have to fight back hard if we're not going to lose our country." ~Michele Backmann "Dont retreat. Instead  reload!" ~Sarah Palin "I hope that's not where we're going, but you know if this Congress keeps going the way it is, people are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies and saying my goodness what can we do to turn this country around? I'll tell you the first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out." ~Sharon Angle ''Our nation was founded on violence. The option is on the table. I don't think that we should ever remove anything from the table as it relates to our liberties and our freedoms.'' Tea Party-backed Texas GOP congressional candidate Stephen Broden''I'm thinking about killing Michael Moore, and I'm wondering if I could kill him myself, or if I would need to hire somebody to do it. ... No, I think I could. I think he could be looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking the life out.'' Glenn Beck, May 17, 2005''My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.'' Ann Coulter ''Obama's got a health care logo that's right out of Adolf Hitler's playbook ... Adolf Hitler, like Barack Obama, also ruled by dictate.'' Rush Limbaugh, Aug. 6, 2009 ''Barack Obama ... chose to use his name Barack for a reason -- to identify, not with America -- you don't take the name Barack to identify with America. You take the name Barack to identify with what? Your heritage? The heritage, maybe, of your father in Kenya, who is a radical? Is -- really? Searching for something to give him any kind of meaning, just as he was searching later in life for religion.'' Glenn Beck ''The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel.''' Sarah Palin ''We need to execute people like (John Walker Lindh) in order to physically intimidate liberals.'' Ann Coulter''I believe we have more to fear from the potential of that bill passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country.'' Rep. Virginia Foxx ''Baby Killer!'' Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), shouting at Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI)''He has no place in any station of government and we need to realize that he is an enemy of humanity.'' Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ), on President Obama's decision to fund international family planning organizations that support legal abortion, Sept. 26, 2009''I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out: Are they pro-America or anti-America?'' Rep. Michelle Bachmann, calling for a new McCarthyism, Oct. 2008 "The exact phrase separation of Church and State came out of Adolph Hitlers mouth, thats where it comes from.

In any event, my 12 gauge is quite safely stored on a wall mount gun rack, magazine loaded, chamber empty, safety on. In that condition, it's about as safe as a firearm can be while also being available for use.

Funny thing is that when they were trying to ruin the President's chances at the WH, they ran daily endless cycles of Rev Wright saying America's "chickens are coming home to roost," yet I don't recall them falling over themselves to interview him. Nope, they decided to tell you what he was thinking, yet they give the Tea Party a platform to say all types of hateful shit, but its ok I guess because well let's be honest, they are white. They think it is amusing. The Tea Party is nothing more than the bigoted wing of the Republican Party, but the media wouldn't dare say that, but they said all kinds of shit about Wright. They didn't think he was amusing. They didn't call him a hero. They didn't even try to understand where he may have been coming from, and what period he grew up in. They never highlighted his service in the military. Hey I will never justify what he said, I am just making a point about how the media handles things today. They are a disgrace. Palin has said much more hateful things than Wright, but how come she is a hero, popular, and a contender for the WH in 2012 up until this point but Wright was labeled by the media as a "bigot?" The Tea Party has called the President every name in the book, and they are given a platform, and their rallies are covered, yet the media would never cover Wright at a rally, or lets say Louis Farrakhan. Why is that? Oh yeah, the Tea Party is white. No one who preaches hate should have a platform regardless of color. I am just pointing out how the media is complicit in the dumbing down of America instead of doing anything substantial for this country. What a disgrace. I will not and have not been giving them my viewership. I refuse to reward bad behavior." "Let's not forget George S. asking the President if "Rev Wright loves this country." A man that served his country at that. Have they ever asked Palin that? When she put her political adversaries in the crosshairs did anybody in the media ask her that?Has the media ever asked the Republian Party how they can stand at rallies with Tea Party folks comparing our President to a Nazi, and support them with their flaming rhetoric, if they "love this country?" Have they ever questioned the Republicans the way they questioned how the President could be a member of Wright's church? The answer is no. Oh no, they decried the President as racist as well, but no no no, Palin can say all the bigoted BS in the world, and the media wouldn't dare call her that. What about the fact that her husband was a member of an Alaska secessionist group? The media made sure to just ignore that little tidbit. The hypocrisy is astounding. Considering Palin has no military experience, her education doesn't compare to Wrights, and she has said just as much if not more hateful stuff than he has, by the media's standards, doesn't that make Wright qualified to be President? If he came out today saying he was running the media would foam at the mouth digging up those tapes, but not those witch doctor tapes from Palin's church, and again no mention of Todd being a member of a secessionist group. Why is that? I am sure you can understand where I am coming from and now I digress."I did not write the above, p/u from a comment at OFA.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDBoon      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:52 PMResponse to Original message100.Left wing anarchists trashing Starbucks does not equal the death of a childThe damage done by the most violent fringe element of the left does not even measure to what "mainstream" talk radio advocates day in and out.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCommie Pinko Dirtbag      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:59 PMResponse to Original message101.Kick to keep this thread above the passive-aggressive infantilic RW troll copycat.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCommie Pinko Dirtbag      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:01 PMResponse to Original message102.Kick.

Is pure conservatism itself not a genuine and real threat to the stability, survival and well-being, from birth to death, of ANY US citizen, regardless of their ideology?They do NOT need to make or have made more or less threats of violence than Democrats/progressives/liberals. There is NO need to make ANY comparisons about who is more responsible. The very core of conservatism is "personal responsibility" and to achieve their ultimate "wet dream" goal of shrinking our government to a size small enough to "drown it in a bathtub" means to me that they would need to privatize everything with the possible exceptions of the military, and the three branches of government, the latter of course, being comprised only of conservatives.They have made and will CONTINUE to make demands to drastically reduce, if not better still...ELIMINATE all forms of government support for US citizens, and instead, they expect the federal government (or what is left of it), to abandon the disabled, poor, infirm, and aged, ie...anyone who can not or never could support themselves. They firmly  believe that only family, friends, relatives, charities, churches, and prayers should serve as the only means of obtaining any assistance or help.
