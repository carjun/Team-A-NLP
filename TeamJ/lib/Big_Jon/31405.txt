The problem is determining whether a sedative used in the execution will cause Cook a little pain before he bites the dust.In November, the court refused to set an execution date for Cook because it was unclear how the state acquired the drug sodium thiopental, a sedative used to knock the inmate out before he's hit with a lethal dose of potassium chloride.

He aint tellin' us nothin'.We've spent the last two weeks trying to get Congressional candidate Jon Hulburd to respond to a few questions, to which voters might want to know the answers before heading to the voting booth. It's been two weeks and he hasn't given us one actual answer.In the past, Hulburd's campaign's been quick to get back to us -- mainly because our previous questions havefocused on his apparent campaign platform: bashing his opponent. Now that the questions have shifted from being about Ben Quayle to being about Jon Hulburd, getting a response from his campaign is like pulling teeth. Sadly, we were even snubbed -- and shot a dirty look -- by Hulburd at a press conference following his debate with Republican candidate Ben Quayle.Since Hulburd won't give us any real answers -- and because he's insisted on making morality the basis of his campaign -- we've created a list of five questions Jon Hulburd doesn't want you to ask. Check it out after the jump.

But we didn't realize just how slow it actually was until we looked at the home page of azcentral.com this afternoon and saw that the Arizona Republic is asking readers to "share your memories" to celebrate Sky Harbor International Airport's 75th anniversary.Our initial thought was "it's just an airport." After reading the article, we thought "it's still just an airport."Call us cynics, but to us airports don't hold much nostalgic value. Rather, they represent little more than sheer frustration, anxiousness, and boredom. Think about it, have you ever been in an airport and wanted to be there?

S. Securities and Exchange Commission say about Tom Horne, the Republican candidate for Arizona Attorney General?On August 20, 1973, after conducting several years of investigation into Tom Horne, the Securities and Exchange Commission came to the conclusion that "it is in the public interest to revoke the broker-dealer registration of T.C. Horne & Co., Inc. The SEC consequently ordered "that Thomas C. Horne be, and he hereby is, barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser or registered investment company." Horne didn't admit guilt but did consent to "findings of violations as alleged in SEC order and to the entry of an order barring him from association with any broker-dealer, investment adviser or registered investment company." Horne's ban from the investment industry was for life.

"Nik Richie"), knows how to milk a situation to the fullest.As painful as it is to even write this guy's name -- lending legitimacy to someone who's essentially a junior high school gossip queen -- "Richie" has thrust himself into the spotlight by outing Congressional candidate Ben Quayle's ties to his gossip site.We have no problem with that -- nor do we have a problem with Richie's Web site. Exposing Scottsdale douche bags and publishing pictures of hot chicks is something we can really get behind. However, in exposing the douchiest of the bags, Richie has become a douche bag himself (see photo after the jump) and now won't shut up about his brief brush with a somewhat-legitimate news story.

Here's some predictions about who won't get the gig:1. SATAN: Left, in photo.2. JESUS: Right, in photo.3.. BILL MONTGOMERY: Andy Thomas clone with a bit more personality than Andy (that's damning with faint praise, as they say) and an admirable military background (GulfWar vet). Ran against Terry Goddard for Attorney General a few years ago and(likeThomas beforehim) got his conservative Republican butt handed to him, despite a 150,000-plus voter registration edge. Knee-jerk law-and-order type. Will kiss Sheriff Joe and Big Dave Hendershott's white butts any chance he gets. Will run, for sure, in the November general election against whomeverthe Board of Supervisors picks as interim MCA.4. PHIL MACDONNELL: We found it almost humorous that Andy's hand-picked chief deputy submitted his application to the board Has been studiously invisible (both inside and outside the office) during Thomas' madly contentious tenure, choosing tokeep his head down at all times. If Baseline Killer defendant Mark Goudeau was a member of the Bar, he would have as much support among the five-member board as Phil -- none.5. CLEVE LYNCH: Guy does know how to prosecute a murder case. Hell, he's been doing it since Richard Nixon was about to crumble to the Watergate scandal. Juries tend to like him. But, jeez, Cleve is a much better golfer than he is a public speaker (he's actually quite good--at golf, that is). Why he put in for this thankless, if powerful, job is beyond us. We'll chalk it up to his dry sense of humor. Oh, we did learn in his application that "Cleve" is really "Edwin."6. ANDREW PACHECO: We met him during his ill-fated Republican Primary run against Andy Thomas, et al. in 2004, and liked him. He's reasonably reasonable, reasonably ambitious, and was reasonably successful as a prosecutor with both the County Attorney's and U.S. Attorney's offices before sneaking off to private practice a few years ago. So very reasonable. So what's the hitch? Doesn't seem to have the necessary political juice to pull this one off.

The story detailed his penchant for hiring family members and steering federal stimulus funds to supporters from his time on thecouncil. Faced with those allegations, and a strong response from County Manager David Smith, the agency's board of directors had placed Lingner on paid leave, and under investigation.Today, that board of directors voted unanimously to accept Lingner's resignation -- and, in exchange, to terminate its investigation into his actions.The only problem? Lingner hasn't officially resigned yet. Apparently, an agreement is circulating between the two parties, but the board is still waiting for Lingner's signature.

(Ahem, E.J. Montini loyalists.)In his ruling today, Pima County Superior Court Judge John Leonardo did not just smack down Maricopa County Andrew Thomas and his ambitions of prosecuting the case against Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox.He smacked him down, he smoked him, and then he stomped on him for good measure.Leonardo's ruling doesn't just agree with Wilcox's attorneys on every single conflict of interest that they alleged -- although it does, in fact, agree with them. And the judge didn't just dismiss the entire indictment against Wilcox, although he did that, too.No, Leonardo took it a step further. He expressly barred Thomas from hiring his celebrity D.C.-based "special prosecutors," at least in the way Thomas had hoped to.

And only her courage under fire keeps her out of the witness protection program after brazen threats from Arpaio's top goon, Chief Deputy David Hendershott.Polk's testimony raised one question and one question only: Who will file nominating papers to enter her name in the Republican primary for Attorney General in opposition to Arpaio's top enabler, Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas?

But after the cameras went away, Thomas' prosecutors focused their attentions, not on Waterworld's owners, but on the theme park's food-service and catering manager, Lessie Serrano.Serranohad hired and supervised some of the low-level employees busted inthe made-for-TV raid on June 10, 2008. (No doubt, there were illegals working at Worldworld.So stop the damned presses!)Serrano was charged with aggravated identity theft (the equivalent under Arizona law of committing manslaughter) and of hindering prosecution.

We know it's a good way to fill the paper during a slow news week and all ... but, really, they couldn't come up with anything more interesting than this? And go figure: The only remotely negative piece in the ongoing package has been a wire pickup from the Washington Post. "The decade's worst ideas" allowed the Republic to call out such odious developments as Blackberries, compassionate conservatism, and the housing bubble.But that package got us thinking. What were the worst ideas in Arizona this decade? The state's in near bankruptcy, county government isin shambles; Sheriff Joe isstill running amok. Surely, some ideas (and actors) are responsible for this state of despair.This being New Times, we're happy to call out the fuzzy logic -- and we're naming names. So here goes: our entirely subjective list of the stupidity that got us to where we are today, or maybe just irritated the hell out of us on our way down.

They also asked Leonardo to dismiss the indictment against Wilcox, citing a series of serious defects in the charges.New Times has already detailed some of these problems, which include the fact that Wilcox faces one felony count for a vote where she wasn't even present. We also explained that Arizona's conflict of interest statute, which forms the basis for 12 of the counts against her, appears not toapply to the facts in this case -- an argument that Wilcox's attorneys, Colin Campbell and Kathleen O'Meara, explain in more detail in their filing.Wilcox is the lone Democrat on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. She faces 36 felony counts, all of them stemming from her failure to disclose a series of loans from the non-profit Chicanos Por La Causa at the same time the agency received grants from the county.But, as Campbell and O'Meara explain in their filing, Wilcox wasn't even required by law to disclose the loans in question.

Federal election records show that, to date, Gordon's committee, Moving Phoenix Forward, has paid Mullany and her limited liability company $104,497 -- most of it in $8,000 monthly fees for "committee management."And, records show, that absolutely dwarfs the money that Gordon has used to support (and win influence with) members of Congress: They've received just $58,600 in contributions from the committee. The Arizona Democratic Party received an additional $10,000.

Instead, he and Sheriff Joe Arpaio (who stood next to Thomas at the lectern) offered the same vague allegations they have made for nearly a year regarding the county's planned court tower,currently under construction.In fact, the county attorney said no evidence exists that the veteran judge personally has received anything in the way of a personal financial benefit during the flap over the $347 million construction project.Arizona has a "very broad" definition of bribery, Thomas said in response to requests for specificity. Thomas seems to be alleging that the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, the county's Superior Court bench, and their "shared" outside counsel, Tom Irvine and Ed Novak of Polsinelli Shughart, are an unholy "triad" working to block his and Arpaio's legitimate investigation into the tower's construction.But today's announcement that Donahoe now faces felony charges -- when the only evidence of "wrongdoing" on the judge's partis a series of rulings that Thomas and Arpaio vehemently disagree with -- is unprecedented even in Maricopa County.

But they should have a much harder time getting those charges tostick in court.That's because this indictment is even sloppier than the one they issued against Supervisor Don Stapley last December.Wilcox is accused of voting on a series of contracts (and contract amendments) that the supervisors awarded to the local nonprofit agency Chicanos Por La Causa, or CPLC. At the same time, the indictment alleges, Wilcox had received a loan from CPLC's subsidiary, Prestamos, which offers loans to small businesses.Wilcox never reported the Prestamos loan on the personal-financial-disclosure forms she filed with the county. Nor did she abstain from voting.That's shady behavior. But a little analysis raises serious questions about whether it's actually criminal -- much less whether this set of charges will hold up under a defense attorney's scrutiny.
