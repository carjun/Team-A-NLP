Stay tuned... What is the cutest Christmas card that you received this year? Readers of this hub are about to see one of our favorites! If you are like us, the Christmas cards arrive a few at a time early in the month of December and steadily increase coming in bunches each day and then trail off later in the month with a few really late arrivals.My husband and I happily read each card and notation or Christmas letter as it arrives and stack them to be enjoyed at least one more time before discarding them.A few special Christmas cards, especially those with photos are worth keeping from year to year. I thought that you might like seeing our most favorite Merry Christmas greeting card in the nature of cute Christmas cards that made its way from a Peoria, Illinois post office to ours in Houston, Texas and then via our mail carrier into our mailbox and finally our home this year.

There is no limit beyond one's imagination as to what can be utilized to create a unique and pleasing greeting card for Christmas or any other seasonal greeting during the year.    For my cousin Tom and his wife, Judi, they have the perfect subject matter with their pet Shih Tzu doggies.Not only are they darling little dogs, but Judi has more than a passing interest.    In addition to having these friendly canines as companions and pets in their home...she also grooms their Shih Tzu and trains them and has won many ribbons and prizes in shows featuring the aspect of obedience.Besides all of that, she is pretty handy with a camera...wouldn't you agree? Shih Tzu - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaAmerican Kennel Club - Shih TzuThe Shih Tzu is a sturdy, lively, alert toy dog with long flowing double coat. Befitting his noble Chinese ancestry as a highly valued, prized companion and palace pet, the Shih Tzu is proud of bearing... Christmas card that we received this year.

"Three Blind Mice" was their winning contest entry in the Halloween contest.Judi's doggies have been dressed one year as a "Chain gang."Another time they were the "Baywatch Beach Crew" and three of them were the swimmers, one was a shark and one the lifeguard.Obviously this is a fun pass-time for my cousins and their Shih Tzu dogs also seem to enjoy the attention they get with the different pet wear that they sport.

They love their collars! Yes, they like sweaters and other clothing which keeps them warm. They like wearing boots and/or rain gear. They seem to like being dressed up in different costumes. They like a combination of the above. Nope.  My dogs wear nothing.See results without votingSweaters for dogs My mother once had a Lhasa Apso that loved wearing a sweater. In fact once he had it on his body he disliked having it removed and he fussed a bit each time we had to undress him whether it was to wash the item or because the weather was becoming too warm for him to still be wearing his sweater.We have had similar experiences with dogs that have been groomed through the years. Often they were given a new scarf to wear. They always seemed happy to be wearing them and seemed to dislike having them taken from them. If you bathe your dogs and they regularly wear a collar, they are always so happy  to be given back their collars! I guess just as we humans like certain possessions, so do our canine friends.

Unlike larger breeds who need more space to run, play and exercise, these smaller dogs can do fine with more limited exercise.They do need daily brushing and frequent grooming however.  With their sweet personalitiesShih Tzulove the attention that this brings making it easy to form a life-long bond with these little beauties and cuties.

One of her dogs, Sofie, won the rating of High in trial at the Shih Tzu National Dog Show last year. Her registered name is Trinket's I'll Go First  and she is #2 in the top 10 of her breed in the American Kennel Club Obedience ranking!This certainly attests to the dedication and effort in which she expends when working with her darling Shih Tsu babies.  Shih Tsu dogs ( just like the Lhasa Apso dogs ) have an almost baby shape when holding them.Looking into those widely spaced and rounded eyes, they are sure to charm almost any kind of dog lover.  Judi and Tom's Shih Tzu dogs would entertain and please them even if they did not have a growing assortment of ribbons and titles.But...nice to know that other people also enjoy and appreciate the work that has gone into making them the "stars" that they are! Judi alsoteaches classes atthe Peoria Obedience Training Club ( POTC ) in Pottstown, Illinois which is a part of the Peoria region. So if you wish for your furry friends to be as well behaved as Tom and Judi Gullickson's, and you live near Peoria, you might wish to enroll your family ( you and your dogs ) into some of these classes.

This takes a lot of effort to keep their coats flowing and silky.  With a total of five Shih Tzu as a part of the Gullickson family, brushing sessions with each of them would be a part of a daily routine. I wonder if they also get daily massages?  If so...can I be adopted? (Smile) Suffice it to say, these Shih Tzu Gullickson darlings are well pampered and loved!Tender Touch Dog Grooming is the name of Judi's business in Peoria. If you live in Peoria, Illinois and wish for Judi to groom your special Shih Tzu friend, they will be well tended.  Most people who are not showing their dogs choose to have them trimmed in a shorter style which is easier to be kept matt free.Her friend and the breeder of Judi's champion sired dogs, Julie Burns, also works with her. The location of Julie's breeding business is Metamora, Illinois and her website is the following: www.trinketshihtzu.com  All ready for harvest time!Source: Judi GullicksonConditions for Peoria, IL at 8:53 pm CSTCurrent Conditions:Fair, 24 FForecast:Sun - Cloudy.

Thanks for being the first to comment on this Merry Christmas greeting card with pictures of my cousin's prize winning Shih Tzu dogs.  The obedience training really pays!Peggy W4 days ago Hi dahoglund,I know...many people include or are substituting the Christmas letters for the Merry Christmas greeting card.  Rather nice to hear what has transpired over the course of the past year for those that only communicate at this time of year.  So your dogs (unlike these Shih Tzu prize winners of my cousins) don't like to be dressed.  One of ours loved wearing a sweater in the winter and those of ours that we have had groomed always seemed to enjoy wearing their scarves...but every dog is different.  Thanks for your comment.  Will check out your link.Peggy W4 days ago Hi Cheryl,Thanks for the complimentary comments on this Merry Christmas greeting card hub with pictures of my cousin's Shih Tzu prize winning dogs.
