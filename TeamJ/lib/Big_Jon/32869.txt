Gates is set to arrive in Beijing on Sunday to meet his Chinese counterpart, resuming top-level military consultations that have been all but frozen since the White House announced a $6 billion arms sale to Taiwan last Jan. 29.They want to show the U.S., show Mr. Gates, their muscle, Mr. Chang said.More.[ The New Chinese J-20 in a front view....]A Better look and anailysis from Defense Tech.. With all the hoopla about Chinas new fifth-gen fighter this week, we asked Teal Group aviation analystRichard Aboulafia for his take on how serious a threat the J-20/J-XX is to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in air-to-air combat and as a competitor on the global fast jet market.Rumor has it the J-20 is designed to take on the air superiority-focused F-22 Raptor. But remember, now that the F-22 is ending production and is banned for export sales, the F-35 will be the fifth-gen mainstay of the United States and numerous allies.Heres what Richard has to say on the matterShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Military, Politics, UpdatesAir Superiority, air superiority-focused, Analysis, Chinese J-20 Stealth Fighter, US F-22 Stealth fighter, US/F-35 FighterRead moreDSDs Roll Call AnalysisDont AskDont Tell vote in the Senate..December 19, 2010jamesb1012 commentsImage of the Dome of the United States Senate surrounded by 13 red stars[Cue:] Aaron Coplands Fanfare for the Common ManDrum roll[VO:] And now for more ofDSDs Roll Call AnalysisIf you look at or think about the map of the DA/DT vote, the geographical pattern is quite remarkable..You will not find a vote against repeal in any of the Pacific States going inland to Nevada nor in any of the Atlantic States north of South Carolina and going inland to Vermont, Ohio and West Virginia.In the Great Lakes States north of Missouri and east of the Missouri-Red River line, the only Senators to vote against repeal are Charles Grassley of Iowa and Richard Lugar of Indiana, who are matched by the other Republican Senators in this area, Mark Kirk (Ill.) and George Voinovich (Ohio).In fact, were you to draw a line from the boundary between the Carolinas and follow it along the Atlantic, Great Lakes, Canadian and Pacific boundaries all the way to the Colorado River boundary between Arizona and California, the only anti-repeal Senators youd find would be Lugar (Ind.) and the two from Idaho (Mike Crapo and Jim Risch). [This would probably differ had this been the next Congress, where Republicans will replace Byron Dorgan of N.D. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Evan Bayh of Ind. and Arlen Spector of Pa.] To look at it another way, compare the anti-repeal Senators with the 26 Senators and 3 Territorial Delegates in the Second Confederate Congress (1864-65), including Kentucky, Missouri, the Indian tribes of Oklahoma and the Confederate Arizona Territory (southern Ariz. & N.M.) but not West Virginia (except through the Senators from Virginia), Maryland or Delaware. The same area is now represented (in whole or in part not counting W.Va) by 32 U.S. Senators.From these take away both Senators from Virginia (2D), North Carolina (D & R), Arkansas (2D) and New Mexico (2D), plus one Senator each from Missouri (Claire McCaskill, D), Florida (Bill Nelson, D), and Louisiana (Mary Landrieu, D), as well as one non-voting Senator from Kentucky (Jim Bunning, R, retiring). That leaves 20.Add one Senator from Utah (the retiring Bob Bennett, R; Orrin Hatch didnt vote), both Senators from Idaho (2R), Wyoming (2R) & Kansas (2R) and one Republican Senator each from South Dakota (John Thune), Nebraska (Mike Johanns), Iowa (Grassley) & Indiana (Lugar). Thats 31.Those are the only votes against repealing Dont Ask/Dont Tell. With the exception of Richard Lugar, theyre all from the Confederacy or the inland states of the Great Plains and Mormon Belt of the Rockies.

He asks the question.What are the Dems gonna do come next month?What kinda deal could he..or the Dems get after the GOP controls the House?Obamas Tough Words for Liberals: Truth or Dare?ByNATE SILVERPresident Obama, already under scrutiny from some liberal groups for having agreed with Republicans to extend the Bush-era tax cuts across all income brackets, would seem have invited additional criticism from the left with hisunforgiving rhetoric toward them in his press conference this afternoon.In response to a question from theWall Street Journals Jonathan Weisman, Mr. Obama likened the debate over tax policy to the one that took place earlier in his term over his health care bill, which dissatisfied some liberals because it did not include a public health insurance option.Im not sure that Mr. Obamas comparison quite holds. The public option  though advocated for enthusiastically by liberal bloggers and interest groups  was by and large a boutique issue thatranked low on the priority list for most voters. And the health care bill wasquite popular among liberals by the time it eventually passed.Tax policy, on the other hand, is a little more central to the liberal worldview.At the same time, Mr. Obamas compromise with the Republicans  which has yet to pass the Congress  also contains some provisions that liberals might be pleased with, like extending unemployment benefits and reducing the rate of the payroll tax, which has a proportionately larger effect on low- and middle-income earners. The relatively poor reviews that Mr. Obama has received from some liberal groups so far underscores how his messaging on the tax cutscould become complicated along a number of dimensions.But if Mr. Obamashand was somewhat forced in acceding to a compromise with the G.O.P.  which on Saturday voted unanimously to block a Senate proposal to extend the tax cuts only at incomes below $250,000  his relatively combative attitude toward his liberal critics at his press conference today would seem to be entirely discretionary.What Mr. Obama may be banking on is not necessarily that some liberal groups wont be annoyed with him, but that they may have nowhere else to turn. Essentially, it amounts to a dareMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesAnalysis, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, The Obama Tax Deal Press ConferenceRead moreAs America Votes, Its All Over but the ShoutingRothenberg AnalysisNovember 2, 2010jamesb101No commentsFrom Stu Rothenberg..So what happened this election cycle? As voters across the country head to the polls today, here are a few thoughts. Democrats never succeeded in changing the trajectory of the election cycle that developed roughly midway through last year.Once voters decided PresidentBarack Obama and Congressional Democrats werent the answer, the election cycle was set. That doesnt mean that the size of the Republican wave was inevitable, but it does mean that all of the Democratic spin turned out to be little more than hot air.Democrats wanted to blame PresidentGeorge W. Bush and make the midterm elections a referendum on the last Republican president and the last Republican Congress. But while voters agreed that Obama inherited an economic mess from his predecessor, they saw the 2010 election as an opportunity to tell Obama how he was doing, not as a time to repeat their previous verdicts on Bush.Democrats insisted that the election was a choice, not a referendum. It certainly didnt turn out that way. When one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House, the election is always a referendum. If you arent sure about that, just ask Republican strategists about 2006 and Democratic operatives about 1994..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, UpdatesAnalysis, Democrats, Polls, Rothenberg on The 2010 Midterms, votersRead moreDaniel.2010 Midterms; A Must Read Piece: PPPs Tom Jensen outlines the Democratic Struggles in the MidwestSeptember 24, 2010jamesb1011 commentHello Dog Pound!Countless times I said the BIGGEST Struggle Democrats face in the November Election is the Midwest.Tom Jensen (Co-Host of Public Policy Polling) outlines it in a MUST READ PIECE:The Dems Bad MidwestTheres little doubt that the Midwest is the Democrats toughest region this year. If the election was today the party would almost certainly lose the Governorships it holds in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Its also more than likely at this point to lose the Senate seats it has in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Indiana, miss out on a once promising pick up opportunity in Ohio, and quite possibly lose their seat in Illinois as well. And there are too many House seats the party could lose in the region to count.The question then is: whats going on in the Midwest? Here are four of the main reasons:-Unpopular Democratic Governors.Our last Ohio poll found Ted Strickland with a 34% approval rating and 52% of voters disapproving of him.

Rod Blagojevich ensures we are stuck with the knucklehead at least through most of 2011. He wont be going to prison anytime soon for the one (of 24) counts for which he was convicted after a multimillion dollar trial. But he wont be receding into history, either, on account of a prompt decision by federal prosecutors to declare they intend to retry him for allegedly trying to sell former President Barack Obamas Senate seat to the highest bidder. Think Blagojevich I was a barnburner? What until you get a load of Blagojevich, Part Deux, the Sequel, the Revenge.I kid. There are a lot of different layers of meaning to the jurys inability to render any sort of meaningful verdict after months of trial and weeks of deliberations. The easiest and most simple explanation is that there was a holdout thwarting the will of the other 11 jurors. And, indeed, one juror evidently said Tuesday after the fact that there was aholdout who just didnt see what we all saw.If thats what happened here, U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald no doubt will see a silver lining, tinker a bit with the presentation of his case next time out, and spend a whole lot more time and attention on jury selection.Its also possible that federal prosecutors are kicking themselves right now for a lost opportunity. Did they, as Blagojevichs lawyers claim, stop their case fatally short, erroneously believing they would later supplement their case by attacking the former governors story on cross-examination? Were they so cocky about those famous wiretaps that they didnt pour it on the way they should have? Did they not sufficiently explain all those cuss words uttered by Blagojevich as he sought to wheel and deal? Were they too complicated or not complicated enough? You can be sure theyll be talking to the jurors to get a sense of what they could have done better. Same goes for Team Blagojevich. If the score here really was 11-1 against, they ought not now be potted plants.Another layer of meaning comes from the fact that this case never quite fit the typical pegs that we like to give to federal criminal cases. There was no violent crime here  so there were no grieving family members of the victim attending the trial. This was not a case of terrorism. But the defendants in the dock were not white-collar criminals, either. So who are the real victims of the crimes with which Blagojevich was charged? Who lost of a life, or a limb, or a pension, or a lifes fortune, off of Blagojevichs conduct (no matter how heinous we may feel it was)? The fact that Fitzgerald was able to convict I. Lewis Scooter Libby in similar circumstances (President George W. Bush later granted him clemency) didnt translate into a victory. Jurors, it seems, will still always give prosecutorsmore of the benefit of the doubt when there are real, tangible victims to account for.Looking for a more political layer of meaning? How about the notion that jurors in America today  like the rest of us  are so disgusted with politics and politicians, the selling of political seats, and the grotesque bargaining that we are now essentially forgiving criminal conduct as business as usual. Its easy to hear from the voice of our alleged lone holdout the following [fictitious] quote: Why is what this guy did different in tone or tenor from what a thousand hack politicians do every day in Chicago and Washington and everywhere else in America? Is it possible that routine politics have become so venal and unbecoming that we cannot distinguish it from official corruption and fraud and obstruction? And if so, how ironic that the political judgment against Blagojevich was so swift and stern compared with the still-looming legal judgmentMore..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesAnalysis, The Blago TrialRead moreThe Democrats did good last night..August 11, 2010jamesb101No commentsDaniel has been riding me unmercifully about Healthcare Bill anger, Incumbent anger, Socialism anger and anti-Obama and anger..Well maybe the ole Dog is right..There isnt really that much out thereMaybe there just isnt.Sen. Michael Bennet galloped to a surprisingly wide 9-point victory in Colorado Tuesday. APPresident Barack Obama and the Democratic Party, who have been starved for good news through much of 2010, finally received a generous helping Tuesday night.Republicans, meanwhile, were left with several new reasons to wonder whether all the favorable national trends showingin the polls are enough to overcome local candidates who are inspiring little confidence about their readiness for the general election 12 weeks from now.In each of the four states that held primaries Tuesday, the GOP either nominated or gave an overnight lead to candidates tarnished by scandal, gaffes or some other significant vulnerability.Theheadline victory belonged to Sen.Michael Bennet, the Colorado Democrat who, with extensive help from Obama and the party establishment in Washington, galloped to a surprisingly wide 9-point victory over challengerAndrew Romanoff. A former state House speaker, Romanoff once looked well-positioned to rally liberal discontent and give the White House a very visible black eye.But the party establishment showed it still has some fight, even in an anti-establishment year. And Democrats, in an assessment that many independent analysts tend to agree with, said the most favorable news for them may have come from the results on theRepublican side.The GOP nominee will beKen Buck, a county prosecutor and insurgent conservative who Democrats will try to paint as a Colorado version of Sharron Angle the Nevada Republican whose rhetorical stubbed toes and strident ideological profile have weakened GOP prospects there.TheColorado results, combined with Tuesdays returns inConnecticut,Georgia andMinnesota and other recent primaries, suggest it may be time to scrutinize a treasured 2010 story line about an angry electorate, determined to punish insiders and professional pols of all stripes, rushing to embrace ideological insurgents.Its not that this narrative is all wrong.
