Thank you Jan Brewer. Thank you John McCain. Thank you Jon Kyl. Thank you Trent Franks. Thank you Sharron Angle. Thank you Sarah Palin. You must all be so proud of yourselves today.Congresswoman Giffords' office vandalized in March 2010 during the health care "debate".Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head today. She was holding a public event in Tucson, dubbed a Congress on your Corner event to meet with her constituents. It was a routine event, nothing special, just a Congresswoman getting out in public, doing her job, talking to the people whose interests she was elected to represent in Washington. She was there to update them on the goings on in Congress, and to listen to their concerns.Reports at this point are very scattered. What is known is that a gunmanpresumably acting alonewalked into the crowd, took aim started shooting. Congresswoman Giffords was hit in the head. At least five others are confirmed dead including at least one Giffords staffer and a federal judge, with reports of 12 or more having been hit. It is speculated that due to the rapidity number of shots fired (witnesses reported 15-20 shots having been fired) that the gunman used a semi-automatic weapon for his despicable attack. The Sherriffs Department in Pima County has confirmed that the gunman used a handgun with an extended clip to carry extra ammunition.Law enforcement officials have confirmed that 22 year old Jared Laughner of Arizona has been taken into custody for the attack. He was taken to the ground and held for police by bystanders who were attending the gathering. The culprit has not been identified as of yet, and no motive has been revealed. But given the political atmosphere in Arizona, the far right wing slant of todays Arizona politics, we have a pretty good idea of his motivations.This attack on a Democratic member of Congress was inevitable. The Republican rhetoric of the 2010 election made this a foregone conclusion. Giffords office had been targeted just prior to the election, having been shot at and otherwise vandalized during a highly contentious campaign against a far right wing Tea Party candidate. Giffords won by a narrow margin. Democratic Congressman Raul Grijalva representing Southwestern Arizona, including Yuma, also saw his office shot at and vandalized shortly before the election. Shockingly, no Republican candidates in Arizona faced any similar threats.This is what the Republican Party of Sarah Palin has wrought. The constant hate peddling and fear mongering. The constant drumbeats for war and violence. The advocacy of those Second Amendment remedies to overthrow the government. The accusations of Socialism and Michelle Bachmanns anti-American rants; Glenn Becks cries that theyre deliberately trying to DESTROY this country!This is what the Tea Party has brought to American political discourse. This is what Sarah Palin has brought about with her Facebook images of liberal Congressional candidates encircled in rifle crosshairs, and her exhortations to Take them out!This is Republicanism in its most extreme, which unfortunately is becoming more the norm. It is the anti-human rights meme of Republicans and Tea Partiers (anti-gay rights, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim) and the every-man-for-himself attitude that is so pervasive among the right wingers. It is the anti-government stance that has culminated in a member of the United States Congress getting shot, and several others being killed for no reason whatsoever.Mainstream Republicans fell all over themselves to pander to the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican Party during the 2010 elections, and this is the result.Republicans may not have specifically advocated for this kind of violence. Not even Sharron Angle, who during her attempt to replace Harry Reid as a Senator from Nevada, was so fond of those Second Amendment Remedies would have explicitly advocated that individuals take it upon themselves to attempt an assassination of their elected officials which whom they disagree. At least I hope not. But the rhetoric and the language being used by todays Conservatives have served to incite this kind of hatred, this kind of desperation to subvert our system of governance.This whole gun culture that the right wing has going for it has got to take a step back and consider where theyve brought this country. When Conservatives feel compelled to flex their muscles by strapping loaded assault rifles to their backs along with loaded handguns holstered out in the open at their side, carrying them out to public political events, it was only a matter of time before someone took the next step and sent real bullets flying through the air at such an event. This is the political world we now live in.So thank you Republicans. Thank you for finally bringing about what we can all hope will be a turning point in our discourse. Thank you for yammering on and on about how citizenship should NOT be a right conferred on those born on American soil. Thank you for proving to the entire country what your reckless behavior and your narrow minded vitriol leads to. You were warned that this would happen, and you poo-pooed it. Thank you for finally proving that words matter. Thank you for showing us once and for all what your core constituency is all about. Thank you for dividing this country as it has never been divided in any of our lifetimes.Thank you, Republicans. This is the America you have created.Share|Did you find this article interesting?

I had no sooner pulled out of the underground parking area of a friends house in Oceanside, heading back home, when I heard the news of Gabrielles shooting. She was a well respected and diligent servant for people in my home state.Whats so sad for me personally, as I root for Arizona to get it together, is that Ive felt as you pointed out, that something like this was due to happen considering the political climate in these here United States and particularly in the Grand Canyon State.Now, Im anxious to find out just where this tragedy took place as I heard it was in Northwest Tucson which just happens to be my old stomping grounds.Hopefully through this madness some kind of awakening will take place and Americans will look at solving the problems of a troubled world with more reason and compassion and intelligence. Then, on the other hand, maybe well first have a snow blizzard in O.B. Im wishing for the former.ReplySarahJanuary 8, 2011 at 4:54 pmErnie, It was up in my old hood at Ina and Oracle.

I know that the civic sphere has become an extraordinarily toxic realm.   What makes that realm so frightening and appalling  is the degree to which our elected representatives  and national pundits have been willing to embrace the rhetoric of pissed off /deranged people with guns and empower those very people- with impunity.  ThinkProgress has a post today about Gifford being shot.

Gifford Shot, Several Wounded.Does reporting get any better than that?http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/jan/08/arizona-rep-giffords-shot-several-wounded/ReplyAndy CohenJanuary 8, 2011 at 7:34 pmWell, I dont want to give the UT too much creditits an AP story written by AP writers.  But at least the UT ran it.ReplyannagraceJanuary 8, 2011 at 9:19 pmAndy- my apologies.  As a reader posted elsewhere, it is hard to determine what is news and what is satire (or irony).  The U-T has done an abysmal job of reporting what is going on.  It was pretty late in the afternoon when I posted the limp, uninformative heading- from AP- that AZ rep shot and several wounded.  By that time it was clear that 18 people had been shot, including a Congresswoman who was in grave condition, and that 6 people were dead.  My post was an attempt at sarcasm.  It is 9:16pm right now and the signon article now reads AZ shooting targets US congresswoman, kills 6.  This is also from AP.Has the AP become brain dead?  Does the U-T think that no one notices?  This is abysmal news coverage.ReplyAndy CohenJanuary 8, 2011 at 9:27 pmNah.its a hard news story that everyone is struggling to get information on.  Still lots of speculation, and as hard news journalists, they can only run with what they can confirm.  The story was originally written pretty early in the day, and its been pretty fluid.  Obviously as the day has worn on we know a lot more than we did at the time it was originally published.  On a story like this they will ALWAYS be conservative with what they report, especially at the AP since the story will be published nationally.  They want to be very careful to get it right and not publish any guesswork as fact.  Thus, I have a hard time blaming the writers for being a little short on detail.ReplyAndy CohenJanuary 8, 2011 at 9:29 pmBesides, since its in Tucson, the UT surely doesnt have anybody on the ground out there, so theyre relying entirely on wire service reports.  If it had happened here in San Diego, then Id expect them to have their own reporters on the job giving us a lot more local details.ReplyrakJanuary 8, 2011 at 10:30 pmStrikes me as typical for the UT, and I guess even the new UT. Reminds me of the comparison I noted between the UT, the LA Times and the NY Times for the reporting on the shooting down of the Korean Airline flight 007 back in September of 1983. All three newspapers were lined up for sale in their street vending machines with headlines and map graphics portraying the incident. Its been a while so the details are a tad fuzzy at this point, but what I recall is that the UT essentially stated the simplest of facts (something like: Korean passenger flight shot down by Soviets) with a low detail map that showed what appeared to be a small deviation from the assigned route; the LA Times reported that the plane had strayed into Soviet airspace and showed a more detailed map which made this much more evident; and the NY Times reported that the plane had also strayed near military installations and included a map which was much more detailed, including the display of the locations of the Soviet military bases. All three reports may have been factual, but the degree of relevancy was very plainly at different levels.ReplyFrank GormlieJanuary 9, 2011 at 4:08 pmRAK, Andy, and Anna, the OB Rag was publishing more information by that time than the U-T yesterday. Andy  you keep saying it has to be confirmed, confirmed, confirmed. But thats not how mainstream media works. And its true that writers/ reporters do have bosses called editors and editors have bosses called corporate. (Did mainstream media confirm that there were WMDs in Iraq? Of course not.) We heard and read so much that was un-confirmed yesterday  and Andy and I discussed this over the phone. First, CNN was reported that Giffords was already dead  and we were about to run with that story when the hospital contradicted that  thankfully  and we had to change the headline and lede. Anyhow, the point is the failure of the U-T to be on top of a story that was occurring not that far away. Do you know how long it takes to fly from San Diego to Tucson? And a story that has far-reaching consequences for all of us.ReplyAndy CohenJanuary 9, 2011 at 6:14 pmMSNBC was reporting the same thing, citing wire services, until they had an official from the hospital on the air to set the record straight.  In an event like this, theres a big difference between broadcast media and the print media (which includes web site reporting).  Broadcast media has the luxury of reporting events in real time, with the ability to quickly correct bad information.  They were going with the best info they had available to them at the time, with updates as they were available.  In the print media, the standards are generally more stringent, particularly with the wire services (AP, Reuters, etc.).  Traditionally, in the print media you dont report anything as fact until you can confirm it through at least a second source.  Even with the internet, a printed story is much more difficult to correct, so theres a certain urgency to get the story right before you report it.  Thus, the early stories we saw from the AP tended to be a bit conservative.  The piece above is more editorial in content than reporting the facts.  This is my view of the environment we live in and it is the root cause of the attack yesterday.  I am certainly not alone in that assertion, as its been a recurring theme all over the place (with the possible exception of Fox, as theyre more culpable than anyone for building this tinderbox).  In publishing this article, I dont have to wait until the FBI or the police finish their interrogations and investigations to get official word of Loughners reasoning.  And its certainly not an unreasonable conclusion to say that by pushing the gun culture the way they have, by throwing accusations at the liberals the way they have, and by practically calling for an insurrection the way they have, that this event was a logical climax.  And Im afraid were going to see more of it, because the Tea Partiers and those of Sarah Palins ilk refuse to recognize the damage theyve done.Its likely going to get worse before it gets better; before the more rational among us begin to shun and shut out en masse the voices of hate and prejudice.ReplyannagraceJanuary 9, 2011 at 7:01 pmWhat is even more pathetic Frank is that the U-T was pulling their reports from AP.  I dont know if the U-T modified those reports but they were lame and inaccurate and stale as posted on signon.  I checked often throughout the day.   I have to assume that anyone with a computer and functioning brain is looking for everything except the local news elsewhere.ReplyJamesJanuary 8, 2011 at 5:57 pmJust another A hole acting like an A hole Fn peoples S up for no good reason. I worry for our children.ReplyIanJanuary 8, 2011 at 6:16 pmSo Andy Cohen, and the O.B. Rags initial response to the tragedy is to write rhetoric filled piece full of speculation blaming the right for the murders. All the while complaining about the level of political discourse in the country. Oh, the irony.ReplyannagraceJanuary 8, 2011 at 6:31 pmGee Ian- do you think that just tonight you can quietly go off and entertain yourself by sticking  pins in the Federal Reserve?  Tomorrow is another day and perhaps then I will be disposed to a lecture on the climate of political discourse in this country.ReplyIanJanuary 8, 2011 at 6:38 pmSure, Ill leave you and Andy alone to contrive false generalizations so that you can reinforce your hate for the hate filled opposition.ReplyannagraceJanuary 8, 2011 at 6:43 pmThank you, Ian.ReplyJonJanuary 9, 2011 at 5:43 pmasshat.ReplyFrank GormlieJanuary 8, 2011 at 6:35 pmAll of the violent rhetoric out there these days is from the extreme right. Do you disagree with that?  The sheriff of Pima County believes that Arizona has become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry. I dont think hes a leftist. Who has made that state of Arizona that way? Who is calling for violent revolution these days? Who has marches with gun-totting protesters?  Its the extreme right.ReplyannagraceJanuary 8, 2011 at 6:17 pmSo heres whats making the rounds on the right:  Jared Loughner, Alleged Shooter in Gabrielle Giffords Attack, Described by Classmate as Left-Wing Pothead  I hope there is some good fact checking going on.http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2011/01/jared_loughner_alleged_shooter.phpReplyAndy CohenJanuary 8, 2011 at 6:51 pmIf he was a left-wing pot head, then why did he shoot a DEMOCRATIC member of Congress?The Sheriff of Pima County himself has blamed the right-wing rhetoric, specifically blaming radio hosts for inflaming the bigotry and hatred.Replylane tobiasJanuary 9, 2011 at 12:17 ameveryone arguing about the shooters political pedigree is missing the point. regardless of the young mans position on various issues, and regardless of the Congresswomans past voting record, the fiery language and imagery being splashed about by potential Presidential Nominees like Sarah Palin is directly to blame for this kind of act.  Maybe the young man felt this politician wasnt living up to his own vision of a liberal; maybe he had transformed from a left wing pothead to a Tea Party supporter.  The truth is, s Libertarian attitudes and political beliefs share much in common with the Hippie/Yippie philosophies, and much less with the Conservative Right of the past.  Nonetheless, we can sit here and say But she was a Democrat  why would a leftist shoot her? and completely ignore the fact that figures like Sarah Palin appeal to people on both sides of the political spectrum.  The fact is, violent rhetoric led to the shooting. It doesnt really matter who believed what; 19 people are injured, and a well-liked Congresswoman with a reputation for reaching across the aisle to GET THINGS DONE was shot in the head. When are we going to realize there are actual repercussions for the things we say? I would never place any living persons face within an image of a cross-hair.  It supports murder, and stokes the flames of anger and violence that are completely unnecessary with an already unstable political landscape.ReplyGoatskullJanuary 8, 2011 at 10:51 pmScary times we live in.  I hope this isnt the case but I fear thi is only the beginning.ReplyMichaelJanuary 9, 2011 at 8:43 amI am the CD 8 liaison between Congresswoman Giffords and my union the National Association of Letter Carriers. The Congresswoman is a supporter of postal worker issues, but always after very careful consideration.I am also a frequent visitor of OB and I love it dearly. This article nails it for me. Talk is not cheap, but comes with responsibility. The right wing needs to step back, take off the aluminum hats, stop listening to the Fox lies, and start thinking for themselves.ReplyIanJanuary 9, 2011 at 9:24 amIt is sad that you and others here cant see the water you swim in. The political rhetoric in this article is in the same vain as Sara Palin, and Glenn Beck, but since you agree with it, you cannot see the similarities. While you are correct that the right wing needs to step back, take off the aluminum hats, stop listening to the [media] lies, and start thinking for themselves, the same also goes for the left. You all really are not that different.ReplySkepticJanuary 9, 2011 at 12:27 pmI think that considering the age of the shooter, this is least likely to be politically motivated and more along the lines of If I kill a bunch of people I will be remembered.ReplyGoatskullJanuary 9, 2011 at 1:32 pmTo a degree I sort of agree with Ian.  I am not fan of Fox news (other than for some chuckles) but I dont watch a lot of MSNBC either.  I dont listen to right wing talk radio and for the short time it was available in SD, I wasnt impressed with Air America either.  It was the same crap only from a liberal perspective.  We have become so polarized its rather comical.  I disagree with Ian in that it IS the right wing extremists who are using violent language.  Yes the left has been guilty at times, but much less often.  Either way, I REFUSE to get caught up in the polarization.  I have an equal disdain for the extreme right saying liberals hate America and the extreme left using clever little word spellings like Republikkkans.  Its beyond stupid.ReplySarahJanuary 9, 2011 at 2:52 pmI sort of agree with Goatskull sort of agreeing with IanBoth sides fan the flames of extreme rheotoric with little thought to how hot that fire can get.  We give too much airtime to extreme views and with our new ability to spout our personal opinions broadly across the internet we can, unfortunately, influence weaker minds more quickly and efficiently than ever.ReplyFrank GormlieJanuary 9, 2011 at 4:22 pmGoatskull and Sarah  please give me some examples of left-wing uses of extreme rheotoric that you have seen or heard recently either in the news or airwaves. (And I dont mean the immature uses of republicakkkan as Im talking in the media or press that many see or read or hear.)  It really is not like the two sides are equally responsible here. Sure, the left back in the Sixties and early Seventies used violence-tinged rhetoric  but youre talking 40 years ago! That was a different era. But theres been extreme right militias our there now for decades, the Minutemen, now the tea parties, not to underestimate FOX News (see? I could have said FAUX News). The left does not have militias, a mass movement, and a major TV channel, and there are not as many progressives and leftists on the radio as the right has. The near-violence has been exhibited by the extreme right in the reloads, the second amendment remedies, gun-toters at rallies and marches, the racism in the signs and slogans, the across the nation violence displayed at Democratic congressional offices during the health care debate, the right-wing and racist threats against Obama  Check out Annas list above  Bottom line: the left is not and has not in this era of American politics been any where near the extreme right and even the mainstream rights vitriol in terms of rhetoric and political conduct.What has to change is Americans acceptance of this vitriol.  And what do we do when the right does not change or accept what they have created?Replydave riceJanuary 9, 2011 at 6:24 pmI got into this same argument earlier today  sent you the pics that were used against me.  Two clearly satire, a couple that I cant source a date on but probably a few years old, though they do appear to be lefties advocating violence.  My personal opinion is still that its skewed pretty far toward right-wingers being 90% responsible (or more) for the incitement to attack other citizens you dont like.ReplyRBJanuary 9, 2011 at 4:46 pmOf course anything is possible as an explanation for destructive behavior.And it is much too early to make any assumptions and there are other possible reasons than those listed here.  There is a report of drug use and failure to get into the military.http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/loughner-unable-to-enlist-in-a.html?hpid=topnewsReplyAndy CohenJanuary 9, 2011 at 5:40 pmWithout the political environment that we currently live in (particularly in Arizona, as Sheriff Dupnik pointed out), it never would have come to this.  The guy may very well be deranged, but it was the vitriolic language and environment of bigotry and hatred that planted the seed and pushed him over the edge.  He targeted a prominent political figure for a reason.  The right wing hate machine has made the kind of language and behavior that once would have been condemned okay.  I dont know..maybe we should do nothing and watch us devolve into a second American Civil War.  Then we could divide into two countries; let the South be the bigoted cauldron of hate that wants to drag the rest of us back in time, and let the North be the more progressive nation that pulls the world further and further into the 21st century.ReplyRBJanuary 9, 2011 at 6:46 pmI am already doing something.  I reject both the far right and the far left and extremest language and hatred from both sides.  The majority of the country is in the middle.  The largest and fastest growing political identification is independent.  It would be much easier and less violent to just form an new independent party in the middle and let the Rep. and Dem. become irrelevant.Replydave riceJanuary 9, 2011 at 6:09 pmIm kind of on board with Sarahs vague support of Goats marginal support of Ian  my knee-jerk was to get pissed at the right because theyve long advocated violence against their political opponents (Lanes comment nailed it on this one), but I kind of feel like a clod after the facts started to trickle in and this guy just seems like an all-out extremist with views all over the map.  Maybe right-wing rhetoric set him off, but what I really feel like Im seeing is someone identified as needing psychiatric help that didnt get it.ReplyAndy CohenJanuary 9, 2011 at 6:17 pmAnd thats just the point:  Without the right wing rhetoric, its likely that this guy would have found another outlet instead of targeting a Democratic politician.  This is exactly what Sheriff Dupnik was getting at; that the language used by the right gives people like Loughner the justification to act.ReplyCancel reply Leave a CommentName *E-mail *WebsiteWant to be notified of follow-up comments by email?
