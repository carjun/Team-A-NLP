The organization is a monthly publication that promotes a variety of white racial positions."The group's ideology is anti government, anti immigration, anti ZOG (Zionist Occupational Government), anti Semitic," according to the memo which goes on to point out that Congressman Giffords is the first Jewish female elected to high office in Arizona. A recent posting on American Renaissance's website on January 7 begins with an article entitled: "Exit poll: Whites are Different." The site goes on to list anti-immigration articles. Investigators are also pursuing Loughner's alleged anti-Semitism.The Federal Bureau of Investigation has taken command of the investigation.Read more: http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2011/01/09/dhs-memo-s...

The cousin of alleged 9/11 hijacker Ziad al-Jarrah has been exposed as a long standing Israeli spy in yet another startling intelligence connection between the Zionist state and the attacks on New York and Washington.A New York Times report details how Ali al-Jarrah was a highly valued spy for Israel for no less than 25 years, sending reports and taking clandestine photographs of Palestinian groups and Hezbollah since 1983.According to the article, From his home in this Bekaa Valley village, Mr. Jarrah, 50, traveled often to Syria and to south Lebanon, where he photographed roads and convoys that might have been used to transport weapons to Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group, investigators say. He spoke with his handlers by satellite phone, receiving dead drops of money, cameras and listening devices. Occasionally, on the pretext of a business trip, he traveled to Belgium and Italy, received an Israeli passport, and flew to Israel, where he was debriefed at length, investigators say.To emphasize how highly regarded he was by Israel, Israeli officials even assured Jarrah that his town would be spared at the outset of the 2006 Lebanon-Israel conflict and that it was safe for him to stay at home.Federal Assistance to Recipient URBAN MOVING SYSTEMS INChttp://www.fedspending.org/faads/faads.php?&recip_id=90...

That ruling brought death threats to Roll and his family, and for a time he was given a protection detail.* 6 deaths attributed to the shooting. 19 total people hit by gunfire.* suspects mother works for the Pima County Board of Supervisors* the suspect has multiple arrests ...

We have to hold individuals responsible for their acts. No matter how warm and fuzzy we feel about tying any and every crime to loud mouths like Palin, Hannity, and Beck. The rhetoric is hot every where and on every side. If you're liberal, you're convinced the rhetoric is loudest from Fox News, tea party members, and their blogs. If you're conservative, you think it's hottest from MSNBC, liberals, and our blogs. My primary concern is that we don't trip ourselves up in this rush to tie legal speech from one person or group to the actions of another. That's a fairly broad brush.Not to mention, this guy seemed to have enough variety in his reading list to tie him to any group you could consider. Try to limit the public speech rights of far right loons, and invariably we limit our own.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopThe Wielding Truth      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:52 PMResponse to Reply #2128.He was delusional, if his writings are his, yet is was just a matter of timebefore someone off balance would act on the RW hate speech and targets put on the heads of their political enemies.He is not the only off balance person who has been promoted to attack RW enemies.

Talk doesn't cause a sane person to kill. I don't care how hot the talk. It's ridiculous and dangerous to public speech. Something I've always considered MORE important to liberals. If the best you've got to throw at me...is calling me a troll, I can take that. This is about discourse. If you don't want to discuss the issue with me, go away. I don't mind the conversation from those that do. This liberal believes in freedom. Unfortunately, freedom comes at great risk. I have said things I wish I hadn't said. When Bush was in the White House...please! Should I be blamed if after listening to me, someone else goes out and does something stupid or evil. Are we into censorship, now? I don't want anyone to freeze my speech...I don't seek to freeze anyone else's. I'm not a troll. I'm an American. I'm a democrat. I'm a liberal. It's naive to think both sides don't do it. Or, delusional. It's human nature. The other side is wrong...our side is right. We're intelligent. They're stupid, they're evil...they're (fill in the blank). Of course, both sides do it and will continue to do until people cease to exist. The signs that this kid was slipping was evident. Not in whether or not he watched Fox News. It was evident in what his friends are just now speaking on out in the open. Did you hear what his friend said...she said she just ignored his behavior, his ramblings that didn't make sense. This is no lifelong republican or democrat. He was 22 years old. She was talking about him having issues in high school. When he was in high school there was no tea party, no first black President, and he probably was not a news junkie.Why wasn't anyone able to give him the mental help he needed in high school? Why even now, does it make us feel better to blame people who have never met him, than to be adults and realize this was simply a kid with some serious mental issues that went unchecked...year after year.It never fails...after the crime, friends and family recognize the signs. Next, we'll hear from his teachers, etc...and republicans want to talk about the greatest medical system in the world. This is evidence of our failure. To reduce it to a conversation about Beck or Palin would, in my opinion, oversimplify a serious failure in our society. Not an opportunity to censor speech.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopRoccoR5955      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 09:31 PMResponse to Reply #9091.Oh, I supposeThat you believe that telling people to "Lock and load," against a candidate, or using a second amendment remedy if an election does not turn out your way is freedom of speech?  I suppose that you believe that shouting, "FIRE!" in a crowded movie theater is also free speech.  IT'S THE SAME THING.When people use terms that advocate violence, surely most sane people would take it with a huge grain of salt, however, there are kids, whose values are being formed, and when one advocates violence, you make that kid, who may be just a little off, think it's okay to go out and kill an elected official.Yes, the kid should have had mental help, but in order to stave off this kind of thing, Palin and her ilk should not have advocated violence in any way, shape or form.By stating that we are "freezing" someone's speech, you sorely miss the point.  PALIN AND OTHERS SHOULD NOT HAVE USED THAT LANGUAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE.Yes, there is too much violence in society today, but what becomes of our society when people running for office, and their lackeys advocate assassination?And YES, it's just that simple.To advocate otherwise is just being a damn troll, AFAIC!Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topstockholmer      (71 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:31 PMResponse to Reply #2176.well said  n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toplark      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 07:01 PMResponse to Reply #2187.Where is the evidence to back your claims?Seems like you are just an appeaser, citing msm bs without using any thought.

If he didn't believe in government involvement, especially programs helping people, I don't believe he was a liberal.  If he believed in small government or no government, then he's a libertarian fool or a rightwing teabagger.  Liberals believe that the government is the people, and that the government is to serve the people and by pooling our resources together, it is used to aid the people.I do not know one liberal who believes that government should be done away with or government should be "drowned in a bathtub."Of course if he was reading Icke, then I wonder if he believes there's a bunch of alien reptiles out there.  Icke is one who takes some grounded facts, then destroys it by making outlandish claims.  I believe he actually does a favor for those who actually have a lot of dirt, just by throwing in the outlandish claims.  However, if this young man believed in the gold is everything, no government then it almost sounds like he's been listening to Beck.  Also, some liberals are not the only ones who use drugs, all you got to look at is one blathering right wing talk show host.

They pick and choose according to their own thinking, however logical or emotional that may be, and what they come up with may not seem all that coherent to anybody else. Yet it is, to them.We argue about labels when there are 100,000 different sets of views out there and 4 or 5 high-level labels and perhaps a dozen arrayed on the next lower tier. The labels mask reality even though we think the labels say something Truly Meaningful. So-and-so's not a "true" whatever, he's a WINO, a whatever-in-name-only. She's not a real whatever, she's a closet corporatist/collectivist, a traitor or betrayed of the whatever cause. Labels are actually fuzzy. Calling my mother a racist would be accurate; she's also a strong supporter of Obama and her "racist" views of "Mexicans" is that they're all hard working and good people. Calling my friend George a "homophobe" overlooks his gay friends, that he believed strongly in equal rights for gays (not marriage, though), and that he believed that if Jesus was tempted like all men (and women) then Jesus also necessarily found having sex with men to be about as tempting as having sex with women--unmarried heterosexual sex was as bad as unmarried homosexual sex, but George wasn't a heterophobe. Even such relatively narrow labels mask underlying complexity. Manipulating labels is easier, though. Keeping track of 4 or 5 labels, with one assigned to any given person, is a lot easier than finding out about dozens of polyvalent views per person and keeping them all straight. We believe that the labels are really, really meaningful because we have assigned one of the labels to ourselves and need to defend the sanctity of that label. You see that kind of argument on DU (and conservative sites) all the time. "I'm a liberal, I'm a good person, so if somebody says something bad about liberals they're saying something bad about me." Talk about whole-part fallacy and the quasi-fallacy that employs shifting definitions.The guy's label doesn't matter. What matters aren't even his views, since most people with those that I've heard about don't go and gun down 6 people, wounding a dozen others. Rather than pointlessly arguing, as the RW does, over labels, what about the underlying pathology or factor(s) that made him snap and actually gun somebody down? Even calling him pathological or a loon primarily says that he's not one of my group, the necessarily non-pathological non-loons. (Ah, I see: I just don't get it. It's not because of anything "underlying," it's because he's a "teabagger," part of the dreaded subhuman tribe of uber-conservatives with no morals and no ability to think, and so we find the answer in a trite label. Deep, truly critical thinking, that, up there with the 9/11 bombers did it because they were Muslims and black murderers just do it because they're black. Labels, labels, labels, the all-determining, all-important labels. Having labeled something we now control it, have made it safe, have protected ourselves from the evil unlabeled evil. Well, a relative had his disease labeled calciphylaxis a couple of years ago and a lot of people immediately breathed a sigh of relief. The label meant control and was assumed to mean understanding and treatment when it was a feel-good substitute for understanding. But calciphylaxis has no cure, no treatment, nobody knows why it happens but we do know it is invariably painfully and brutally fatal--properly labeled or not--within a couple of years. Yes, he died over a year ago.)Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopEnthusiast      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 04:45 PMResponse to Reply #1971.End -Times liberal?

The media doesn't report the news, or the truth.  All the media does is attempt to stir people up and cause them to become anxious and paranoid so that they will continue to listen.  The reason why they do that is so they can use the total number of people (who they have duped into listening to them) to lure potential advertisers who will translate into a greater source of income for them.  Cynical, but true.  And, yes, I have even seen evidence of this over at HuffPost.  Hey, nothing wrong with that, right?  It's what is called capitalism.

Apparently Loughner's rants about conscious dreaming come directly out of Icke's stuff.Icke is the source of an elaborate conspiracy theory that recycles a lot of old anti-semitic materials but blames the Illuminati and the other usual suspects on alien lizard-people rather than Jews.He mixes these basically right-wing materials with a lot of New Age stuff -- basically a gnostic type of theory that suggests the world is a dream from which we have to awaken, Matrix-style.  That's apparently where his encouragement of lucid dreaming comes in -- I guess the idea is that if you can become aware within your dreams that you are dreaming and use that to gain control over the dream, you can do the same in waking life.Icke is apparently on good terms with some of the hard-core racists and white supremacists.  They see him as a kindred spirit, despite his New Age-y beliefs.And the one thing the high school classmate said that did ring true was that Loughner was obsessed with 2012 prophecy stuff.  That plus the numerous children's fantasies on his list of favorite books suggests that he can comfortably be placed within the occult wing of the extreme right.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopMrMickeysMom      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:56 PMResponse to Reply #3031.In mentioning Icke last night, something occurs to me... ... and so, I think of this -Do you think that this guy's interests, mixed up as they were were so extreme right fringe, this is why he is confused as extreme left?Theory:  If one travels so far out to the fringe of the right, one meets the other fringe of the left.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBlaze Diem      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:06 PMResponse to Reply #3134.Perhaps that happens in the psyhchotic minds of the unhinged..
