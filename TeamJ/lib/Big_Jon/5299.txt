The Obama administration's decision to move forward with a legal challenge to Arizona's stringent illegal immigration law will almost certainly elevate the issue on the campaign trail this fall.The Arizona measure, which was signed into law by Gov. Jan Brewer (R) in April, is a major political touchstone--of prime importance to Hispanics, the fastest growing demographic group in the country and a coveted electoral prize for both parties.Democratic strategists see the Arizona law as a key moment in the ongoing battle to win the loyalty of Hispanic voters. They believe that it will have a similar chilling effect for Republicans with Latinos as the passage of California's Proposition 187 did in the 1990s.Republicans, on the other hand, believe that Democrats are badly out of step with the American people on the immigration issue. They cite the Obama administration's aggressive approach to fighting the Arizona law is yet more evidence of that out-of-touchness.In that vein, nearly two dozen House Republicans sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder  on Tuesday describing the legal challenge as the "height of irresponsibility and arrogance."Polling on the Arizona law specifically falls in Republicans' favor, although broader data suggests a public deeply divided on immigration.In the latest Washington Post/ABC poll, 58 percent expressed support for the Arizona law -- including 42 percent who were strongly supportive -- while 41 percent opposed it.But in that same survey, which was conducted in early June, nearly six in ten (57 percent) of people supported allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the country if they paid a fine and met other citizenship requirements -- a major plank of past attempts to offer a comprehensive immigration solution.And, on the question of whether the state government should be allowed to make its own laws on immigration or whether that should be left up to the federal government, the public was deeply divided, with 46 percent choosing states and 52 percent opting for the federal government.(On that question, partisanship is a major predictor: three quarters of Democrats said that the federal government should be in charge of immigration law, while 59 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of independents said states should be free to make their own laws.)While President Obama has made something of a rhetorical push of late on immigration, party strategists believe the issue is too politically hot -- and with too little clarity on what the American people want -- for it to be taken up in an election year.The administration's lawsuit, however, ensures that the immigration debate will be front and center for the next few months -- making it a virtual certainty that for some (many?) it will be a voting issue on Nov. 2.2. Indiana Rep. Brad Ellsworth (D) is up with his first TV ad of the race for the seat of retiring Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), a 30-second spot touting his background as a sheriff but making no mention of his current occupation."One thing that 25 years as a sheriff teaches you is zero tolerance for bull," the two-term southern Indiana Congressman says in the straight-to-camera spot. "There's too much at stake. But out in Washington, it's like they live and breathe this stuff."It's the most striking example to date of Ellsworth's endeavor to run as sheriff -- he was the top cop in Vanderburgh County before being elected to Congress -- and not as a congressman. Even Ellsworth's campaign website touts him as a sheriff: it features a banner photo with the candidate standing next to a sheriff's car and the first paragraph of his bio leads with his "over two decades of experience in the local Sheriff's office," making only a passing reference his "brief time as the 8th District's Congressman."(Ellsworth is far from the only representative this cycle to leave out any mention of his current occupation. Just yesterday, Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) released a TV ad highlighting his background as a high school teacher and university president, making no mention of his years in the House Republican leadership.)National Republicans were quick to point out the omission in Ellsworth's ad. "Brad Ellsworth is right: voters have 'zero tolerance for bull.' But unfortunately, 'bull' is exactly what Ellsworth is offering Hoosiers in this hypocritical and insulting campaign advertisement," National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Brian Walsh said.3. Iowa Republicans have cut their voter registration gap in half -- a sign of not only a competitive gubernatorial GOP primary in the state last month but also the movement of the state away from Democrats in recent months.Iowa Secretary of State Mike Mauro (D) announced Tuesday that Republicans added 37,000 voters to the rolls in June, while Democrats lost 10,000 - a shift that cut in half a Democratic advantage that had stood at around 100,000 votes after the 2008 election, an election where President Barack Obama carried the Hawkeye State by 10 points.The latest GOP shift was more pronounced than other recent waves of party switchers in the state. In 2006, a competitive Democratic governor primary forced a net shift of about 25,000 voters in the party's favor, while in 2002 competitive GOP governor and Senate primaries moved 20,000 voters to Republicans.The new shift is notably bigger than its predecessors, but is likely the result of a leveling effect after the 2008 election.Iowa Democrats in Iowa increased their registration advantage from 30,000 at the start of 2008 to 110,000 after President Obama's big win. Their current 46,000-voter edge is much more in line with where party registration has been over the last decade -- returning Iowa to swing state status.  4. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty (R) will make another swing to Iowa at the end of the month, a three-day visit that will mark his third visit to the state this cycle and a continuation of his presidential ambitions.Pawlenty will kick off his trip on Saturday, July 31. He's slated to attend a breakfast event for state Rep. Steve Lukan (R) in Dubuque, followed by events for state Senate hopeful and former state Rep. Bill Dix (R) in Waverly and state House Minority Leader Kraig Paulsen (R) in Cedar Rapids.On Sunday, he attends an event with state Rep. Jeff Kaufmann (R) in West Liberty. The trip will be rounded out with an event for the Scott County Lincoln Club in Davenport on Monday morning."Governor Pawlenty is working hard to help conservatives around the country win this fall," Pawlenty spokesperson Alex Conant said. "We have great opportunities in Iowa, and Governor Pawlenty is trying to build on that excitement through his new Iowa PAC and this upcoming trip to eastern Iowa."The trip will be Pawlenty's first to the eastern part of the state, which is Iowa's strongest Democratic area. In November, he spoke at the Iowa Republican Party's annual dinner, and in April he addressed a rally for Iowans for Tax Relief; both events were held in Des Moines.Pawlenty has made no secret of the fact that he is exploring a run for president in 2012 and his regular trips to Iowa affirm that interest. Remember the old Fix adage: NO politician goes to Iowa by accident.Pawlenty leads the pack of potential 2012 Republican contenders in visits to Iowa this cycle: as of mid-June, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and South Dakota Sen. John Thune had each visited the state once since November, 2008.But Pawlenty's name ID remains low in the state: a June Des Moines Register poll showed that 53 percent of likely Republican voters in Iowa didn't know enough about the Minnesota governor to have an opinion about him.This weekend, Pawlenty makes his third visit this cycle to another key 2012 state: he's scheduled to be in New Hampshire, where he'll be headlining the Strafford County Republican Party summer picnic as well as a $250-a-couple fundraiser for the New Hampshire Republican Party.5. Fundraising reports continued to trickle in Tuesday, with Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper's (D) Colorado gubernatorial campaign going bargain-basement shopping.Hickenlooper's camp announced Tuesday that it has spent virtually all of its money on a lengthy television ad buy. It has $1.2 million in ad time reserved, but just $66,000 cash on hand. By buying time early, the Hickenlooper campaign gets the time at a lower rate.It's an unusual strategy, and one that requires a few things. First, you need to be sure your fundraising won't dry up (probably not an issue for Hickenlooper, who raised a strong $500,000 in June). And second, you need to be able to get out front and make sure the strategy isn't misinterpreted as free-spending on ads when no voters are paying attention. Sen. Mark Udall's (D-Colo.) 2008 campaign employed a similar strategy, which isn't surprising given that Udall's 2008 campaign manager, Mike Melanson, now fills that same role for Hickenlooper.In other second-quarter fundraising reports: Montgomery City Councilwoman Martha Roby (R) raised $100,000 between May 13 and June 23 in advance of her July 13 runoff with Rick Barberr-- yes, that Rick Barber-- with the winner moving on to face Alabama Rep. Bobby Bright (D)....Former New Hampshire Rep. Charlie Bass (R) raised a decent $170,000 in the second quarter and banked $360,000 for his run at Senate candidate Paul Hodes' (D) 2nd district seat.....Former Ruth's Chris Steakhouse CEO Craig Miller (R) announced he raised $270,000 and banked $322,000 over the last three months for the Aug. 24 primary to face Rep. Suzanne Kosmas (D-Fla.)....In the Democratic primary for retiring Massachusetts Rep. Bill Delahunt's (D) seat, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating outraised state Sen. Robert O'Leary $381,000 to $200,000 between April and June, according to the Cape Cod Times....Tennessee state Sen. Roy Herron (D) reported raising $350,000 and banking $1.2 million for a clear primary in retiring Rep. John Tanner's (D) district. Republicans are waging an expensive primary battle.With Felicia Sonmez and Aaron BlakeBy Chris Cillizza|                   July  7, 2010;  7:15 AM ET   Categories:Morning FixSave & Share:Previous: Tea Party = Republican party?Next: The Fix breaks 201007070715CommentsIt's always astonishing to watch the party in power forget what put them there. If one recalls the previous election, the Democrats included a rash of ads condemning Bush's "shipping jobs overseas." Not only has the outsourcing lobby quelled any mention of that issue since the Dems have controlled all three branches of government, but incredibly, the language below is their platform in the immigration bill framework. How is it that these parties forget their very ads and posturing that put them over the top in the previous election. To the outside observer, it almost seems like each party likes to figure out a way to forfeit power--strange!!!

Get everyone of them out of MY damn country, every christian, muslin, jew, anglican, catholic, etc.  Leave now, every son and daughter of the Irish, Germans, English, Dutch, Italians, Polish, French, Spanish, etc.  This place was great before you brought your guns and disease and violence.  Yes, Mr. Obama, you must leave too because this is my home and all you immigrants have spoiled, polluted and deforested my home, depleting the land and fouling the air.  We didn't INVITE you here and you are an unwelcome crowd of squatters who have murdered most of my family and virtually imprisoned the remainder. LEAVE NOW!  I ORDER YOU DEPORTED. Posted by: ep_Patriot_Vet | July  8, 2010  2:42 PM | Report abuseWhat most people don't seem to understand is that immigration is the exclusive province of the Federal Government.  The states have no jurisdiction under the Constitution. Obama has no choice, but to go after Arizona.  Otherwise, we would have fifty different immigration statures on the books, and no one would know what the law was.  The GOP is simply ignoring facts, and choosing to make hay when it can.  Obama should clamp down on the boarders, and stop illegal entry. Where was the GOP during the Bush years on this issue?  He did nothing to stop it, as the GOP contributors needed cheap labor.  Now that jobs are rare, it has become an issue the GOP will try to twist to its advantage.  Seal the borders, as terrorists could likewise slip across.  Why is it only illegal aliens that use this means of entry?Posted by: atc333 | July  8, 2010 12:57 AM | Report abuseApproximately a year ago I was beaten by police in the city of Alameda, ca. I entered a plea of not guilty after $500 for emergency services, and $1200 worth of bail.  In a preliminary hearing,officer Ryan Derespini, lied and said that I was "publicly intoxicated" (slurring my words,and etc.) despite the fact that I haven't been drunk since 1973. But Officer Kevin Horikoshi, and Ray Ortega said that I was drunk. But at a supression hearing they didn't even show up because the admitting doctor said that I wasn't drunk. they had no evidence. But they said I was mexican on the police reports, the funny thing is that I am black and fillipino. Don't give these knuckle heads any more discresionary power than the have, they already have too much.Posted by: LEOMARQUES | July  7, 2010 11:44 PM | Report abuseThe current Law problem between the Federal Government and the Stat of Arizona has nothing to do with the border closing,the immigrants or even the criminals coming into the State. All it has to do with is the current administration looking to get future votes,votes,votes,votes,votes, and votes.That is it in a nutshell. Thing about it. No action over the past 30 or so years and now a top priority.Yeah right.Posted by: joecarrsr | July  7, 2010  8:19 PM | Report abuseICE just informed our community they are no longer picking up illegals that have broken a law serious enough to land them in jail.  So in essence, ICE has no intention to do what they are suppose to do and that is to deport these felons.  Mexico cannot wait to dump their felons and poor on us.  They have opened their jails at our back door knowing our government is just too lame for explanation endangering everyone of us.  If the Feds are not doing their job and have no intention to do their job, the people of this nation should rise up in outrage.  We need to send these radicals a message in the next election.  The Feds are endangering our love ones and this is beyond comprehension.  In their deranged minds, they actually believe this will save their sorry tails.  I am steamed they would watch this nation suffer to gain politically or even think they would.Posted by: greatgran1 | July  7, 2010  7:00 PM | Report abuseThis has been one of the better threads.

THE FURTHER TRUTH - all this talk from the democrats about AMNESTY is just ENCOURAGING more illegal immigration because people are thinking they should want to get into this country under the deadline.So - Obama is making the problem WORSE, not better.SECOND on the historical context - one of the major justifications for NAFTA was to place jobs in Mexico, so people would have an incentive not to illegally migrate.Did that work ? I think not. But no one is saying to re-do NAFTA - so the Mexicans have the jobs in Mexico AND the jobs here.AT SOME POINT - Americans are going to have to face the question: WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE US UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE FACE OF ALL THESE TRADE AGREEMENTS.Should the trade agreements be re-done - so the US government makes sure all the JOBS STAY HERE.The present trade agreement situation gets set up OVER A DECADE AGO - THERE ARE NO ADJUSTMENTS - AND THE AMERICAN WORKERS DO NOT DESERVE TO BE STUCK IN A BAD SYSTEM WHICH CLINTON SET UP.Posted by: FlowersOfPeace | July  7, 2010  5:41 PM | Report abusebsimon1,The fix is simple if people would get their focus off of the physical borders - mandate E-Verify so that all jobs current and future would be checked.  40% of illegal aliens overstayed their visas.  But alas,  both political parties have no interest in any kind of serious enforcment.  But for anyone to say that stopping most illegal immigration is impossible is ludicrous.Posted by: merbc | July  7, 2010  5:40 PM | Report abuseFederal law, CFR 8 specifically allows states to enforce question, detain and arrest illegal aliens.Posted by: win1 | July 7, 2010 10:46 AM____________________________________Is this true  ???

Posted by: wggodek | July  7, 2010  5:31 PM | Report abuse"Racial Profiling" should be examined closely.Initially "racial profiling" applied and referred to blacks who were driving down a highway  -  and were pulled over for no reason.Everyone has agreed that is not right - and that police need a reason to pull someone over.However the phrase "racial profiling" has been applied to two other situations  -  WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.One is at airports  -  where people of Arab descent may be getting on airplanes.   HERE there is A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER  -  A RISK OF TERRORISM WHICH COULD KILL PEOPLE.That is totally different from stopping a car  -  At the airport, "racial profiling" should be permitted  -  and clearly SECURITY CONCERNS ARE MORE IMPORTANT.There is a REASON - SECURITY to give certain people more scrutiny.   That should pass Constitutional tests.Now - the third application of the phrase "racial profiling" - applied to find out if someone is in this country legally or not.First - if someone is in this country, born here or naturalized  -  that person SHOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY to show their license and ASSIST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.The illegals have no issue with "racial profiling"  -  because they are illegal and should be caught.The ONLY ISSUE with racial profiling is those people who are here legally  -  and are being burdered by showing their ID card.So what ?   Show it  -  they should be happy to be in this country.It is a small burden.In addition - the very nature of the offense - illegal immigration involves papers  -  it involves whether you have the right papers or not -  THE ONLY WAY TO FIND THAT OUT IS TO LOOK AT PAPERS.REASON  -  The reason so many people support this is there is 500,000 illegal aliens in Arizona alone  -  that is the reason.The reason is there is AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR TO THE TUNE OF 500,000 PEOPLE.That is the REASON.it should pass the Constitutional test..Posted by: FlowersOfPeace | July  7, 2010  5:15 PM | Report abuseOf course, we could just line up a bunch of soldiers and/or border patrol agents from the pacific to the atlantic on both borders, hands-across-america style. That would put a dent in the ol' unemployment rate too. Posted by: bsimon1 _____I think a workable fence from the Pacific to the Gulf would be okay for now.  And who's done it before how about Israel. Remember when there was bombs going off in cofee shops and buses well Israel had enough and build a fence between their country and the West bank.  The world community was against it but it worked..  Terror bombings pretty much stopped. "Israeli statistics indicate that the barrier has substantially reduced the number of Palestinian infiltrations and suicide bombings and other attacks on civilians in Israel and in Israeli settlements, and Israeli officials assert that completion of the barrier will make it even more effective in stopping these attacks. "An absolute halt in terrorist activities has been noticed in the West Bank areas where the fence has been constructed"." Now yeah we have a longer border but if Israel can build a fense 436 miles long that works seems to me we can build one along our southern border... Posted by: sovine08 | July  7, 2010  4:47 PM | Report abuseIf AZ has an immigration problem, work with the feds to enforce the existing law. The problem is not the lack of a law, the problem is the lack of enforcement.Posted by: bsimon1_____And we have come full circle...  yes that's the problem. The Feds do not enforce the law!!! You claim they do in MN well I don't know if they do or don't.. but they aren't doing in it Arizona. The Feds don't control the border and they don't enforce immigration law.  So Arizona said fine we will.  Feds do write immigration law but if they refuse to enforce can states do it? That is the legal issue..  a court will decide. Meanwhile I still say it's cynical for Democrats to oppose Arizona enforcing the law because it will hurt their re-election chances...    Posted by: sovine08 | July  7, 2010  4:30 PM | Report abuseThe SPLC!? It has been so thoroughly discredited that I'm surprised that anybody even mentions it.Back in 1973, I was sent a letter by the SPLC (actually Julian Bond was the "sender" on their behalf), asking me to become a retainer supporter and send in a monthly contribution that would be used to help blacks secure their civil rights. I believe that blacks should have the same rights as anybody else; and at that time, I think we can say that they were having an uphill struggle for education,  fair housing, employment, etc. It seemed like a good idea.Over the years, it seemed that the SPLC did less and less civil rights work and more and more "Teaching Tolerance" and  monitoring "hate groups". I continued to contribute even as I wondered whether my money was going to fluff. At the time most of their "hate groups" were usually associated with militias, some of which actually did commit violent acts, with the usual KKK, WCC, etc. thrown in. I was well aware that the KKK was about as much threat as Ducks Unlimited but I still figured that my relatively small monthly contribution was being used in a manner I could sanction. I did notice, however, that they began to slide very close to calling anybody who disagreed with them on any issue, such as affirmative action, some form of bigot.My break with the SPLC came when I received in the mail their publication that basically equated with the KKK anybody who believed that the immigration-driven out-of-control population growth in the USA was a bad thing. As a long-time environmentalist, I had long since come to the conclusion that massive immigration was a bad thing for the US and started advocating for the US to enforce our immigration laws and restrict legal immigration. I wrote the SPLC a letter noting why I no longer would contribute to them and haven't since then. Over the years, I had contributed quite a bit of money, albeit in small contributions.I have come to the conclusion that the SPLC concluded that the oppression of black people was not exactly a growing enterprise and so they needed a new cause. They made immigration and hate-crimes/hate-speech that new cause. Illegal immigration was growing and people were beginning to notice. If the SPLC could equate opposition to this to denying blacks their civil rights, they could be in business for years to come. If they could criminalize - or try to criminalize - criticism of a lack of enforcement of immigration laws or of replacing citizen workers with cheap foreign labor, better still. Best yet, they wouldn't have to spend any of those millions that they were raking in on court cases. They could simply slime and run, which is cheap in every sense of the word.It is odd that in boosting immigration, the SPLC is now actually harming blacks - the very group that they were started to assist. Massive third-world immigration is the new Jim Crow as the biz interests hire immigrants, legal and illegal, over black workers.

It is a muddy opinion, with language like this surplusage:"Unlike most of the classifications that we have recognized as suspect, entry into this class, by virtue of entry into this country, is the product of voluntary action. Indeed, entry into the class is itself a crime. ... With respect to the actions of the Federal Government, alienage classifications may be intimately related to the conduct of foreign policy, to the federal prerogative to control access to the United States, and to the plenary federal power to determine who has sufficiently manifested his allegiance to become a citizen of the Nation. No State may independently exercise a like power."  It is, in fact, the four Justice dissent that I recalled most clearly without having re-read it.  The dissent noted that "Rodriguez" was being implicitly overruled."Appellees "lack control" over their illegal residence in this country in the same sense as lawfully resident children lack control over the school district in which their parents reside. Yet in San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), we declined to review under "heightened scrutiny" a claim that a State discriminated against residents of less wealthy school districts in its provision of educational benefits. There was no suggestion in that case that a child's "lack of responsibility" for his residence in a particular school district had any relevance to the proper standard of review of his claims. The result was that children lawfully here but residing in different counties received different treatment." The dissent also contains the quotation offered by win1, earlier.  The 'conversation" in TX about differential tuition came after the case and was inspired by Powell's concurrence.The case was decided 5-4, with four different opinions in the majority of five.The opinion of the court, authored by J. Brennan, created a new class of protection limited to public education by declaring that it is not a right but it is greater than a mere benefit.  It is a defective opinion and it skirts the entire sovereignty issue.Again, I regret having misreported from memory.  Please accept my apology. Posted by: mark_in_austin | July  7, 2010  3:13 PM | Report abuseThe issue is a slam-dunk for those who oppose illegal immigration -- it's always amazed me that neither Party seemed to grasp this, making this an additional nightmare for the Democrats in November. What had already looked like a defeat is turning into a potential massacre. The reason lies in the bogus data you report about "57% of Americans supporting an earned pathway to citizenship."  That finding is the result of push polls that give respondents only one other option: mass deportation.  Under those circumstances, Americans -- who hate amnesty -- grudgingly choose it rather than "mass deportation" that evokes imagery of Nazism.  But it is a faulty dilemma: "mass deportation" is a chimera. When given the choice of ATTRITION -- which Arizona's SB1070 exemplifies -- incremental self-deportation by the illegal population caused by strict border control and internal tough application of immigration laws, HUGE majorities of Americans select it every time pollsters offer it RATHER THAN AMNESTY.  (See polls by Zogby and Rasmussen.)  Members of Congress who delude themselves into buying that data from push polls will shortly find themselves looking for work. By the bye, members of Congress know the real story.  Back in 2007, every member of the Senate from both Parties that switched votes and voted against cloture on debate over the last "comprehensive immigration reform bill" (S.1639) was up for re-election in 2008. If it indeed finally emerges as a major national issue, immigration will give the Republicans a huge political edge.Posted by: svetistephen | July  7, 2010  3:12 PM | Report abusesmoses3 writes"They are trying to tell us that the greatest country on this planet, the U.S. cannot deal with closing and protecting our borders, but 3rd world countrys don't seem to have a problem controlling thiers?"Like, which 3rd world countries?

Arizona's law only allow the law officers to check WITH THE FEDS if they have reason to believe the suspect is illegal.

Long before President Obama came to power the federal government has rigorously refused to enforce our immigration laws since 1986. However, it is only in the last 25 years that America has been under assault by a foreign force of illegal workers and families.The US Constitution text of Article IV, Section 4:The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on Application of the Legislature.But we have been invaded by 20 to 30 million foreign nationals, not the numbers of 12 million that has been as stated continuously by the overwhelming Liberal press. According to FAIR, Illegal Immigration expenditures are a $113 Billion annual Drain on U.S. Taxpayers.This new study released today by FAIR is the most comprehensive analysis of how much the estimated millions of illegal aliens and their U.S.-born children costs federal, state and local governments. Just think how much this huge amount of money would go towards cutting the U.S. deficitthat has climbed to 13 trillion dollars? You can read the report at (FAIR) Federation for American Immigration Reform. An extra $60 billion dollars are earned by illegal aliens in the U.S. each year. One of Mexico's largest revenue streams (after exports and oil sales) consists of money sent home by legal immigrants and illegal aliens working in America.Its impossible to calculate or list the welfare programs, health treatment, education and prison incarceration where these billions of dollars are drained. Hundreds of other concealed programs have their costs that must include the U.S. Border Patrol and the pretense of the border fence. The 2006 Border fence was for two fences not ONE.

Forget barring undoc kids from schools - TX was not trying to do that - it just wanted to treat undoc kids like cross district transfers, since they were not "legally" residents of the school district.TX's position made sense to me, but the Constitution could be read to make that position an immigration law outside the power of a state.  I then proposed to our congressional delegation that Congress authorize the charging of tuition at non-resident rates to illegal aliens.  There was no will to do that.  It would be a great relief in the southwest border states if a modest tuition could be charged to undocs, treating them like out-of-district students.

It's about the will of the people, states rights and sovereignty. The Founders were intent that the will of America's Citizens serve as the guidance in our governance. Indeed, what benefit would derive from casting off the yolk of the Crown, if we were only going to replace it with the petty oppressions and usurpation's of self serving politicians, bureaucrats and an elitist minority?By definition, the Crown was little more than an elitist minority. The Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor, they fought against an elitist minority that sought to dictate how America's Citizens would conduct their lives. If America's Citizens, the overwhelming majority of whom support Arizona's SB 1070 Legislation, cannot say NO to an amnesty, say NO to the invasion that threatens our social, economic and environmental future, how have we benefited from the sacrifices we've made in pursuit of democracy? Arguably, an Administration and Courts that refuse to honor the will of America's citizens, that our border be secured and our immigration enforced, has adbicated it's authority in principal and in practice, and dishonors our Constitution and the Founders of our nation. Our Founding Fathers, recognizing the greed and self interests of Politicians and Bureaucrats, indeed, even the Clergy, were prescient in their provision of our 2nd. Amendment against such time as the government and the courts no longer felt compelled to accept the will of the people as their guidance. Clearly, our nation was founded on the premise that the will of the people, the governed, should serve as the final arbiter in our governance. Why then should we allow government and the courts to 'overrule' our will, and oppress the citizens of Arizona, and the vast majority of America's citizens who support enforcement based solutions to the egregious problem of illegal immigration? If this Administration and the Courts can willy-nilly usurp or undermine the will of the people, how then can we continue the charade that we are a democracy? If we the people cannot say NO to governmental and Judicial oppressions and overreaching, how is our lot any different than those who suffer under socialist empire or despotism? If the will of the people still matters, by what mechanism are we allowed to re-assert control over those who usurp our will under the guise of constitutional mandate?

Overpopulation, congestion, urban sprawl, diminishing resources, crumbling infrastructure, lack of affordable housing, vanishing farm land and green space, overcrowded schools and hospitals, water and energy shortages, crime, pollution, depressed wages, increased tax burdens, the balkanization of our communities, the marginalization of American workers, taxpayers and voters, the overall decline in quality of life, are all the result of unconstrained immigration. Too many people competing for the same limited resources is NOT sane, sustainable social, economic or environmental policy. Indeed, stabilizing the egregious population growth that occurs through out-of-control illegal immigration and anchor baby policies would do more immediately to address our carbon footprint than decades of any Cap and Trade legislation. Likewise, all of the green energy alternatives the administration is citing as the way forward require vast amount of land and water if they are to become a viable alternative to hydrocarbons. Bear in mind that, save for using coal, few hydrocarbons are really the result of energy production. Solar, wind, hydro, bio-fuels, geo-thermal, all require lots of increasingly expensive and rare real estate and water if they are to be viable as consumer and investor options to oil. Real estate and water that are increasingly in short supply as the result of egregious overpopulation resulting from unconstrained immigration. Investors will see no benefit in funding 'green alternatives' that are more resource intensive, especially if those energy alternatives are more expensive and problematic for consumers to use. Consumers likewise see little value in paying higher prices for energy alternatives that will only be consumed by immigration and population growth before the energy products reach the consumer market. Reducing energy costs is what motivates consumers and investors, and our immigration policies presently run contrary to the interests of America's workers, taxpayers, voters, and our economic and environmental interests in general.Posted by: edweirdness | July  7, 2010 10:25 AM | Report abuseIn initiating this lawsuit against Arizona the President of the United States has declared war on law abiding citizens who have demanded that the Federal Government enforce Immigration Laws.

THE FURTHER TRUTH - all this talk from the democrats about AMNESTY is just ENCOURAGING more illegal immigration because people are thinking they should want to get into this country under the deadline.So - Obama is making the problem WORSE, not better.SECOND on the historical context  -  one of the major justifications for NAFTA was to place jobs in Mexico, so people would have an incentive not to illegally migrate.Did that work ?    I think not.   But no one is saying to re-do NAFTA  -  so the Mexicans have the jobs in Mexico AND the jobs here.AT SOME POINT - Americans are going to have to face the question:  WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE US UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE FACE OF ALL THESE TRADE AGREEMENTS.Should the trade agreements be re-done  -  so the US government makes sure all the JOBS STAY HERE.The present trade agreement situation gets set up OVER A DECADE AGO  -  THERE ARE NO ADJUSTMENTS  -  AND THE AMERICAN WORKERS DO NOT DESERVE TO BE STUCK IN A BAD SYSTEM WHICH CLINTON SET UP.Posted by: FlowersOfPeace | July  7, 2010  9:50 AM | Report abusewin1 writes"Rather then having a racist immigration policy as you suggest we should limit immigration to those that serve the needs of this nation while."I don't see where Andy's proposal was 'racist', but your other point is valid: immigration policy should serve the needs of this nation.

And I am sure that as you pointed out that the primaries may determine the races in Iowa, because if the GOP picks the crazy tea-party folks those Obama democrats may come back to the Dems in the end.Posted by: AndyR3 | July  7, 2010  9:39 AM | Report abuseHere's a thought:Why don't we just open up our borders and let everybody in--including terrorist? There aren't enough jobs to go around for the American people, so why don't we let the illegals in so they can take up ever more of the jobs. That way you force true Americans into the streets, as homeless beggars. Let's raise our American born child in the streets and gutters like those in India? Let's become a third world country.

He come off as thoughtful on the issue rather than a demagogue.  The green card option sounds like Andy's red card proposal.  Also noted in that story is that both parties find the issue too useful to resolve it this year; the Repubs rally the base & think they're attracting swing voters, while Dems think they're attracting Hispanics as lifelong, multi-generational D voters.  When there're elections at stake, approaches like Cornyn's, AndyR3's, Mark in Austin's, etc. are irrelevant.

Take away the reason for illegals to be here and they will either leave of their own volition or go about the proper channels of getting their visa and/or citizenship. There is a reason our borders are not guarded by the federal government, they are influenced by all the lobbyists whose paymasters gain from lax border security. If the government doesn't do this, fire them and elect others who will. We are in a representative republic, if you don't feel like they are representing your best interests get their stinking asses out of public office.Do this and there will be no need for an unsightly 16th century wall around our great nation. Also, a wee bit off-topic but still pertains, if you are against gangs and murderers capitalizing on us, legalize marijuana. Cannabis is the majority of black market flow over the US-Mexico border, well into the billions of $$, untaxed. But the government makes too much money off allowing that to come over our borders and imposing fines and locking away decent human beings. Funny how hemp was made illegal when a well known interest was trying to push their nylon rope(made from oil) which wasn't as strong, durable, nor as cheap as hemp cordage. Also hemp seed oil and hemp fibers can be made into a SUSTAINABLE bio diesel and ethanol, unlike corn ethanol which was only introduced to jack up corn prices, while it is not sustainable. Lobbyists and corporations own you, please see the light of day, we have to work together to get our nation back. For full disclosure, I am center politically, and yes I have smoked cannabis since I was 19 and will until the day I die. Pigs be damned.

And, therein lies the reason an increasing number of voters are going to abandon Democratic candidates at the poll.  Because this party believes at its core that a strategy of catering to a single voting bloc should outweigh the duty to represent the interests of all the people. Need we remind Democratic strategists that minority voters do not turn out in anywhere near the numbers for midterm elections as in a Presidential cycle?Democrats who support reform (amnesty?) do so on humanitarian, compassionate and idealogical grounds.  They cannot bring themselves to admit this issue is, at its heart, about economics and pragmatic public policy because to do so would reveal the shallowness of their position.  And when a Democrat/liberal has a losing argument on practical grounds, they pull out the "feelings" card.  If you are a Republican you are hoping and praying the Democrats keep pushing this issue right up to election day.  You can then hang the consequences of reform (amnesty?) on each Democratic candidate and amplify the disenchantment caused by unacceptably high unemployment, two wars and a massive overreach of Federal power. About the only hope Democrats have of blunting this loser of an issue is that Michael Steele continues as Chairman of the GOP.  At least, then, his ramblings can serve as a counter point to the insanity of pushing immigration reform (amnestY) down the throat of an electorate which sees it for what it is.

The entire Obama Administration has sworn to uphold the law when they took their oath of office. They are obligated to enforce the immigration laws that Arizona is attempting to enforce. The law does not allow for sanctuary states and/or cities and also does not allow for selective enforcement.The law is the law and the law must be obeyed, also by the Federal Government.Furhtermore the Obama Administration is guilty of aiding and abetting the illegal criminals in committing their crimes in the US by not enforcing the immigration laws to the full extend of the law. The Obama Adminstration should be held accountable for the crimes they are committing against US citizens.Arizona should also sue the Federal Government for the material and financial damages it has experienced as a result of this administration's lack of law enforcement.It does not matter if someone supports or opposes illegal immigration, the law is still the law that is on the books now. It is the obligation of the federal government to uphold these laws until they have been legally changed. By not enforcing these laws the administration has imposed a hidden tax on the US citizens without any legal authority. The cost might not be shown in the budgets today but the bill will become due some day.Enforce the law and impose the maximum fine on every employer who hires illegal aliens.Posted by: duif100 | July  7, 2010  9:19 AM | Report abuseARIZONA DEFENSE FUND -  Unite against this violation of our rights and liberty!www.keepazsafe.com Posted by: bb67chev | July  7, 2010  9:19 AM | Report abuseGood early morning comments. There was an interesting interview with Sen. Cornyn this morning on the immigration issue. Absolute opposition to a pathway to citizenship those who came to the US illegally or overstayed a visa. A sticking point for Republicans is going to be that citizens naturalized under this process are likely to be Democrats.He was, however,  open to green card status. A green card would mean residency, the right to work, and the ability to return to the US. It's not a bad deal and as good as they or the Democrats could get.

I think you could set up national centers for documentation where undocumented immigrants could come and pay a fine, get a criminal ground check and get a 'red' card which would serve like a temporary worker type of green card.  They would have to pay Social Security and medicare as well as income taxes with no assurance that they would be able to get that money back unless they go through the full green card citizenship process which they would have to start from the begining.  Then after 2-3 years any non-citizen who is found in the country without a red/green card will be immediatly deported, and you can use that time to train police officers around the country on how to enforce that law.  And if you are found working without that documentation any unpaid wages can be seized and the person who hired you needs to be fined heavily as well.At the same time we need to streamline the path to citizenship and make it easier for Hispanics to come in legally to this country.  I personally think that we need to set-up two to three new Ellis Island type locations in places like El Paso and TJ to make this process work better (ie hand out new Red Cards for people coming over for seasonal work, family members joining naturalized citizens etc)Posted by: AndyR3 | July  7, 2010  8:49 AM | Report abuseAndyR,The democrats still hold a 46,000 person edge over the GOP. I would say that is a pretty sizable sum in a state as politically active as Iowa.Andy demographics do matter and Iowa is mostly white so even though there is significantly more D in Iowa those voters do not vote as a block.  I would say a lot of people registered as D in 2008 since the D primary was a hotter issue with an unpopular president.  The D now controls both houses of congress and the presidency and much of the large programs and massive spending passed by congress does not sit well with the average Iowans.  Colin who is opposing Grassley has come out with commercials condemning the actions of Washington of which the D have voted in favor of, so she is running as an outsider who is actual outside her own partys governance.  I am sure she would have voted along with her party, but she is playing the voter anger card.  Boswell before the health care vote was touting a compromise (incremental health care reform) so he too has was softening his partys agenda.  All that to say most Iowa D are not hard left, but rather center left.  The news here is that people who are registering are registering as R not D.  However, I would say the R primary was more hotly contested and there is more energy with R voters so that could explain part of the increase in R over D.  There is a lot of anger at Washington and D will feel the heat this election cycle.

The only actual consensus on immigration is that we do not want a policy of "open immigration, y'all come, please". Historically it is easily the most often demagogued issue of all that have dogged our nation.  It does not help that neither our legal immigration rules nor our policies regarding hiring of undocs make sense.The AZ law will be struck down in part. To the extent it is an attempt at state direction of FP it cannot stand.That polls show Americans favor both the AZ law and some form of "amnesty" demonstrates the ease with which the issue can be exploited.  Amnesty did not work for RWR and it will not work now, but there are resolutions that can be achieved that are far less costly and drastic than mass forcible deportations.  Rational thought will be drowned out in a sea of catchwords.  The Immigration Law and Labor Law sections of the ABA should be asked to volunteer a Model Law and what would be presented would work.

It's nice that you are writing bold columns on the white vote, what Michael Steele on Afghanistan means, the TEA Party revealed and, today, immigration policy. I have found some of the interpretations simplistic, but what can you do in a few hundred words in a coulmn that is about politics?  The other problem is that the comments section gets bogged down in a great deal of shouting.  So much certaintity with so many strongly held opinions and no one listening to anyone else. That's fine when we are just high-sticking about campaigns, but I feel like this just isn't the forum for complicated, nuanced issues that require time to say exactly what you mean along with a real commitment to taking-in another person's reasoning and experience.

If the Dems think this issue is a winner for them, I can't see why they'd be telling Obama and Holder to butt out.There's nothing in the suit about discrimination, which is understandable since it has yet to be enforced.  Arizona law isn't really in conflict with the Federal statutes; it's more like assistance.  I think there's at least a 50/50 chance the state prevails as this case works its way to the Supreme Court.  Then other states will follow, and the pressure for national, comprehensive reform will intensify.Posted by: Brigade | July  7, 2010  7:25 AM | Report abuseThe comments to this entry are closed.
