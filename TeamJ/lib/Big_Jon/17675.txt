Please take time to enjoy the twelve portrait paintings that drew my interest inside of Houston's Museum of Fine Arts (MFAH).By no means is this an exhaustive listing but just a sample of what you will find if and when you get to visit our fine arts museum in person. There are areas where photography is allowed as long as one does not use a flash and other areas that are off limits.Obviously the portraits offered here for your viewing pleasureare from the area where one can take pictures.Please enjoy!

It is an oil painted on board.The notes to the side of this striking painting tells us that Jawlensky liked using the "strong colors of Fauvism" and also the "vigorous brushwork of Expressionism."In a book of his memoirs Jawlensky thought that the series of square pictures of large-scale heads like this one titled Portrait of a Woman were considered by him to be the best work that he had created.Fauvism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Madame Cezanne in Blue by Paul Cezanne Source: Peggy WPaul Czanne - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaPaul CezannePaul Cezanne (Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists)Amazon Price: $3.75List Price: $6.95Paul Cezanne, 1839-1906: Pioneer of Modernism (Taschen Basic Art)Amazon Price: $4.99List Price: $9.99CezanneAmazon Price: $7.98List Price: $19.95Paul Czanne  This most famous of painters was French and lived in the years from 1839 to 1906. He was a Post-Impressionist painter bridging the 19th and 20th century. Both Matisse and Picasso who both became famous painters credited Paul Czanne with being "the father of us all." Although his father wanted him to study law, he ultimately financed his study of art and due to the generous allowance, Czanne was not the typical "starving artist" but was free to learn and explore. In this painting above he portrays his wife with his distinctive brushstrokes and unique choice of colors.  Empress Eugenie by Franz Xaver Winterhalter Source: Peggy WFranz Xaver Winterhalter - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaFranz Xaver WinterhalterFranz Xaver Winterhalter: And the Courts of Europe, 1830-70Amazon Price: $250.00List Price: $75.00FLORINDA BY FRANZ XAVER WINTERHALTER BEAUTIFUL GIRLS CANVAS REPRODUCTIONAmazon Price: $24.80Hofmaler: Jan van Eyck, Giorgio Vasari, Antoine Pesne, Hans Holbein der Jngere, Josef Arpd Koppay, Franz Xaver Winterhalter, Godfrey Kneller (German Edition)Amazon Price: $19.98List Price: $19.99Peintre Acadmique: Peinture Acadmique, George Frederic Watts, Franz Xaver Winterhalter, Fernand Pelez, Romain Cazes, Vittorio Matteo Corcos (French Edition)Amazon Price: $19.99Empress Eugnie This oil on canvas was created in 1854 by Franz X. Winterhalter, a German artist who lived from 1805 to 1873.According to the notations to the side of this portrait painting, Countess Eugnie de Montijo was of Portuguese descent and after marrying Napoleon the third in 1853, she graced the French throne with grace and elegance emulating the fashionable Marie Antoinette.With the patronage of Empress Eugnie and the French court, Franz Winterhalter's fame and success as a portraitist became well known.The Empresswas a beautiful woman and wasgracefully adorned with layers of elegant clothing for this particular portrait. The youthful lines of her neck and shoulders were accentuated by the simple flowers placed at her bosom and in her up-swept hair and her youth was forever captured and memorialized with this particular painting.  Portrait of John Joseph Henry by Thomas LawrenceSource: Peggy Whttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_LawrenceThomas LawrenceThomas Lawrence: Regency Power & Brilliance (Yale Center for British Art)Amazon Price: $42.89List Price: $70.00With Lawrence In ArabiaAmazon Price: $2.75Sir Thomas Lawrence (Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art)Amazon Price: $59.46List Price: $75.00Thomas LawrenceAn English artist who lived from 1769 to 1830, Thomas Lawrence produced this Portrait of John Joseph Henry as an oil on canvas in the year 1805.Thomas Lawrence was the leading portrait painter in England at the time and John Joseph Henry at the time of this sitting was the high sheriff of County Kildare in Ireland. He is dressed in Roman costume with his hair cut in a "Brutus crop" which according to notations at the side of this painting was popular at the beginning of the 19th century.Lawrence died before finishing and delivering this painting to the subject and it is painted over a sketch of another male sitter which is still slightly visible under the right kind of lighting and with some scrutiny on the part of the viewer at the bottom of this canvas.  Madame Valtat by Louis Valtat Source: Peggy WLouis Valtat - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaLouis ValtatLouis Valtat (Monographies) (French Edition)Amazon Price: $201.13Antheor Bay, Fine Art Print by Louis Valtat, 27.5x23.75Amazon Price: $26.99List Price: $23.99Louis Valtat  This was a French artist who lived from 1869 to 1952 and in 1906 he painted this charming oil on canvas using his wife, Madame Valtat, as his model. Louis Valtat was among the first painters to embrace the colorful style of Fauvism blending it with an Impressionistic style.  He was a participant in the very first Fauve exhibition at the Salon d' Automne in 1905. Can you see evidence in this painting of his being influenced by the artists van Gogh and also Renoir?  Leopold Zborowski by Amedeo Modigliani Source: Peggy WAmedeo Modigliani - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaAmedeo ModiglianiModigliani: Beyond the Myth (Published in Association with the Jewish Museum, New York)Amazon Price: $31.50List Price: $50.00ModiglianiAmazon Price: $6.00List Price: $26.99Amedeo ModiglianiAmazon Price: $10.46List Price: $14.99Amedeo Modigliani This Italian artist lived from 1884 to 1920 and created this oil on canvas titled Lopold Zborowski in 1916. Lopold Zborowski was a Polish poet who met Modigliani in the Parisian neighborhood of Montparnasse.What is really interesting according to the notations to the side of this painting is that although Lopold Zborowski was not a rich man, he so appreciated the work done by Modigliani that he decided to financially support him. When he died Zborowski's widow had to sell all of the Modigliani paintings in her possession because of being left so deeply in debt. Not your typical story of art patronage!   Marcelle Aron ( Madame Tristan Bernard) by Edouard Vuillard Source: Peggy WHistory behind why and what Edouard Vuillard painted...Distemper (paint) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaEdouard ViullardEdouard VuillardAmazon Price: $300.00List Price: $75.00Edouard Vuillard: Painter-Decorator: Patrons and Projects, 1892-1912Amazon Price: $67.70List Price: $95.0012X16 inch Edouard Vuillard Canvas Art Repro MadameAmazon Price: $23.97Edouard VillardThis was a French artist who lived from 1868 to 1940.He painted this Distemper on canvas from 1913 - 1914. For more information about Distemper painting which basically is a method of combining the colored elements like chalk or lead with a gelatinous substance, I have included a link from which you can read more if you are interested.The subject matter is titled Marcelle Aron ( Madame Tristan Bernard ). This stylish lady is forever captured on canvas petting her blonde dog in this highly patterned room in which more of the surrounding space is reflected in the mirror behind her. Portrait of Pierre Cadeau de Mongazon by Nicolas de LargilliereSource: Peggy WHistory of Art: Baroque and Rococo - Nicolas de LargilliereHistory of Art: Baroque and Rococo - Nicolas de LargilliereHistory Artists: Jacques-Louis David, Thomas C.

He painted this Portrait of Pierre Cdeau de Mongazon in the year 1715.It is an oil on canvas.According to notations to the side of this painting, Nicolas de Largilliere was an extremely prolific artist in his time producing well over 1,500 portraits!This subject "was probably painted about 1715 just after the sitter had been appointed as a court magistrate."Look at that terrific curly white wig on the magistrate's head. At least I am supposing it is a wig which seems to have been part of the costuming just as important as the robes worn in court back in that time and going forward for many years. Portrait of Mrs. Jeff Powis and Her Daughter by Joshua Reynolds * Photo by Peggy WJoshua Reynolds - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJoshua ReynoldsDiscourses on Art: New edition (Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in Britis)Amazon Price: $18.45List Price: $39.00Seven Discourses On ArtAmazon Price: $14.78List Price: $15.16Seven Discourses on ArtAmazon Price: $0.00Joshua ReynoldsAn English artist who lived from 1723 to 1792, this oil on canvas of the Portrait of Mrs. Jeff Powis and her daughter was painted in 1777. The notation to the side of this large painting states the following:First president of the Royal Academy in London, Joshua Reynolds was the most influential artist and one of the most important portrait painters in 18th-century England. In his lectures to the Academy, he urged that modern painting, even portraiture, be based on antique prototypes. He seems to have followed his own precept in this portrait: the painter "dresses his figure something with the general air of the antique for the sake of dignity, and preserves something of the modern for the sake of Likeness." Portrait of Monsieur d' Hotel in Hunting Clothes by Jean-Marc NattierSource: Peggy WJean-Marc Nattier - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJean-Marc NattierMadame de Pompadour 1748 Giclee Poster Print by Jean-Marc Nattier, 36x48Amazon Price: $139.99Jean-Marc Nattier (Portrait of a Lady) Art Poster Print - 11x17Amazon Price: $0.01Jean-Marc NattierThis is a French artist who lived in the years 1685 to 1766.He executed this oil on canvas in 1727 and the subject is the Portrait of Monsieur d' Htel in Hunting Clothes.Back in the 16th century the aristocracy often chose to be portrayed with some of what would have occupied a portion of their time...in this case, the hunting gear and one of his dogs. We can learn much about the pass-times and interests of the wealthy by looking at portraits such as this one.Jean-Marc Nattier started out as a history painter but turned to portraiture because it more readily paid the bills.  Portrait of Lieutenant Colonel William Shirriff, H.E.I.C.S. by Henry RaeburnSource: Peggy WHenry Raeburn - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaHenry RaeburnSir Henry Raeburn, R.A.; his life and works, with a catalogue of his picturesAmazon Price: $15.88List Price: $21.75Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston, The, Art Poster by Sir Henry RaeburnAmazon Price: $32.00The Painter's Eye: The Skating Minister (Sir Henry Raeburn)Amazon Price: $0.99Henry RaeburnRaeburn was a Scottish artist who lived in the years from 1756 to 1823.

I still have more in the computer and could do another hub sometime.  Much of what is great inside the museum is off limits as far as being photographed.  Thanks for the comment.GusTheRedneck12 days ago Hi Peggy - This is a really fine article and much appreciated. One of the portraits sort of stood out for me, possibly because, when it comes to paintings, I know not what I am seeing. That portrait of the good colonel spoke of too much food, and his head seemed to me to be of a smaller size than his body would have borne. Must be my eyes. Anyway, your photography was sterling. Thanks for the nice visit to the museum.Gus :-)~Peggy W12 days ago Hi Billy,As you say, those of us living in Houston, Texas have an abundance of great art venues in addition to the Museum of Fine Arts.  Thanks for the visit and Christmas greeting.  Hope you and your family enjoyed yours as well.Peggy W12 days ago Hi Gus,Often painters seem to exaggerate body sizes for better or worse depending upon one's point of view.  Look at that neck on the Modigliani for instance.  If that was not exaggerated, then Leopold Zborowski had one of the longest human necks that I have ever personally seen.  He was certainly a slim man if this painting was realistic in any way.  Glad you liked viewing these 12 portrait paintings inside of Houston's MFAH.  Thanks for the comment.Candie V12 days ago I love art galleries!  Haven't been to one in years.. no I lie, went to the Seattle Art Museum, but it had a special exhibit.

It has no real resemblance except for the beard. I have since done a more realistic one but after having looked at some of the efforts above, I don't feel quite as bad.I will never be as good as some of them but my efforts are not absolutely horrible.Peggy W6 days ago Hello guymclaren,I like your avatar!  Thanks for taking a look at these twelve portrait paintings inside Houston's MFAH.  Keep up your painting.  Who knows?  Someday your portraits may be hanging alongside some now famous ones!  :-)Nell Rose6 days ago Hi, I love paintings, I don't understand a lot about how the artist paints, or what canvas etc, but something always draws me to them, I love the Troy picture, I think it is because his personality comes across so much, and of course the artwork is fantastic, I remember watching my aunt paint, she was brilliant, but for some reason she never showed them, well, occasionally she gave them for club evenings etc all depending on the subject, but I have them now, she was so talented, loved this, thanks nellPeggy W5 days ago Hi Nell Rose,Nice that you have your aunt's paintings and that you actually got to see her in the process of painting them.  There are so many talented people in this world!  Thanks for taking the time to view this sampling of portrait paintings from Houston's MFAH.  In addition, thanks for your comment.  Have you featured your aunt's paintings in a hub?forkhyun5 days ago Cool paintings!

Nice to know that you liked this and thanks for the comment.Peggy W4 days ago Hi Nell,Is it possible to just take pictures of your aunt's paintings?  Pictures of most paintings turn out pretty well.  I find it more of a problem to photograph art when framed with glass over it due to reflections.  Hope you can accomplish this and share your aunt's artwork with us.  I would enjoy seeing it.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites97Peggy WFrom Houston, Texas1130 Followers256 HubsJoined 2 years agoRead more hubs by Peggy WContact Peggy WFollow Peggy WSubscribe to Peggy W's RSS feedRelated QuestionsHave you ever had a dream, that became reality?asked by heart4theword 10 months ago19 answersAnswer this questionHow to de-worm a kitten?asked by Haunty 9 months ago1 answerAnswer this questionRelated HubsPicasso - Most Famous Artist of the 20th Centuryby Hello, hello,Paul Cezanne - Post-Impressionist Painterby Uninvited WriterFrederic Bazille - French Painterby Uninvited WriterCamille Pissarro - French Impressionist Artistby Uninvited WriterFabulous Landscape Paintings in Houston's MFAby Peggy WVan Gogh -- Post Impressionismby Hello, hello, Painting ForumTopicReplieshow do promote my art online and offline in 2010?posted by wcharles62223how to sell works easiest?posted by amandanike11How to Sell Paintings Online Successfully?posted by DebtFreedom21Post a new topic10 more topics Tagstexas paintings houston impressionism paul cezanne  portrait paintings Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
