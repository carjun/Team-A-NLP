Chinnaswamy StadiumCapacity:42,000Owner:Dr. Vijay Mallya [2]Official website:Royal Challengers BangaloreRoyal Challengers Bangalore (Kannada: , ), (often abbreviated as RCB) is a franchise, cricket team based in the city of Bangalore. The team is owned by the business magnate Vijay Mallya, through his flagship firm UB Group.[3] , while Ray Jennings, is the coach.[1]Contents1 Franchise history1.1 2008 IPL Season1.2 2009 IPL Season1.3 2010 IPL Season2 Etymology3 Theme Song4 Players4.1 1st IPL Auction4.2 Transfers & New Signings4.3 2nd IPL Auction4.4 3rd IPL Auction4.5 Captaincy4.6 4th IPL Auction5 Current Squad & Administration6 Administration7 Champions League Twenty207.1 2008 season7.2 2009 season7.2.1 Group stage - Group C7.2.2 League stage - League B7.3 2010 Season8 Fixtures and results8.1 Overall results in the IPL8.2 2008 season8.3 2009 season8.4 2010 season9 References10 External links[edit] Franchise historyIndian Premier League is a cricket tournament being organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and backed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).[4] For the inaugural tournament held in Apr-Jun 2008, the BCCI had finalised a list of 8 teams who will be participating in the tournament. The teams representing 8 different cities of India, including Bangalore, were put up on auction in Mumbai on 20 February 2008 and the Bangalore team was won by Vijay Mallya, who paid US$111.6million for it. This was the second highest bid for a team in the IPL, next only to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries' bid of $111.9million for the Mumbai team. Bollywood actresses Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone, and Sandalwood film stars Ramya and Puneeth Rajkumar are the brand ambassadors of the team.[5][edit] 2008 IPL SeasonMain article: 2008 Indian Premier LeagueThe team won 4 matches in this season, losing 10 matches and managed to secure only the last but one position in the points table. Only one of their batsman, Rahul Dravid managed to score more than 300 runs in the tournament and they had to even bench their costliest foreign player, Jacques Kallis, for a few of the matches due to his poor form.[6][7] The string of failures mid-way through the season led to the sacking of the CEO, Charu Sharma who was replaced with Brijesh Patel.[8] Even coach Venkatesh Prasad was about to be sacked, but he saved his job by publicly apologising for the team's failure. Vijay Mallya went on to publicly criticise Dravid and Sharma for the failures by saying that they had not selected the right team. He regretted that he had made a mistake by not getting involved in the selection of the team.[8] They were the only team in the IPL to try out 11 opening combinations in 14 games. Eventually the chief cricketing officer, Martin Crowe resigned.[9] It was decided that from 2009 IPL session onwards the team would be coached by former South Africa Coach Ray Jennings.[edit] 2009 IPL SeasonMain article: 2009 Indian Premier LeagueThe team started with a win against defending champions Rajasthan Royals but quickly went on to loose a few games afterwards under the captaincy of Kevin Pietersen. However, he had to leave for national duty and captaincy was taken over by former Indian Test captain Anil Kumble. The team fortunes reversed and they beat Deccan Chargers to secure a 3rd place after the round robin stage in IPL2. In the semi final they beat the Chennai Super Kings convincingly who were led by M.S.Dhoni and crushed their hopes of winning the title. However they lost the final by 6 runs, in a close match to Deccan Chargers. Also Manish Pandey became the first Indian to score a century in IPL when he made 114*(73) against Deccan Chargers in their last match in the league phase.[edit] 2010 IPL SeasonMain article: 2010 Indian Premier LeagueChallengers had a mixed round of success in the third edition of the IPL. The team slumped to a defeat in their first match against the Knight Riders but came back strongly to win the next four games which started off with the highest successful run chase in IPL 2010 and the second highest successful run chase in IPL history against Kings XI Punjab at Bangalore. This win was followed by comprehensive wins against the Rajasthan Royals, Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings. Kallis and Uthappa were in tremendous form with the bat while Kumble was miserly with the ball, Steyn fast and accurate and Vinay Kumar wily picking wickets at the right time. However the team lost the next two games and after a roller coaster ride managed to sneak into the semis for the second consecutive season by virtue of their healthy net run rate beating Delhi Daredevils and Kolkata Knight Riders both of whom had equal number of wins and losses as the Bangalore outfit. In the semifinal the Challengers put on a shoddy display after beginning well to concede 77 runs during the last 5 overs of the Mumbai innings and did not bat well to lose the match by 35 runs. The team had the final laugh after they beat the defending champions Deccan Chargers against whom they lost the previous year's final, by beating them all end's up by 9 wickets to finish third for the season and thereby book a slot in the 2010 Champions League Twenty20.[edit] EtymologyVijay Mallya wanted to associate one of his top-selling liquor brands, either No. 1 McDowell's or Royal Challenge with the team.[10] The latter was chosen, hence the name. The jersey colours of the team are red and golden yellow, the same as the Karnataka state flag,[11] and the logo consists of the RC emblem with "Royal Challengers Bangalore" in standard format.[edit] Theme SongThe first theme song of Royal Challengers was Jeetenge Hum Shaan Se sung by Kunal Ganjawala and Sunidhi Chowhan. However Another unofficial fanclub's theme song called Thakkath Geete has been composed in support of the Red & Yellow team, with the help of TV9. However, the team anthem was created in 2009 by Rediffusion Y&R Bangalore and is called Game for More. The music video was directed by Sanjay Shetty and Vishal from Opticus Films, music was directed by Amit Trivedi (DEV.D and Aamir fame) and lyrics were penned by Anshu Sharma a.k.a. anshubaba from Rediffusion Y&R.[edit] Players[edit] 1st IPL AuctionThe players in the team (except for Rahul Dravid, who was the Icon Player), were selected in an auction conducted by BCCI on 20 February 2008. South Africa's Jacques Kallis at $900,000 became the costliest player to be selected to play for the Royal Challengers. This meant that Rahul Dravid, being the Icon Player would be paid $1,035,000 (15% more than the highest bid player in the team). Other players selected included the then Indian Test cricket captain Anil Kumble along with his team-mates Praveen Kumar and Zaheer Khan, West Indian Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Aussies Nathan Bracken and Cameron White, South Africa's Mark Boucher (Wicket Keeper) and Dale Steyn. The team also included Pakistan cricket team's vice captain Misbah-ul-Haq although he wasn't in the playing 11 for most part of the tournament.[edit] Transfers & New SigningsOn the last day of the 2008-2009 transfer window, Zaheer Khan was swapped with Robin Uthappa of Mumbai Indians, with no money exchanged. The team also acquired Karnataka batsman Manish Pandey from Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan fast bowler Pankaj Singh from Rajasthan Royals. The team also signed Eagles fast bowler Dillon du Preez as a replacement for Zaheer Khan.The team management also suspended the contract of Pakistani player and current vice-captain of the Pakistan Cricket Team, Misbah-ul-Haq where as some other owners have decided to terminate the contracts of Pakistani players.[edit] 2nd IPL AuctionKevin Pietersen made his way into RCB as one of the costliest players in IPL history. Kevin Pietersen was valued at $1.55m over a base price of $1.35m. Also Jesse Ryder from New Zealand was acquired in the auction at $160,000.[edit] 3rd IPL AuctionChallengers were among the least active during the 2010 auction by signing Irish batsman Eoin Morgan for $220,000 as the only acquisition.[edit] CaptaincyVijay Mallya, the owner of Bangalore Royal Challengers, has kept the captaincy options open. Minutes after picking up Kevin Pietersen at USD 1.55 million, Mallaya said he was happy with the price he got him at. "The captaincy options are open. The team management will take a decision on it." The Royal Challengers, who finished second last the previous year, were led by Rahul Dravid. On 21 March 2009 Vijay Mallya announced that Kevin Pietersen was replacing Rahul Dravid as the team captain for the 2009 season. The reason given was Dravid's absence in the league due to family related reasons.[12] However many suspect that the change in captaincy is the result of the poor performance of the team in the first season of the Indian Premier League. On the 30th April 2009, Anil Kumble was named the captain of the team for the remaining games of the IPL Season 2, due to Kevin Pietersen's absence to play for England against the West Indies. Since then performance of Bangalore Royal Challengers has been instrumental and the turn around has been superb. The challengers found great success under Kumble's leadership.[edit] 4th IPL AuctionOn January 8th, 2011, IPL Governing Council held the auction for the season 4 of the league. The franchises had the option of retaining a maximum of four players for a sum of $4.5mn. Royal Challengers however retained only one of their player in Virat Kohli leaving the rest of the players back in the auction pool. On day one of the auction for the season four Bangalore bought Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan for $650,000, their former player and Mumbai Indians spearhead Zaheer Khan for $900,000, South Africa's ace middle order batsman AB de Villiers for $1.1mn, current New Zealand skipper and former Delhi Daredevils player Daniel Vettori for $550,000, India's young talent who played with Mumbai Indians until last season Saurabh Tiwary for a whopping $1.6mn; Australia's Dirk Nannes for $650,000 who played for Daredevils and India's young talent Cheteshwar Pujara for $700,000. Daniel Vettori is expected to captain the side for the forthcoming seasons of the IPL.[13][edit] Current Squad & AdministrationRoyal Challengers Bangalore Roster For IPL 4viewtalkeditBatsmen05  Virat Kohli--  Saurabh Tiwary--  Cheteshwar Pujara--  Mohammad Kaif--  Luke Pomersbach--  Rilee Rossouw--  Jonathan VandiarAll Rounders--  Daniel Vettori--  Tillakaratne DilshanWicket Keepers--  AB de VilliersBowlers--  Zaheer Khan--  Abhimanyu Mithun--  Charl Langeveldt--  Johan van der Wath--  Dirk Nannes--  Nuwan PradeepSupport StaffHead Coach:  Ray JenningsAssistant Head Coach:  Sanath KumarPhysiotherapist:  Evan SpeechlyMentor:  Anil KumbleCEO:  Brijesh PatelManager:  Avinash VaidyaMasseur:  Ramesh ManeTeam Analyst:  Prassana AgoramHead Strength And Conditioning Coach:  Basu S[edit] AdministrationOwner - Vijay Mallya's UB GroupCEO - Brijesh PatelAmbassadors -Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone, Ramya, Upendra, Puneet Rajkumar [14][edit] Champions League Twenty20Main article: Twenty20 Champions LeagueThe Twenty20 Champions League is an international Twenty20 cricket competition between clubs from India, Australia, England, South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and West Indies. The competition was launched in 2008 as a response to the success of national Twenty20 domestic cricket leagues, most notably the Indian Premier League[edit] 2008 seasonMain article: 2008 Twenty20 Champions LeagueThe Royal Challengers did not qualify for the Champions League during the 2008 Season. However the tournament was cancelled due to 2008 Mumbai Attacks but qualifying teams from India, Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were compensated with the losses incurred.[edit] 2009 seasonMain article: 2009 Twenty20 Champions LeagueOn account of emerging as the runners-up of the 2009 season of the Indian Premier League, the team participated in the inaugural edition of the T20 Champions League, along with two other Indian teams; the winners of IPL 2009, Deccan Chargers and Delhi Daredevils, the toppers of the league-stage points table.They had a limited amount of success during the tournament being placed in Group C for their first round. They lost to Cape Cobras in their first match but came back strongly to comprehensively beat Otago, to enter the second round. The results from the pairings during the first round were carried forward to the league stage hence the Royal Challengers eventually crashed out from the second round after finishing with 2 points from 3 matches which included a loss to the Victorian Bushrangers, a victory over the Delhi DareDevils and the loss against the Cape Cobras carried forward from the first round.[edit] Group stage - Group C8 October, 2009 20:00ScorecardBulletinRoyal Challengers 180/4 (20.0 overs)v Cape Cobras184/5 (19.4 overs)Cape Cobras won by 5 wickets.M Chinnaswamy Stadium, BangaloreUmpires: Brian Jerling and Russell TiffinPlayer of the match:  JP DuminyRoss Taylor 53*Charl Langeveldt 1/12JP Duminy 99Praveen Kumar 3/32Toss: Royal Challengers won the toss and chose to bat first.12 October, 2009 20:00ScorecardBulletinRoyal Challengers 188/2 (20.0 overs)v Otago108/10 (17.5 overs)Royal Challengers won by 80 runs.M Chinnaswamy Stadium, BangaloreUmpires: Brian Jerling and Russell TiffinPlayer of the match:  Jacques KallisJacques Kallis 73*Aaron Redmond 1/23Craig Cumming 20Jacques Kallis 3/18Toss: Royal Challengers won the toss and chose to bat first.[edit] League stage - League B15 October, 2009 20:00ScorecardBulletinRoyal Challengers 127/6 (20 overs)v Victorian Bushrangers133/3 (15.5 overs)Victorian Bushrangers won by 7 wicketsM.
