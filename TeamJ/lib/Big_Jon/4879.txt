Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and others, including a child and federal judge who died from their wounds.But critics of Sarah Palin have already drawn a link between the shooting and the fact that the former Alaska governor put Giffords on a "target list" of lawmakers Palin wanted to see unseated in the midterm elections.In March, Palin released a map featuring 20 House Democrats that used crosshairs images to show their districts. (You can see it here.) Critics suggested at the time that she was inciting violence by using the crosshairs imagery and for later writing on Twitter to her supporters, "'Don't Retreat, Instead - RELOAD!'""We're paying particular attention to those House members who voted in favor of Obamacare and represent districts that Senator John McCain and I carried during the 2008 election," Palin wrote when she released the target list.She specifically cited Giffords and then went to say: "We'll aim for these races and many others."Read more: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20027918-503544.... Related OP which has Giffords' reaction to being put in Sarah Palin's gunsight crosshairs...I think its important for all leaders, not just leaders of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party  community leaders, figures in our community to say, Look, we cant stand for this. I mean, this is a situation where people really need to realize that this rhetoric, and firing people up, and even things  For example, were on Sarah Palins targeted list, but the way she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gunsight over our district. And when people do that, theyve gotta realize that theres consequences to that action.More: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph...

It is NOT a political organization at this point. It is NOTHING SHORT of a TERRORIST ORGANIZATION...FAR worse than Al Quaeda! FAR worse than Nazi Germany. FAR worse than ANY OTHER group in history, BAR NONE.Sarah Palin is the titular head of this party, and with her murderous rampage that included the poor granddaughter of a revered baseball manager, SHE should be in the cell next to the person she influenced to pull off this horrific deed. In addition, the republican Party ITSELF must be held accountable for allowing the conditions to fester for decades which LED to the Tea Party Terrorist movement, and now has claimed its first victims.I've already opined on how to ban the GOP through RICO statutes, identifying and deconstructing its financial apparatus. NOW, see what you have wrought by NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THIS?Sarah must be jailed for life on this act. Jesse Kelly should be held just as accountable as well. I sincerely hope that Loughner tells the truth on how the Tea Party, in particularly how Sarah Palin influenced his deeds and that the full weight of legal and, if necessary, legal physical enforcement against the republican Party become a reality. It is an insidious shame that it took a republican-sponsored murder to accomplish that feat.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPatrynXX      (916 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:07 PMResponse to Reply #137160.would seem the shooter would be pro Iranif he's anti ZOG and anti Semite   both of which the current idiots in Iran who stole the election are controllingPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLeftist Agitator      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 07:44 PMResponse to Reply #160164.Fuck you, you racist retard.Teh Joos are controlled by Iranz!

Christina Taylor Green, nine-year-old victim in today's Tucson shootings, once was an infant designated to be a "Face of Hope" by virtue of her birth on September 11, 2001. She was one of the children born on 9/11 featured in the book by Christine Pisera Naman which was dedicated to all the babies born on the day the World Trade Towers in New York City were taken down in an act of terrorism.Ironically, today her life ended in violence, as she fell under the attack of a gunman at a political function at a supermarket.A neighbor was going to the Giffords event today, the Arizona Republic reports, and invited Christina along simply because she thought she would enjoy it, according to Christina's uncle, Greg Segalini. Christina was newly elected to the student council at her school.The event, an opportunity for constituents to meet Giffords and discuss any concerns they had related to the federal government, was an outdoor family friendly event.A talented girl, Christina Green participated in many activities, ranging from ballet to baseball."How do you prepare for something like this? My little niece got killed--took one on the chest and she is dead," Segalini reportedly said outside the girl's house.The public yields a stunned assent."She was born on 9-11 and died today? That's the most tragic thing I've ever heard," a Facebook comment asserts.Christina's page in Faces of Hope reads: I hope you know all the words to the Star Spangled Banner and sing it with your hand over your heart.

I'm genuinely concerned about that large lump on the cartoid area of his face.  My dad had one just as large, learned it was skin cancer.

From the post:Well, I'd argue that we can narrow the target list by looking at those Democrats who sold out the Constitution last week. I've bolded members of the Blue Dogs for added emphasis.... this vote certainly puts a bulls eye on their district.Giffords' name is bolded on a list of "targeted" blue-dogs.Much of the overheated hyperventilation on progressive sites will boomerang since there are plenty of examples of strong or even intemperate rhetoric coming from the left.  I have nothing against the DailyKos post - representatives can and should be held accountable for their votes.  I also do not believe in blanket restrictions what strong language can and cannot be used, or who can be attacked and mocked and who cannot (I am a South Park and a 1st amendment fan).  And what if it turns out that the shooter had visited dailykos.com?  Or the DU?  Would you want someone tarring those sites as "terrorist" because a psychotic visited them?Regarding church shootingshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Colorado_YWAM_and_New... Should the shooter's hatred of christians, who he blamed for the worlds problems, be used as a cudgel against progressives who have an antipathy toward religion, especially christianity?  I have certainly read many rants here on the DU that, taken out of context, could be used to support such a ludicrous campaign.  To those who want to make this rampage a political point for their side, they should look in a mirror to see the enemy.  Sometimes horrible crimes are just that - no political motivation that has a connection to reality, such as the Colorado murders.  The Manson murders were "political" in that he wanted to start a race war, but the reality is that those crimes were generated in the deep recesses of a psychotic mind and were not truly political.  We have yet to learn many important things about this event - particularly if there was someone else involved and, if so, their motivation.  Until then what we have is a deeply disturbed young man who went on a rampage.  Nothing more.In politics it always is wise to ask "what if the tables were turned?"  For example, if you have a majority in the Senate it is a great temptation to weaken the filibuster - but no majority lasts for ever.  I saw one post yesterday on the DU that lamented that the GOP had not been banned when the Democrats "had the chance" with a big majority in Congress.  What an idiot.  The worm turns, and what is good for the goose must be good for the gander.  So those who are making all kinds of wild allegations invoking distal and tenuous connections might find such statements come back to bite them, especially as more information come to light.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopSouth End Liberal      (34 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:43 PMResponse to Original message133.Can we set the political mud throwing aside for now?Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 12:44 PM by South End LiberalRight now, we know little about the shooter.

Does it compute - Christina Green - age 9, murdered because she stoked the flames of hate.Think about that, Sarah.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopSocialprogressiveIL      (3 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:32 PMResponse to Original message157.Speculation is not factI find Sarah Palin as awful as most of you do, but anyone here who claims they know that Sarah Palin's map was the motivation for this is flat out not telling the truth. We can speculate, but we have no idea. If people are venting, I get that, and I think places like this are important for that, but don't pass it off as fact. It's no more than wishful thinking at this point.

I shudder to think, we would be in lock-down curfews for all blacks and Hispanics and "Muslim-looking" middle easterners.Armed militias would be patrolling our cities' streets, a national emergency would have been declared, and Keith Olbermann would be in GTMO.That's the difference in equality American justice would show us.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNeoConsSuck      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 07:53 PMResponse to Original message166.Sarah, that sucking sound you're hearingis your career as a right wing hater being flushed down the toilet.
