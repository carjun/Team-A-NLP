(October 2010)American people or Americans are a nation and denizens of the United States. The United States is a multi-ethnic nation, home to people of different ethnic and national backgrounds. As a result, some Americans don't take their nationality as an ethnicity, but identify themselves with both their American citizenship and their ancestral origins. Aside from the indigenous Native American population, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries.[17]Due to the multi-ethnic composition, the United States is a multicultural nation, home to a wide variety of traditions and values.[18][19] The culture held in common by most Americans is referred to as mainstream American culture, a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of Western European migrants, beginning with the early English and Dutch settlers. German and Irish cultures have also been very influential.[18] Certain cultural attributes of Igbo, Mand, Kongo and Wolof slaves from West Africa were adopted by the American mainstream; based more on the traditions of Central African Bantu slaves, a distinct African American culture developed that would also deeply affect the mainstream.[20] Westward expansion integrated the Creoles and Cajuns of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest and brought close contact with the culture of Mexico. Large-scale immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from Southern and Eastern Europe introduced many new cultural elements. More recent immigration from Asia, Africa, and especially Latin America has had broad impact. The resulting cultural mix may be described as a homogeneous melting pot, or as a pluralistic salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[18]In addition to the United States, Americans and people of American descent can be found internationally. As many as 4 million Americans are estimated to be living abroad.[3]Contents1 Racial and ethnic groups1.1 White and European Americans1.2 Black and African Americans2 National personification3 Language4 Religion4.1 Main religious preferences5 Culture6 See also6.1 References[edit] Racial and ethnic groups[edit] White and European AmericansMain articles: European American, White American, and White Hispanic and Latino AmericansThe majority of the 308 million people currently living in the United States consists of White Americans, who trace their ancestry to the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. White Americans are the majority in forty-nine of the fifty states, with Hawaii as the exception. Non-Hispanic whites are the majority in forty-six states; the four minority-majority states are California, Texas, New Mexico, and Hawaii. In addition, the District of Columbia has a non-white majority. According to the 2009 American Community Survey, there were 229,773,131 whites in the United States, which represented 74.8% of the population. In addition, there were 199,325,978 non-Hispanic whites, which represented 64.9% of the population.[21]The largest continental ancestral group of Americans are Europeans who have origins in any of the original peoples of Europe. This includes people via African, North American, Caribbean, Central American or South American and Oceanian nations which have a large European diaspora.[22]The Spanish were the first Europeans to establish a continuous presence in what is now the United States.[23] Martn de Argelles born 1566, San Agustn, La Florida, was the first person of European descent born in what is now the United States.[24] Twenty-one years later, Virginia Dare born 1587 Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina, was the first child born in the Thirteen Colonies to English parents.In 2009, German Americans (16.5%), Irish Americans (11.9%), and English Americans (9.0%) were the three largest self-reported ancestry groups in the United States forming 37.4% of the population.[25]Overall, as the largest group, European Americans have the lowest poverty rate[26] and the second highest educational attainment levels, median household income,[27] and median personal income[28] of any racial demographic in the nation.European ancestriesRankAncestryPercentagePop.AncestryPercentagePop.Benjamin Franklin of English descent.Jacqueline Bouvier ofFrench, English, Irish descent.Wright Brothers of English,Dutch, German-Swiss descent.[29][30]1German15.2%42,841,569Scotch-Irish1.5%4,319,2322Irish10.8%30,524,799Swedish1.4%3,998,3103English8.7%24,509,692Russian0.9%2,652,2144American7.2%20,188,305Welsh0.6%1,753,7945Italian5.6%15,638,348Danish0.5%1,430,8976Polish3.2%8,977,235Hungarian0.5%1,398,7027French3.0%8,309,666Czech0.4%1,258,4528Scottish1.7%4,890,581Portuguese0.4%1,173,6919Dutch1.6%4,541,770Greek0.4%1,153,29510Norwegian1.6%4,477,725British0.4%1,085,7182000 United States Census Bureau[edit] Black and African AmericansMain articles: African American and Black Hispanic and Latino AmericansAfrican Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa.[31] In the United States, the terms are generally used for Americans with at least partial Sub-Saharan African ancestry. According to the 2009 American Community Survey, there were 38,093,725 blacks in the United States, which represented 12.4% of the population. In addition, there were 37,144,530 non-Hispanic blacks, which represented 12.1% of the population.[21]Most African Americans are the direct descendants of captive Africans who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States, although some areor are descended fromimmigrants from African, Caribbean, Central American or South American nations.[32] As an adjective, the term is usually spelled African-American.[33]African American history starts in the 17th century with indentured servitude in the American colonies and progresses onto the election of Barack Obama as the 44th and current President of the United States. Between those landmarks there were other events and issues, both resolved and ongoing, that were faced by African Americans. Some of these were slavery, reconstruction, development of the African-American community, participation in the great military conflicts of the United States, racial segregation, and the Civil Rights Movement.Black Americans make up the single largest racial minority in the United States and form the second largest racial group after whites in the United States.[34]African ancestries [35]RankAncestryPercentagePop.AncestryPercentagePop.Oprah Winfrey descendentof the Kpelle of Liberia.[36]Michael Jacksonof black African descent.1Nigerian0.0%254,794Ugandan0.0%11,6742Ethiopian0.0%186,679Senegalese0.0%8,7673Somalian0.0%103,117Zimbabwean0.0%6,3674Cape Verdean0.0%90,828Other Subsaharan African0.0%126,4635Ghanian0.0%84,777Subsaharan African0.5%2,866,4196South African0.0%55,895Black Hispanic0.4%949,1957Liberian0.0%49,428Black or African American alone12.3%38,093,7258Kenyan0.0%44,4679Sudanese0.0%36,66310Sierra Leonean0.0%13,2812009 American Community Survey Bureau[edit] National personification"Uncle Sam" is a national personification of the United States. The image bears resemblance to the real Samuel Wilson. The female personification is "Columbia".A national personification is an anthropomorphization of a nation or its people; it can appear in both editorial cartoons and propaganda.Uncle Sam is a national personification of the United States and sometimes more specifically of the American government, with the first usage of the term dating from the War of 1812. He is depicted as a stern elderly white man with white hair and a goatee beard, and dressed in clothing that recalls the design elements of flag of the United States  for example, typically a top hat with red and white stripes and white stars on a blue band, and red and white striped trousers.Columbia is a poetic name for the Americas and the feminine personification of the United States of America. It has inspired the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions, and companies in the Western Hemisphere and beyond.[edit] LanguageMain articles: English language, American English, and English-only movementLanguages (2007)[37]English (only)225.5 millionSpanish, incl. Creole34.5 millionChinese2.5 millionFrench, incl. Creole2.0 millionTagalog1.5 millionVietnamese1.2 millionGerman1.1 millionKorean1.1 millionEnglish is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some lawssuch as U.S. naturalization requirementsstandardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[37][38] Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states.[39] Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii by state law.[40]While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[41] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.[42] Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico.[edit] ReligionMain article: Religion in the United StatesMajor religions by overall percentage.The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., is the largest Catholic church in the United States.First Baptist Church in America in Providence, Rhode Island.Religion in the United States has a high adherence level, compared to other developed countries, and diversity in beliefs. The First Amendment to the country's Constitution prevents the Federal government from making any "law respecting an establishment of religion", and guarantees the free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court has interpreted this as preventing the government from having any authority in religion. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a "very important" role in their lives, a proportion unusual among developed nations, although similar to the other nations of the Americas.[43] Many faiths have flourished in the United States, including both later imports spanning the country's multicultural immigrant heritage, as well as those founded within the country; these have led the United States to become the most religiously diverse country in the world.[44]The majority of Americans (76%) identify themselves as Christians, mostly within Protestant and Catholic denominations, accounting for 51% and 25% of the population respectively.[45] Non-Christian religions (including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism), collectively make up about 4% to 5% of the adult population.[45][46][47] Another 15% of the adult population identifies as having no religious belief or no religious affiliation.[45] According to the American Religious Identification Survey, religious belief varies considerably across the country: 59% of Americans living in Western states (the "Unchurched Belt") report a belief in God, yet in the South (the "Bible Belt") the figure is as high as 86%.[45][48]Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans, Pennsylvania by Irish and English Quakers, Maryland by English and Irish Catholics, and Virginia by English Anglicans. Although some individual states retained established religious confessions well into the nineteenth century, the United States was the first nation to have no official state-endorsed religion.[49] Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.[50][edit] Main religious preferencesChristianity: (82.3%)[51]Unaffiliated, including atheist or agnostic (11.6%)[51]Judaism (1.2%)[51]Islam (0.6% [51] to 1.6%)Buddhism (0.5% [51] to 0.9%)Hinduism (0.4%)Other (1.4%)[edit] CultureMain article: Culture of the United StatesAmerican Shepherd with his horse and dog.The development of the Culture of the United States of America has been marked by a tension between two strong sources of inspiration: European ideals, especially British; and domestic originality, such as Jeffersonian Democracy, which Europeans feared would turn their immigrants[clarification needed] into American savages and degenerates. Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and a reactionary piece to the prevailing European consensus that America's domestic originality was degenerate.American culture encompasses traditions, ideals, customs, beliefs, values, arts, folklore and innovations developed both domestically and imported via colonization and immigration from the British Isles. Prevalent ideas and ideals which evolved domestically such as important national holidays, uniquely American sports, proud military tradition, and innovations in the arts and entertainment give a strong sense of national pride among the population as a whole.[edit] See alsoAmerican AustralianAmerican BrazilianAmerican CanadiansAmerico-LiberianAmerican New ZealanderHyphenated AmericanImmigration to the United States[edit] References^ "U.S. POPClock Projection".
