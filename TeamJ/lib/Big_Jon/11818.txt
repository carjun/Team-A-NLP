Donald L. Carcieri, had issued to crack down on illegal immigration.To cheers, Governor Chafee officially rescinded the edict that he termed an agent of divisiveness, incivility and distrust among the states citizens. He did so in a packed room at the International Institute of Rhode Island, a nonprofit agency that assists immigrants and refugees.Chafee said he was turning back the clock to March 26, 2008, the day before Carcieri issued his Illegal Immigration Control Order. Carcieri said then that he intended to curb what he termed an epidemic, the costly flow of illegal immigrants. The order sparked numerous protests and spread fear in the immigrant community.Today, we are living up to those standards established by Roger Williams when he came here in 1636, Chafee said, standards of welcome, tolerance, personal rights and the broadest freedoms in the world.The rescission lifts a requirement that state agencies and state vendors screen employees through the federal E-Verify system. Critics say E-Verify is prone to inaccuracy.Chafee also clarified that he is also directing state police Col. Brendan P. Doherty to end the so-called 287(g) agreement between state police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Carcieris order directed state police to pursue the agreement. It led to four troopers being deputized with immigration-enforcement powers.Chafee cleared up confusion left after one of his senior staff members said Tuesday night that the rescission would leave the 287(g) agreement in place, and that whether the governor would choose to terminate the agreement is a different question. Thats not whats on the table  for right now. That is an issue that will be addressed in due course.Asked if the memorandum of understanding with ICE will be revoked, Chafee replied, Thats correct. Thats correct. He added, We will continue to work with all the immigrant communities and state police to make sure were enforcing the laws to the best of our ability, but not doing immigration and customs work.Doherty said later, I thought the [287(g)] process was working well. Reasonable minds may differ, but he is the governor.He added, We will continue to communicate and cooperate with ICE on matters of mutual concern and make sure the people of Rhode Island are safe in a variety of ways.Chafee said the real answer to curbing illegal immigration is through federal immigration reform. He pledged to push for that through the National Governors Association to get our immigrant community  some of whom are living in the shadows  out of the shadows.Chafees repeal, accomplished through an executive order terminating [the] illegal immigration control order, drew immediate praise.But some attending the ceremony raised concerns that new Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartins stated intent to enter a federal Secure Communities initiative could overshadow Chafees repeal of the executive order.The initiative would allow law-enforcement officers to fingerprint people under arrest and have them automatically checked against an immigration databasehttp://www.projo.com/news/content/CHAFEE_RESCINDS_ORDER_01-06-11_8GLQJOO_v15.34cdb6.htmlShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updatesimmigration, RI Gove Lincoln Chaffe, Illegal Immigration Control Order -repealedRead moreArizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords among 12 shot at Tucson grocery.January 8, 2011jamesb10147 commentsRepresentative Giffords at an event in October.Congresswoman Giffords Shot in TucsonCondition of Rep.

But if the sheer intensity of the quarrel seems disproportionate to that seemingly straightforward dispute, thats because its also deeply personal. Long-simmering resentment of two of the leading figures on the economic right, American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene  who runs the event  and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, who has long been involved in planning it, has morphed into a conflict that carries the special bitterness of a civil war.There are a lot of conservatives who see a larger problem with Grover Norquist and David Keene, and theyve decided to fight it out and CPAC is a proxy for that, said Erick Erickson, the publisher of RedState.org, who said he wont be participating in the conference because he wants to stay out of the conflict. The underlying question is whether the conservative movement still has strong planks for social conservatism and national security conservatism. But it has also become very personal.If youve been around this town for a long time, as I have youve got people who disagree with you substantively and youve got people who dont like you and if you hang around long enough, their numbers increase, said Keene, who dismissed many of the attacks as residing in the fever swamps of the website WorldNetDaily.Its no secret that some social conservatives are very upset at the idea that there would be any participation by any organization thats gay, but over the course of the 37 or 38 years that CPACs been in existence weve had all kinds of people suggest that other people ought to be tossed out, he said. Our mission is once a year to allow social, economic, and national security conservatives to come together.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesConservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, David Keene, GOProud, Grover Norquist, Libertarian, Republicans/GOP, Social Conservatives, the 'Right'Read morePresident Obamas Approval 1/8/11..January 8, 2011jamesb1011 commentPresident Obamas Poll numbers..From Realclearpolitics.

Many of the companies on this list are partially doomed by their industry. Airlines, cable companies, and banks for example, are often maligned by their customers. Retail firms and companies that were sensitive to downturns in the economy had to lay off significant numbers of employees during the recession, which bred resentment.But several companies you might have expected on this list arent. AIG became a pariah after its federal bailout, but it does not show up on the list thanks to high earnings over the past year, as its stock has nearly doubled. Goldman Sachs, that infamous vampire squid of Wall Street, earned a fair share of negative press and popular resentment since the credit crunch. But Goldman also ranked near the top in categories like customer satisfaction, shareholder satisfaction, employee satisfaction and CEO approval. GM has faced similar obstacles, but its also seen a spate of good news in the last few months, with profits, hires, and a successful IPO winning it more positive press coverage.More..Why am I not surprised that Bank of America tops the list?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAT&T, Bank of America, BP, Citibank, Dell, Direct TV, McDonalds, Nokia, The 15 Most Hated Companies in America, ToyotaRead moreNate Silver goes after Stu Rothenberg for a bad call.January 7, 2011jamesb1012 commentsNate is calling out Rothenberg on a call he made on April 23rd , 2009..On that date Rothenberg announced that the GOP could NOT win a majority of House seats in 2010Of course he was wrong..Silver of Fivethirtyeigth goes on to say that when Rothenberg actually started reading the polls etc. in 2010..He correctly came up with the closet GOP House gains..ButSilver wants Rothenberg to own up to the mistaken April 23rd call.Maybe he will.And maybe he wont..How Not To Take Responsibility For a Failed ForecastByNATE SILVERTheHouse race forecasts issued by Stu Rothenberg and his team on the eve of last Novembers elections performed extremely well.Not only did the Rothenberg Political Report project the overall number of Republican gains correctly  [a] likely Republican gain of 55-65 [House] seats, with gains at or above 70 seats possible, they wrote (the Republicans actually gained 63 seats in the House), but the Rothenberg team also did quite well in projecting the outcome of individual races.If you assess them one point for every missed won-loss prediction and half a point for each race in which they declined to designate a favorite and called the race a toss-up, then Mr. Rothenbergs team scored just 18 points on the night (fewer points is better), compared with 18 for Larry Sabatos forecasts; 19 for FiveThirtyEight; 29 for RealClearPolitics; 29.5 for CQ Politics; 31 for the Cook Political Report, and 33 for HuffPost Pollster (HuffPost Pollster did not issue forecasts in a few competitive races, so I assigned them the Cook Political forecast in these cases).The night after the election, once Id seen how well Rothenbergs team had done, I sent a note to Nathan Gonzales, the political editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, complimenting the team on their performance. Their forecasts have been quite reliable in the past as well, which is why we incorporate them  along with forecasts from Cook Political, CQ Politics and Mr. Sabato  into our own House race projections.Much earlier in the political cycle, however, Mr. Rothenberg had made a very silly forecast.Read moreNote .Stu Rothenberg is already out with a caution that Democrats have a better chance of retaking the House back than keep the Senate come the 2012 Elections.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Polls, UpdatesApril 23rd /2009 Rothenberg call, Macro vs Micro forcasts, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polling giants, Predictions vs Forcasts, Stu Rothenberg political reportRead moreHow about a woman replacement for Robert Gibbs as White House Press Secretary?January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsIf Im correct the last woman to hold the office was Dee Dee Myers in the Clinton Administration.Are there any good ones from Chicage available?Politics Daily has a list of a few good women to choose fromThe White House is looking for a successor to departing press secretary Robert Gibbs, and the top prospects  as usual  are men. But PoliticosMike Allen says new chief of staff Bill Daley would like a woman in the job.A woman as the face of this administration  why, that would be something new and different.The most important qualities in a press secretary include access to the president, clarity of expression, ease on camera, and good relations with reporters. The names in the mix so far are deputy press secretaries Bill Burton (whod be the first black press secretary) and Josh Earnest, and vice presidential communications director Jay Carney.Its unclear how much influence Daley will have over the choice. MSNBC says hell have input, but incoming senior adviserDavid Plouffe will lead the search and have the biggest say. Its also unclear who if any of Washingtons major female players would take the job. Some of them have spouses and-or children; at least one already knows exactly how consuming the job would be because shes already done it.Still, Plouffe et al should take this seriously. There would be no better way to dilute the Club Men impression the Obama White House gives off. Here are some possibilities, some more famous than others and some more feasible (those who are declared Democrats, for a start):Gwen Ifill.

Thats a lot of MONEY!I see they are mentioning a first thought figure of $159 Billion that they say is now the $120 BillionI wouldnt count on the savings of $39 Billion.Somehow I think that money will end up back in the budget some way..For the current fiscal year, the Obama administration has assumed about $159 billion in costs for military operations, chiefly in Afghanistan and Iraq. The new estimates now appear to reflect the double impact of pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq and also getting a better handle on stepped-up operations in Afghanistan.Nonetheless it is a very different picture than President Barack Obama had once hoped for as a candidate backed by anti-war forces in his party. In contrast with the Bush-era budgets, Obama has made a point of including some place-holder for war costs in his spending plans, but these have proven more of a gesture than any accurate forecast of the dollars needed.For example, Obamas 2011 budgetjust a year ago at this time assumed $50 billion as a placeholder for contingency war funds in 2012, less than half of what now is expected to be needed.Given the nature of war and the changing tempo of operations, even detailed, timely estimates are vulnerable to the same short-comings. In some respects, the $159 billion request for 2011 may have proven too high and the extra contingency funds became an escape valve of sorts for House and Senate Appropriations looking for ways to buy new military equipment and still cope with proposed cuts from the core defense budget.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Military, Politics, The Economy, Updates$120 Billion vs $159 Billion final number, The War budget request to CongressRead moreObamas import of more Chicago Staff as seen from Chicago.January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsThis..In response to a question I put out about Obama and his preference for more Chicago based new staff members coming to the White House.James,The Chicago crew (save Obama) is alright.Bill Daley seems to have his head screwed on and actually seems like he could be a member of my mothers large Chicago Irish family.I think if Obama is smart enough to listen to him he will be a good moderating influence (keep in mind this is coming from a Right of Center perspective) on a President who shunned Rahm for the expert opinions of Valarie Jarret (exactly what the f#*k does she know about anything again?) and political guru Axlrod, who had no more business making policy than Karl Rove.If he just sits back and listens to Daley I think his Presidency has a chance to reboundIllinois Jim.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesBill Daley, Illinois Jim @Politicaldog101, Obama 's Chicage staff choices, Valarie JarrettRead morePage 3 of 327Previous Page12345...327Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
