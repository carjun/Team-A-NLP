An American President authorises the bombing of a country with which it is not at war. The operation is undertaken not by the military but the CIA, and is concealed from Congress and the parliament of the country being bombed.Pilotless drone air strikes are conducted on average once every three days, overseen from a base in California 8,000 miles from the target. Hundreds of innocent men women and children are killed in the assault.The President is Barack Obama, the country is Pakistan, and the media scrutiny is almost invisible.Now imagine this scale of operation had been undertaken by President Bush. There would be a fierce media debate about the legality and effectiveness of the policy. This column is not to argue the rights and wrongs, a case can be made each way, it is to question why so little attention has been paid to the issue. President Obama gets away with it because his name is Barack, not George. He authorised more strikes inside Pakistan in his first nine months in the White House than George Bush did in his final three years. In 2010 the number doubled from 2009. Low estimates suggest civilians account for 30 per cent of fatalities. If Bush, who first authorised "targeting killing", was still in power, the statistics would be better known.(...)Refresh|+9 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this thread"Now imagine this scale of operation had been undertaken by President Bush.

The "glory" needs to be taken out of warfare.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCatherina      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 07:50 PMResponse to Original message41.Rec'd.
