I think it's great that they don't hate people based on sexuality, but if they took their religion seriously, they'd be marching right next to Fred Phelps. Once people start to see what there religions really teach, the hope is they can begin to free themselves, learn to think independently and without fear of imaginary punishment. 1 month agoflag  reply0ParatusThese people need to get a job.

There guys aren't reading a different Bible or anything, folks. This is all straight out of Biblical interpretation. These people didn't make up 'god hates fags,' it's all over the Bible.You just have to decide if that's the kind of morality you really believe in. If you really could see yourself teaching this to your children. Because, guess what, if you teach your kids that the Bible is any sort of guide to morality or written by some deity, this is what you stand for. 1 month agoflag  reply+2mr_brightsideThese sickos protested at my High School, chanting their hateful nonsense.

They were told by the local police that they had to be like 100 yards away from where the service was to take place. They put them in a fenced off area for "their protection". The cool thing was, that a group of bikers showed up and parked their Harleys all around the area and just revved their motors to drown out their crazy rhetoric. They were pissed to say the least. They complained to the local media that they had the right to have their voices heard, but unfortunatly for them so did the bikers. If you want to see an excellent documentary about this church seek out "Fall From Grace".

So to make sure I got all the info presented I clickrd the link and readonly the reading reiterated here. So here's my question: ExactlyWHY are they picketing her funeral ? I can understand why they'dwant to picket former Senator John Edwards, who left his seat torun with Kerry as his VP on the 2004 presidential election ticket.Both are a rum lot. As rum a lot as Bush/Cheny or McLame/Palin or Nobama/Biden. Or any of the horseshit with designer labels the corrupt political parties shoved on us as a "choice" in recentmemory. Some choice. Like having the same old dish of boiled potatoes every night for dinner. Yetch !!! But what the deuce did she ever do to those people that would motivate them to picket her funeral. She's always been portrayed as the jilted wife, and a victim of a louse substitute for a decent man. What political causes did she ever espouse that escaped my attention ? 1 month agoflag  reply0DougChristian  PressCore:It's not so much a statement about Mrs. Edwards. The point is just to make a scene to keep themselves in the news, so the more inappropriate the better from their point of view. These guys do this at funerals of soldiers who have much less to do with the political causes they oppose than Elizabeth does. She was an outspoken liberal and her death is high profile. That's more than enough for them. 1 month agoflag  reply0sarasarasara  PressCore:I read in the paper that it was because she has a "whore" husband and she supported gay rights or something. :/Not valid.
