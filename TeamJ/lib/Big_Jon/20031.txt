Florida and 42 other states have passed versions of Jessicas Law, mandating minimum sentences for child rapists.A bill was written that would require increased prison sentences, electronic tracking of all convicted sex offenders on probation, and the mandatory use of state databases by all local probation officials so that known sex offenders could not avoid the scrutiny of law enforcement.  The Jessica Lunsford Act was quickly approved and signed into law by Governor Jeb Bush on May 2, 2005.  The law took effect on September 1.Although Massachusetts claimed they would get tough on child molesters and rapists, joining 42 other states in passing a version of Jessicas law calling for mandatory minimum prison sentences, in fourteen months only one person has been sentenced under it as of Jan. 09, 2010. Why are they going easy on them? Why? My hub on Judge Katherine Savage you must read. She let the man walk who confessed to raping a 7 year old relative, the little girl told the police he did and not only did she let him go, I can find no where anyone went to get that child to protect her! Is there any reason to think he has stopped? Even the child told he raped her, black mailed her in order to do it, shouldn't that be another charge? That judge deserves to be locked up with him, not that I think she would tempt him. Really though if someone finds he is still at it, not only he but that judge deserves life!Why isnt it enough that an adult forces his body inside the body of a 3-year-old? Why isnt that enough for a mandatory punishment? asks former prosecutor Wendy Murphy who worked with lawmakers to draft stronger language that never made it into law. http://www.patriotledger.com/news/cops_and_courts/x1530316728/Law-goes-easy-on-many-child-rapistsHow many times have we heard this? Other times, other girls, women, and tiny babies. How long will we allow it to go on? Is it that men mostly run the world and they have no idea what rape is? What is it going to take? Everyone wants an appropriate sentence. I want them castrated! Castrated or killed and don't wait ten to twenty years to do it! It is the only way to know they wont do it again.Let me make myself clear, I personally have heard of a young boy who has been having sex with a much younger girl and I have the idea they possibly even slept in the house of her parents with their knowledge, she gets mad or jealous and they run and yell rape and then when they see what this means they change their mind and tell the law the truth but too late nowlaw is law. He is in serious trouble, his life is over. He is a registered sex offender and everyone knows that is not so, even the law! Maybe the judge will go easy (and maybe not!) and I hope so. Why is it no one in law or government have half a brain, or heart. We all know what I am talking and certainly they do, but these judges have no rules or laws apparently treating rapes of women and especially little children like it's nothing!Well we know this happens and years ago I would not allow my children to hang at a local mall because girls as young as ten I know, are dressed like hookers and acting like them too. You think their parents don't know it? That is not what I am talking about here although all parents should certainly warn their sons along with their daughters! I can have pity too, when it is deserved, but we know the kind of man I am here to talk about. A rapist. Castration being the only answer to quench their thirst, and protect all females. I know this law is all we need! I just know simply having the law will give these perverted people second thoughts. It is the only solution, we all know that. They are not going to change. Tell me of one, please. I am sorry they are the way they are, rapists and murderers and they get too much leniency and I have to wonder why. What about all these Catholic Priest? I have heard nothing since all those scandals. Shouldn't they be castrated, even if the church hides them away somewhere, does that make anyone near them safe. I wouldn't leave them with my goat. Male or female. They can't help themselves, they are animals too, but animals are not running around raping everything near it. So they are worse than animals! Any adult who rapes or sodomizes a child should be castrated if DNA proves it without a doubt, no second chances for what justice that child deserves! Rape and murder first time proven, death penalty.  A second raped proved without a doubt, even with no murder, death sentence within six weeks, give him time to settle his affairs and feel the same fears and terrors awhile as he put these children through. What is in a judges mind that sees this any differently and I have to seriously wonder about them.If castration is not 100%, then make the penis only usable for urination but I am quite sure I have never once heard of a fixed male dog start mating again in all my life so maybe the Vet should do the surgery.Many of the sex offenders become homeless because of the restrictions of where they can live, they say. We have homeless children and whole families, who worries about them? If these offenders are castrated who has to worry? Is this sick of me? It is too bad when a rabid dog must be killed but what can you do? No one feels sorry for them do they? They cant help how they are but we must protect ourselves knowing they will do what they cant help. We could put them to sleep and just pull their teeth. Makes sense to me, more so than letting a rapist loose on the world. They want permanent housing for these parolees. That sounds really fair. I think people who come up with these ideas are just as sick. The criminals always seem to be the most protected and shown concern for. Lets do all we can for them with our tax money, what about the victims? Are there any free programs for rape victims or special worries for them if they are even still alive?  http://homelessness.change.org/blog/view/homeless_sex_offenders_isolation_isnt_the_answer There is a rape every two minutes in America, almost 800,000 in the last two years.(That we know of.) Now what does that tell us about how many rapists are out there and these are the ones we know about. They even claim most rapists are not repeat offenders so that tells me we have nearly 800,000 rapists running around in the United States! Yes we really should worry about them becoming homeless. Maybe they should be used as guinea pigs, used in some way to help our economy, but don't ever let them loose if you don't fix them first, or even if you do!! One third of juvenile victims are under six years old, only babies, but let's worry about the rapist's rights and where they might sleep. Shouldn't there be a special punishment for raping babies? These people who are so lenient and care less about our children (I'm talking about law makers and judges here) will answer to God one day, I have not one doubt of that. But that does not protect all from rapist and/or murderers now.Chronic headaches, fatigue, sleep disturbance, recurrent nausea, decreased appetite, eating disorders, menstrual pain, sexual dysfunction, suicide attempts, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV transmission risk, clinically depressed, social phobia, and psychological problems stay as long as fifteen years in many victims after the assault, it is said, and I personally would like to know whos guess that is. It just leaves after fifteen years? I would say never! Do we worry about a program for the victims? Will someone be there once the rapists is caught and sentenced, if and/or when, to see to this females needs and rights? Will her needs be provided or worried about?http://www.paralumun.com/issuesrapestats.htm Should the sex offender be invited to sit in when the rape victim is getting help? Depending on if he only did this once? (Or caught once!) Would this be safe for him? Here we go again, the criminals rights! I do not believe so much of what I am finding; looking for what is done for the victim. Would these people actually try to convince a victim to sit with her rapist to make things right for him and if so lets look at all of what would be best for him!? Get real! We have some real loo loos making some serious suggestions and/or laws! Whoever suggested this is one sick person and deserves to be locked up with the rapist. Then lets see what they think.http://www.nsvrc.org/blog/bystander/2326 As I watch Jaycee Dugard, everyone wanting to turn her return into a reality show, all I can think of is that couple who did this, is there a punishment bad enough, and now she has children she loves belonging to her rapist and she cant even realize what has actually happened to her. She has never been allowed to even grow up, but she will probably be OK in fifteen more years. Right? Let's go easy on that old sick man. Nothing would surprise me.The law is not tough enough on true rapists, plain and simple, and although I doubt if there could be a rare reason castration shouldnt be done, in my book they deserve to be fixed-for good. No more rapes, no desires, so let the judge let a man get only a slap on the wrist for raping a baby, but mandate castration, at least he wont do that again! I think it should be law! Or only have women judges when it comes to rape because it sounds as if the male judges have no idea or have a problem themselves understanding what rape really is. But then, do they understand murder either?I do not buy rape being a hate crime and not a sex crime, look at the ones that keep these victims for years for sexual gratification. Even young boys, just whoever the sex addict desires. We have to all let our judicial system know we have had enough of leniency for these men who are on this earth for one purpose only and will never change! Separate and redo the law not looking at teens having consensual sex with the same punishment as a hardened criminal and repeat sex offender. Do we have more sense than the lawmakers? I think we do, they tie their own hands and let these horrible monsters loose continually and have a boy listed as a sex offender who had sex with a willing partner. Alright, it's against the law, but we are talking about two different things here and we know it, why can't they make the law according to that? So many people against barbaric punishment, what about the punishment these young children and babies are getting, with the monsters doing this all being protected. We really have some ignorant, heartless people running this world, and try as I may I cannot understand the sickness of this type of thinking.Of interest in castration>                 http://eunuchinfo.com/methods.html vote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...? Useful Funny Awesome Beautiful Castration: Castration Crusade Update/ 7 yr old girl gang raped!CommentsBkCreative10 months ago This just leaves me so numb - it happens over and over and over. And jail is nothing at all to these rapists and murderers. I was reading about a piece of human garbage who raped and beat a woman - and then you look at his arrest record - most of his life he has been a violent degenerate but he is back on the streets - again and again.You may have heard that a so-called sex offender here in NYC was just given the job as the superintendent of a building and had keys to everyone's apartment. He is still on the job. What women need to do is understand that they have a right to protect themselves in this case - and put their own lock on the door - always.Even if castration does not stop the act of rape - at least it will bring on some pain - and pain is a must here. What ever happened to an eye for an eye? Rape a child but you don't get raped? We are a nation that blames the victim - that in itself is outrageous and part of the problem. Folks immediately start asking 'why did she let him' or 'where were the parents?' True we have to protect but let's look at the monsters here. Good grief!And we have to stop cleaning up the label - you'll notice I did not use the term of the day - sex offender. This person is not a sex offender - let's call them baby rapers, or child murderers - why euphemisms when it comes to these predators?Thanks for taking a stand!Pollyannalana10 months ago Thank you so much for all you have said and you may be the first to agree, I think what makes me the angriest are these judges who seem to consider rape a little fist fight! Id like to see a few of them get raped...are you listening rapists?Sandyspider10 months ago I know it is harsh, but I think physical castration should be done to these monsters.Pollyannalana10 months ago Not one bit harsher than the babies and little girls they rape, it is the answer, I have thought so for years, but would a male judge, no, he thinks maybe six years, if that. I think its time these judges have some classes on rape, why do they not see it as bad as a shooting or stabbing? They are ignorant or have low opinions of the female!Shlomo SL Abrin10 months ago I agree with your sentiments, but worry about the slippery slope and other problems that come from reactionary justice. What's to stop law enforcement from removing other limbs that commit crimes? Shoplifters get their hands cut off? I do not mean to compare rape to shoplifting, but in some countries, this is exactly what happens! In fact, those countries also treat rape with less concern than they do crimes on property.Would you say that a rapist should lose his penis after the first rape and incarceration or should he get at least once chance to behave himself? What about the dozens of men convicted of rape that are later, sometimes years later, proven innocent by DNA? Would you also 'castrate' a woman who has sex with an underage boy? What about cases where the couple is underage, the parents don't approve and they file charges anyhow just to get rid of the boy?The beauty, and sometimes frustration, of our legal system is that it is somewhat balanced on the side of the accused and the convicted. This isn't about THEM, rather about us. A person imprisoned is no threat to the free, but the knee jerk vigilantism of the free threatens everyone because suddenly, there becomes a world where justice is swift, but mistakes cannot never be corrected.Legalize prostitution in the US and you will see a drop in rapes. The more we restrict sexual impulses, the more those impulses turn to rage and violence.Child rapists should, however, be removed from society indefinitely. Anyone who is so out of control or driven by lust as to not be able to restrain himself from raping a child is a little too sick and dangerous to be walking the streets.Pollyannalana10 months ago I believe if you read my story good you would see I have made it completely clear that I am talking about a proven rapist and I will never change my mind on that, I don't think we ever have to worry about the law being too harsh in America,(actually our crooks in the government get a free holiday!) murder and rape seems to go with small sentences, I am always shocked to know that soon they will be right back at it, possible more careful next time. I posted another story last night, about a guy who should have still been in jail instead of free to kill his wife and run off with her 7 year old daughter, we can only imagine what that baby is going through if she is even living. I will never back down, something HAS to be done, SOON. You may have a point though, why should we give them free medical, food and a place to live...electrocute them, that would make me happy knowing what they are here on earth to do! Legalize prostitution will prevent rape? Would legalizing child pornography stop rape of children? I think NOT!loua10 months ago When it dawns on society that it is its brother's keeper...Humanity is as civil as the whole of its creation...You see we all want independence freedom; but refuse the responsibility associated with obtaining them...  Wars are  acts of greed as is punishment...You see when we are in three degrees of balance with the world none of the atrocities can occur; but it requires a commitment to the unity of (inclusive, selfless civility) which will neutralize all the negative behavior of the world...The learned negative behavior of humanity does not allow for the implementation of a democratic constitution of self-rule, so it is doubtful it has the capacity to reason the utility of inclusive selfless civility; but it is the answer whether one can comprehend it or not...Look, people act out the repressed anxiety that society programs into them...  Change the programing and so goes the behavior, simple...   Leave your wanton greed at the doorway of hell and the world will be fine; create a system of governance that provides this mechanism - self-rule of Democracy...Pollyannalana10 months ago Well I will allow your say, and wait for someone to tell me this isn't like ring around the roses, there is never going to be a perfect world where we can change a rapist into a loving goody two shoes if that is your point,(until this world of flesh is over anyway) and no matter how he got the way he did, we all have choices we all know right from wrong, I still say you hold a knife up to these rapist and say "go ahead punk, make my day" meaning if they rape they get the wack job, they will think twice...I feel sure. We do not live in a perfect world and never could until all people such as murderers and rapists are gone or fixed..I could be happy all the time if I didn't see every day what crooks get by with.loua10 months ago There will never be a perfect world if it is not directed to let it to evolve in accordance with inclusive, selfless and civil principles...Simply to dismiss bad behavior as incurable is to acknowledge defeat as does the all types of punishment; if punishment and warring were the correct responses these things should have been resolved ages ago, but that is not the case...As long as the attitude is that some else must solve the problem or that there is no solution except to demonize people like they did during the Inquisition, then there will be no civil answers...The simple difficult answers and solutions requires facing the need for change and commence to implementing these changes...  You see the philosophy of the Constitution was sought and found but the change was never implemented so we have what resulted; the failure of a half baked idea...To extricate humans from society only fails the acid test of the humanity you think exist, which is for naught; because you refuse to accept the innate responsibility for implementing the inclusive, selfless and civil behavior necessary for the declaration of such a society...Its a lesson that humanity does not want to learn and it will impede its understanding that perfection is outcome of the process of evolving... So to say humanity is not perfect is to acknowledge it is not evolving...  On this I will agree...Pollyannalana10 months ago Where has evolution brought us to so far? Maybe you aren't from the U.S., maybe you aren't from this world, in this world I look at those little girls faces and I think of what they have been through, so many.. and little boys too, and women... over 800,000 in two years, but you don't have to worry, no man will let this be the answer unless we women do something about it, in fact you have given me so much to think about I may see just what is going on about that, I know it is not just me upset, I have never had this happen to me or any of mine, I can just imagine the rage the people who have had this in their life have though and for rotten judges who treat it almost as a misdemeanor. Law enforcers who know a sex offender has married someone with a child and did not go get her? I have read that judges are ex-lawyers and that is where the problem lies, I think it is that most men couldn't possible comprehend the horror of this crime, there's no other reason I can see for the leniency. Maybe we should find out just how much of our tax dollars have gone to help with " selfless and civic principles." for these evil devils, to no avail, I'm sure that that has been a waste however much it's been and yes lets help the crooks let's do that as we always have and forget helping the vicims, that's the way it has been so far..great job there. You apparently have no wife or daughters.loua10 months ago Do not get me wrong I am as appalled as you are about these atrocities...Demonizing the perpetrators is not going to solve the problem; changing the behavior of society will...It takes diligence in dealing with the root cause of the behavior...   When you discover the reason why these people become such predators you will see it is because of the social deviation that takes place right in front of your eyes; and is  taken for granite as a sad fact of life...Behavior is a learned trait, by repeated stimulus eliciting a response...   Give no respect get no respect  is a key model... All the atrocities have to do with this fundamental notion...Individuals need to be taught and given responsibility and respect or they will act out in many peculiar ways...   The atrocities are the extreme cases; but all deviation is a result of the lack of training and commitment to creating an evolved civil behavior...Pollyannalana10 months ago I understand all you are saying, and yes it would be perfect if that was the way it was-but it is not. Simply said I am assuming you have as much sympathy for the criminal as the victim and some how we are all responsible for not preventing him from becoming this person, but he is and my sympathies are not nor ever will be for him. There are many that probably  grew up with the same abuse and neglect and did not take it out on others, they used their choice not to, the same as the criminal,rapist murderer. I have no pity nor anything more to say about it here, although I am not finished with the research. by far.Shlomo SL Abrin10 months ago This is a dangerous mindset.If one doesn't use a hand in the approved manner, we chop it off. If one doesn't use genitalia in the approved manner, we chop it off. If one doesn't use the head (thinks) in the approved manner, we chop that off, too. Is that where this leads?re: sister or daughterI think the comment that one might feel more strongly if one had a female relative is a low blow. First of all, my wife was a child victim of rape in a time, not too long ago, when such crimes were seldom reported and victims were almost never believed. She DISAGREES 100% with your idea of 'justice' via castration.Secondly, imagine for a moment that it is your father, brother, or husband who stands falsely accused of child rape. Let's say there is a really good circumstantial case or perhaps an overzealous prosecutor and police who stretch the evidence to fit the charges. Let's say your family can't afford to have evidence reviewed impartially or you have to rely on a public defender.Now, your beloved male relative gets castrated. Sometime, later, DNA proves him innocent or another man confesses to the crime. All this, AFTER the system castrated your loved one.The penis cannot be reattached after we remove it. The justice system, a huge unfeeling behemoth, cannot be trusted with subtleties and nuance. We should not ever take any action we cannot remedy should we find ourselves mistaken in our eagerness to mete out justice.Pollyannalana10 months ago He who has ears let him hear, I am talking about proven without a doubt and usually repeat offenders, and my opinion will never change. I have these innocent little babies in my mind and heart and the torture they endure, I don't know what is in your mind but you have a right to your opinion. For once in my life I get to scream it if I want for these innocent victims and I always will. If I had a relative who did this I would feel the same if he was a rapist or murderer, if families would do something about it when knowing a family member is this sort of criminal, many lives would be saved as in the Lester Hobbs case. Now they fear for their lives from this brother and son. His own brother thinks death is what he deserves, I only want him to feel the torture he has put on his victims and he will..in this life or the next.thooghun9 months ago This is a crushing issue. I confess that I don't know where I stand. I don't subscribe to revenge, but justice must be harsher than it presently is. I'll need to think on it.Pollyannalana9 months ago Well anything you do to them could be called revenge, but if that part of them is causing their problem then we should fix it for them. Mercy for them and their victims. Look how many days that little girl has been gone and we know how horrible it is being for her if she is even still alive. How anyone could defend this man is beyond any reasoning!thooghun9 months ago The difference between revenge and justice is intent. I try not to fight fire with fire, but there needs to be a serious deterrent.Pollyannalana9 months ago Castration is really too good for some. Jessica Lunsford was taken from her home by John Couey, to his trailer 100 yards from her home. She was kept in his bed and raped that night he admits and again the next morning and then put in his closet while he went to work. Three days later after who knows what he talked her into getting in two trash bags saying he was taking her home but in fact buried her alive. She had poked a hole with two fingers through the bags the coroner said but cause of death was listed as suffocation...after all else she had been through. I cannot ask God to have mercy on the soul of this demon for any reason, much less the law! What is castration compared to what he did to her? Please tell me!Aslans Princess8 months ago I totally agree with you.  I get that you're talking about real brutal merciless rape. Castration MIGHT be too good.  When I think about that precious baby poking a hole with her fingers, trying to grasp breath and reality of what's going on to her... It makes me ill, takes my breath away. My heart broke watching her father through this.  I loved his strength in looking at this monster during the trial. THAT SHE DIED ALONE LIKE THIS BECAUSE OF THIS MONSTER! And this is only one incident...Keep preaching it, sister!!! LOL!Pollyannalana8 months ago Don't worry I will, I have no fear from anyone who thinks this is no big deal, it only makes me have one thought about them. We have to stand up for these victims dead or alive and make this stop! I think the threat and reality finally of Castration will do it and that is ALL that will do it.*I would like to add for those who do not know, castration has to do with the testicles, not the penis.MelindaGilman8 months ago i say cut it all off.. all the need is a pee hole..Pollyannalana8 months ago Don't think I haven't thought that too. They deserve some pain.stagnetto7 months ago Hello Pollyannalana, after reading your hub and all the comments I can only add that I utterly believe in castration but as you added castration has only to do with the testicles and so something has to be done with the penis so that they can no longer put it ever again where it harms any kind of female.  Maybe the penis could be shortened and as MelindaGilman said, just leave enough to be able to pee but not be able to insert into anything.Pollyannalana7 months ago Well I believe a doctor could manage a castration that could prevent a rise anywhere, I believe I could, you just have to look at one of those babies faces and you know it CAN be done.Or kill them...all the same to me. Sorry if I sound mad at you. lol These monsters just get me so very mad and at the people who don't seem to take this serious enough.Pam5 months ago Well I think that women who chose to circumcise their boys should have their clitorises CUT OFF!!  Circumcision is rape of the worst kind!!Pollyannalana5 months ago Well this is not a hub on circumcision and circumcision is not castration. Maybe we could have the clitorises cut off on the females who molest young boys, like several female teachers have, being fair to what I feel DNA proved men rapists should get and not chemically (just chop chop being no worse than the pain they put these small children and babies through)) and having women punished equally. As for circumcision you will have to take that up with God, He came up with that rule for the Jew and why I have no idea but I never question what God demands.Pollykrenfrey995 months ago With you 100% Pollyannalana,I think chemical castration let's them off lightly,they should be physically castrated if it was up to me. Too many people championing the rights of criminals.What about the victims,mentally scarred for life.You can bet these do gooders would have a different perspective if it happened to their daughter.Pollyannalana5 months ago Thank you. My thoughts exactly and if they didn't (as some don't even if it happened to a loved one of theirs) you really have to wonder about them. Look at all the cost of chemical too besides not being 100% done and sure. Always something to cost us and I believe if we had the choice which we should it would be for help for the victims. I guess because we have so many crooks in our legal system they have to look out in case they are ever caught up in something, why else would their pity go to a crook?Linda2 months ago I completely agree with you Polly. Castration is the answer : most appropriate punishment for rapists. Unfortunately our criminal justice system has been created and managed by men. Thousands of women become victims of rapes everyday. I believe if castration of rapists becomes a law, women will be much safer in this world.QudsiaP16 weeks ago Heinous crimes if and when proven, deserve heinous and memorable punishments.Castrate one rapist and others will think at least twice before releasing their wild animal side on innocent little children.CAUTION : THE COMMENT BELOW IS VERY GRAPHIC, PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN WILL.Let me tell you of an event, about 15 years ago, kidnapping and torturing of young children was very dominant. There was a man who would kidnap young children by bribing them with candies. Once kidnapped, he would shave the heads, rape the children, make them unconscious and then drop them in acid and actually watch them dissolve to the bone.When the man was finally caught, the judge was so appalled, that he sentenced this psyco rapist to the same fate that he had given to dozens of children.All kinds of people came ahead saying it was inhuman etc etc. The judge refused to change his sentence. The psycho rapist suicided the night before his death sentence.The announcement of the judge to give that criminal what he deserved spread such a shock wave that it practically ended the long stream of kidnapping and murdering of children that was taking place.An eye for an eye is a fair system, keeps people in balance. The next example I will give is of Saudi Arabia, this was a country known for its justice, so much so that the crime rate was practically nil, why you ask? Because a thief's hands would get cut off, if he is proven guilty, while a rapist, drug trafficker and a murderer are openly sentenced to death. Where the crowd is invited to watch the horror.This is done to inflict FEAR in the hearts and minds of people who might even think of any criminal behaviour.I will agree that if one rapist is castrated, there will be an instant drop in rapes, may it be for children or adults.A rapist continues his nasty ways because he is NOT afraid to go to jail, maybe he even might enjoy knowing new criminals and increasing his PR in the criminal universe.--------------------------------------------------------The prisons today are perhaps the best breeding ground for such criminals. Every now and  then I hear that the prisons are overcrowded.STOP putting them in prison and START punishing them in a manner that scares the evil out of evil people.Pollyannalana6 weeks ago Linda>You should read my Judge Savage hub,this is a female judge, the man admits the rape and she sends him free to go back to raping the little girl they have talked to and know what he is doing! She should go to prison!Pollyannalana6 weeks ago You have said it, QudsiaP1 and we all know that, I will never understand anyone who can feel sorry for any of these evil devils yet in America anyway, they have all the rights and they never get what is due them. Complete castration will stop it and many would be I am sure!Anaya M. Baker6 weeks ago Love your suggestion that the vets should handle it! While they're at it, they might as well stick the offender in a locked crate while they recover!I like the fact that you differentiate between sickos and kids who have inappropriate sex. Some people think that we should go easier on sex offenders because of the consentual statitory rape cases. I say we need to do everything in our power to keep sex offenders from doing it again. It is a sickness, not a lack of judgement. An 18 year old boy who has sex or other physical relations with a 13 or 14 year old girl, or a 23 year old dating a 17 year old high school girl is inappropriate and out of line, not a sick individual that will continue to prey on younger women throughout his life. The law needs to make a clear difference between these very different cases, and punish the ones who have the sickness as harshly as possible, as well as moniter them CLOSELY for the rest of their lives-though personally I think life imprisonment is the best solution.Pollyannalana6 weeks ago Anaya that is so true and these judges let so many walk or give them just a couple of years and you know this has to be like murder to a child! I think citizens should get to vote on the outcome for these sickos. Thanks for reading!Pollyahorseback6 weeks ago Hey Polly , Happy holidays , I agree with your writing, The problem though isn't the judges and lawyers specificly, It is directly the fault of a society that is too soft on ALL crime. I actually cant believe how many people say , in effect , Oh , thats to harsh a punishment. Juries are ineffective in punishment today , theres always one soft hearted idealistic  freak in the group that doesn't want to Believe that the pigs in the suit at the defence table  did the  crime and the criminals know it , the judges know it , the lawyers know it. And SOCIETY knows it. America is soft on crime , we have to face up to the fact that , Like everything else , If you are not a VICTIM of violent crime , you can't know the need for justice. I believe juries should be made up of victims of crime .....I believe defence should be paid for by the perps , and that judges should go back to sensitivity classes with courses  made up of victims of crime. And , I am a carpenter by trade , if I dont do a job correctly..... I dont get paid.... When a perp commits another crime the judge , attourneys  and the prosecutors shouldn't get paid either. ....Thats why I can only shake my head.....and wish for more vigilantes in our society. But I can hear the "liberal" intellectual elements now, OHHHHH , look at the poor rapist hanging in the tree!Pollyannalana6 weeks ago Been trying to answer you since early this morning but my reply goes no where. I was just saying a female Judge Savage let this man walk away free who was raping this little girl that was in the same home with him and with everyone fighting her about it which I assumed to be police, lawyers, some in that field because the man confessed and as far as I know no one went to take the child from the home! Things like this God will just have to forgive me if I am wrong and I am not sure I am but I will be glad to see people like that get theirs come judgment day. Thanks for stopping by and reading.PollyQudsiaP15 weeks ago In reference to Anaya M. Baker's comment, do you know that some cultures actually force their young daughters to marry men 10 or more years older than them.The sons are very happy because they are bringing innocent submissive little girls who will be overwhelmed by everyone and live like a church mouse with out ever voicing their opinion.Pollyannalana5 weeks ago Nothing surprises me Qudsia, did you know many countries have the clitoris cut off girls and other genital parts if not completely all like North Africa, SE Asia, Middle East, many places in the name of religion or tradition. No body need tell me there won't be a hell for these devils!Silva Hayes33 hours ago I am not sure that castration is the answer.  I would be afraid that some of them would still do awful things to little children because child molesters and rapists are mentally twisted and in my opinion cannot be rehabilitated.  Here's my answer:  For the child rapists, child molesters, child murderers, pedophiles -- who are guilty beyond any doubt; (theyre on video doing the crime, their DNA samples match, there are several impartial eye witnesses, they have confessed to the crime, etc., etc.) the sentence I would impose is to load them in the belly of a big cargo plane, fly out over the Atlantic Ocean on an as-needed basis, and about 200 miles off-shore, open the bay doors. Oh, and take the Judge with the first load (you know who I'm referring to).  Note to the citizens who want to protect the child murderers, rapists, molesters and provide them with homes -- please note that I said that I would advocate this solution for the ones who are guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.  I do not want our tax dollars spent feeding, clothing, and housing these criminals in prison for life, and I certainly don't want them turned loose to do it again, so my solution is a good one.  It's fair; they have more of a chance at survival than a little girl buried alive in a plastic bag.Pollyannalana33 hours ago You said it and I always say when proven without a doubt and really have to wonder about people who want to protect those!
