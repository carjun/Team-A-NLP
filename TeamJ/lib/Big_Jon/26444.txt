Legislators in the Kremlin-controlled parliament hadsaid before the Senate landmark ruling on Wednesday that they would approve the treaty quickly after it is ratified in the U.S., the AP reports. Lower house speaker Boris Gryzlov, however, told reporters Thursday that the Senates ratification resolution contained some conditions and the legislators need to carefully study the text before making their decision.But Gryzlov added, If these conditions dont change the text of the treaty, we may pass a ratification bill even tomorrow.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Military, Politics, UpdatesRussian ratification, START TreatyRead moreThank You Mr. President.Democrats and YesRepublicans.December 23, 2010jamesb101No commentsThank You Mr. PresidentFor taking a hit from the Mid-Terms and doubling down and moving ahead WITH the GOPThank You for turning away from the Liberals and the Tea PartyAnd finding a middle like the American people want you toThank you for sticking to it and getting the Healthcare Bill.Thank you for making the Planet safer with your push for START.I promise to think twice before threateningto take my Hillary signs out of the closet again.Thank you DemocratsFor jumping off the cliff on Healthcare.You did the right thing.Thank you for going along with YOUR party leader and OUR President in the last week on so many Bills.And Finally..Thank you Republicans.For focusing the President on what was important.Thank you for bringing a reality check to the Democratic left wing that lives sometimes in Oz..Thank you for NOT following Senator DeMint and the other knuckleheads with Just Vote NoThank you cutting the deals with Your President and Ours.This Dog wanted to get this out.Because someone had to say this.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Healthcare, Law, Military, Politics, UpdatesCongress, Democrats, President Obama, republicans, Thank YouRead moreThe Lame Duck 111th Congress was busy..December 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsThe Capitol building stands in Washington, D.C.(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)While the US Congress took almost all of its last year wrestling with HealthcareThe last few days have been feverishThe list of accomplishments have been surprisingly goodHeres the few I can remember.Feel free to add more to my list which I will update..The Stimulus.The Wall Street Economic Reform BillThe Healthcare BillThe Obama Tax Deal ..Dont AskDont Tell Repeal.The Defense Budget.The 9/11 Healthcare BillThe START Treaty ratificationTwo Supreme Court Justices The Food Inspection Bill.The College Education BillThe Pay Equity Bill***However history judges the 535 men and women in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate the past two years, one thing is certain: The 111th Congress made more law affecting more Americans since the Great Society legislation of the 1960s.For the first time since PresidentTheodore Roosevelt began the quest for a national health-care system more than 100 years ago, the Democrat-led House and Senate took the biggest step toward achieving that goal by giving 32 million Americans access to insurance. Congress rewrote the rules for Wall Street in the most comprehensive way since the Great Depression. It spent more than $1.67 trillion to revive an economy on the verge of a depression, including tax cuts for most Americans, jobs for more than 3 million, construction of roads and bridges and investment in alternative energy; ended an almost two-decade ban against openly gay men and women serving in the military, and today ratified a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia.Before adjournment today, Congress approved legislation to help rescuers and clean-up crews suffering from illnesses linked to the wreckage caused by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. The Senate approved it on a voice vote, the House by a vote of 206-60. New York SenatorsCharles Schumer andKirsten Gillibrand, in a statement, called it a Christmas miracle.For all of its ambitious achievement, the 111th Congress, which may adjourn this week, also witnessed a voter-backlash driven by a 9.6 percentunemployment rate that cost Democrats control of the House and diminished their Senate majority.This is probably the most productive session of Congress since at least the 60s, saidAlan Brinkley, a historian at New Yorks Columbia University. Its all the more impressive given how polarized the Congress has been.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Media, Men, Military, Other Things, Politics, The Economy, Updates, WomenDon't Ask...Don't Tell Repeal, Lame Duck 111th Congress, President Obama, The 9/11 Healthcare Bill., The College Education Bill, The Defense Budget, The Food Inspection Bill, The Healthcare Bill, The House, The Obama Tax Deal, The Pay Equity Bill, The Senate, The START Treaty ratification, The Stimulus, The Wall Street Economic Reform Bill, Two Supreme Court JusticesRead moreThe Army tries to buy Mi-17 Russian Helos for Afghainstan at a 50% markup.The Navy does better, and fasterDecember 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsDont you get a Government discount if you buy in bulk?Oh, Yea I forgot.Its OUR money these people are spendingThey dont care..At least that what it seems the Army has doneThe Navy seems to have done a bit better on the price.And MUCH better on delivery times..Listen I dont care that they are buying Mi-17s.Thats what they use over thereAnd those birds are probably better suited for themSimply made and not as finicky as US choppers.But the money thing is starting to get to meIf the Army cant get their shit togetherLet the Navy do itAs Strategy Page put it in an excellent commentary in December:Three months ago, the U.S. Navy began evaluating proposals in a competition for 21 additional Mi-17 aircraft for Afghanistan. The estimated value of this acquisition is $300400 million. The navy requirement was tailored to ensure only civil variant Mi-17s were being procured. While the navy expected the usual sour grapes protests from U.S. helicopter manufacturers, they did not expect the ban on Rosoboronexport to be lifted, or that the U.S. Army would combine efforts with Rosoboronexport in an attempt to cancel the competition.The U.S. Army had conducted two previous sole source acquisitions of Mi-17s; twenty one for Iraq and ten for Afghanistan. These programs have experienced more than $40 million in overruns, had the performance requirements reduced, and are respectively two years and one year behind schedule. The Navy, however, conducted an open competition for four new Mi-17 aircraft and delivered them in less than 50 days, at a price 40 percent lower than the Armys sole source price. The Army did not want to see another Navy success, and the opening of the Rosoboronexport channel gave the Army a new plan.Now, we hear the same office inked a deal with the Russian state arms office (oh yeah, Im sure thats not a shady place) for Mi-17s at $18 million each, or 100 percent over their $9 million drive away price from the factory. Our source tells us the Navy inked a small deal last year for four Mi-17s at $11 million each.And those were delivered within three months.Read more:http://defensetech.org/#ixzz18u5dmyWGDefense.orgShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Military, The Economy, Updates30 to 50 day deliever for the Navy, 50% over cost and late delivery, Afghanistan and Iraq Air Force Helo's, The Navy and Army buy Mi-17 HelosRead moreDefense bill clears Congress also.December 22, 2010jamesb101No comments[ The Pentagon the Headquarters of the US Military......]From Politico.In the final hours of its lame-duck session on Wednesday, Congress gave final approval to a bill to set defense policy and authorize funding for the Pentagon, staving off potential criticism about the relevance of the House and Senate Armed Services committees.If the fiscal 2011 defense authorization bill, now headed to President Barack Obama for his signature, had failed to overcome one of the many roadblocks in its way, it would have been the first failure to approve such a measure in nearly 50 years.On voice votes, first the Senate, then the House approved a new version of a scaled-down bill, ending what had become an unusually rocky road for the annual authorizationMore.This from The Hill.Senators removed a provision authorizing payments to residents of Guam who suffered or lost relatives under Japanese military occupation in World War II. Language repealing the ban on gays serving openly in the military, which had kept the bill stalled in the upper chamber because of GOP opposition, was also stripped.The bill does include a ban on the transfer of military detainees from the prison at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba  a blow to the Obama administration, which has yet to make good on a promise to shutter the facility.Senate Democrats and Republicans passed the bill by unanimous consent after negotiating late into the night Tuesday. If the measure had failed, it would have been the first time in 48 years Congress did not pass a defense authorization.This is the bill slightly reduced to eliminate some of the controversial provisions, which would have prevented us from getting to this point, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said.He noted that 90 percent to 95 percent of the bill remains from what we worked so hard on in committee on a bipartisan basis.This bill will improve the quality of life of our men and women in uniform and give them the tools that they need to remain the most effective fighting force in the world. It will improve the acquisition and management of the Department of Defense and address important issues of cyber security and energy security, Levin said in a statement.The legislation includes funding for a 1.4 percent across-the-board pay raise for service members; authorizes healthcare coverage for the children of military personnel up to the age of 26; and provides $11.6 billion to train and equip the Afghan National Army and police forces.It also supplies $9.8 billion for the U.S. Special Operations Command and funding for programs to reintegrate low-level insurgent fighters in Afghan society.In addition, the bill extends the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund to bolster the Pakistan army in its war against radical insurgents, and provides funding to reimburse Pakistan and other nations that cooperate in U.S. operations..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Military, The Economy, UpdatesCongress vote for passage, The Defense Authorization BillRead moreToday in Congress.12/22/10.December 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsBy David Waldman @Dailykos.In the House, courtesy of theOffice of the Majority Leader:FLOOR SCHEDULE FOR WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 2010House Meets At: 11:00 a.m.: Legislative BusinessFirst Vote Predicted: 12:00  1:00 p.m.Last Vote Predicted: Evening***Members are advised that further information about the schedule will be announced as it becomes availableOne MinutesPossible Motion to Concur in the Senate Amendment toH.R. 847  James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act (Rep.

This is a very good day.No longer will our country be denied the service of thousands of patriotic Americans who were forced to leave the military, regardless of their skills, no matter their bravery or their zeal, no matter their years of exemplary performance, because they happen to be gay, he said. No longer will tens of thousands of Americans in uniform be asked to live a lie.Obama was joined on stage by Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen, Sens. Joe Lieberman, Susan Collins and Harry Reid and Reps. Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and Patrick Murphy, an Iraq War veteran who had pushed for DADT repeal.In the coming days, we will begin the process laid out by this law, Obama said, adding that repeal will not go into effect immediately. It is very important that servicemembers remember that.He spoke directly to gay soldiers, and said he hoped those discharged under DADT will re-enlist once it is fully repealed.There will never be a full accounting of the heroism demonstrated by gay Americans in service to this country, he said. As the first generation to serve openly in our armed services, you will stand for all those who came before you, and you will serve as role models for all those who will come after you.Read more Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Military, Politics, Updates, WomenDA/DT- Don't Ask/Don't Tell, Gays in the military, Obama signs DADT RepealRead moreThank You Bill Clinton for gettting the ball rolling on Healthcare and Dont Ask..December 22, 2010jamesb101No commentsIn a piece in the Washington Post we are reminded that President Clinton started out on changing both and got ran over.(Hillary did actually Healthcare)..Truly momentous legislation that changes policy takes a long time..To get things done requires heavy lifting and persistence.President Obama has done both more a decade later because Americans have also changed.And despite fear, politics and egos.This is all good for America..At a highly unusual news conference more than two weeks ago, President Obama introduced former President Clinton, then left the briefing room to go to a Christmas party whileClinton touted a tax agreement the White House was pushing. But for most of the last two years, the opposite has happened: Obama has campaigned to enact goals Clinton failed to achieve.On Wednesday morning, Obamawill signed into law a repeal of the ban on people who are openly gay from serving in the military  a ban that Clinton tried to get rid of in the early 1990s before settling on dont ask, don tell as a compromise.In the afternoon, the Senate islikely to give final approval to a major nuclear weapons treaty with Russia that the Clinton administration unsuccessfully pursued more than 10 years ago.And most famously, Obama earlier this year signed a massive health care expansion that had eluded his Democratic predecessor.These policies and priorities are of course not unique to either man; most Democratic presidents would likely have pushed them. And their successful passage during Obamas second year in office has as much to do with timing as either presidents legislative skill.Support for gay rights, for example, has increased dramatically since Clinton tried to change the militarys policy on gays almost two decades ago. Many of the people who helped push Obamas health-care law through Congress, such as then-chief of staffRahm Emanuel, personally participated in and learned from the 1993-94 experience.The former president does not sound envious when he talks about his successors achievements. Tensions from the 2008 campaign have cooled, as the two have praised each other publicly and Obama has sought the advice of both Clinton and his wife, the highly regarded Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton.I was in the Oval Office talking to the president about a number of things, Bill Clinton said in an interview last week on Larry King Live, recalling his meeting with Obama earlier this month..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Media, Men, Military, Politics, Polls, UpdatesDA/DT- Don't Ask/Don't Tell, ex-President Bill Clinton, President Obama, The Healthcare BillRead moreCan Gay soliders seperated from the service come back?December 21, 2010jamesb101No commentsI dont know..But this piece says probably..But they would get no favors.As I have said previouslyThis question is for the lawyers at the Pentagon and Department of Justice.The Senate voted torepeal the dont ask, dont tell policy on Saturday after weeks of wrangling. More than 13,000 service members have been fired since that rule came into effect in 1993. Can those people re-enlist?Probably. For the past 17 years, service members discharged for homosexual conduct have been permanently barred from the military, even if they swore that their sexual preference had changed. During that time, Congress has considered several bills to repeal DADT, many of which would haveexplicitly permitted discharged service members to rejoin. (The process is technically called reaccession.) In the end, the bare-boneslegislation that Congress is about to send to the president punts the re-enlistment issue to the Pentagon. We dont yet know for sure how the secretary of defense will handle the discharged soldiers, but the militarys Novemberreport (PDF) supporting repeal recommended that they be permitted to come back. Secretary Gates commissioned the report and has so farendorsed its findings.Any plan to take back dismissed soldiers may run into snags with the paperwork. Most gay people released under DADT received whats called an involuntary honorable discharge, which also applies to personnel with mental health problems or parental duties that preclude military service. Those who receive an involuntary honorable discharge are usually assigned theRE-4 re-enlistment code, which means theyre not allowed to come back.Its not clear how the Pentagon is going to work around this bureaucratic problem. Normally, each branch of the service would draft its own set of rules, but General James F. Amos, the top man in the Marines, has beenless than enthusiastic about repealing the policy. Secretary Gates may have to issue a special blanket rule that either alters the re-enlistment codes after the fact for fired gay soldiers, or instructs recruiters to ignore the code when the reason for discharge was homosexual conduct.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Law, Media, Men, Military, Politics, Updates, WomenDA/DT- Don't Ask/Don't Tell, Gays in the military, involuntary honorable discharge, Re-Enlistment for gaysRead moreThe START Treaty WILL passDecember 21, 2010jamesb1012 commentsPresident Obama is almost there..He has gotten everything he wanted from Congress except the Dream Act..Sen.
