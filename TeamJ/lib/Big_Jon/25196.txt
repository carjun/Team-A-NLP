He met and corresponded often with the First Lady of the United States, Rosalyn Carter, and was feted at a testimonial dinner by California Governor Jerry Brown (along with Mervyn Dymally and Willie Brown). Walter Mondale met privately with him during the 1976 campaign and publicly praised the People's Temple.You may wish to do a little research on your own, but I believe you'll find only further confirmation of what I've written.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Tophootinholler      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 12:15 AMResponse to Reply #2227.Interesting,I will look into it, thanks.

Jim Jones was a fanatical pseudo-Christian.  He was not really what you would call a leftist, and certainly not involved in the American left movement (which used to be considered centrist) that has developed since Reagan.  There really isn't much left left in the US.I was considered quite middle-of-the-road until the Republican right-wing became so nastily fanatical and irrational.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopQuantess      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 02:08 AMResponse to Reply #22110.Jim Jones would fall under the category of religious nutwho killed his own followers.Anything else is just a cherry on that nut-sundae.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopStraw Man      (121 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:11 AMResponse to Reply #1725.Ask the Wiki......about Jim Jones.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Tophootinholler      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 12:38 AMResponse to Reply #2546.Thanks!That was helpful.-HootPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJustitia      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:24 AMResponse to Reply #1232.You do realize that Jim Jones had a DEMOCRATIC congressman killed, don't you?The only Congressman ever killed in the line of duty.Jim Jones was a fucking insane murderous CULT LEADER.RIP, Rep.
