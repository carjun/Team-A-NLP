At least five other people, including members of her staff, were hurt, according to Peter Michaels, news director of Arizona Public Media.Giffords was transported to University Medical Center in Tucson. Her condition was not immediately known.Michaels said Giffords was talking to a couple when the man ran up, firing indiscriminately, and then ran off.

The weapon was a semiautomatic. The health law was a key issue. "Anger over her position became violent at times, with her Tucson office vandalized after the House passed the overhaul last March and someone showing up at a recent gathering with a weapon."TUCSON, Ariz.  A gunman unloaded a semiautomatic weapon outside a busy supermarket Saturday during a public gathering for Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, killing Arizona's chief federal judge and five others in an attempted assassination that left Americans questioning whether divisive politics had pushed the suspect over the edge. The shooting targeted Giffords and left the three-term congresswoman in critical condition after a bullet passed through her brain. A shaken President Barack Obama called the attack "a tragedy for our entire country. "Giffords, 40, is a moderate Democrat who narrowly won re-election in November against a tea party candidate who sought to throw her from office over her support of the health care law. Anger over her position became violent at times, with her Tucson office vandalized after the House passed the overhaul last March and someone showing up at a recent gathering with a weapon. Police say the shooter was in custody, and was identified by people familiar with the investigation as Jared Loughner, 22. U.S. officials who provided his name to the AP spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release it publicly.The article also said the gunman outlined his political beliefs on the net.  One report I saw said he was targetting Giffords specifically and another said an aide of hers was also shot.I also saw a report that she is responding to commands.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbreadandwine      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 11:20 PMResponse to Reply #522528.Gunman on the web ----http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-01-08-jare...

Senator Phil Gramm: "We're going to keep building the party until we're hunting Democrats with dogs."3. Rep. James Hansen on Bill Clinton: Get rid of the guy. Impreach him, censure him, assassinate him."4. John Derbyshire intimated in the National Review that because Chelsea Clinton had "the taint," she should "be killed."5. Ann Coulter: "We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed, too."6. Ann Coulter: "My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times building."7. Bill O'Reilly: "ll those clowns over at the liberal radio network, we could incarcerate them immediately. Will you have that done, please? Send over the FBI and just put them in chains."8. Clear Channel radio host Glenn Beck said he was "thinking about killing Michael Moore" and pondered whether "I could kill him myself, or if I would need to hire somebody to do it," before concluding: "No, I think I could. I think he could be looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking the life out -- is this wrong?"That's just SOME of the spewed filth of the hundreds of incidents where they've advocated violence towards liberals/Democrats, and these are just SOME of the better known repubs doing it - there's hundreds smaller swine of the GOP who've said the same.There's plenty more of them out there, and even if you can just recall the discussion put it on this thread so we can see it as some people 100% don't believe this goes on, even people on this board.Here's some other hate -1. Mel Gibson on Frank Rich: "I want to kill him. I want his entrails on a stick. I want to kill his dog."2. Fresno City Council Member Jerry Duncan in 2003 wrote in an email that police should "Cap" members of the Human Relations Commission and wrote, "If I had one dirty bomb and I could eliminate all the liberals in Fresno at once." When his comments became public, Duncan said "The response I have gotten from the public on this has been 100% supportive."3. World Socialist newsletter about how "Republican Right prepares for violence"http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/nov2000/elec-n24.pdf 4. Shooter/Murderer wanted to "kill liberals who are ruining the country", had books of Hannity and other right wing GOPers who told they were doing such - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Knoxville_Unitarian_U ... 5. Right winger backer and often a TV guest, Ted Nugent calling for violence -http://vyan.blogspot.com/2007/08/nugent-calls-for-viole ...

Some more...David Fitzsimmons of the Arizona Daily Star just said on CNN that the right has been stoking the fires of rage and hatred successfully for so long. And what motivated the attack on Gabrielle Giffords, who was a moderate, shows everything that is wrong with politics in this state. Giffords barely survived a vicious campaign against a Tea Party opponent who held a rally to shoot a fully automatic M16 to get on target and remove Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords was also on Palins target list of vulnerable Democrats.  Palin also stated on her Tweet, "Don't Retreat, Instead - RELOAD".How many threatening statements are out there that these extremists have made on websites, Fake News Channel, and their radio hate programs?  Democrats and liberals rarely, and I emphasize, rarely say or do things like this...  We've had some great Democrats and progressives murdered over the decades, and this shocking violence immediately made me wish the victims well, and pray for them, and made me think of this old post of mine, there's hundreds of threats and dozens of attacks against us...Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topdipsydoodle      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 01:39 PMResponse to Original message14.3 were shotEdited on Sat Jan-08-11 01:40 PM by dipsydoodlehttp://www.kold.com/Global/story.asp?S=13807677 Yes - sickening.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLisa0825      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 01:41 PMResponse to Original message15.She was on Palin's "target map."Edited on Sat Jan-08-11 01:44 PM by Lisa0825http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post... http://www.takebackthe20.com /Someone seems to have taken Palin literally.

Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona was shot outside a grocery store in Tucson while holding a public event, an eyewitness reported Saturday.Giffords, who was re-elected to her third term in November, was hosting her first "Congress on Your Corner event at the Safeway in northwest Tucson when a gunman ran up and started shooting. At least five other people, including members of her staff, were hurt, according to Peter Michaels, news director of Arizona Public Media.Giffords was transported to University Medical Center in Tucson. Her condition was not immediately known.Michaels said Giffords was talking to a couple when the man ran up, firing indiscriminately, and then ran off. He was tackled by a bystander and presumably taken into custody.Read more: http://www.npr.org/2011/01/08/132764367/congresswoman-s...

In the meantime, we have to wait and see what actually did happen. I used to jump all over these reports, but I've learned to wait before saying too much.

Slightly off topic, but you weren't making a threat of murder to prove that you were "serious" about  your political statement, were you?Guns are tools. They kill people and animals, just as hammers drive nails. You take them to an inappropriate place, it's either 1) because you're an idiot, 2) because you're paranoid, 3) because you think you're skilled enough to defend yourself in a crowd without hitting the innocent bystanders (see 1), 4) because you want to threaten, 5) because you want to kill, or 6) more than one of the above.

I don't care how pure your intentions are. I don't care if you're licensed. It's irresponsible, and they even knew that in the Wild West, where you checked your guns when you entered the town, it was common sense. At what point did we become so dumb? Is it industrial pollutants? What if this person had a license, he was carrying as innocently as you, and all of a sudden, he just got so angry? If he hadn't had the gun, he would have had the chance to think again, or the moment could pass. You could have a bad moment, too. While you're carrying the gun into a crowd, also drive drunk. You know how to do it responsibly. Hell, why don't even rally for the right to it?And I'll connect back and say, you're only slightly better than the person who carries the gun to the rally with ill intentions. With you, it's that something could go wrong. Even if you have great intentions, if you wear it in the open in a crowd, somebody could take it off you. PS. I was right, you weren't brandishing or flourishing it, then, like the guy at the Obama rally. Thank you for showing that you have a little common sense, unlike the state of Arizona.Maybe I'll show up at the Guns Forum. Depends on if you answer, but I think I'm out of posting time today.

They say there's two kinds of people in a gunfightThose who knew beforehand that there's going to be a gunfight, and those who don't. If you don't know, you lose almost every time. If your surprised and your armed, you won't have time to draw. It just happens that quick. See what good it did her? And what if it had happened slower, if she had a chance to draw, nervously, and say wounded or killed several other people? In a civilian gunfight, it's hard to aim under that kind of pressure when your life is already on the line. Hands tend to get shaky, you could practice at a range all you want, but it still doesn't prepare you. Only being a soldier, or surviving a gun battle prepares you. Carrying a gun for general safety is a stupid myth, that is, unless you know there's going to be a gunfight. So, I think she was dumb for carrying a gun in the crowd, too. Poor lady, sorry to say that. Would be interesting to see if she does it after this.

Maybe guns are suppose to communicate messages now, I mean, since everybody says they don't kill people, I assume that as tools, they have some other function. But I just don't have the vocabulary to understand what that gun was saying. If the point were to give a "message" why not mock-up?I don't know what you mean by headless and armless.

" He is a full citizen and is not required to mock up or shut up anymore .  And seeing as how the black folks weren't even allowed in the Mexican ward schools where they were shitting in a box (1) not 30 feet from a sewer main* , I see his photo and can't help but grin . He is a citizen like me , I wouldn't shoot me . Neither will he . So I grin . To immediately assume otherwise is irrational and illogical but justifiable bigotry to me . Even if he were an avowed "Maoist Fuckstick" , intent that we only need 100 million people to run this country so "a few" (2) will have to go . I would still grin as we are still truly free . Imagine if he were to do that in Progesso even before La Violencia .   Here is one not 500 yards from my house , in the right foreground . Our glazier now lives in the white high school in the background . 4 rows of brick , 15 foot ceilings and his wife is completely enamored with it . Ironically enough they are Hispanic and had no idea about "the rest of the story" until I filled them in . It got a little misty , but I dont think they noticed as I pretended to sneeze .But if you crop his head from a photo taken from an angle where his hands are obscured , and then blink the photo on the boob toob while basting it with breathless innuendo Many will see "Racists hate black president" as they were supposed to . Many saw through it immediately , but the media kept at it for a few days until it started producing a little pain .footnotes and corrections(1) I have photos of said shitter and sewer main as well ,if need be . It is completely full so I have to make two corrections ,as they were shitting on the ground and it should read headless and HANDLESS man .(2) I don't grin long , especially if it turns into "kill they babies"As this has ended up in the backwaters of yet another massive moral panic thread , it has earned it's own place in The Gungeon  .We have steaming pigs !

That bastion of gun liberty where every black male has a right to carry guns, (not true for black women) and where they seem to be terribly available? And guess what? It seems that other liberties are not well protected there. Now, you might try to call me a racist for making that point with the Congo, but I thought it might be important to point out that the freedom to walk the streets with guns is likely not the civil rights blacks had in mind throughout the 20th century, and where it has happened for black males, the results have been . . . questionable.Also, I'll say the same is true of Iraq, or Colombia. Guns can protect you or they might protect liberties. As the original intent went, it also guaranteed that somebody could hunt for food, and also enabled whites to slaughter and dispossess the Indians.  We no longer have the last two, but the point I'm making: it's not a liberty in itself. Being in an environment where you must constantly have the ability to kill another human being is not liberty. However, guns can make other liberties possible, even if their record on that is mixed. Societies don't tend to get more tolerant of other rights once guns are introduced. Why? Because the government is organized while the people usually aren't, and it will always hold the most and best guns, along with worse weapons.

Also, the police officer who has to watch this guy then can't spare to time to maybe spot a real assassin. If you're really making just a political statement about how serious you are, why not just a replica? Fact is, if it's not unusual to be armed at a political rally, how do people then have a chance to spot a real assassin? Rather than, say, just some guy who's alluding to assassination by carrying a rifle, just for exercise?   "If Civil Rights are not useable in public, where? When? Just because you disagree with it doesn't mean it's wrong."The statement about shouting "fire" in a crowded theater applies here. People have agreed, socially and legally, that that isn't protected speech. You don't have the right to do that, but it makes a good analogy to your argument: if you can't practice your right to free speech in a crowded theater, where else can you do it?Some things just are common sense to me. Fasten your seat belt, don't drive drunk, and don't carry guns in crowds where your wild shots can have many terrible consequences. You might say, it's a little more than rude. At the very least, I know you don't have my best interests at heart. I don't believe I made the argument that because I disagree about guns at political rallys then it's wrong. I'd call that a straw man, and a rather lazy one, ignoring every argument I've made. See you at the gun forum sometime tomorrow. I'm too lazy to open it tonight.

Would he have been prepared, had fresh ammo for this rally? And as far as you know, if he would have owned it illegally, he could have been arrested long before this. And do you even know he could have obtained such a good weapon? Contraband generally carries a high price.  So, it's very conceivable that this wouldn't have happened if it were illegal. I believe I've refuted you on this point.As for your comparison against murder, here's the problem with making that argument: we don't have a world without laws against murder to compare to ours. Unlike gun laws, such a world is hard to imagine because all of history would be different, but everybody thinks it would be much harsher, and murder and assault would be much more common, which is why we have laws against it. In other words, we presume that it makes murder far less commonplace, and we live in a better world because of it. Many people are denying that about guns now, but some laws, not even laws against them, regulations, or even such common sense courtesy, would prevent many incidents from happening, or would reduce their severity. Like I doubt that you'd have a dozen people wounded or killed here. You ask how courtesy might have prevented this, well, it might be seen as more unusual or disdainful to carry a gun at a rally. Spotting somebody with one or knowing somebody carried one wouldn't be shrugged off, it would alert people.   So, I think I've refuted you on your second point too.    And I'm not saying guns should be banned. I know we have a Second Amendment (though I don't agree with the current conception of it.) Or just at least think clearly about guns and their appropriate use.   (Edited to add some sentences; sorry if this has confused things.)

And yes, I believe it's often the case they get them from legal dealers.(Probably want to reread what I wrote because I edited it-- sorry.)In other words, we have a legal/illegal market, a hybrid, rather than a fully illegal market. so, what would prices be like in a totally contraband market. People won't be stealing guns so they could undersell the legal market. Let's look at drugs for a comparison. So, contraband doesn't carry a high price? So, how much do people pay for a shot of heroin that costs about $3 to produce and distribute. I guess your right. Contraband doesn't carry a high price. Now, guns aren't like tax-abated stolen cigarettes. They're attraction in a purely illegal gun market won't be that they're cheaper. But again, I never brought up illegality, I'm just telling you that the questions you've asked to poke holes in what I've said are real softballs. I'm surprise gunnuts think they're zingers.    So, I guess I failed to refute another one of your arguments. Frankly, I think you're just mad because you never thought of any of what I've presented.

First, given that your statement opening lines were sarcastic to begin with, of course I'd get snarky back. Fact is, after that beginning, I really didn't care if you understood or not, either way you meant it, it was dumb."You think someone with intent to murder with a gun ILLEGALLY, would have pause to possess a gun illegally to murder with?"No doubt he'd be willing. But that's not the question. The question is would he be able? So, you missed that point, too. That's what I mean by guns making you dumber. Why wasn't that clear, either? No doubt he wouldn't be able to buy it at a Sports Authority, as he reportedly did. Trying to buy a gun from the black market would be at least somewhat more difficult and otherwise risky. Since he bought this at the end of December, apparently he did it to make this attack. Would he have been able to obtain the gun in time, then? Given that he'd be breaking the law just owning one, it would have been a bit more likely he would have been arrested. Not only that, would he be able to purchase a gun that's-- so good, or even afford a gun at all? Presumably, the black market in a world where guns are illegal would make guns more expensive than they are in this world. But of course, it's rather impossible to compare this world to a world where the US has gun control because the latter does not exist. We can't scientifically test if it would cut assaults and murders, but I'm saying, there's some questions that you're muddying due to ideology, that is, the fact that guns must be legal. We do have a second amendment, the right to keep and bear arms exists, but no matter how beneficial it is, we should also be truthful about the consequences it brings us.

Have you ever heard the saying: use the right tool for the right job? Now you have the common sense to know that hammers drive nails. Why don't you have the common sense to know that guns kill people because that is what the tool is made to do, and not say, to use for your commute to work? What is it about the pro-gun propaganda that has damaged your thinking process on this, because it is damaged. Guns either kill people or animals or they are the only tool human beings have ever produced that have absolutely no use. Okay, first look at the strip mall. Where would he accelerate to even 45 miles per hour from? Through a maze of parked cars? Would he even be able to spot the Congresswoman at that distance? And say he accelerates through the crowd, what are the chances in the chaos he creates that he is going to be able to keep her in sight? And which is easier to dodge? A car going at 90 miles per hour or a bullet going at 600 feet per second? Again, you have the common sense to know this. Plus, there's a good chance that he would wreck the car and kill himself. And he would know this. But I'll agree, with luck, he might hurt or kill as many people, but the problem is, he wanted to get the politician; the rest were innocent bystanders, and he knows he more than likely couldn't do that with a car. No, he needed the proper tool. He could also use a knife, but let's just say, I bet he would hurt only four, kill nobody, and never the congress woman.  No, for selectively assassinating somebody, there's no substitute for the proper tool. "Any place where a person is allowed to carry a firearm by law is an appropriate place."So, not even manners and decorum apply to guns? Oh, what can possibly go wrong with that? You can't yell obscenities in a public square, but you can show everybody your gun?Again, in the Old West, people had common sense about guns. You checked them in when you entered the town.

Here's what he said:The event was very informal: Gifford had set up a table outside the Safeway and about 20-30 people were gathered to talk to her. The gunman, who may have come from inside the Safeway, walked up and shot Gifford in the head first. According to Rayle, who is a former ER doctor, Gifford was able to move her hands after being shot.After shooting Gifford, the gunman opened fire indiscriminately for a few seconds, hitting a number of people, including a kid no older than 10 years old. Rayle hid behind a concrete pole and pretended to be dead. When the gunman apparently ran out of ammunition he attempted to flee, but a member of Gifford's staff tackled him. Rayle helped hold the gunman down while waiting for the sheriff to arrive, about 15-or 20 minutes later. 30 minutes later the EMS came. Rayle said he was "stunned" by how long it took medical help to arrive.The man was young, mid-to-late 20s, white, clean-shaven with short hair and wearing dark clothing and said nothing during the shooting or while being held down. He didn't look like a businessman, but more of a "fringe character," Rayle said.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Sat Jan-08-11 02:29 PMResponse to Reply #157162.Deleted messageMessage removed by moderator.

There was an attempt at bombing a Democratic polling place in Arkansas, there have been death threats against Democratic representatives and their families in many states. There is a direct link in several cases to the emotional tirades of Glen Beck and others. There will probably be some spin put out that is wasn't political, but I won't believe it. Anyone who has followed how Democrats, liberals, progressives, you name it, have been vilified and the calls for their death over the years, can't help but feel we have targets on our backs. Will the Freepers or the 'Second Amendment Solution' folks take back their words now?Will this be a turning point in our national dialog? After years of hate mongering, will it change or get worse?When I first heard this story, I went through the stages of grief, save the first, shock. No, I wasn't surprised. I'd had to not be paying attention to the rantings of Beck and Palin followers to be shocked. Then I went to intense anger, and now I'm coming down from that. For right now, today, I'm just crying.

The video maker is almost certainly a college student (same age range as the suspect), who seems to have a major grudge against government, and has some really wacko ideas about the Constitution (police are unconstitutional, as are public colleges)...he says, "don't trust this government."Edit: make sure you don't confuse the 5 videos he CREATED with the one that he added to his FAVORITES (the one with the American flag).

True socialism does not advocate such economic dictatorship -- it can only be democratic. Hitler's other political beliefs place him almost always on the far right. He advocated racism over racial tolerance, eugenics over freedom of reproduction, merit over equality, competition over cooperation, power politics and militarism over pacifism, dictatorship over democracy, capitalism over Marxism, realism over idealism, nationalism over internationalism, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, common sense over theory or science, pragmatism over principle, and even held friendly relations with the Church, even though he was an atheist.

Edited on Sat Jan-08-11 09:30 PM by jwirrI cannot remember the names of them but one of the companies made weapons, etc. Also our dear prez boooosh's family did business with slave runners in one of the death camps and they were not government businesses. The government and these businesses just paid them for the people in the camps to supply labor. I do not think there was anything socialist about it. Some of our bankers were even funding them. FDR had them all tried for the crime of aiding and abetting the enemy.

Reading this does not indicate any political motive for this atrocity on the part of a wacko shooter.  I guess had the DU existed 30 years ago there would be in-the-heat-of-the-moment posts about how the right wing was responsible for Lennon's murder.  Certainly much that I have seen on this thread would support such a view.Like with most things, it is best to wait until more complete and cross-checked info is available.  After all, Giffords was first reported to be dead, but now she is responding to commands.  And there is a search for a suspected accomplice.  When (if) that person is located, more will be know.  Perhaps there are other reasons behind the attack and the shooter was just a tool for (left, right, cartelistas, fill in the blank) who wanted her shot.  And it would be foolish to blame any particular group until there is real evidence.  After all, what if the apparent fact that the shooter listed The Communist Manifesto was used to claim that communists were behind this and that there should be an immediate dragnet and mass arrest of "communists?"  That would be pretty foolish, wouldn't it?  And it would tell us more about the authors of such a move than any intrinsic reality.  Elsewhere on this thread there is someone calling for a legal ban on the GOP.  What a moron.So hold your fire and keep your powder dry in case that evidence does, in the end, point to a political motive that found a willing tool in a young wacko who lost touch with reality.  But at this time, there is no there there.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toponpatrol98      (727 posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 10:04 PMResponse to Reply #498503.I know...It's ridiculous to blame Palin, Beck, or Fox for what an individual decides to do.
