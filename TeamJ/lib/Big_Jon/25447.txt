Not only do they replenish our skin, but they force us, in an unobtrusive way, to take time for ourselves and relax; after all, it's impossible to get much of anything done with a layer of creamy goodness slathered over your face, and cucumbers over your eyes.But why get dressed up and go out to a salon, when you can get the same benefits, and remain comfortable in your own space? The answer is: there is no reason. Below I've included recipes for my favorite at-home face masks. Each provides unique benefits, but all are quick and easy to blend up at home, with ingredients you use every day. Hey, you can even make yourself a smoothie while you're at it.Nourish: Banana-Avacado MaskIngredients1/2 over-ripe banana1/2 over-ripe avacado2 Tbsp unflavored full-fat yogurt1 tsp olive oilInstructionsMash banana and avacado, combine with other ingredients, and mix well.

On many you can see (or feel) results immediately afterwards, but generally you'll see the best benefits the next morning, after your skin has had a chance to fully react and rebalance.Shirley Anderson2 years ago Oh Maddie, these sound wonderful!

Why? I think I'll do one soon. By the way, have you ever tried to put a cooled-down tea bag on your face, especially around your eyes? It tightens and tones your skin. You look silly when your laying there with tea bags on your face but it feels good.joaojeronimo2 years ago Hi :)Great recipes you have there, I'm sure most of the people can find the ingredients at home and that's great because a lot of people can do those :)JudyG2 years ago Home facial treatments are great and far less expensive (usually) than store brands. However having been in the beauty industry for over 25 years I would strongly recommend seeking out a professionals evaluation of your skin and skincare needs. Not all acne is the same nor is dry skin necessarily dry. You need to know what your real issues are before you treat the wrong cause and create bigger problems. Invest a little time and money first by having a professional analyze your skin then go home and make your own mask. Just remember the added benefits of steam and manual minipulation of the limph nodes and pressure points in reducing alot of the "causes" of skin irritation and problems. Of course change in diet, smoking and alcohol consumption will also do wonders for tired dehydrated skin. Sophie2 years ago IM HAVING A BIRTHDAY PARTY AND I WANT TO DO A LITTLE SPA THING IN THE BEGINING WITH FRIENDS  THEN GET ALL DOLLED UP AND GO TO A RESTURAUNT....
