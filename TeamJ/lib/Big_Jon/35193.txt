This includes a drop of 32% in robbery, 21% drop in homicide. I'm convinced if more people were to exploit their weapons in a respectful and responsible manner of OC, we would see an even more dramatic drop in violent crime. But in a modern society it is becoming less acceptable and the notion that its not necessry iswinning popularuty the result of ignorance.http://forum.opencarry.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-4...

Occasionally it does happen, as at the New Life Church in 2007.The intersection of odds between concealed carry and a spree shooter are so small as to prove vanishingly small. In most states, those who carry concealed make up between 3 and 5% of the eligible population. Spree shootings are quite rare.I carry to protect myself- I'm not a cop, nor a hero. If I weren't in immediate danger of grievous bodily harm, I would seek cover and be a good witness.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopThe Backlash Cometh      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 09:11 PMResponse to Reply #3053.See post #52.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 08:30 PMResponse to Original message14.Deleted sub-threadSub-thread removed by moderator.

But that's not what's happening:Arizona to allow concealed weapons without permitBut he said what really concerns him is that the new law will allow people who have had no education about Arizona's laws and no training on the shooting range to carry a concealed gun. The eight-hour class currently required to get a permit includes information on state law and gun safety, as well as requires students to be able to hit a target 14 out of 20 times. Furbee said his class at Mesa-based Ultimate Accessories costs $79, plus $60 for the five-year permit."I fully agree that we have a right to keep and bear arms," Furbee said. "But if you are not responsible enough to take a class and learn the laws, you are worse than part of the problem."He said it's not uncommon for students to walk into his classroom and pull a new gun out of a box with no idea how to hold it and no understanding of the laws surrounding it."If you are going to carry a concealed weapon, you should have some kind of training and show that you are at least competent to know how the gun works and be able to hit a target," he said. "You owe the people around you a measure of responsibility."Read more: http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/arti...

However there WAS one man with a gun who was inside the store during the shooting.I don't know what you're trying to say... but in reality there isn't even a legal obligation for a CCW holder to render aid or assistance.One may be capable of handling a firearm well enough to defend themselves but not have the skills to confront an armed attacker in a crowded area as he's shooting.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopThe Backlash Cometh      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 08:40 PMResponse to Reply #2132.Yes. There are limitations. That's what I'm saying. There are limitations.Carrying a gun is no panacea.

A very small percentage. Odds are that if you go to the supermarket, nobody you see there is carrying. That's the actual reality of CCW, even in a state like Arizona. CCW gets far more publicity than the number of people actually carrying warrants.Chances are high that there wasn't someone carrying there who was in a position to act. That's usually the case.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOzymanithrax      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 09:04 PMResponse to Original message48.It is basic human instinct to run when bullets start flying...Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 09:05 PM by OzymanithraxThe military and police spend a great deal of effort and time to train people to reject that basic instinct and return fire.One of the people that acted was a woman who was shot, who fought him to keep him from Palinizing his weapon (reloading).  Others, when they had a clear chance drug him down and stopped him.  These were brave and courageous people who risked their lives.Rather than wonder why a second amendment wonder didn't pull his weapon and gun the guy down like Stalone or Schwarzenegger, we should be thankful that people acted when they did.  With another 30 round magazine, it could have been worse.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopThe Backlash Cometh      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 09:22 PMResponse to Reply #4862.Very astute observation.The gunman was put down without the use of a gun.
