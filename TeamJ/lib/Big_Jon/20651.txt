The banknotes of the first dollar replaced those of the Rhodesian dollar at par in 1980 following the proclamation of independence.[1] The primary issuer of Zimbabwean banknotes is the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and has issued many types of currency notes alongside banknotes in its history, including Bearer cheques and Agro cheques ("Agro" being short for Agricultural) in the period between 2003 and 2008. The Standard Chartered Bank also issued emergency cheques from 2003 to 2004.The main illustration on the obverse of banknotes issued since 1980 is the Chiremba Balancing Rocks in Epworth, Harare. The rocks were part of the Reserve Bank's emblem, which was used for all Bearer and Agro cheques, which circulated between 15 September 2003 and 31 December 2008. The reverse of dollar notes often illustrate the culture or landmarks of Zimbabwe.The second dollar (ZWN) was replaced on 1 August 2008 by the third dollar (ZWR),[2][3] which was then phased out by fourth dollar (ZWL) with short notice on 2 February 2009 because it rapidly lost value.[4] The economic and trade sanctions imposed against the Zimbabwean government and the Reserve Bank have made it difficult to incorporate modern security features on most banknotes issued since September 2008.The banknotes of the third dollar were originally scheduled to be demonetised on 30 June 2009 but the Zimbabwean dollar as a whole has been suspended since 12 April 2009, implying that banknotes of both the third and fourth dollar are not de jure legal tender.[5]Contents1 History2 Paper money of the first dollar (ZWD)2.1 Desmond Crough series2.2 Kombo Moyana series2.3 Leonard Tsumba series2.4 Gideon Gono series2.5 Standard Chartered series2.6 2003 bearer cheque series3 Paper money of the second dollar (ZWN)3.1 2006, 2007 and 2008 Bearer cheque series3.2 Agro cheque series4 Paper money of the third dollar (ZWR)5 Paper money of the fourth dollar (ZWL)6 Replacement banknotes7 Valuation and collecting ability8 Other circulating currency9 See also10 Notes11 Citations12 References13 External links[edit] HistoryThe first banknotes of Zimbabwe were issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (formerly Reserve Bank of Rhodesia) for the first dollar (ZWD) in 1980 to coincide with the independence of Zimbabwe. These notes replaced the circulating banknotes of the Rhodesian Dollar at par. The first series of banknotes ranged from $2 to $20, and were signed by D. Crough, the last Governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia.[1] From 1994 to 1997 the Reserve Bank issued a new series of notes ranging from $2 to $100, although the $2 banknote was withdrawn and replaced by a coin in 1997.[6] As rising inflation started to affect the purchasing power of the Zimbabwean Dollar, the $500 and $1000 banknotes were issued from 2001 to 2005 with enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures.[7]The RBZ also issued special traveller's cheques in 2003, with six denominations ranging from $1000 to $100000. These were short-lived due to unpopularity with the general public: identification was required both during issue and encashment of such cheques, which could only be used once by the bearer. As usual, banks levied a commission fee on all of the cheques.[8]On 15 September 2003, the RBZ and Standard Chartered issued special Bearer cheques with denominations ranging from $5000 to $20000.[9][10] These, and subsequent issues of the first and second dollars were time limited and lacked sophisticated anti-counterfeiting measures which were heavily used in many modern banknotes such as those of the Swiss Franc. In the first half of 2006 new denominations of $50000 and $100000 were issued, with the $1 million denomination being planned for September 2006; it was subsequently never issued.The time limits were either ignored or extended by multiple decrees, meaning that all notes of these issues remained legal tender in practice until 21 August 2006.[11]On 1 August 2006 the banknotes of the second dollar (ZWN), with less elaborate designs, replaced those of the first dollar at the ratio of 1000 to 1.[12] The redenomination (codenamed Operation Sunrise) was heavily publicised under the banner Zero to Hero, but was also rapid and disorganised which resulted in many people being unable to convert their old Bearer cheques to new issues before the lapse date,[11] The Reserve Bank Governor Dr. Gideon Gono said that "10 trillion (first dollars) were still out there and it had become manure".[13]Further denominations ranging from $5000 to $500 million were issued in the period between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In the second quarter of 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated.[14] Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice.[3][15] The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.[14]Munich-based security printers Giesecke & Devrient ceased providing banknote paper to the Reserve Bank on 1 July 2008 in response to an official request from the German government and widespread calls for sanctions;[16] The Jura JSP software end-user licence, issued to the state-owned Fidelity Printers & Refiners was also terminated on 24 July 2008 for similar reasons although the official press statement quoted that it was de facto impossible to prevent the printers from using the software.[17][18]On 1 August 2008 the banknotes of the third dollar (ZWR), which were printed for the abandoned second phase of the 2006 redenomination, replaced the cheques of the second dollar at the ratio of 10 billion (1010) to 1.[2][19] The Bearer and Agro cheques of the second dollar were phased out along with the smaller denominations of the third dollar on 1 January 2009. Despite the reform the Reserve Bank issued several high-value denominations up to $100 trillion ($1014) in the period between September 2008 to January 2009,[I] which merely kept in similar pace with the cash rate instead of the black market rates.[20]On 2 February 2009, banknotes of the fourth dollar (ZWL) were introduced to replace those of the third dollar at the ratio of one trillion (1012) to 1. It was originally envisaged that banknotes of the third dollar would remain legal tender until 30 June 2009 but all banknotes were withdrawn from circulation following the suspension of the Zimbabwe dollar on 12 April 2009.[5][II][edit] Paper money of the first dollar (ZWD)The Chiremba Balancing Rocks near Harare is the main artwork used for obverse sides of the first two banknote designs of the first Zimbabwean dollar. Notes of these design also feature on either side major landmarks and landscapes such as the Kariba Dam and fauna. As hyperinflation took hold at the end of the 20th century the quality of the notes deteriorated as printing plates from previous issues were reconstituted for printing emergency notes. Although the notes of the first design were gradually phased out from 1997, all remaining notes of the first dollar were forcibly demonetised on 22 August 2006.[11][edit] Desmond Crough seriesThe Desmond Crough series was the first series of banknotes for Zimbabwe, which carried the signature of Dr. Desmond C. Crough, then the last governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia. They are dated 1980 but issued in 1981 (except for the $20 note, which was issued in 1982). The notes bear Salisbury as the name of its capital rather than Harare, as the name was changed on 18 April 1982. There are four denominations in this series: $2, $5, $10 and $20; its designs make extensive use of the Guilloch technique, heavily relied upon by banknotes of many currencies during the 1980s.The 1982-dated issues banknotes differed little from the earlier, except that it took into account of the renaming of the country's capital from Salisbury to Harare. However, there was an error with early runs of the $10 banknote (Pick no. 3b), because it bears Salisbury as the name of the capital city instead of Harare. These type of issues are rare. Later runs of the $10 note (Pick no. 3c) corrected the error. There were no $2 banknotes dated 1982: the second run of this denomination was taken in 1983 with K. Moyana as governor of the Reserve Bank.[21]Desmond Crough series (Signature: Dr. D.C.

The series bears the correct name of Zimbabwe's capital (Harare) and is indifferent to the last two series except for the date and signature.[21]Kombo Moyana series (Signature: K.

The banknotes which carried his signature are referred to as the Leonard Tsumba series.The first banknotes to be issued with his signature was the two last runs of the original designs, dated 1994. The first run, which consisted of denominations from $2 to $20, had the original watermark of the Zimbabwe Bird (profile angle, short neck), whilst the second run consisted only of the $2 and $5 denominations, bearing the watermark of the bird with a longer neck and at  profile angle.[22]In 1994 the general design of the banknotes was reviewed to keep up with advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992.[23] Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.The $500 denomination was first issued with red as the main colour in 2001. The 2003-dated versions were brown. It was followed by the $1000 denomination on 2 October 2003, the sole difference between the two variants of the $1000 notes (Pick no. 12) only being the typeface of the serial number.[24]Leonard Tsumba series (Signature: L.L.

Following the redenomination of August 2006, bearer cheques that were originally scheduled to expire on 31 December 2006 were demonetised early.[12]Bearer cheques dated 15 September 2003 bear the signature of the acting governor Charles Chikaura.

Poor communications meant that many civilians of Zimbabwe were unable to convert old bearer cheques to new ones before the deadline.[11][edit] 2006, 2007 and 2008 Bearer cheque seriesThe 2006 bearer cheque series was put into circulation on 1 August 2006 and initially consisted of 14 denominations, ranging from 1 to $100000. The cheques were signed by Dr. Gideon Gono and were set to expire on 31 July 2007, except for the $100 and $500 cheques, which were initially due to expire on 31 December 2007, but later extended to 31 July 2008.[29] The $5 denomination was also issued, despite not being widely publicised in the changeover campaign.[30]Two variations that were issued for the $10000 and $100000 denominations are recognised in the Standard Catalog of World Paper Money: the difference between them was the use of digit grouping. Cheques with the denomination expressed as '10000' or '100000' bear serial numbers with the (scarce) prefix AA, while notes with prefixes AB onwards is expressed as '10000' or '100000'.[31]2006 bearer cheque series (Signature: Dr. G.

The $750000 denomination of the December 2007 series was the only note out of all cheques of the second dollar to bear a holographic strip, as the cheque was printed on paper that was prepared for the 1000ZWD notes (Pick No. 12).[34]2007 bearer cheque series (Signature: Dr. G.

Three denominations of the 2008 series remained legal tender at the ratio of 1010 to 1 until being demonetised on 31 December 2008.[2]There are two variants of the $10 million denomination, the primary difference being the typeface and size of the serial number.

Although of a different design and with the intention for use only by farmers, it had found its way into regular use because of the parallel functions with bearer Cheques and the exponential rise of food prices. Following the 2008 currency reform, Agro and bearer cheques were phased out on 1 January 2009.[2]The four denominations in this series are not the same by dimensions as the $25 billion note used different paper from the 500 ZWD banknote of 2001. The $100 billion ($1011) Agro Cheque was the largest of the second dollar, sharing the record for the most number of zeroes depicted on a banknote with the Yugoslav 500 billion ($51011) dinar note of 1993, up until January 2009.Special Agro (Agricultural) cheques, 2008 (Signature: Dr. G.

There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.[38]The 2008 banknote series circulated from 29 September 2008 to 12 April 2009. The series demonstrated the intensity of hyperinflation during the period as the highest denomination increased from $1000 to $100 trillion ($1014) by January 2009, the latter being the largest denomination issued by the Reserve Bank.[III] The first issues of the series were the $10000 and $20000 denominations.[39] These were followed by the following denominations:$50000 (13 October 2008) [40]$100000, $500000 and $1 million (3 November 2008) [41]$10 million, $50 million and $100 million (4 December 2008) [42]$200 million and $500 million (12 December 2008) [43]$1 billion, $5 billion and $10 billion notes (19 December 2008) [44]$20 billion and $50 billion notes (12 January 2009) [45]$10 trillion, $20 trillion, $50 trillion and $100 trillion (16 January 2009) [46]The large number of denominations issued in late-2008 as well as the suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Consequently most design features were copied from the 2007 banknote series and lack many modern security features that were being relied upon by banknotes of major currencies such as those of the Canadian Dollar. The notes denominated from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton.[47] A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes were printed on paper intended for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Different types of paper were used in two types of $20000 banknotes.2007 banknote series (Signature: Dr. G.

The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in optically variable ink and an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design were recycled from designs of past issues and do not have a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.2009 banknote series (Signature: Dr. G.

Some examples of such notes may be sold further in excess of their true face value.[50]The price and value of a Zimbabwean banknote depend on various factors: the rarity, based on factors such as the name of capital city, how long it was printed, or the type of watermark; its condition, and the national situation at time of issue, such as shortages or hyperinflation.[51] Common designs and variants such as the $100 note of 1995 (Pick no. 9) are usually valued at about $1 apiece, while rare varieties such as the $10 Salisbury error note (Pick no. 3b) and the Standard Chartered issues are valued at around $100 or more. Zimbabwean banknotes are usually sold by banknote dealers over the counter or on the internet, although the most valued types theoretically qualify for inclusion in auction.[52][edit] Other circulating currencyAs in every fiscal emergency, hard currency, particularly the United States dollar, has long served as a parallel currency on the black market, and many prices in shops would be posted in dollars, even during periods when it was illegal to possess foreign currency or to transact business in dollars.A unique form of circulating specie is the Petrol Coupon, which has been issued in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Known denominations include 1, 10 and 20litres of petrol, and translate roughly into the local petrol price (about 1 UK pound sterling per litre or US$1.50 in late 2008).[53] Businesses, including Western Union, have been reported paying employees with these coupons, and even auctions have been transacted in this currency.[54] As with much Zimbabwe currency, printing standards are crude and counterfeiting is rampant; the RBZ has been dissuading this widespread use.[55][edit] See alsoReserve Bank of ZimbabweLeast valued currency unitZimbabwean dollarHyperinflation in ZimbabweEconomy of Zimbabwe[edit] NotesI. ^ The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued 21 additional denominations between 1 September 2008 and 2 February 2009. They were as follows: $1000, $10000, $20000, $50000, $100000, $500000, $1 million, $10 million, $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, $500 million, $1 billion, $5 billion, $10 billion, $20 billion, $50 billion, $10 trillion, $20 trillion, $50 trillion and $100 trillion.Information about the 2008 banknote series which involved the issue of such notes can be found in section 4.II. ^ The Interbank, black market and official exchange rates are still monitored despite the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009: as of 2 August 2009 one US dollar is worth Z$363.07.[56]III. ^ The $100 trillion (1014) banknote (Pick No. 91) is the largest denomination ever issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and is accepted by most numismatists as a banknote with the most zeroes ever shown in the design. Before 16 January 2009 the 500 billion dinar (51011) banknote of Yugoslavia (Pick No. 137) held such status.However, the Guinness World Records recognises the Hungarian 1 billion b.-peng (1021) banknote (Pick No. 137) as the world's largest denomination, although the 100 million b.-peng (1020) (Pick No. 136) was the largest denomination to be issued.[57][edit] Citations^ a b Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe 1983^ a b c d e f Zimbabwe to revalue its currency, BBC News, 2008-07-30, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7532702.stm, retrieved 2008-07-30^ a b c Gono, Gideon (2008 30 July) (PDF), Half-year Monetary Policy Statement, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, pp.910, http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/2008Julymps/mps.pdf, retrieved 2008-08-07^ a b Zimbabwe dollar sheds 12 zeros, BBC News, 2009-02-02, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7865259.stm, retrieved 2008-02-02^ a b c Zimbabwe dollar 'not back soon', BBC News, 2009-04-12, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7995882.stm, retrieved 2008-04-26^ Zimbabwe Banknotes, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, c. 1997, http://www.rbz.co.zw/about/notes.asp, retrieved 2009-06-07^ Cuhaj 2007, pp.10301031^ Zimbabwe tackles cash shortage, BBC, 2003-08-08, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3133351.stm, retrieved 2009-06-07^ a b Zimbabwe launches new currency, BBC, 2003-09-17, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3116716.stm, retrieved 2009-06-07^ a b Motsi, Tandayi (2003-06-11), Cash Crisis Inconveniencing Thousands, The Herald (Harare), retrieved from the Zimbabwe Situation, http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/jun12_2003.html#link1, retrieved 2009-06-07^ a b c d Rush to spend old Zimbabwe money, BBC News, 2006-08-21, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5271154.stm, retrieved 2008-07-22^ a b c Zimbabwe money loses three zeros, BBC News, 2006-08-02, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5231836.stm, retrieved 2008-07-22^ "Missing trillions now manure, says Gono", newzimbabwe.com, 2009-12-11, http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/inflation96.14725.html, retrieved 2009-09-21^ a b Zimbabwe introduces Z$100bn note, BBC News, 2008-07-21, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7515823.stm, retrieved 2008-07-21^ a b Gono, Gideon (2007-12-31) (PDF), Statement by Gideon Gono (on Currency Reforms), Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/currency.pdf, retrieved 2008-10-11^ Giesecke & Devrient halts deliveries to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Giesecke & Devrient GmbH, Munich, 2008-07-14, http://www.gi-de.com/portal/page?_pageid=44,147931&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL, retrieved 2008-07-21^ Official Press Statement on media reports concerning the business relations of Jura JSP with the Republic of Zimbabwe, Jura JSP GmbH, Vienna, 2008-07-24, http://www.jura.at/en/press/PR_Jura_JSP_Zimbabwe.pdf, retrieved 2008-11-26^ Lack of bank note paper threatens Zimbabwe economy, Los Angeles Times, 2008-07-14, http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-money14-2008jul14,0,3947241.story, retrieved 2008-07-21^ Zimbabwe rolls out new bank notes, BBC News, 2008-08-02, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7537971.stm, retrieved 2008-08-02^ FREAK Shots: When Money Goes Down the Toilet, Freakonomics, 2008-12-18, http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/freak-shots-when-money-goes-down-the-toilet/?scp=1&sq=When%20Money%20Goes%20Down%20the%20Toilet&st=cse, retrieved 2009-02-02^ a b Cuhaj 2007, pp.10291030^ Cuhaj 2007, p.1029: Zimbabwean Bird Watermark Varieties^ Zimbabwe Inflation rate (consumer prices), Index Mundi, 2008-12-18, http://www.indexmundi.com/zimbabwe/inflation_rate_(consumer_prices).html, retrieved 2009-06-10^ Zimbabwe launches Z$1,000 bill, BBC, 2003-10-02, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3157914.stm, retrieved 2009-06-10^ Cuhaj 2009, pp.1107: "2003 Emergency Cargill Bearer Checks"; Cuhaj 2009, pp.1108: "2004 Emergency Cargill Bearer Checks".^ Cuhaj 2009, pp.1105: "Signature/Title Varieties, Row A".^ Cuhaj 2007, pp.1032^ Wakatama, Pius (2003-11-18), Gonos appointment: Yet another mirage, Zim Standard (Harare), retrieved from the Zimbabwe Situation, http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/nov18a_2003.html#link19, retrieved 2009-06-10^ a b Zimbabwean Government Gazette, Vol. 85, 2007-12-19, http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/statutory.pdf, retrieved 2009-06-07^ New Bearer Cheques Family (2006) at the Wayback Machine  (archived June 26, 2007).^ Cuhaj 2009, pp.1108^ Zulu, Blessing (2007-03-01), Zimbabwe Central Bank Lightens Purses By Issuing Z$50,000 Note, Voice of America, http://www.voanews.com/english/Africa/Zimbabwe/2007-03-01-voa47.cfm, retrieved 2008-08-07^ Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (2008-12-18).
