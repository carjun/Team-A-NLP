Our Irish Setter did! Here is that story... Our Irish Setter Kelly was the first four-legged child to join our family. The timing was not exactly perfect, but just like two legged children the timing is not always what we would ideally choose.My husband and I had worked and saved our money for a down-payment on what was to be our very first home. We had chosen the lot, the floor-plan, and everything from the bricks on the exterior to colors of tile and carpeting on the inside.We were so excited at the thought of becoming home owners!Each lot in the entire subdivision would be fenced and so when an Irish Setter puppy was offered to my parents (who were great animal lovers) to enable finding a good home for the little tyke, they called us.This was a long distance discussion as we lived in Houston and they lived in McAllen, Texas at the time. They realized that they might have to keep the puppy for a little while until our new home was finished, so everything was agreed upon.We were to become new parents! New parents and new home owners! Kelly playing basketball with my hubbyMy baby pictures! My side viewThis photo is too dark but my Grandpa tried to take one with my face in it.We receive a letter!One day we received a letter from our new little puppy that we had already named Kelly. Smart little guy! He could already compose letters! This is the letter he wrote to us...August 8, 1973Dear Mommy and Daddy,I have heard so much about you and can hardly wait to go live with you. Grandma and Grandpa are very nice, and they take good care of me, but they have two big dogs and I know they like them better than me. I have tried to be very good, but sometimes it is just too hard. I do sleep all night tho and I don't even cry.Grandpa took these pictures of me but he said they are not very good because I didn't stand still. And one turned out too dark. The side view picture is more like my true color.Last Sunday Grandma took me in swimming. I showed her that I am a good swimmer, but I really didn't like it much because they have such a large pool, and I'm not even nine weeks old.They have a little girl here at the house and I really would like to play with her, but every time I bite her on her feet she cries and her mommy won't let me play anymore.I hope you like the way I look. I can hardly wait to see you. I will love you very much and will always try to be very good.Love and kisses,KellyAmerican Kennel Club - Irish SetterThe Irish Setter is an active, aristocratic bird dog, rich red in color, substantial yet elegant in build.Irish Setters Shaking "hands"Boundless energyOur bucking bronco!Kelly joins us in our apartmentThe day finally arrived when after making weekend trips to our new home-site and finding one mistake after another, we made the decision that we were going to back out of the contract. This was not done lightly.We had chosen a beautiful wooded lot only to drive out one weekend and find most of the trees ploughed down and burned. That was heart-breaking, but did not squelch the deal.On a final inspection we noted something like 23 things wrong with the house. Major things! Ceiling beams were going the wrong way! Two bricks at the top of one side of the garage door became three bricks towards the bottom as the house was obviously built very much out of plumb. A corner cabinet under the sink was sealed off. The list went on and on.........All this time we were getting updates about the progress being made by Kelly, our new family member whom we had not yet personally met.So although it would not be easy, we decided the day had come to make a trip to the Valley and pick him up. He would simply have to adjust to living in an upstairs apartment until we could once again find another home for the three of us.The first time Kelly had ever had a leash put on him was when we were going to put him in the car to drive from McAllen back up to Houston. He pulled and bucked like bucking bronco! We wondered how in the world this was ever going to work but by the first rest stop, he started walking as though he had been born with a leash attached to his collar.Of course, my parents did not yet know this. When they saw Kelly's reaction to the leash (knowing that he would not yet have a yard of his own in which to run and play) they almost asked to keep him. They, as well as their dogs, had become attached to the little guy!You can probably tell from the photos that Kelly was an active dog filled to the brim with energy. This is typical about Irish Setters which we were to discover. They are also extremely friendly and intelligent.We regularly walked him and found several nearby spots where we could turn him loose so that he could run off some of that boundless energy.Left to his own devices when we were at work or elsewhere, the only thing that he did of a naughty nature was to tear up anything made of paper. Newspapers and magazines became his toys to toss around and shred. We quickly learned to pick up all paper items within his reach when we would leave the apartment.We will never forget coming in one evening after a nice dinner to find Kelly happily laying in what looked like left-over confetti from a massive New Year's Eve party. We had forgotten to pick up the periodicals as we generally did before leaving the apartment. He looked so happy with his performance that we did not have the heart to scold him. After all...we had forgotten to pick up these things that were off limits. Photos of many Irish Setters set to music Playing basketball in HoustonSnow and his own half-acre yard in Wisconsin!Boxing with his DaddyHis new pal KerriBasketballIn the photo showing Kelly playing basketball with his Daddy, we were at that time living in a townhouse.As we would be walking Kelly we would hear kids saying to one another...Look! That's the dog that plays basketball! There was a court near our townhouse and my husband would regularly go out to practice sinking some balls. Kelly loved accompanying him and would become a part of the action as the photo readily shows. We actually had kids knock on our door and ask whether Kelly could come out and play! Our next move took us to Wisconsin. My husband had accepted a transfer and Kelly, for the first time, got to see and play in the snow. We also had a half-acre lot and had the back part fenced. Kelly loved it! He could now run and play without a leash almost anytime he wished. He would get excited when my husband would don his winter clothes with insulated gloves and they would go out in the back yard and box with one another. This was one of his favorite games. Kelly still had oodles of energy and this kept him happily engaged on those long winter days. He seemed to understand that he was not to play as rough with me.While in Wisconsin we decided that he could use another four legged pal and Kerri, a little mixed breed joined our happy family.From the very first moment, Kelly seemed to love her and they became the best of pals.As a matter of fact, Kerri was to grow up and become a feisty little member of the family that ruled the roost with regard to Kelly and the dogs that would join our family after her.Kelly now had an additional family member with which to frolic and play. Irish setters take around two years to fully mature and a growing puppy kept him entertained and happy. They became inseparable buddies and our family now numbered four.Where Kelly lived in Wisconsin with the rest of his family...two legged and four legged.Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin - Wisconsin Rapids, WI, USA [get directions]{"lat":44.383575,"lng":-89.817345,"zoom":7,"mapType":"ROADMAP","markers":[{"id":"9676","lat":44.383575,"lng":-89.817345,"name":"Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin","address":"Wisconsin Rapids, WI, USA","description":""}]} Kelly making himself comfortableHe sat on sofas just like people!Cartoon from a newspaper clippingIrish SettersIrish Setter Men's 838 Wingshooter 6" Waterproof Lace-up Boot,Amber,11.5 D USAmazon Price: $121.40List Price: $139.95Irish Setter - 11oz MugAmazon Price: $13.99Irish Setter Men's 855 Upland Kangaroo 9" Waterproof Side-Zip Boot,Brown,10.5 D USAmazon Price: $179.90List Price: $219.95Irish Setter Men's 887 DSS Classic Non-Insulated Oxford,Brown,9 D USAmazon Price: $112.30List Price: $129.95Irish Setter Men's 838 Wingshooter 6" Waterproof Lace-up Boot,Amber,9 D USAmazon Price: $121.40List Price: $139.952011 Wooden Refillable Calendar Holder-IRISH SETTERAmazon Price: $19.99Men's Irish Setter Gunflint 1000 gram Thinsulate Ultra Insulation Boots Mossy Oak, MOSSY OAK, 11.5Amazon Price: $117.50List Price: $129.95"Sit" takes on a whole new meaning!Kelly was larger than the average Irish Setter. He was taller, big chested and weighed about 95 pounds. As soon as he became full grown he developed an interesting habit.He would sit on sofas with his feet on the floor just as he was used to seeing it done by us and others. That always seemed to surprise people.Whenever we had a group of invited guests in our home, Kelly was always an integral part of the party. If there was a vacant spot on the sofa, he would settle in and look from one person to another as though he was following the conversation.He loved people!We vividly remember and still laugh about the time we had some guests for dinner from the home office. Everyone knew that we were animal lovers and many of them were also.Every available seat was taken and filled by people. The president of the company for which my husband worked was down on the floor playing with Kelly.Suddenly one gentleman got up to go to the restroom. The seat on the sofa next to his wife suddenly became vacant. She was probably the only person in the room not fond of dogs.Can you guess the rest?Kelly immediately grabbed that chance to sit on the sofa next to her. Not only did he sit there, but he...being the friendly sort of fellow that he was...kept inching over to her and was just about sitting on her lap by the time her husband returned. He was just trying his best to be friendly!Everyone in the room was laughing...with one exception. But she took it in good humor considering the circumstances.Memories of our boyKelly lived a good and long life.He was a great big majestic soul who enriched our lives greatly. Intelligent, fun loving, energetic and loving were all descriptions that aptly fit that beautiful red canine first born "child" of ours. Kelly had such cute ways about him and people from many years ago still remember and talk about him.While I would never recommend getting an Irish Setter if one lives in an apartment, it worked out in our case. But we did as much as we could to keep him exercised and engaged. And it was not long before he had a huge yard of his own in which to run and play.Irish Setters, from our experience, are a great dog breed. They are typically loving and friendly. While they might not all play basketball like our Kelly did, they will be sure to keep you entertained and smiling through the years.Have you ever had or would you want an Irish Setter?

It did not take long before they were sleeping with us!  Ha!Thanks for your comment.Mardi17 months ago Peggy, how heartwarming! My Lab mystery cross Sasha, not in my avatar picture, sits just like your Kelly did on the couch. Barak, the Lab Border Collie cross in this pic does everything she does, but his little legs are a bit shorter. Between the two of them they are almost 130 pounds of dog, they are all on the bed as well!Peggy W17 months ago Hi Mardi,Our dogs have always slept with us.  At one time we had 3 of them sharing our bed!  Nice to hear that you love yours as much as we did ours.  Right now we have two cats + my mother's Pomeranian dog, Skippy.  We love them all...dogs and cats.  Thanks for your comment.  Barak is a handsome fellow.bingskee17 months ago what a lovely dog...Peggy W17 months ago Hello bingskee,Kelly certainly was a lovely dog as are all Irish Setters.  Thanks for the comment.BirteEdwards17 months ago From the way you tell the story of Kelly, it is obvious that you loved him very much, and that you still miss him, despite having other dogs.Of course he was your "first born" and that is always special.But Kelly sounds like a very special dog. I love animals, and I have unfortunately only had one dog (not an Irish Setter), but if ever I again have one, I could consider one.ethel smith17 months ago Beautiful dog. Funny isn't it how dogs always go to the people who are apprehensive of them. Dogs may leave large holes in our hearts when they go but they also leave great memories.loveroflife17 months ago Kelly must have really been a special dog.  Why don't we see many Irish Setters anymore?Peggy W17 months ago Hi Birte,I don't think that you would be disappointed if you get one in the future.  Irish Setters are so sweet and loving.  If you want a scary guard dog...they are definitely not the breed to get.  They are in love with the world!Thanks for the comment.Peggy W17 months ago Hi Ethel,Yes, it was like Kelly knew the people who needed a little reassurance that dogs (Irish Setters, in his case) are wonderful creatures and he was going to do his part to educate them.  LOLI also agree that they leave great big holes in our hearts when they die, but also great and living memories.Thanks for commenting.Peggy W17 months ago Hi loveroflife,Yes, Kelly was very special.  As to why we don't see more Irish Setters around...I have no idea.  They are such beautiful, great and gentle creatures.  Guess fashions come and go in canine companions as well as dress.  (Sigh)Thanks for the comment.Melody Lagrimas17 months ago That was very enjoyable, Peggy.Peggy W17 months ago Hi Melody,Happy to know that you enjoyed this.  Kelly was quite a character.  He has been gone for many years now but the memories can still bring a smile to our faces.

Clearly a very smart dog. I really enjoyed this Hub.Peggy W13 months ago Hello Truth From Truth,Your small dogs would not be able to play basketball like our Irish Setter...but am sure that they play in their own way.

Thanks for posting!Peggy W12 months ago Hello Jason Roatan,Happy that you liked this story of our Irish Setter dog, Kelly, who liked playing basketball.  He was quite the entertaining family member!  Thanks for the comment.jasmin r7 months ago i live in an apartment and i am thinking of getting a little irish setter girl, but everywhere i read that this dog is not recommended or apartment life. I work 4 and a half days aweek from about 10 to 6pm, i do live next to central park and riverside park in nyc, i could do 1 hour walk in the morning and another hour in the evening. a small walk in the afternoon, do you think it be alright? i had a golden retriever for 12 years and i played a lot with her, also took her on vacaton with me to have her swim. what do you think?Peggy W7 months ago Hi jasmin r,Since you read this hub...you already know that we ended up having Kelly as an apartment dog for the first part of his life.  It sounds to me as though any dog you adopt would be the recipient of your great love and devotion.  Irish Setters are definitely high strung and need lots of attention. While not ideal for apartments...if you can put the time and effort into all those walks and playtime...good luck to you.  It worked for us.  We found places where he could run with abandon and work off some of that energy which seems to last for quite a few years before they settle down.  Our Kelly was a love!  Best of wishes to you!billyaustindillon6 months ago Beautiful dog - we have had blue healers, kelpies, labradors and pomeranians all high energy so that aspect doesn't worry me. None of them played basket ball though - the blue healer and kelpie love balls and frisbees though. I am a big fan of dogs though as you probably gathered. I lovely tribute to your buddies Peggy.Peggy W6 months ago Hi billyaustindillon,You have had some nice dogs!  We now have my mother's Pomeranian and 2 inside cats as our companions.  Kelly, the Irish Setter was our first "baby" but each and every one since have held special places in our hearts.  Like you, we too love animals.  Thanks as always for the comment.Laura3 months ago I had an Irish Setter when I was little named Mule and he was my parents first dog when they married.  So when my husband and I first started dating I told him he was a boy that needed a dog.  We drove 5 hours to pick out a little puppy from an Irish Setter litter.  11 pups in all but our little Dixie was the one for us.  She is a wonderful dog and we love her so much.  I was raised with lots of setters and pointers.  So when my dad offered us a puppy from an English Setter litter we went for it.  So Dixie has a little sister Belle now and they are best friends.  Dixie is so protective of Belle and they both love Pace our cat, which I never thought would happen.  Oh we love our animals.  My husband says no more until we have more room.  I loved your story!Peggy W3 months ago Hi Laura,Aren't Irish Setters fun!  Am sure your Mule gave you as much love and fun as did our Kelly.  Nice that you have Dixie, Belle and Pace in your family now.  Thanks for commenting and letting me know about your dogs and cat.  We love animals too!!!  :-)Basketball3 months ago Hahahahsuch a beautiful and talented dog!
