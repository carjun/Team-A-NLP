He is crazy and evil  a word not used enough, Mr. Erickson writes. The guy is very clearly not of the tea party movement, not a Dittohead, not led by Sarah Palin, me, or anyone else on the right.He adds: But the media, at least as of this morning and its accumulated coverage so far on this matter, could not care less. The media is intent on yet again exploring right-wing rhetoric and tea party hate. Left-wingers yesterday were falling all over themselves to blame everyone on the right for the horrific shooting.Jack Shafer, writing in Slate, agrees with Mr. Erickson that the political rhetoric is not to blame.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Media, Other Things, Politics, Updates, Womena leading conservative blogger, conservatives, Erick Erickson, RedState.com, Shooter being tied to the political right, Tucson shooting rhetoricRead moreTucson Shooting Update 1/9/11 ..Giffords responsive, Flags at half mast, 2nd Person of interestJanuary 9, 2011jamesb1013 commentsIt is about 24 hours after yesterdays tragedy in Tucson, ArizonaThe country is still trying grasp and deal with its aftermathHere are some of the UpdatesDoctors Say Gabby Giffords Able To CommunicateRyan J.

Ive polled thousands of high school history teachers and spoken about the war to audiences across the country, and there is little agreement even on why the South seceded. Was it over slavery? States rights? Tariffs and taxes?As the nation begins to commemorate the anniversaries of the wars various battles  from Fort Sumter to Appomattox  lets first dispense with some of the more prevalent myths about why it all began.1. The South seceded over states rights.Confederate states did claim the right to secede, but no state claimed to be seceding for that right. In fact, Confederates opposed states rights  that is, the right of Northern states not to support slavery.On Dec. 24, 1860, delegates at South Carolinas secession convention adopted a Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union. It noted an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery and protested that Northern states had failed to fulfill their constitutional obligations by interfering with the return of fugitive slaves to bondage. Slavery, not states rights, birthed the Civil War.South Carolina was further upset that New York no longer allowed slavery transit. In the past, if Charleston gentry wanted to spend August in the Hamptons, they could bring their cook along. No longer  and South Carolinas delegates were outraged. In addition, they objected that New England states let black men vote and tolerated abolitionist societies. According to South Carolina, states should not have the right to let their citizens assemble and speak freely when what they said threatened slavery.Other seceding states echoed South Carolina. Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery  the greatest material interest of the world, proclaimed Mississippi in its own secession declaration, passed Jan. 9, 1861. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of the commerce of the earth. . . . A blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.The Souths opposition to states rights is not surprising. Until the Civil War, Southern presidents and lawmakers had dominated the federal government. The people in power in Washington always oppose states rights. Doing so preserves their own..More from the James Loewen piece.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesDSD @PoliticalDog101, Five Myths of the Civil War, James Loewen, Lincoln, Slavery, The Civil War, To Free the Slaves, To keep the Union, Lies My Teacher Told Me"Read moreThe Twitter finger pointing about the Tucson shooting.January 8, 2011jamesb1014 commentsFrom Politico..Mission accomplished, Sarah Palin, Kos tweeted soon after word of the shooting broke, a reference to the target list of congressional members who voted in support of health care reform that the former Alaska governor and conservative icon created on the six-month anniversary of the health care law.Koss words were met with pushback from conservative Andrew Breitbart, who tweeted, For the love of God, @markos. Stop it. Dont go there, trust me. Trust me. Trust me. You will not like the blow-back, I assure you.Palin posted a statement on Facebook around 3 p.m., calling for peace and justice. She did not make any direct reference to the debate over political rhetoric, playing out on her own Facebook page, which drew more than 3,000 comments.My sincere condolences are offered to the family of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and the other victims of todays tragic shooting in Arizona, Palin wrote. On behalf of Todd and my family, we all pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and justice.Palin, the original Mama Grizzly, had a famous line about how conservatives should not retrench, but instead should reload.How dare people politicize a political assassination! Moulitsas said in another tweet, which came just as most news outlets were pulling back initial reports that Giffords had died, correcting them to say instead that she was badly wounded and in surgery.The New York Post quoted Giffords weeping father, who said, when asked if the congresswoman had enemies: Yeahthe whole Tea Party.But those commenting on Palins Facebook page were equal parts supportive and casting blameMore.(The Markos Moulitas photo added by the Dog..)Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Media, Men, Other Things, Updates, WomenDaily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas, Sarah Palin, Tucson Shootings, twitterRead moreBlog tip: New York  through the Lens..Talkandpolitics.January 8, 2011jamesb101No commentsOr rather  a tumblr tip, this new micro-blogging service..Manhattan and Brooklyn BridgeLots of good photography, and its linked up to a more extensive flickr-site with hundreds of images.

Donald L. Carcieri, had issued to crack down on illegal immigration.To cheers, Governor Chafee officially rescinded the edict that he termed an agent of divisiveness, incivility and distrust among the states citizens. He did so in a packed room at the International Institute of Rhode Island, a nonprofit agency that assists immigrants and refugees.Chafee said he was turning back the clock to March 26, 2008, the day before Carcieri issued his Illegal Immigration Control Order. Carcieri said then that he intended to curb what he termed an epidemic, the costly flow of illegal immigrants. The order sparked numerous protests and spread fear in the immigrant community.Today, we are living up to those standards established by Roger Williams when he came here in 1636, Chafee said, standards of welcome, tolerance, personal rights and the broadest freedoms in the world.The rescission lifts a requirement that state agencies and state vendors screen employees through the federal E-Verify system. Critics say E-Verify is prone to inaccuracy.Chafee also clarified that he is also directing state police Col. Brendan P. Doherty to end the so-called 287(g) agreement between state police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Carcieris order directed state police to pursue the agreement. It led to four troopers being deputized with immigration-enforcement powers.Chafee cleared up confusion left after one of his senior staff members said Tuesday night that the rescission would leave the 287(g) agreement in place, and that whether the governor would choose to terminate the agreement is a different question. Thats not whats on the table  for right now. That is an issue that will be addressed in due course.Asked if the memorandum of understanding with ICE will be revoked, Chafee replied, Thats correct. Thats correct. He added, We will continue to work with all the immigrant communities and state police to make sure were enforcing the laws to the best of our ability, but not doing immigration and customs work.Doherty said later, I thought the [287(g)] process was working well. Reasonable minds may differ, but he is the governor.He added, We will continue to communicate and cooperate with ICE on matters of mutual concern and make sure the people of Rhode Island are safe in a variety of ways.Chafee said the real answer to curbing illegal immigration is through federal immigration reform. He pledged to push for that through the National Governors Association to get our immigrant community  some of whom are living in the shadows  out of the shadows.Chafees repeal, accomplished through an executive order terminating [the] illegal immigration control order, drew immediate praise.But some attending the ceremony raised concerns that new Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartins stated intent to enter a federal Secure Communities initiative could overshadow Chafees repeal of the executive order.The initiative would allow law-enforcement officers to fingerprint people under arrest and have them automatically checked against an immigration databasehttp://www.projo.com/news/content/CHAFEE_RESCINDS_ORDER_01-06-11_8GLQJOO_v15.34cdb6.htmlShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Updatesimmigration, RI Gove Lincoln Chaffe, Illegal Immigration Control Order -repealedRead moreArizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords among 12 shot at Tucson grocery.January 8, 2011jamesb10147 commentsRepresentative Giffords at an event in October.Congresswoman Giffords Shot in TucsonCondition of Rep.

But if the sheer intensity of the quarrel seems disproportionate to that seemingly straightforward dispute, thats because its also deeply personal. Long-simmering resentment of two of the leading figures on the economic right, American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene  who runs the event  and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, who has long been involved in planning it, has morphed into a conflict that carries the special bitterness of a civil war.There are a lot of conservatives who see a larger problem with Grover Norquist and David Keene, and theyve decided to fight it out and CPAC is a proxy for that, said Erick Erickson, the publisher of RedState.org, who said he wont be participating in the conference because he wants to stay out of the conflict. The underlying question is whether the conservative movement still has strong planks for social conservatism and national security conservatism. But it has also become very personal.If youve been around this town for a long time, as I have youve got people who disagree with you substantively and youve got people who dont like you and if you hang around long enough, their numbers increase, said Keene, who dismissed many of the attacks as residing in the fever swamps of the website WorldNetDaily.Its no secret that some social conservatives are very upset at the idea that there would be any participation by any organization thats gay, but over the course of the 37 or 38 years that CPACs been in existence weve had all kinds of people suggest that other people ought to be tossed out, he said. Our mission is once a year to allow social, economic, and national security conservatives to come together.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesConservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, David Keene, GOProud, Grover Norquist, Libertarian, Republicans/GOP, Social Conservatives, the 'Right'Read morePage 1 of 112123...112Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
