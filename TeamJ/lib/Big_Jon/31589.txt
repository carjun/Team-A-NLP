Wikipedia:No original research - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWikipedia:No original researchFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia(Redirected from Wikipedia:OR)Jump to: navigation,searchTo raise issues with specific articles, see the No original research noticeboardThis page documents an English Wikipedia policy, a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus.Shortcuts:WP:ORWP:NORWP:ORIGWP:ORIGINALThis page in a nutshell: Wikipedia does not publish original thought: all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published source. Articles may not contain any new analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position not clearly advanced by the sources.The Five PillarsContent policiesArticle titlesBiographies of living personsNeutral point of viewNo original researchVerifiabilityWhat Wikipedia is notWikipedia does not publish original research. The term "original research" refers to materialsuch as facts, allegations, ideas, and storiesnot already published by reliable sources. It also refers to any analysis or synthesis of published material to advance a position not advanced by or detailed within the sources.This means that all material added to articles must be attributable to a reliable published source, even if not actually attributed. The sourcing policy, Verifiability, says a source must be provided for all quotations, and for anything challenged or likely to be challengedbut a source must exist even for material that is never challenged. "Paris is the capital of France" needs no source because no one is likely to object to it, but we know that sources for that sentence exist. If no source exists for something you want to add to Wikipedia, it is "original research". To demonstrate that you are not adding original research, you must be able to cite reliable published sources that are both directly related to the topic of the article, and that directly support the material as presented.Despite the need to attribute content to reliable sources, you must not plagiarize them. Articles should be written in your own words while substantially retaining the meaning of the source material."No original research" is one of three core content policies, along with Neutral point of view and Verifiability, that jointly determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in articles. Because these policies work in harmony, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should try to familiarize themselves with all three.Contents1 Sources1.1 Reliable sources1.2 Using sources1.3 Primary, secondary and tertiary sources2 Synthesis of published material that advances a position3 Citing oneself4 Original images5 Translations6 Routine calculations7 Related policies7.1 Verifiability7.2 Neutral point of view8 See also9 Notes10 Further reading[edit] SourcesResearch that consists of collecting and organizing material from existing sources within the provisions of this and other content policies is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia. The best practice is to write articles by researching the most reliable sources on the topic and summarizing what they say in your own words, with each statement in the article attributable to a source that makes that statement explicitly. Source material should be carefully summarized or rephrased without changing its meaning or implication. Take care not to go beyond what is expressed in the sources or to use them in ways inconsistent with the intent of the source, such as using material out of context. In short, stick to the sources.If no reliable third-party sources can be found on an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article about it.[edit] Reliable sourcesMain page: WP:SOURCESAny material that is challenged or likely to be challenged must be supported by a reliable source. Material for which no reliable source can be found is considered original research. The only way you can show that your edit is not original research is to cite a reliable published source that contains the same material. Even with well-sourced material, if you use it out of context or to advance a position not directly and explicitly supported by the source, you are engaging in original research; see below.In general, the most reliable sources are: peer-reviewed journals; books published by university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and, mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication. Self-published material, whether on paper or online, is generally not regarded as reliable, but see self-published sources for exceptions.[edit] Using sourcesInformation in an article must be verifiable in the references cited. In general, article statements should not rely on unclear or inconsistent passages nor on passing comments. Passages open to multiple interpretations should be precisely cited or avoided. A summary of extensive discussion should reflect the conclusions of the source's author(s). Drawing conclusions not evident in the reference is original research regardless of the type of source. It is important that references be cited in context and on topic.[edit] Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"WP:PRIMARY" redirects here. For the article naming guideline, see WP:PRIMARYTOPIC.Policy shortcuts:WP:PSTSWP:PRIMARYWP:SECONDARYWikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources and, to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources. Secondary or tertiary sources are needed to establish the topic's notability and to avoid novel interpretations of primary sources, though primary sources are permitted if used carefully. All interpretive claims, analyses, or synthetic claims about primary sources must be referenced to a secondary source, rather than original analysis of the primary-source material by Wikipedia editors.Appropriate sourcing can be a complicated issue, and these are general rules. Deciding whether primary, secondary or tertiary sources are appropriate on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages. For the purposes of this policy, primary, secondary and tertiary sources are defined as follows:[1]Primary sources are very close to an event, often accounts written by people who are directly involved, offering an insider's view of an event, a period of history, a work of art, a political decision, and so on. An account of a traffic accident written by a witness is a primary source of information about the accident; similarly, a scientific paper is a primary source about the experiments performed by the authors. Historical documents such as diaries are primary sources.[2]Policy: Unless restricted by another policy, primary sources that have been reliably published may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. A primary source may only be used on Wikipedia to make straightforward, descriptive statements that any educated person, with access to the source but without specialist knowledge, will be able to verify are supported by the source. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages to describe the plot, but any interpretation needs a secondary source. Do not make analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims about material found in a primary source. Do not base articles entirely on primary sources. Do not add unsourced material from your personal experience, because that would make Wikipedia a primary source of that material. Use extra caution when handling primary sources about living people; see WP:BLPPRIMARY, which is policy.Secondary sources are second-hand accounts, at least one step removed from an event. They rely on primary sources for their material, often making analytic or evaluative claims about them.[3] For example, a review article that analyzes research papers in a field is a secondary source for the research.[4] Whether material counts as a primary or secondary source is not fixed. A book by a military historian about the Second World War might be a secondary source of material about the war, but if it includes details of the author's own war experiences, it would be a primary source of material about those issues.Policy: Wikipedia articles usually rely on material from secondary sources. Articles may include analytic or evaluative claims only if these have been published by a reliable secondary source.Tertiary sources are publications such as encyclopedias or other compendia that mainly summarize secondary sources. Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Many introductory undergraduate-level textbooks are regarded as tertiary sources because they sum up multiple secondary sources.Policy: Reliably published tertiary sources can be helpful in providing broad summaries of topics that involve many primary and secondary sources. Some tertiary sources may be more reliable than others, and within any given tertiary source, some articles may be more reliable than others. Wikipedia articles may not be used as tertiary sources in other Wikipedia articles, but are sometimes used as primary sources in articles about Wikipedia itself.[edit] Synthesis of published material that advances a positionPolicy shortcuts:WP:SYNWP:SYNTHESISWP:ORIGINAL SYNDo not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. This would be a synthesis of published material to advance a new position, which is original research.[5] "A and B, therefore C" is acceptable only if a reliable source has published the same argument in relation to the topic of the article.A simple example of original synthesis:N The UN's stated objective is to maintain international peace and security, but since its creation there have been 160 wars throughout the world.Both parts of the sentence may be reliably sourced, but here they have been combined to imply that the UN has failed to maintain world peace. If no reliable source has combined the material in this way, it is original research. It would be a simple matter to imply the opposite using the same material, illustrating how easily material can be manipulated when the sources are not adhered to:N The UN's stated objective is to maintain international peace and security, and since its creation there have been only 160 wars throughout the world.The following is a more complex example of original synthesis, based on an actual Wikipedia article about a dispute between two authors, here called Smith and Jones. The first paragraph is fine, because each of the sentences is carefully sourced, using a source that refers to this dispute:Y Smith claimed that Jones committed plagiarism by copying references from another author's book. Jones responded that it is acceptable scholarly practice to use other people's books to find new references.Now comes the original synthesis:N If Jones did not consult the original sources, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the Harvard Writing with Sources manual, which requires citation of the source actually consulted. The Harvard manual does not call violating this rule "plagiarism". Instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them.The second paragraph is original research because it expresses a Wikipedia editor's opinion that, given the Harvard manual's definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it. To make the second paragraph consistent with this policy, a reliable source would be needed that specifically comments on the Smith and Jones dispute and makes the same point about the Harvard manual and plagiarism. In other words, that precise analysis must have been published by a reliable source in relation to the topic before it can be published on Wikipedia.[edit] Citing oneselfPolicy shortcuts:WP:SELFCITINGWP:COSIf you are able to discover something new, Wikipedia is not the place to premiere such a discovery. This policy does not prohibit editors with specialist knowledge from adding their knowledge to Wikipedia. In fact, expert input is encouraged and experts often have specific knowledge of the relevant literature. However, as with all editors, this policy does prohibit experts from drawing on their personal knowledge without citing reliable sources. If an editor has published the results of his or her research in a reliable publication, the editor may cite that source while writing in the third person and complying with our neutrality and conflict of interest policies. See also Wikipedia's guidelines on conflict of interest.[edit] Original imagesPolicy shortcut:WP:OIBecause of copyright law in a number of countries, there are relatively few images available for use in Wikipedia. Editors are therefore encouraged to upload their own images, releasing them under the GFDL, CC-BY-SA, or other free licenses. Original images created by a Wikipedian are not considered original research, so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments, the core reason behind the NOR policy. Image captions are subject to this policy no less than statements in the body of the article. It is not acceptable for an editor to use photo manipulation to distort the facts or position illustrated by an image. Manipulated images should be prominently noted as such. Any manipulated image where the encyclopedic value is materially affected should be posted to Wikipedia:Files for deletion. Images of living persons must not present the subject in a false or disparaging light.[edit] TranslationsPolicy shortcut:WP:ETRANSSee also: Wikipedia:Verifiability#Non-English sourcesWhere English translations of non-English material are unavailable, editors may supply their own, subject to consensus, with the original posted alongside or in a footnote. Copyright restrictions permitting, translations published by reliable sources are preferred to those provided by Wikipedians.[edit] Routine calculationsPolicy shortcut:WP:CALCThis policy allows routine mathematical calculations, such as adding numbers, converting units, or calculating a person's age, provided editors agree that the arithmetic and its application correctly reflect the sources. See here for some conversion templates.[edit] Related policies[edit] VerifiabilityMain page: Wikipedia:VerifiabilityThe threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. The policy says that all material challenged or likely to be challenged, including quotations, needs a reliable source; what counts as a reliable source is described here.[edit] Neutral point of viewMain page: Wikipedia:Neutral point of viewThe prohibition against original research limits the extent to which editors may present their own points of view in articles. By reinforcing the importance of including verifiable research produced by others, this policy promotes the inclusion of multiple points of view. Consequently, this policy reinforces our neutrality policy. In many cases, there are multiple established views of any given topic. In such cases, no single position, no matter how well researched, is authoritative. It is not the responsibility of any one editor to research all points of view. But when incorporating research into an article, it is important that editors provide context for this point of view, by indicating how prevalent the position is, and whether it is held by a majority or minority.The inclusion of a view that is held only by a tiny minority may constitute original research. Jimbo Wales has said of this:If your viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;If your viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;If your viewpoint is held by an extremely small minority, then  whether it's true or not, whether you can prove it or not  it doesn't belong in Wikipedia, except perhaps in some ancillary article. Wikipedia is not the place for original research.[6][edit] See also{{Original research}}  template used to warn of original research{{Synthesis}}  template used to warn of unpublished synthesisHow to cite sourcesWikipedia:No original research/history  origins of this policyWikipedia:Template messages/DisputesWikipedia:These are not original researchWikipedia:No original research/ExamplesObserver effect  Wikipedia's popularity means that documenting an obscure concept (e.g. an internet meme) in Wikipedia might increase its visibility, generating artificial notability as other sources cover it due to the additional exposure obtained from WikipediaWikialityNo original research noticeboardvdeKey Wikipedia policies and guidelinesOverviewFive pillars Policies and guidelines  List of policies and guidelines (Summary list of policies Summary list of guidelines)Project-wide principlesWhat Wikipedia is not Editing policy Consensus Dispute resolution Ignore all rulesArticle standards policiesNeutral point of view Verifiability No original research Biographies of living persons Article titles DeletionBehavioral policiesChild protection Civility Edit warring No personal attacks No legal threats Ownership of articles Sock-puppetryBehavioral guidelinesAssume good faith Etiquette Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point Please do not bite the newcomers Gaming the systemClassification guidelinesCategories, lists, and navigation templates Categorization Template namespaceContent guidelinesConflict of interest Do not include copies of primary sources Disambiguation Do not create hoaxes Notability Patent nonsense Identifying reliable sourcesEditing guidelinesArticle size Be bold Hatnotes Signatures Talk page guidelines User pages SubpagesStyle conventionsManual of Style  Manual of Style (accessibility) Manual of Style (dates and numbers) Manual of Style (layout) Manual of Style (lists) Manual of Style (linking)Policies Guidelines[edit] Notes^ This University of Maryland library page provides typical examples of primary, secondary and tertiary sources.^ Further examples include archeological artifacts, census results, video or transcripts of surveillance, public hearings, trials, or interviews; tabulated results of surveys or questionnaires; original philosophical works; religious scripture; and artistic and fictional works such as poems, scripts, screenplays, novels, motion pictures, videos, and television programs. For definitions of primary sources:The University of Nevada, Reno Libraries define primary sources as providing "an inside view of a particular event". They offer as examples: original documents, such as autobiographies, diaries, e-mail, interviews, letters, minutes, news film footage, official records, photographs, raw research data, and speeches; creative works, such as art, drama, films, music, novels, poetry; and relics or artifacts, such as buildings, clothing, DNA, furniture, jewelry, pottery.The University of California, Berkeley library offers this definition: "Primary sources enable the researcher to get as close as possible to what actually happened during an historical event or time period. Primary sources were either created during the time period being studied, or were created at a later date by a participant in the events being studied (as in the case of memoirs) and they reflect the individual viewpoint of a participant or observer."Duke University, Libraries offers this definition: "A primary source is a first-hand account of an event. Primary sources may include newspaper articles, letters, diaries, interviews, laws, reports of government commissions, and many other types of documents."^ University of California, Berkeley library defines "secondary source" as "a work that interprets or analyzes an historical event or phenomenon. It is generally at least one step removed from the event".^ The Ithaca College Library compares research articles (primary sources) to review articles (secondary sources).^ Jimmy Wales has said of synthesized historical theories: "Some who completely understand why Wikipedia ought not create novel theories of physics by citing the results of experiments and so on and synthesizing them into something new, may fail to see how the same thing applies to history."
