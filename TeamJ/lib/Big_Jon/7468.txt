Embedded in Arctic muck are a large number of mammals that have been frozen before they could decay. Recently a completely preserved frozen woolly mammoth was excavated. In Alaska, duck-billed dinosaurs, turtles, conifers, herbaceous vegetation, and broad-leaved trees bear testimony to a tropical environment that once existed. Dr. Jack Wolfe in a 1978 U.S. Geological Survey Report submitted evidence of tropical vegetation in Alaska: mangrove, palm trees, Burmese laquer trees and others. (cited in Dillow, Joseph, The Waters Above, 1982 p. 348.) In 1998 a champosaur, an extinct subtropical crocodilian, and turtles were discovered in the Queen Elizabeth Islands in arctic Canada. Obviously such a reptilian was not mobile enough to migrate. This would require a temperature range of 25 to 35 for an area that currently sees temperatures of -45 degrees. (Oard, Michael, "A Tropical Reptile in the 'Cretaceous' Arctic," CEN Technical Journal, vol. 14, no. 2, 2000, p. 9.)Even evolutionists concede that tectonic plate movement has a hard time accounting for evidence like the metasequoias in-situ growth at Axel Hieberg (picture to the right taken from "Our Tropical Arctic," Canadian Geographic, Vol. 106 no. 6 Dec./Jan. 1987, pp. 28-37.) In 1998 a champosaur, an extinct subtropical crocodilian, and turtles were discovered in the Queen Elizabeth Islands in arctic Canada. Obviously such a reptilian was not mobile enough to migrate. This would require a temperature range of 25 to 35 for an area that currently sees temperatures of -45 degrees. (Oard, Michael, "A Tropical Reptile in the 'Cretaceous' Arctic," CEN Technical Journal, vol. 14, no. 2, 2000, p. 9.)A similar "lost world" is frozen in place at the South Pole. The geologist, Peter Barret, was one of the first to look for fossils in Antarctica. He discovered an amphibian jaw belonging to a creature that could only have survived in a warm, damp environment. Various paleontologists have followed his lead. Thirteen thousand feet up Mt. Kirkpatrick in Antarctica (400 miles from the Pole) pterosaurs, carnivorous theropods, and many other creatures have been found. Dr. Duane Gish asks a pertinent question How could animals like dinosaurs, flying reptiles, and turtles survive alongside ferns and conifers in areas with very low temperature and months of darkness? (Evolution: The Fossils Stills Say No!, 1995 p. 127)Obviously, there was a dramatically different climate at the poles. "The discovery of thousands of well-preserved leaves in Antarctica has sparked a debate among geologists over whether the polar region, rather than being blanketed by a massive sheet of ice for millions of years enjoyed a near-temperate climate as recently as three million years ago." (Raymond, Chris, "Discovery of Leaves in Antarctica Sparks Debate over Whether Region Had Near-Temperate Climate," Chronicle of Higher Education, March,1991, p. A9, as cited in Morris, 1997, p. 273) http://www.genesispark.org/genpark/trop/trop.htm 10 days agoflag  reply+2JanforGore  congoboy:Excuse me, but we are in 2010, and the Arctic as of the date of the current NSIDC report is continuing to show less sea ice extent and more melting of multi-year ice. Again, your attempt to politicize this and to deny it only shows you are not able to read and assess scientific information. 10 days agoflag  reply+1Wetdog  congoboy:There are wooly mammoth fossils in New York and Missouri too, so what?     There are also whale fossils in Kansas and the Egyptian desert.       The climate has changed before.    Antarctica was once located on the equator and was part of a super continent called Pangeia.    All of the present day continents were---of coarse there are fossils of tropical plants and animals.     Tectonic plate movement is a basic fundamental element of geology.        The facts pertinent to the article Jan posted are          1) a basic physical property of CO2 is that it absorbs infrared radiation and it is converted to heat.         2)  Since the start of the industrial revolution in the late 1800s, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has risen as a result of human activity---and the rate of change is increasing exponentially due to increasing population and increasing fossil fuel use.          3)  Increasing amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere mean more infrared radiation is absorbed and retained as heat.    It has to be, there is no place else for it to go.           4)   The heat in the atmosphere is conducted by convection and conduction to the surface, causing changes in weather patterns in the short term, and changes in climate in the long term.    That is what weather and climate are---movement of heat through the atmospheric and geologic formations that make up the earth. 10 days agoflag  reply-2IceKat  Wetdog:"Increasing amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere mean more infrared radiation is absorbed and retained as heat. It has to be, there is no place else for it to go. " If your theory had been correct the world would have burned to a cinder centuries ago. You assert that the atmosphere is sucking in infra-red radiation and retaining it, then why isn't the planet continually warming, and don't try to tell me it is unless you can prove that other warm periods were cooler than today's.Why, if CO2 continually retains infra-red radiation, did global temperatures fall this year?Data - RSS  Lower troposphere.July               +0.608C    August          +0.583C   September    +0.525C    October        +0.293C    November     +0.312CWhat has brought the temperature down from the peak of +0.858C in April 1998? Has CO2 taken a holiday or are there other factors involved?You need to do some research to discover what factors are involved in atmospheric cooling. 10 days agoflag  reply+1Wetdog  IceKat:------" 4) The heat in the atmosphere is conducted by convection and conduction to the surface, causing changes in weather patterns in the short term, and changes in climate in the long term. That is what weather and climate are---movement of heat through the atmospheric and geologic formations that make up the earth."-----     I did not say the heat stays in the atmosphere. 10 days agoflag  reply-2IceKat  Wetdog:"Increasing amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere mean more infrared radiation is absorbed and retained as heat."Retained. So what is your definition of retained?Still, it doesn't get away from the fact that CO2 is not causing run-away warming. 10 days agoflag  reply-2IceKat  JanforGore:This is yet another attempt to make things look worse than they really are. Arctic ice extent has hit a low point, agreed, but there's more to it than that, as well you know!Look at the chart showing current Arctic temperatures. Temperatures did rise to around 255K (-20C) in November but are you telling me that ice melts at -20C? I don't think so, so there must be something else going on here. For a start US Navy PIPS data shows multi-year ice thicker than 2.5 metres has increased in two years - it isn't all about extent. Arctic sea ice blows around and piles up, it isn't like an ice cube sitting on a table. Temperatures have since fallen and are now around -32C so don't expect the ice to melt away anytime soon. 10 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  JanforGore:jan you epitomize politicizing. i'll match my real science to your junk science any day 10 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  Wetdog:thats exactly my point. The climate has changed before and will again, with or without mans alleged influence. so whats your point? 10 days agoflag  reply-2congoboy  JanforGore:so call me when the current natural cycle ends. in the mean time quit using electricity, buying groceries and driving a car. be part of the solution, not the problem. 10 days agoflag  reply+2JanforGore  congoboy:Oh, can your phony challenges. I'm not here nor do I care to engage in your showy pissing matches on this site in order to prove something. -  And on edit, that goes for every other member of the denier disrupt club here.And please tell me how the NSIDC site is political. I'll wait. You do nothing but post here to showcase your political superiority and trash "leftylibs." Please spare us all your fake posturing. 10 days agoflag  reply0JanforGore  congoboy:It is being quickened in pace and severity by human forcings which we as humans cannot keep up with in order to sustain ourselves.  Are you really that dense? 10 days agoflag  reply+1JanforGore  congoboy:Again, you show your ignorance. This is a combination of natural cycles being pushed to their limit by human intervention to the point that the changes now taking place are too pronounced and fast for us to keep up with at a pace that will adequately sustain life. That has always been what scientists have stated. NONE have ever stated that the Earth does not go through natural cycles. It is understood. It is only political parrots and paid operatives of oil companies and politcal groups like the Tea Party financed by oil companies and the Koch Brothers who use that false argument to negate the truth for their own ideological agenda. Please, do us all a favor and spare yourself anymore embarrassment and actually read something instead of just parroting your political mentors. 10 days agoflag  reply-1IceKat  JanforGore:Show us the evidence. Show us that the storms, droughts, floods and heatwaves that occurred previous to 1800 were less severe and that humans had a better climate. Then maybe this time you will actually answer the question I have been asking for months; when was the climate correct? What is the correct temperature of the earth?And then you can explain why, if things are getting worse, are people living longer and, according to a recent study are predicted to live even longer in years to come?Maybe you can also explain why this "quickening in pace" does not include things like tropical storms:"Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA) Only 14 typhoons formed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 2010, the lowest number since the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) began keeping typhoon records in 1958, a meteorologist said Wednesday."Maybe a quickening in pace means a slowing in pace, just as global warming is responsible for global cooling!How stupid do you think people are? Apart from continually moving the goal-posts, predictions never come true (except for the ones who predict everything and blame it on climate change) theories fail, and reality has never followed climate models or predictions.The theories of the extremists have failed time and time again, and yet some people still desperately cling to the global warming theory in the hope that catastrophe will occur. Yes, that is what they want. Why else would scientific evidence disproving the imminent disaster be dismissed instantly? Give them good news - they hate it. Give them bad news and it's all hands on deck, blame someone, make people pay, lay on the guilt - look what we did to our beautiful planet - as if humans had no right to be here.In any other world, a theory that fails constantly and shows absolutely no correlation to reality would be dismissed out of hand, but not global warming. That theory will be kept alive long after stagnation and rigor mortis has set in, at least until they can invent a new catastrophe to feed upon. 10 days agoflag  reply-2IceKat  JanforGore:"And please tell me how the NSIDC site is political. "NSIDC is funded by government/public money.

So what?    Yes, it has.    You want to "prove" that since crocodiles have lived in Antarctica in the past---that disproves man made climate change.     Antarctica was once on the equator.      We used to think dinosaurs had scales and were cold blooded.    We now know that many of them had feathers and were warm blooded.      Prove that man is not digging coal and oil out of the earth at prodigious rates and burning them.            Then, I would be able to agree with you that climate change is not man made. 9 days agoflag  reply0Wetdog  congoboy:It is winter dope.    The melting cycle  will resume when summer gets here.   The point is, each year the melting cycle comes earlier, and ends later.     The net effect over time is that there is less ice each year. 9 days agoflag  reply-1IceKat  Wetdog:"...each year the melting cycle comes earlier, and ends later"Oops... not quite! One year where that didn't happen was this year (2010). The ice melt season began later and ended sooner giving an overall shorter melt season than many previous years. Also worth noting is that when the ice began to form it happened at a much faster rate than seen previously. 9 days agoflag  reply0Wetdog  congoboy:The solution is don't use coal and oil.      If we use natural gas(methane, CH4) to generate electricity---we produce less than 1/2 the amount of CO2 to produce the same amount of energy----and there are no strip mines, the air is clean, and there are no mountains of soot and ash to laden with heavy metal toxins to find their way into the food chain.There is nothing hard, mysterious or expensive about replacing coal with natural gas.    It is the cheapest consumer available form of energy we have.      And we have far more natural gas reserves than coal.Biofuels can do anything that can be done with petroleum.     Biofuels do not produce new CO2 in the atmosphere----every atom of carbon in biofuels is first removed from the atmosphere by the plants they are made from.     It is impossible to raise atmospheric CO2 using biofuels.        And biofuels are far superior fuels to petroleum.     Biofuels are extrmemely low in pollution.     Ethanol is water soluble and extremely low in toxicity.    If the Mecondo well had been leaking ethanol instead of oil----the leak would probably not even been detectable at the surface, and there would have been almost no loss of wildlife and no fouling of beaches and marshes for hundreds of miles.       And ethanol can be made anywhere out of any type of plant material---we've been able to do it for over 100 years.    No shipping  oil half way around the world or more, spilling it all over, fouling the air, and strip mining the earth to get it.      Ethanol is cheap to produce, and using ethanol, we can more than double the thermal efficiency of our internal combustion engines---we've been doing it for over 100 years.     The fastest, most advanced race cars in the world all use ethanol----because gasoline can't even come close to the kind of performance you can get using ethanol.      No batteries required. 9 days agoflag  reply0Gravity_Man  IceKat:Weather Pendulums => darn things; so unpredictable!!! 9 days agoflag  reply0IceKat  Wetdog:I think your 'amazing ethanol' argument was well and truly trashed in another thread. Unfortunately JanforGore decided to censor that thread so all the comments were lost"BTW, I deleted the previous entry on this because I was tired of coming into the thread and seeing the same disruptors and the same fights. So thanks Current for providing that option. ;-) " - JanforGoreAlso worth noting is that she subsequently deleted her original comment that contained the above statement.But just to add a little about ethanol, a recent article found that, "Minnesota ethanol plants' price is pollution.Five ethanol facilities in Minnesota have been cited in the past 12 months for widespread air and water quality violations. They have paid more than $2.8 million in penalties and corrective actions."The pollution effects of ethanol are real and need to be taken into account. Ethanol may seem like a pollution-free alternative but its manufacturing process certainly isn't. Many greens themselves are turning away from the idealistic view of ethanol."At a green business conference on Monday, Al Gore admitted that his support for corn ethanol subsidies was a mistake. This news comes weeks before tax credits are up for renewal.U.S. tax breaks for ethanol make it profitable for refiners to use the fuel even when it is more expensive than gasoline.  Total ethanol subsidies reached $7.7 billion last year according to the International Energy Agency. In fact, biofuels worldwide received more subsidies than any other form of renewable energy."If ethanol was as cheap and effective as you assert, why does it need so much in the way of subsidies? Basically we're paying good money to produce food to burn in an expensive way while people in other countries starve. 9 days agoflag  reply-1IceKat  congoboy:"...someday they'll thank us" I don't think so. Even when more and more real evidence shows man's impact on the climate is insignificant, they'll tell us that although we were right, our reasons were based on immoral thinking based upon our reliance on Big Oil money, or political reasons. But seeing as climate change, in fact any form of weather, no matter where, when or how, is taken as evidence of man's interference, I doubt they'll ever concede their position. 9 days agoflag  reply+1Wetdog  IceKat:------" Even when more and more real evidence shows man's impact on the climate is insignificant, ......"---------     Anyone with even half a lick of sense only needs to look around to determine the complete falsehood and lunatic nonsense of that statement.--------"  they'll tell us that although we were right, our reasons were based on immoral thinking based upon our reliance on Big Oil money, or political reasons.

Then use methane, natural gas.     We can make it easily and cheaply from any type of biomass, even sewage.       How much sewage do you eat?     It is even possible to use gasoline, ethanol or compressed natural gas in the same vehicle. 9 days agoflag  reply-1IceKat  Wetdog:Don't get the impression I'm against biofuels in principle, but at the moment, just like other alternative methods of producing energy, there still needs to be a lot of research and development before these fuels are ready for use on the scale that will be needed."How much sewage do you eat?" None, actually, but I do get to read a whole lot of it. 9 days agoflag  reply0Wetdog  IceKat:------"  None, actually, but I do get to read a whole lot."--------     Too bad the only things you seem to be reading is garbage.      Otherwise you'd know that the reason we use gasoline is that it was originally a waste product that was either burned or dumped into streams.      It was toxic then----and it is still toxic now.       The only reason to use petroleum then was to generate  corporate profits at the expense of public health and the environment----and the only reason it is used now is to generate corporate profits at the expense of public health and the environment. 9 days agoflag  reply-1IceKat  Wetdog:"Too bad the only things you seem to be reading is garbage."Er no.

Natural gas can be used in catalytic fuel cells that are over 98% efficient.    The most efficient coal electrical plants are less than 40% efficient.    Natural gas is both a fossil fuel and a biofuel.     We can make methane(natural gas) easily and inexpensively from any kind of biomass at all, including sewage and landfills.

And we can make it out of any type of biomass at all-----with no high tech required.     We've been doing it since ancient Persian Empire.       Ethanol is a relatively recent newcomer---we've only been able to distill it into a fuel for about 1400 years---since about 600AD, although we've been making it since long before there was written language to record it.     One of the very first known instances of written language is ancient Summarian Cuniform on clay tablets----it is a recipe to make beer.      We even have a vehicle in manufacture, on sale and in use on the road by consumers right now that can run on all three.     The Fiat Siena Tetrafuel can run on gasoline, gasoline and ethanol mixtures, pure hydrous ethanol(unblended), and/or CNG(methane).       Every new vehicle sold should have multi-fuel technology on it.

With that outlook in mind, what do world climate experts actually think about the science of his movie?Professor Bob Carter of the Marine Geophysical Laboratory at James Cook University, in Australia gives what, for many Canadians, is a surprising assessment: "Gore's circumstantial arguments are so weak that they are pathetic. It is simply incredible that they, and his film, are commanding public attention."See also:Global Warming: The Cold, Hard Facts?US being hoodwinked into draconian climate policiesThe Gods must be laughingA sample of experts' comments about the science of "An Inconvenient Truth":But surely Carter is merely part of what most people regard as a tiny cadre of "climate change skeptics" who disagree with the "vast majority of scientists" Gore cites?No; Carter is one of hundreds of highly qualified non-governmental, non-industry, non-lobby group climate experts who contest the hypothesis that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are causing significant global climate change. "Climate experts" is the operative term here. Why? Because what Gore's "majority of scientists" think is immaterial when only a very small fraction of them actually work in the climate field. 12 days agoflag  reply-4ayipis  ayipis:that MOVIE alone generated a lot of money ..ahhh. i mean... a lot of awareness on what gore was trying to say 12 days agoflag  reply+1coolplanet  ayipis:Prof. Bob Carter is a geophysicist, not a climetologist.

Whether its reforming your nail biting habit (a perennial resolution of mine) or beginning an exercise plan, the new year is the time we try to better ourselves.That spirit can be applied to how we use energy in our homes. Taking simple steps will not only help you save energy, but will also save a nice chunk of change. You can invest that extra cash in a gym membership  or a vacation, depending on how youre feeling in February.Ive resolved to cut my morning showers down to a lean five minutes  Im too embarrassed to admit how long my showers take right now. If youre not a water hog like me, here are some other great resolutions to consider for 2011:1. Turn your thermostat down by two degrees. The difference will feel slight, but the savings really add up. By moving your thermostat setting by just two degrees, you could save as much as $125 per year. [1] Of course, youll save even more money if you turn it down lower, and Repower at Home commenters have tons of suggestions for making a slightly cooler house feel snug. Popular suggestions include adding extra layers, like wrist warmers and Snuggies, and gradually making the changes over time.2. Insulate your hot water pipes. Hot water pipes in the basement are out of sight, out of mind, so its easy to put off adding insulation to them. The good news is that you can easily add insulation to your hot water pipes in under an hour. Pay special attention to the pipes closest to your hot water heater these are responsible for a lot of heat loss. To make sure you follow through, take advantage of Repower at Homes commitment tool. The tool allows you to select a deadline and receive reminders to complete your action.3. Have an energy assessment. Nearly two-thirds of all single-family homes have inadequate or poor insulation. [2] By scheduling an energy assessment of your home, youll find out how your home is doing and where you can benefit from additional insulation and air sealing.Are there any energy-saving steps that youve been putting off? What new actions will you take in 2011?References: 12 days agoflag  reply+1tverdell  ayipis:Personally, I am not trying to reduce my carbon footprint per se.Only if it benefits me financially, such as buying a fuel efficient car to save gas money.That's why only a carbon tax will make a real difference.

Yes part of global warming is just that,warming of the earth BUT climate change is also what you are (thank you) showing to all of us here which is the disruption of the very delicate balance of mother nature shown in the unusual amounts of snow that we have been experiencing all over the world in fact several countries this year have recorded record amounts of snowfall. It can also show up as the increasing numbers of floods,hurricanes,droughts etc that are occuring at ever increasing rates. I also don't think that you are realizing the stories you are posting here were caused by SNOW and bad visibility NOT COLD.

This may seem kooky, but when I read and hear about where the planet is headed, and when I witness the resistance to acceptance of scientific truths, I am reminded of the DC Comics saga of Superman, whose father was ridiculed for warning that his planet was about to explode.In a spooky, unwitting prediction of events to come, the writers of the Superman series periodically reiterated how willful ignorance and calculated denial led to the extinction of a race of humans.  There is one significant difference, of course, between the comic book story and what is happening to Earth: no one here is capable of building a spaceship to send any of our offspring to safety on any other planet.  The rise in atmospheric and ocean temperatures has already begun to catalyze runaway, aberrant weather, and when humanity looks for relief from what will certainly be catastrophic consequences, no relief will be forthcoming.

He can mention him all he wants as I love the man and respect that he is still out here getting this truth out to educate people like him. The rise in atmospheric CO2 is now causing a rise in methane in melting permafrost, and that is the harbinger we did not want to truly see released. Saturation of oceans, land, etc is only producing a positive feedback loop that will make it harder and harder to compensate for the longer we continue to deforest the planet and burn fossil fuels without understanding or caring about the consequences of our actions and thinking it will all take care of itself. I have a feeling next year while presenting opportunity will also present huge challenges to us. And I truly think it's time to leave the deniers, paid operatives, poltical partisans, etc. behind and get to the solutions that need to be instituted to at least try to give our grandchildren somewhat of a semblance of the planet we knew.

This study quantifies loss of multi-year ice due to melting, not just export. Excerpt:"Kwok and Cunningham show that between 1993 and 2009, a significant amount of multiyear ice - 1,400 cubic kilometers (336 cubic miles - was lost due to melt, not export. "The paper shows that there is indeed melt of old ice within the Arctic basin and the melt area has been increasing over the past several years," Kwok said. "The story is always more complicated - there is melt as well as export - but this is a another step in calculating the mass and area balance of the Arctic ice cover."The results have implications for understanding how Arctic sea ice gets redistributed, where melt occurs in the Arctic Ocean and how the ocean, ice and atmosphere interact as a system to affect Earth's climate.

At the end of November, Hudson Bay was still nearly ice-free. Arctic sea ice extent averaged over November 2010 was 9.89 million square kilometers (3.82 million square miles). This is the second-lowest November ice extent recorded over the period of satellite observations from 1979 to 2010, 50,000 square kilometers (19,300 square miles) above the previous record low of 9.84 million square kilometers (3.80 million square miles) set in 2006.Ice extent was unusually low in both the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Arctic and in Hudson Bay. Typically by the end of November, nearly half of Hudson Bay has iced over. But on November 30, only 17% of the bay was covered by sea ice. Compared to the 1979 to 2000 average, the ice extent was 12.4% below average for the Arctic as a whole." 12 days agoflag  replymore fromNews:Suspected CIA Banker Allen Stanfords Trial Indefinitely Delayed Online USA News: Fernanda Vasconcellos with her shoes Michael Vick More Important to Obama Than Family of Soldier Killed In Combat The #1 Work From Home Business Of 2011 . . . most populartop rankednew & rising1Remember When Beck Ridiculed Pelosi For Speaking Out Agains... 2Obama lays blow to closing Guantanamo 3Obama Created More Jobs in One Year Than Bush Created in Eight 4Corporations or politicians hurting America? 5Congress to Reduce Free Speech? -- In Response to shooting 6The system suited everybody until the crisis hit  Ron Paul 7LIFE'S GOOD, SHUT UP ! 8A Real Hero....
