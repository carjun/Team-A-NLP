I haven't because I don't see much chance of anything happening on that front with a Republican Congress. An NYT story today reaches much the same conclusion:Gun control advocates said that they hoped the circumstances of this attack  including the facts that the suspect obtained his weapon legally and that one of the victims was a member of Congress  would help their cause. Josh Horowitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said, "People have really had it, and this whole magazine clip issue, and the mental health issue, is something that people can get their heads around." But lawmakers seeking even modest limits on gun rights seem almost resigned to failure. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said in a telephone interview that since he proposed a bill this week that would outlaw having a firearm within 1,000 feet of a member of Congress, his office had received "100 calls an hour from people who think I am trying to take away their Second Amendment rights." "This kind of legislation is very difficult," Mr. King said, noting there had been "no enthusiasm," even among Democrats, for the renewal of the assault weapon ban of 1994 in 2004. "The fact is Congress has not done any gun legislation in years," he said, adding, "Once you get out of the Northeast, guns are a part of daily life." I'm not entirely sure about King's memory of the renewal of the assault weapons ban. Surely some Democrats wanted to extend it (it banned exactly the kind of extended magazine allegedly used by Jared Loughner). There was really one person more than any other who wanted it to expire. From Mother Jones:If the Federal Assault Weapons Ban had been renewed in 2004, there's a good chance that its restriction on high-capacity gun magazines would have prevented the Tuscon shooter from killing so many people. So who's to blame for allowing this common sense law to lapse?Certainly not the American public. During the 2004 debate on renewing the ban, the Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania released a poll showing that 68 percent of the publicincluding 57 percent of all gun owners and even 32 percent of all NRA memberswanted the ban extended.Enacted in 1994 with the support of Ronald Reagan, the Assault Weapons Ban was politicized during the contentious 2004 presidential race. "I don't understand the philosophy that says you're making America safer when you take cops off the streets and put assault weapons back on them," John Kerry said at a rally in Missouri. Though Bush was chastised by Kerry for siding with "powerful friends in the gun lobby," he had claimed he'd sign the assault weapons ban extension if it crossed his desk.Yet the bill never made it that far.  House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) dismissed the ban as "a feel good piece of legislation" and flatly told the New York Times that it would expire even if Bush made an effort to renew it. "If the president asked me, it would still be no," he said. "He knows, because we don't have the votes to pass the assault weapons ban. It will expire Monday, and that's that."Tom's had a rough week on other fronts; I wonder how he's feeling about his role in changing the law that enabled Loughner to buy a 32-bullet clip.King's proposal seems silly to me, and frankly political. New York state is losing congressional districts, and some people think his district is going to be combined with that of Carolyn McCarthy, the Democrat whose husband was killed by a mass-murdering gunman on a commuter railroad back in the 90s. So, aware that he might have to run in a somewhat more Democratic district, he's flogging a plan. But it doesn't sound like a proposal aimed at preventing anything, merely at being able to bring another count against someone who's already done something.The gun lobby is far more powerful today than public opinion, which typically supports tighter controls on automatic and semiautomatic weapons. But this is one more example of conservative absolutism. On taxes, on certain social issues and on guns, no compromise is permitted. The small silver lining is that you choose to live in a part of the country where more sensible laws prevail, but the Supreme Court is taking its axe even to that.Posted byMichael TomaskyFriday 14 January 201115.22 GMTguardian.co.ukPrintable versionSend to a friendShareClipContact uslarger | smaller EmailCloseRecipient's email addressYour first nameYour surnameAdd a note (optional)Your IP address will be loggedShareCloseShort link for this page:  http://gu.com/p/2mdfkDiggredditGoogle BookmarksTwitterdel.icio.usStumbleUponNewsvinelivejournalFacebookMixx it!Contact usClose                           Report errors or inaccuracies: userhelp@guardian.co.ukLetters for publication should be sent to: letters@guardian.co.ukIf you need help using the site: userhelp@guardian.co.ukCall the main Guardian and Observer switchboard: +44 (0)20 3353 2000Advertising guideLicense/buy our contentWorld newsArizona shooting More from Michael Tomasky's blog onWorld newsArizona shooting More blogpostsRelated9 Jan 2011US congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords shot as six die in Arizona massacre10 Jan 2011Gun control: time for a rethink?10 Jan 2011After the violence in Arizona, a truce10 Jan 2011Arizona shooting sees Americans bow their heads in mourningPreviousBlog homePrintable versionSend to a friendShareClipContact usArticle historyEmailCloseRecipient's email addressYour first nameYour surnameAdd a note (optional)Your IP address will be loggedShareCloseShort link for this page:  http://gu.com/p/2mdfkDiggredditGoogle BookmarksTwitterdel.icio.usStumbleUponNewsvinelivejournalFacebookMixx it!Contact usClose                           Report errors or inaccuracies: userhelp@guardian.co.ukLetters for publication should be sent to: letters@guardian.co.ukIf you need help using the site: userhelp@guardian.co.ukCall the main Guardian and Observer switchboard: +44 (0)20 3353 2000Advertising guideLicense/buy our contentAbout this articleCloseGun control after Tucson | Michael Tomasky       This article was published onguardian.co.ukat 15.22 GMT on Friday 14 January 2011.

This is probably a conservative estimate, for two reasons. First, cases of respondents intentionally withholding reports of genuine defensive-gun uses were probably more common than cases of respondents reporting incidents that did not occur or that were not genuinely defensive. Second, the survey covered only adults age 18 and older, thereby excluding all defensive gun uses involving adolescents, the age group most likely to suffer a violent victimization. The authors concluded that defensive uses of guns are about three to four times as common as criminal uses of guns. The National Self-Defense Survey confirmed the picture of frequent defensive gun use implied by the results of earlier, less sophisticated surveys.

"Having lots of ammunition is critical, especially if the police are not around and you need to be able to defend yourself against mobs," he said.Peter King's brave stand is a microcosmically accurate recapitulation of his entire service to the country.  He disdains McCarthys bill, a law that might have prevented, oh, maybe half the murders in Tucson, but prudently proposes that no sovereign citizen-patriot be permitted to arm himself within pistol range of his own representative self.

Jesse Ventura.The Conspiracy Theory segment focused on Venturas belief that the federal government has created concentration camps for dissidents. Ventura suggested Cohen, as a sponsor of legislation to create emergency operations centers for use after natural disasters, endorsed a police state conspiracy.Cohen told the man at Schnucks that the allegations were false, but the man appeared to give them credence, he said.It was scary, Cohen said of the encounter.

That must change if we are to prevent such horrific events in the future.  I wonder if the ACLU would permit such a change in how we handle the mentall ill?Recommend?(2)Report abuse|Linkkattw14 January 2011 4:34PMThe problem, CO, is that most suggested gun control laws violate the second amendment to exactly the same extent as a ban on extended pistol clips.  They get rid of a certain class of weapon, do not deny people the right to own or shoot other weapons, have negligible effects upon hunters, and get shot down by conservatives as violations of the second amendment because conservatives, by and large, see the words 'any and all' in the second amendment, when they clearly are not there.As for congress persons being somehow special, is it really any different than how in most places, there are steeper penalties for killing a cop than for killing anybody else?  The cops are given an elevated place, even though I'm pretty sure I'd be vastly more unhappy if a family member were shot than some cop I didn't know.  It's not fair, but they made it happen.  And it seems particularly dangerous, since the cops get to decide how to treat the people they decide killed someone.  I suspect congress persons could get themselves that elevated rank, too.To lefty, if it's true that every person was automatically a member of the militia, and if there's still law to that effect in place, then congress very much has the power to decide what armaments every single person in the US will bear, as per the armament clause.  In that interpretation, the second amendment merely bans congress from deciding that the answer is 'nothing'.  As long as congress equips you with, at a minimum, a rock or stick, they have acted in accordance with the constitution.  Of course, conservatives, by and large, hate looking at the powers specifically granted to congress, when it's so much more fun complaining about the rather harder to define 2nd amendment restrictions in the Bill of Rights.  We already know, of course, that most OTHER amendments, they have no problem violating, of course, even if there ISN'T a directly granted power in Article 1 Section 8 in exact contradiction to said ignored amendment.And, of course, since Congress has the power to organize and discipline the militia too, if we're all, by definition, militia members, that pretty much gives congress the power to treat us however it darn well pleases.  Maybe we should rethink how very badly we want this second amendment to apply to everybody?Finally, I saw a good point made a while ago: as liberals, or moderates, or simply as conservatives with a shred of intelligence, let's ignore guns.  Let people have as many as they like.  Let's just ban bullets.  People still have their armaments, they just don't get the killing power to go with them.  And bullets are most certainly not protected by the second amendment.  So in the end, superman's life would be much harder, but the rest of us could rest easier in a reduced-danger state.Recommend?(0)Report abuse|Linkjgriffin14 January 2011 4:34PMWe can ban high capacity clips all we want and all that would do is to lower the body count...The problem is to keep crazy people from getting to have a gun in the first place.Recommend?(0)Report abuse|Linksmartypants5414 January 2011 4:37PMLHBOne of the guys who captured Loughner was armed and had gone out to shoot him. had Loughner been able to reload, that guy would have been the only hope for dozens of other people.I know that's a story some people are peddling. But its not what Joe Zambudio (the man in question) is saying.Zamudio was in a nearby drug store when the shooting began, and he was armed. He ran to the scene and helped subdue the killer. Television interviewers are celebrating his courage, and pro-gun blogs are touting his equipment. "Bystander Says Carrying Gun Prompted Him to Help," says the headline in the Wall Street Journal.But before we embrace Zamudio's brave intervention as proof of the value of being armed, let's hear the whole story. "I came out of that store, I clicked the safety off, and I was ready," he explained on Fox and Friends. "I had my hand on my gun. I had it in my jacket pocket here. And I came around the corner like this." Zamudio demonstrated how his shooting hand was wrapped around the weapon, poised to draw and fire. As he rounded the corner, he saw a man holding a gun. "And that's who I at first thought was the shooter," Zamudio recalled. "I told him to 'Drop it, drop it!' "But the man with the gun wasn't the shooter. He had wrested the gun away from the shooter. "Had you shot that guy, it would have been a big, fat mess," the interviewer pointed out.Thank god he didn't shoot!

Somewhere along the line, Congress created the National Guard in large part because the militia concept no longer worked. The national Guard is organized ste-by-state. here In PA, we have the 28th Division, for example, as our National Guard unit. There are Brigade formations scattered around the state-right on down to Company level. Unless "...called into federal Service..."- the National Guard is under the command of the Governor of the state.This is the , some assert, the modern "...militia...".However, there are folks who argue that the old idea has never been lawfully abandoned- and that the able-bodied male populatiojn is still the Militia-like it or not. they would argue that the National Guard are the equilvalent of the Minutemen- a select group but that everybody else still has to serve if called out by properly constituted authority.proper bostonian- obviously nutjobs should not be allowed to buy weapons.

The ban prohibited the production of new magazines holding more than 10 rounds. That is all.  The tens of millions of these magazines that had already been produced were still for sale and readily available. I myself purchased dozens of 30-round magazines while the ban was still in place.I will also point out that limiting magazine capacity doesn't necessarily alter someone's ability to rapidly reload.  I did some testing myself, and am able to 1) carry twice the ammunition, and 2) reload more quickly, when using a fixed 10-round magazine SKS and 'stripper clips', versus an AK-47 that uses the same ammunition but removable 30-round magazines.Recommend?(0)Report abuse|Linkjgriffin14 January 2011 4:45PMshouldn't thre focus be on preventing irrational people from getting guns in the first place?   The American people are not interested in banning catagories of guns... i think MT is right it is a dead issue.  Better to focus on controllibng access by mentally ill and criminals right?Recommend?(0)Report abuse|Linklefthalfback14 January 2011 4:45PMI saw the guy interviewed on saturady evening. He said that he was carrying and he went out to help. When he got there the other guy had tackled Loughner and he, Zambudio, jumped on him too. However, if Loughner had been able to reload, then the first tackler would have already been dead, and Zambudio, as I said above, would have been the only chance for dozens of other people.Recommend?(1)Report abuse|Linklefthalfback14 January 2011 4:46PMsorry=- the last one was to smartypants.Recommend?(0)Report abuse|LinkCautiousOptimist14 January 2011 4:47PMFrances - Well, as someone who has been speaking publiclly professionally for 25 years, who has trained others in presentation skills, and who has a dusty piles of trophies from old debate and oratory contests, I disagree.Obama is an OK speaker, but not outstanding. He still has problems connecting with an audience, he needs to make his extemperaneous remarks more concise, and he has to work on his volume control. But the Tuscon speech was the best I have seen him give.Most of excellent public speaking is practice. Obama had not the levels of practice that many Presidents have, but he is coming along very quickly.Recommend?(0)Report abuse|LinkShowing first 50 comments |Show all comments |Go to latest commentIn order to post a comment you need to be registered and signed in.CommentsSorry, commenting is not available at this time.
