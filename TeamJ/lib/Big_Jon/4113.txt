Yet during his inauguration, he walked right through a party hosted by the Orange County Employees Association without stopping to give a speech at the podium they had erected for him, leading many supporters to boo him. Then, during his inaugural address, he told unions they should not expect any favors.While this was seen as offensive by many union activists, it should not have come as a surprise.  Jerry Brown has a sordid record of union busting and supporting brutal police attacks on ILWU members.  The real question is why unions supported him at all instead of using their resources to organize for the kind of massive strikes and protests necessary to make him and the feds back off.To Read the rest of this article, please visit http://modeducation.blogspot.com/2011/01/brown-to-union...

Per capita GDP about $42K.The exports of goods made in California totaled $134 billion in 2007. $48 billion of that total was computers and electronics, followed by transportation, non-electrical machinery, agriculture, and chemicals. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_California .** California Proposition 24, Repeal of Corporate Tax Breaks ballot proposition was on the November 2, 2010 ballot in California as an initiated state statute, where it was defeated. The goal of Proposition 24 was to stop several corporate tax breaks that were slated to go into effect in 2010 and 2012. The breaks were approved by the California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Proposition 24 would have prevented eligible corporations from receiving about $1.3 billion in tax breaks per year. The tax breaks unsuccessfully targeted by Proposition 24 were agreed to by California lawmakers as part of budget agreements in late 2008 and in what capitol reporter Steve Harmon refers to as "secret negotiations in February". The Silicon Valley Leadership Group, according to the New York Times, "lobbied hard" to get the corporate tax break enacted. http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Propos... (2010)On July 29, the opponents of Proposition 24, the November ballot measure that would repeal a trio of tax breaks for businesses enacted as part of the February 2009 budget, received a $1 million contribution from biotech giant Genentech.While other companies benefiting from the changes in state tax law Proposition 24 would repeal have each contributed $100,000 to the no side  Amgen, Cisco Systems, Abbot Laboratories, Hewlett-Packard, General Electric, Viacom and Time Warner  Genentech has kicked in 10 times that amount.http://californiascapitol.com/blog/?p=3580 The CBP report uses Franchise Tax Board estimates to show how just one of the tax reductions, the elective single sales factor apportionment (SSF), would benefit a very small number of very large corporations. Their analysis also demonstrates that the other two tax breaks benefit small numbers of companies as well. According to the report:Only 1.2 percent of the states corporations would benefit from elective SSF at a cost of $850 million in 2015-16.Nine corporations  0.001% of all California corporations  would receive tax cuts of more than $20 million SSF apportionment would overwhelmingly benefit Californias largest corporations; 80 percent of the benefits would go to companies with gross receipts in excess of $1 billion. These beneficiaries account for just 0.1 percent of all California corporations. Ninety-five percent of the benefits would go to 0.3 percent of the states corporations. Twenty-eight utility corporations would receive tax cuts averaging $1.5 million per firm. This is significant since these firms are tied to California by virtue of the service they produce and the customers they serve. http://californiascapitol.com/blog/?p=3580 Half of the shortfall next fiscal year is the result of temporary fixes put in place in the past two years, including $8 billion in tax increases set to expire.http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-11-10/california-... I repeat, there's plenty of money in California.  The legislature recently voted in more corporate tax breaks, & the voters approved that policy.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnotesdev      (1000+ posts)      Tue Jan-04-11 11:26 PMResponse to Reply #89.add all that  upthen drop it in the $7 bil hole that CALPERS alone is costing the state. Poof it's gone.Seriously, CA's budget problems are on the order of magnitude of $25B. Let's say for argument's sake, everything you mention comes to pass. Fine now it's a $24B hole.You wonder why businesses continue to do business with the state after receiving IOUs? It's because many of these businesses are utterly dependent on the state as a customer in order to be in business in the first place - they have no choice. Take a look at Illinois, which amazingly managed to get one step ahead of California in this, you have state legislators being evicted and businesses going out of business left and right because the state can't pay.There's a lot of money in Illinois still, too - because of its size it is still among the top 10 overall states in total wealth. That doesn't mean a thing, because that money can't be leveraged into paying off the state's bills when it's private wealth owned by individuals. How would you get at that money? Steal homes, cars, pension funds?Keep in mind that CA is still receiving stimulus funds - and quite a bit. And those stimulus funds will run out soon, leaving a hole that is alone bigger than the dirt you brought to fill it.It has only been three weeks since the state Comptroller warned that there is a big time cash crunch that will hit them by this summer, and two months since the state legislative analyst gave a similar warning.California, like all other states and the federal government as well, will need to adjust its spending to be in line with the decreased revenues from an economy in depression. There's no getting around it, and ignoring the problem will guarantee a default not only on promises made internally within the state, but also on those who placed their faith in the state's ability to repay the money it has been borrowing.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHannah Bell      (1000+ posts)      Tue Jan-04-11 11:53 PMResponse to Reply #910.Gee, I wonder how businesses whose only client is the state of california stay in businessEdited on Wed Jan-05-11 12:05 AM by Hannah Bellwhen they don't get paid for two years?Please link me to these vendors who haven't been paid for two years.

At least, if CALPERS is investing in the same kind of vehicles the 95 billionaires living in California are:"Worlds billionaires grew 50 percent richer in 2009"The combined net worth of these 1,011 individuals increased to $3.6 trillion, up $1.2 trillion from the year before.

The second largest winery in the world, with annual sales of approximately $2 billion, E&J Gallo acquired over 1,300 acres of some of the most beautiful vineyards in Sonoma and Napa counties, worth an estimated $75 million. Because Gallo split the purchase among 12 families members - no one person obtained more than 50 percent of the Martini property - it wasn't reassessed for tax purposes.Napa County tax assessor John Tuteur told The Bay Citizen that he "realized from the beginning how smart they were.

I find it charming, though distinctly unhelpful in seeking a solution to real world problems.Look, the very first line of the report announces in headline font that the immediate fiscal hole that needs to be dealt with this year is $25 billion. It doesn't matter that $6B comes from last year's problem, because it's a here-and-now problem for California. It doesn't go away just because they failed to make actual payments to parties to whom the state owes money from the previous fiscal year.I'm glad at least that we can agree on a common source of information for a topic, that is progress.But you have to actually read it, honey. And if you do read it, there's no way in the world you are coming out of that experience with a positive outlook for California's ability to spend money on new things, or even maintain the old things. Do you even see the assumptions made by the report? This is the best case scenario for California, and it's awful. It assumes zero COLA, winning all outstanding court cases that have budget impact, and 5-6% revenue growth y/o/y for the next four years.I'm a bit disturbed by the fact that you read only page 1, when you really need to read everything before the department-specific detail in order to get a complete picture on California's fiscal position, and still missed the headline number. It is as if you have been trained to take any measure possible to avoid confronting the truth that California is simply out of money, as if it is an article of belief that there's always more money somewhere to be had, if only the government can find it and exploit it. No, I'm afraid they've already done that to every degree that they could effectively do so. We are at the wall now. There's no more ability to kick this can into the future. All the putting off solving these problems for another day already happened and is over. Now is the "another day" when the bills are due.You wrote:> But I notice you do have the balls to proclaim loudly that austerity is indeed what the rulers have in mind for the peons.If you hadn't noticed (and as I noted above, you seem to have been trained not to), the rulers have been doing the very opposite of austerity. They find any reason to spend as much as possible. Good economy? Great! We can spend more! Bad economy? Oh no! We need to spend more or we won't recover!Your rulers have already spent all of your money. Austerity is coming no matter what because the unsustainable cannot be sustained. Your other option is the Pritchard route, where they just stopped sending out checks completely when they ran out of money. Would you rather a hard stop and an all-out collapse of the government, or would you at any point be willing to consider the responsible fiscal approach that any household has to take in order to survive, spending no more than gets taken in.I really feel this is the key point where I can't agree with your approach. Your approach depends on indefinitely spending more than we take in. It doesn't work that way!

(The teachers pension program is administered by the California State Teachers Retirement System , and the other three programs are administered by CalPERS.) The states required contributions to CalPERS for state and CSU pensions are forecasted to be about $3.6 billion (all funds) in 201011, growing to $3.9 billion in 201516.

I have no skin (directly) in this game. My interest is purely a matter of trying to understand what is going on in the big picture and extrapolating from there what the future looks like, so I can plan appropriately.I may be a minority voice now, but I was also a minority voice back in 2005-2006 when I asked stupid questions like what if house prices go down? This time the question I've been asking is where the money to pay for all the things that are being promised is coming from. It is incredibly easy to make a promise, yet much, much more difficult to make good on them.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHannah Bell      (1000+ posts)      Wed Jan-05-11 01:41 AMResponse to Reply #1418.What part of this don't you understand?Edited on Wed Jan-05-11 02:30 AM by Hannah BellThe teachers pension program is administered by the California State Teachers Retirement System.The other three programs are administered by CalPERS.The states required contributions to CalPERS for state and CSU pensions are forecasted to be about $3.6 billion (all funds) in 201011, growing to $3.9 billion in 201516.The states payasyougo retiree health benefit contributions to CalPERS are forecast to grow from $1.4 billion in 201011 to over $2 billion in 201516.$3.6 + 1.4 = 5 (2010)  PENSIONS3.9 + 2 = 5.9 (2015) MEDICALI make this about 5.5% of the state budget.
