On November 29th, then-Connecticut Attorney General (and now Senator) Richard Blumenthal announced he was investigating the card for its draconian and outrageous fees, prompting the girls to pull out of the deal.Blumenthal's announcement brought on heavy criticism for its draconian and outrageous fees -- costing up to $99.95 to purchase, $7.95 per month to use after one year, $6 customer service calls, and up to $500 in damages for lost cards.

There is a copy of the initial filing (all 66 pages, including exhibits) of the lawsuit.  It gives you all the info you need and was interesting.  They knew the extent of all the fees before or at the time the contract was signed.  It appears that the Ks acted in bad faith on more than one occasion.  Can we hope that this is the beginning of the end for them?  Depending on the outcome of this suit, other companies may begin to distance themselves from "Dash Dolls LLC".            mffl: I don't know about anyone else but I looked athttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/mffl/kardashians-sued--for-75-million-debit-card-debacle-report_n_806181_73239916.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itHUFFPOST BLOGGERMelissa Terzis                                                    10 hours ago (10:34 AM)                        13 Fans                I am in love with this comment!            hp_blogger_Melissa Terzis: I am in love with this comment!http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/hp_blogger_Melissa Terzis/kardashians-sued--for-75-million-debit-card-debacle-report_n_806181_73256734.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itLuvnumber9                                                    7 hours ago (1:27 PM)                        15 Fans                Of course they knew..their lawyers read the contract and explained the terms            Luvnumber9: Of course they knew..their lawyers read the contract and explainedhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Luvnumber9/kardashians-sued--for-75-million-debit-card-debacle-report_n_806181_73276679.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itjusathot                                                    5 hours ago (3:16 PM)                        464 Fans                They do not like to pay--Brandy hired Kim as a stylist (around the time she made the tape with her little bro) and Kim and her family racked up one hundred thousand dollars in credit for their own purchases.
