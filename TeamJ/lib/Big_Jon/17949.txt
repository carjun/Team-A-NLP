They always seem so in tune with each other.  Tonight we watched the episode where Melinda wanted to buy him a gift to celebrate the anniversary of their meeting.  She was so sure he forgot about it.  When she gave him his gift he asked her what the occasion was.  She looked devastated but played it off.  He told her he was playing poker with the guys and asked her if she'd get his jacket from the closet while he tried out the gift.  She walked to the closet and opened it up finding her own gift inside.The play between the two of them throughout the series was an impossible love but it was a nice love.Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadJoe and Alison Dubois in Medium.Lisa0825Jan-05-11 09:42 PM#1Only three more episodes...sigh..TikkiJan-06-11 12:00 PM#20Bummer.Kat45Jan-07-11 01:49 AM#53+1ceileJan-06-11 02:41 PM#26Gomez and MorticiabluesbassmanJan-06-11 01:54 AM#2YES!   true love (and lust)Joe FieldsJan-06-11 08:40 AM#11+1meegbearJan-06-11 11:29 AM#17OK, every idea I had was CRAP!

He's only using her for her "gift," her fairy blood, and for sex. I think Bill is the one Niall was talking about in Dead and Gone, when he said "The vampire is not a bad man, and he loves you." Even though Bill lied to Sookie about why he wanted to meet her and get close to her, he's usually the one that's by her side and saving her from bad stuff and risking his own unlife to do it.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topjobycom      (1000+ posts)Thu Jan-06-11 04:29 PMResponse to Original message37.Then there's Captain Jack Harkness and, well...Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPryderi      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 04:45 PMResponse to Original message39.Hardcastle and McCormick. n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toplunamagica      (407 posts)Thu Jan-06-11 04:59 PMResponse to Original message40.Starsky & HutchPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCBGLuthier      (1000+ posts)Thu Jan-06-11 08:22 PMResponse to Original message43.Patsy and EdinaPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topsmirkymonkey      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 02:07 PMResponse to Reply #4358.+100"sweetie darling"Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topthirtiesgirl      (147 posts)Thu Jan-06-11 08:25 PMResponse to Original message44.Maddie Hayes and David AddisonCybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis smokin' up the city with their screwball sexual tension.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopMiddleFingerMom      (1000+ posts)Thu Jan-06-11 08:33 PMResponse to Reply #4446.+100.....boink boink boink boink boink boink boink boink boink boink boink boink...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upPQoG9z4QU .....Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptravelingtypist      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 12:32 AMResponse to Reply #4452.I'm glad you brought this up.

Also, I'm loving the interactions between Kim Joo Won & Gil Ra Im in Secret Garden (the current one, still airing on SBS... that is if anyone here watches Korean dramas)What's really gripping for me in a tv series is to have opposing types of strong-willed & charismatic characters who get drawn together (the 'ole opposites attract schtick) or sometimes some sort of fateful forbidden bonding between two who should be enemies. (or are really sworn enemies...or maybe half-siblings! who we later find out have cancer! or their parents killed your parents! what about your revenge? oh no, it can never, ever be, oh WOE!  *cue deafening pop lyrics and camera zooms onto character's tear-stained face, for what seems like forever, as they tremble, sob and curse their fate*)(yeah I have seen too many Korean dramas)Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcolinmom71      (610 posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 03:28 AMResponse to Original message70.Catherine and Vincent, "Beauty and the Beast"....I loved that show.
