Owen has made just 39 appearances for the Old Trafford outfit since leaving Newcastle last year, the vast majority as substitute. Yet even those outings have been severely restricted after he suffered a major hamstring injury in last season's Carling Cup final. Although Owen was introduced from the bench against Stoke on Tuesday, the former England star is being squeezed out by the impressive form of Dimitar BerbatovDimitar Berbatov and Javier HernandezHernandez, plus the imposing presence of Wayne RooneyRooney. With his two-year contract due to expire in the summer, it is open to serious question whether a player who has now passed his 31st birthday will get another. Sir Alex FergusonAlex Ferguson insisted on Friday there had been no discussions on the matter. However, ahead of Sunday's FA Cup third round tie against former club Liverpool, Owen remains happy with life. "I knew when I came here that I wouldn't play every game and it would be a bit different to what I was used to," he told United Review. "But I will sacrifice playing every game for the opportunity to play and train with the very top players and work under a top manager. "I haven't been disappointed at all by my time here. I have loved every minute. "Obviously you always want to play and do your bit. And I feel as though I have scored a few goals when I've played. "At Manchester United, though, the hard part isn't scoring goals on the pitch - it's getting onto the pitch in the first place. "It's a new challenge for me and, in many ways, it's one of the appeals of being here."        1 of 42         Michael Owen playing in his style..      junaid1990 is based in Karchi, Sind, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (41.4%) Saudi Arabia (17.2%) Pakistan (13.8%) Singapore (10.3%) 4 other countries (10.3%)           READ MORE: Javier Hernandez, sports-news, United Kingdom, Manchester, Dimitar Berbatov, Shawn Hernandez, Game (rapper), english footballers, Wayne Rooney, Manchester United F.C., Alex Ferguson, Football in the United Kingdom, Michael Owen, Football in England   More News From: Manchester :  United Kingdom     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 1            Reply  Posted By     Ranasafdaralikhan|about 21 hoursagoMichael Owen,s decision is seemed to be good.Rated up!
